introduction
save for his raucous rhapsodical autobiography ecce homo the
antichrist is the last thing that nietzsche ever wrote and so it may
be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their
final form notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to
have constituted the first volume of his longprojected magnum opus
the will to power his full plan for this work as originally drawn
up was as follows
  vol   i  the antichrist an attempt at a criticism of christianity
  vol  ii  the free spirit a criticism of philosophy as a nihilistic
             movement
  vol iii  the immoralist a criticism of morality the most fatal
             form of ignorance
  vol  iv  dionysus the philosophy of eternal recurrence
the first sketches for the will to power were made in 1884 soon after
the publication of the first three parts of thus spake zarathustra
and thereafter for four years nietzsche piled up notes they were
written at all the places he visited on his endless travels in search of
healthat nice at venice at silsmaria in the engadine for long his
favourite resort at cannobio at zrich at genoa at chur at
leipzig several times his work was interrupted by other books first by
beyond good and evil then by the genealogy of morals written in
twenty days then by his wagner pamphlets almost as often he changed
his plan once he decided to expand the will to power to ten volumes
with an attempt at a new interpretation of the world as a general
subtitle again he adopted the subtitle of an interpretation of all
that happens finally he hit upon an attempt at a transvaluation of
all values and went back to four volumes though with a number of
changes in their arrangement in september 1888 he began actual work
upon the first volume and before the end of the month it was completed
the summer had been one of almost hysterical creative activity since
the middle of june he had written two other small books the case of
wagner and the twilight of the idols and before the end of the year
he was destined to write ecce homo some time during december his
health began to fail rapidly and soon after the new year he was
helpless thereafter he wrote no more
the wagner diatribe and the twilight of the idols were published
immediately but the antichrist did not get into type until 1895 i
suspect that the delay was due to the influence of the philosophers
sister elisabeth frsternietzsche an intelligent and ardent but by no
means uniformly judicious propagandist of his ideas during his dark
days of neglect and misunderstanding when even family and friends kept
aloof frau frsternietzsche went with him farther than any other but
there were bounds beyond which she also hesitated to go and those
bounds were marked by crosses one notes in her biography of hima
useful but not always accurate workan evident desire to purge him of
the accusation of mocking at sacred things he had she says great
admiration for the elevating effect of christianity  upon the weak
and ailing and a real liking for sincere pious christians and a
tender love for the founder of christianity all his wrath she
continues was reserved for st paul and his like who perverted the
beatitudes which christ intended for the lowly only into a universal
religion which made war upon aristocratic values here obviously one
is addressed by an interpreter who cannot forget that she is the
daughter of a lutheran pastor and the granddaughter of two others a
touch of conscience gets into her reading of the antichrist she even
hints that the text may have been garbled after the authors collapse
by some more sinister heretic there is not the slightest reason to
believe that any such garbling ever took place nor is there any
evidence that their common heritage of piety rested upon the brother as
heavily as it rested upon the sister on the contrary it must be
manifest that nietzsche in this book intended to attack christianity
headlong and with all arms that for all his rapid writing he put the
utmost care into it and that he wanted it to be printed exactly as it
stands the ideas in it were anything but new to him when he set them
down he had been developing them since the days of his beginning you
will find some of them clearly recognizable in the first book he ever
wrote the birth of tragedy you will find the most important of all
of themthe conception of christianity as ressentimentset forth at
length in the first part of the genealogy of morals published under
his own supervision in 1887 and the rest are scattered through the
whole vast mass of his notes sometimes as mere questionings but often
worked out very carefully moreover let it not be forgotten that it was
wagners yielding to christian sentimentality in parsifal that
transformed nietzsche from the first among his literary advocates into
the most bitter of his opponents he could forgive every other sort of
mountebankery but not that in me he once said the christianity of
my forbears reaches its logical conclusion in me the stern intellectual
conscience that christianity fosters and makes paramount turns against
christianity in me christianity  devours itself
in truth the present philippic is as necessary to the completeness of
the whole of nietzsches system as the keystone is to the arch all the
curves of his speculation lead up to it what he flung himself against
from beginning to end of his days of writing was always in the last
analysis christianity in some form or otherchristianity as a system
of practical ethics christianity as a political code christianity as
metaphysics christianity as a gauge of the truth it would be
difficult to think of any intellectual enterprise on his long list that
did not more or less directly and clearly relate itself to this master
enterprise of them all it was as if his apostasy from the
faith of his fathers filling him with the fiery zeal of the convert
and particularly of the convert to heresy had blinded him to every
other element in the gigantic selfdelusion of civilized man the will
to power was his answer to christianitys affectation of humility and
selfsacrifice eternal recurrence was his mocking criticism of
christian optimism and millennialism the superman was his candidate for
the place of the christian ideal of the good man prudently abased
before the throne of god the things he chiefly argued for were
antichristian thingsthe abandonment of the purely moral view of life
the rehabilitation of instinct the dethronement of weakness and
timidity as ideals the renunciation of the whole hocuspocus of
dogmatic religion the extermination of false aristocracies of the
priest of the politician of the plutocrat the revival of the
healthy lordly innocence that was greek if he was anything in a
word nietzsche was a greek born two thousand years too late his
dreams were thoroughly hellenic his whole manner of thinking was
hellenic his peculiar errors were hellenic no less but his hellenism
i need not add was anything but the pale neoplatonism that has run
like a thread through the thinking of the western world since the days
of the christian fathers from plato to be sure he got what all of us
must get but his real forefather was heraclitus it is in heraclitus
that one finds the germ of his primary view of the universea view to
wit that sees it not as moral phenomenon but as mere aesthetic
representation the god that nietzsche imagined in the end was not far
from the god that such an artist as joseph conrad imaginesa supreme
craftsman ever experimenting ever coming closer to an ideal balancing
of lines and forces and yet always failing to work out the final
harmony
the late war awakening all the primitive racial fury of the western
nations and therewith all their ancient enthusiasm for religious taboos
and sanctions naturally focused attention upon nietzsche as upon the
most daring and provocative of recent amateur theologians the germans
with their characteristic tendency to explain their every act in terms
as realistic and unpleasant as possible appear to have mauled him in a
belated and unexpected embrace to the horror i daresay of the kaiser
and perhaps to the even greater horror of nietzsches own ghost the
folks of anglosaxondom with their equally characteristic tendency to
explain all their enterprises romantically simultaneously set him up as
the antichrist he no doubt secretly longed to be the result was a great
deal of misrepresentation and misunderstanding of him from the pulpits
of the allied countries and particularly from those of england and the
united states a horde of patriotic ecclesiastics denounced him in
extravagant terms as the author of all the horrors of the time and in
the newspapers until the kaiser was elected sole bugaboo he shared the
honors of that office with von hindenburg the crown prince capt
boyed von bernstorff and von tirpitz most of this denunciation of
course was frankly idioticthe nave pishposh of suburban methodists
notorietyseeking college professors almost illiterate editorial
writers and other such numskulls in much of it including not a few
official hymns of hate nietzsche was gravely discovered to be the
teacher of such spokesmen of the extremest sort of german nationalism
as von bernhardi and von treitschkewhich was just as intelligent as
making george bernard shaw the mentor of lloydgeorge in other solemn
pronunciamentoes he was credited with being philosophically responsible
for various imaginary crimes of the enemythe wholesale slaughter or
mutilation of prisoners of war the deliberate burning down of red cross
hospitals the utilization of the corpses of the slain for soapmaking
i amused myself in those gaudy days by collecting newspaper clippings
to this general effect and later on i shall probably publish a digest
of them as a contribution to the study of war hysteria the thing went
to unbelievable lengths on the strength of the fact that i had
published a book on nietzsche in 1906 six years after his death i was
called upon by agents of the department of justice elaborately
outfitted with badges to meet the charge that i was an intimate
associate and agent of the german monster nietzsky i quote the
official procs verbal an indignant but often misspelled document
alas poor nietzsche after all his laborious efforts to prove that he
was not a german but a poleeven after his heroic readiness via
antiantisemitism to meet the deduction that if a pole then probably
also a jew
but under all this alarmed and preposterous tosh there was at least a
sound instinct and that was the instinct which recognized nietzsche as
the most eloquent pertinacious and effective of all the critics of the
philosophy to which the allies against germany stood committed and on
the strength of which at all events in theory the united states had
engaged itself in the war he was not in point of fact involved with
the visible enemy save in remote and transient ways the german
officially remained the most ardent of christians during the war and
became a democrat at its close but he was plainly a foe of democracy in
all its forms political religious and epistemological and what is
worse his opposition was set forth in terms that were not only
extraordinarily penetrating and devastating but also uncommonly
offensive it was thus quite natural that he should have aroused a
degree of indignation verging upon the pathological in the two countries
that had planted themselves upon the democratic platform most boldly
and that felt it most shaky one may add under their feet i daresay
that nietzsche had he been alive would have got a lot of satisfaction
out of the execration thus heaped upon him not only because being a
vain fellow he enjoyed execration as a tribute to his general
singularity and hence to his superiority but also and more importantly
because being no mean psychologist he would have recognized the
disconcerting doubts underlying it if nietzsches criticism of
democracy were as ignorant and empty say as the average evangelical
clergymans criticism of darwins hypothesis of natural selection then
the advocates of democracy could afford to dismiss it as loftily as the
darwinians dismiss the blather of the holy clerks and if his attack
upon christianity were mere sound and fury signifying nothing then
there would be no call for anathemas from the sacred desk but these
onslaughts in point of fact have behind them a tremendous learning and
a great deal of point and plausibilitythere are in brief bullets in
the gun teeth in the tigerand so it is no wonder that they excite
the ire of men who hold as a primary article of belief that their
acceptance would destroy civilization darken the sun and bring jahveh
to sobs upon his throne
but in all this justifiable fear of course there remains a false
assumption and that is the assumption that nietzsche proposed to
destroy christianity altogether and so rob the plain people of the
world of their virtue their spiritual consolations and their hope of
heaven nothing could be more untrue the fact is that nietzsche had no
interest whatever in the delusions of the plain peoplethat is
intrinsically it seemed to him of small moment what they believed so
long as it was safely imbecile what he stood against was not their
beliefs but the elevation of those beliefs by any sort of democratic
process to the dignity of a state philosophywhat he feared most was
the pollution and crippling of the superior minority by intellectual
disease from below his plain aim in the antichrist was to combat that
menace by completing the work begun on the one hand by darwin and the
other evolutionist philosophers and on the other hand by german
historians and philologians the net effect of this earlier attack in
the eighties had been the collapse of christian theology as a serious
concern of educated men the mob it must be obvious was very little
shaken even to this day it has not put off its belief in the essential
christian doctrines but the intelligentsia by 1885 had been pretty
well convinced no man of sound information at the time nietzsche
planned the antichrist actually believed that the world was created
in seven days or that its fauna was once overwhelmed by a flood as a
penalty for the sins of man or that noah saved the boa constrictor the
prairie dog and the pediculus capitis by taking a pair of each into
the ark or that lots wife was turned into a pillar of salt or that a
fragment of the true cross could cure hydrophobia such notions still
almost universally prevalent in christendom a century before were now
confined to the great body of ignorant and credulous menthat is to
ninetyfive or ninetysix percent of the race for a man of the
superior minority to subscribe to one of them publicly was already
sufficient to set him off as one in imminent need of psychiatrical
attention belief in them had become a mark of inferiority like the
allied belief in madstones magic and apparitions
but though the theology of christianity had thus sunk to the lowly
estate of a mere delusion of the rabble propagated on that level by the
ancient caste of sacerdotal parasites the ethics of christianity
continued to enjoy the utmost acceptance and perhaps even more
acceptance than ever before it seemed to be generally felt in fact
that they simply must be saved from the wreckthat the world would
vanish into chaos if they went the way of the revelations supporting
them in this fear a great many judicious men joined and so there arose
what was in essence an absolutely new christian culta cult to wit
purged of all the supernaturalism superimposed upon the older cult by
generations of theologians and harking back to what was conceived to be
the pure ethical doctrine of jesus this cult still flourishes
protestantism tends to become identical with it it invades catholicism
as modernism it is supported by great numbers of men whose intelligence
is manifest and whose sincerity is not open to question even nietzsche
himself yielded to it in weak moments as you will discover on examining
his somewhat laborious effort to make paul the villain of christian
theology and jesus no more than an innocent bystander but this
sentimental yielding never went far enough to distract his attention for
long from his main idea which was this that christian ethics were
quite as dubious at bottom as christian theologythat they were
founded just as surely as such childish fables as the story of jonah
and the whale upon the peculiar prejudices and credulities the special
desires and appetites of inferior menthat they warred upon the best
interests of men of a better sort quite as unmistakably as the most
extravagant of objective superstitions in brief what he saw in
christian ethics under all the poetry and all the fine show of altruism
and all the theoretical benefits therein was a democratic effort to
curb the egoism of the stronga conspiracy of the chandala against
the free functioning of their superiors nay against the free progress
of mankind this theory is the thing he exposes in the antichrist
bringing to the business his amazingly chromatic and exigent eloquence
at its finest flower this is the conspiracy he sets forth in all the
panoply of his characteristic italics dashes sforzando interjections
and exclamation points
well an idea is an idea the present one may be right and it may be
wrong one thing is quite certain that no progress will be made against
it by denouncing it as merely immoral if it is ever laid at all it
must be laid evidentially logically the notion to the contrary is
thoroughly democratic the mob is the most ruthless of tyrants it is
always in a democratic society that heresy and felony tend to be most
constantly confused one hears without surprise of a bismarck
philosophizing placidly at least in his old age upon the delusion of
socialism and of a frederick the great playing the hose of his cynicism
upon the absolutism that was almost identical with his own person but
men in the mass never brook the destructive discussion of their
fundamental beliefs and that impatience is naturally most evident in
those societies in which men in the mass are most influential democracy
and free speech are not facets of one gem democracy and free speech are
eternal enemies but in any battle between an institution and an idea
the idea in the long run has the better of it here i do not venture
into the absurdity of arguing that as the world wags on the truth
always survives i believe nothing of the sort as a matter of fact it
seems to me that an idea that happens to be trueor more exactly as
near to truth as any human idea can be and yet remain generally
intelligibleit seems to me that such an idea carries a special and
often fatal handicap the majority of men prefer delusion to truth it
soothes it is easy to grasp above all it fits more snugly than the
truth into a universe of false appearancesof complex and irrational
phenomena defectively grasped but though an idea that is true is thus
not likely to prevail an idea that is attacked enjoys a great
advantage the evidence behind it is now supported by sympathy the
sporting instinct sentimentalityand sentimentality is as powerful as
an army with banners one never hears of a martyr in history whose
notions are seriously disputed today the forgotten ideas are those of
the men who put them forward soberly and quietly hoping fatuously that
they would conquer by the force of their truth these are the ideas that
we now struggle to rediscover had nietzsche lived to be burned at the
stake by outraged mississippi methodists it would have been a glorious
day for his doctrines as it is they are helped on their way every time
they are denounced as immoral and against god the war brought down upon
them the maledictions of vast herds of rightthinking men and now the
antichrist after fifteen years of neglect is being reprinted
one imagines the author a sardonic wraith snickering somewhat sadly
over the fact his shade wherever it suffers is favoured in these days
by many such consolations some of them of much greater horsepower
think of the facts and arguments even the underlying theories and
attitudes that have been borrowed from him consciously and
unconsciously by the foes of bolshevism during these last thrilling
years the face of democracy suddenly seen hideously close has scared
the guardians of the reigning plutocracy half to death and they have
gone to the devil himself for aid southern senators almost illiterate
men have mixed his acids with well water and spouted them like
affrighted geysers not knowing what they did nor are they the first to
borrow from him years ago i called attention to the debt incurred with
characteristic forgetfulness of obligation by the late theodore
roosevelt in the strenuous life and elsewhere roosevelt a typical
apologist for the existing order adeptly dragging a herring across the
trail whenever it was menaced yet managed to delude the native boobery
at least until toward the end into accepting him as a fiery exponent of
pure democracy perhaps he even fooled himself charlatans usually do
so soon or late a study of nietzsche reveals the sources of much that
was honest in him and exposes the hollowness of much that was sham
nietzsche an infinitely harder and more courageous intellect was
incapable of any such confusion of ideas he seldom allowed
sentimentality to turn him from the glaring fact what is called
bolshevism today he saw clearly a generation ago and described for what
it was and isdemocracy in another aspect the old ressentiment of the
lower orders in free function once more socialism puritanism
philistinism christianityhe saw them all as allotropic forms of
democracy as variations upon the endless struggle of quantity against
quality of the weak and timorous against the strong and enterprising
of the botched against the fit the world needed a staggering
exaggeration to make it see even half of the truth it trembles today as
it trembled during the french revolution perhaps it would tremble less
if it could combat the monster with a clearer conscience and less burden
of compromising theoryif it could launch its forces frankly at the
fundamental doctrine and not merely employ them to police the
transient orgy
nietzsche in the long run may help it toward that greater honesty his
notions propagated by cuttings from cuttings from cuttings may
conceivably prepare the way for a sounder more healthful theory of
society and of the state and so free human progress from the
stupidities which now hamper it and men of true vision from the
despairs which now sicken them i say it is conceivable but i doubt
that it is probable the soul and the belly of mankind are too evenly
balanced it is not likely that the belly will ever put away its hunger
or forget its power here perhaps there is an example of the eternal
recurrence that nietzsche was fond of mulling over in his blacker moods
we are in the midst of one of the perennial risings of the lower orders
it got under way long before any of the current bolshevist demons was
born it was given its long secure start by the intolerable tyranny of
the plutocracythe end product of the eighteenth century revolt against
the old aristocracy it found resistance suddenly slackened by civil war
within the plutocracy itselfone gang of traders falling upon another
gang to the tune of vast hymnsinging and yells to god perhaps it has
already passed its apogee the plutocracy chastened shows signs of a
new solidarity the wheel continues to swing round but this combat
between proletariat and plutocracy is after all itself a civil war
two inferiorities struggle for the privilege of polluting the world
what actual difference does it make to a civilized man when there is a
steel strike whether the workmen win or the millowners win the
conflict can interest him only as spectacle as the conflict between
bonaparte and the old order in europe interested goethe and beethoven
the victory whichever way it goes will simply bring chaos nearer and
so set the stage for a genuine revolution later on with let us hope a
new feudalism or something better coming out of it and a new thirteenth
century at dawn this seems to be the slow costly way of the worst of
habitable worlds
in the present case my money is laid upon the plutocracy it will win
because it will be able in the long run to enlist the finer
intelligences the mob and its maudlin causes attract only
sentimentalists and scoundrels chiefly the latter politics under a
democracy reduces itself to a mere struggle for office by flatterers
of the proletariat even when a superior man prevails at that disgusting
game he must prevail at the cost of his selfrespect not many superior
men make the attempt the average great captain of the rabble when he
is not simply a weeper over irremediable wrongs is a hypocrite so far
gone that he is unconscious of his own hypocrisya slimy fellow
offensive to the nose the plutocracy can recruit measurably more
respectable janissaries if only because it can make selfinterest less
obviously costly to amour propre its defect and its weakness lie in
the fact that it is still too young to have acquired dignity but lately
sprung from the mob it now preys upon it yet shows some of the habits
of mind of that mob it is blatant stupid ignorant lacking in all
delicate instinct and governmental finesse above all it remains
somewhat heavily moral one seldom finds it undertaking one of its
characteristic imbecilities without offering a sonorous moral reason it
spends almost as much to support the y m c a vicecrusading
prohibition and other such puerilities as it spends upon congressmen
strikebreakers gunmen kept patriots and newspapers in england the
case is even worse it is almost impossible to find a wealthy industrial
over there who is not also an eminent nonconformist layman and even
among financiers there are praying brothers on the continent the day
is saved by the fact that the plutocracy tends to become more and more
jewish here the intellectual cynicism of the jew almost counterbalances
his social unpleasantness if he is destined to lead the plutocracy of
the world out of little bethel he will fail of course to turn it into
an aristocracyi e a caste of gentlemen but he will at least
make it clever and hence worthy of consideration the case against the
jews is long and damning it would justify ten thousand times as many
pogroms as now go on in the world but whenever you find a
davidsbndlerschaft making practise against the philistines there you
will find a jew laying on maybe it was this fact that caused nietzsche
to speak up for the children of israel quite as often as he spoke
against them he was not blind to their faults but when he set them
beside christians he could not deny their general superiority perhaps
in america and england as on the continent the increasing jewishness
of the plutocracy while cutting it off from all chance of ever
developing into an aristocracy will yet lift it to such a dignity that
it will at least deserve a certain grudging respect
but even so it will remain in a sort of halfworld midway between the
gutter and the stars above it will still stand the small group of men
that constitutes the permanent aristocracy of the racethe men of
imagination and high purpose the makers of genuine progress the brave
and ardent spirits above all petty fears and discontents and above all
petty hopes and ideals no less there were heroes before agamemnon
there will be bachs after johann sebastian and beneath the judaized
plutocracy the sublimated bourgeoisie there the immemorial
proletariat i venture to guess will roar on endlessly tortured by its
vain hatreds and envies stampeded and made to tremble by its ancient
superstitions prodded and made miserable by its sordid and degrading
hopes it seems to me very likely that in this proletariat
christianity will continue to survive it is nonsense true enough but
it is sweet nietzsche denouncing its dangers as a poison almost falls
into the error of denying it its undoubtedly sugary smack of all the
religions ever devised by the great practical jokers of the race this
is the one that offers most for the least money so to speak to the
inferior man it starts out by denying his inferiority in plain terms
all men are equal in the sight of god it ends by erecting that
inferiority into a sort of actual superiority it is a merit to be
stupid and miserable and sorely put uponof such are the celestial
elect not all the eloquence of a million nietzsches nor all the
painful marshalling of evidence of a million darwins and harnacks will
ever empty that great consolation of its allure the most they can ever
accomplish is to make the superior orders of men acutely conscious of
the exact nature of it and so give them armament against the contagion
this is going on this is being done i think that the antichrist has
a useful place in that enterprise it is strident it is often
extravagant it is to many sensitive men in the worst of possible
taste but at bottom it is enormously apt and effectiveand on the
surface it is undoubtedly a good show one somehow enjoys with the
malice that is native to man the spectacle of anathemas batted back it
is refreshing to see the pitchfork employed against gentlemen who have
doomed such innumerable caravans to hell in nietzsche they found after
many long years a foeman worthy of themnot a mere fancy swordsman
like voltaire or a mob orator like tom paine or a pedant like the
heretics of exegesis but a gladiator armed with steel and armoured with
steel and showing all the ferocious gusto of a mediaeval bishop it is
a pity that holy church has no process for the elevation of demons like
its process for the canonization of saints there must be a long roll of
black miracles to the discredit of the accursed friedrichsinners
purged of conscience and made happy in their sinning clerics shaken in
their theology by visions of a new and better holy city the strong made
to exult the weak robbed of their old sad romance it would be a
pleasure to see the advocatus diaboli turn from the table of the
prosecution to the table of the defence and move in solemn form for the
damnation of the naumburg hobgoblin
of all nietzsches books the antichrist comes nearest to
conventionality in form it presents a connected argument with very few
interludes and has a beginning a middle and an end most of his works
are in the form of collections of apothegms and sometimes the subject
changes on every second page this fact constitutes one of the counts in
the orthodox indictment of him it is cited as proof that his capacity
for consecutive thought was limited and that he was thus deficient
mentally and perhaps a downright moron the argument it must be
obvious is fundamentally nonsensical what deceives the professors is
the traditional prolixity of philosophers because the average
philosophical writer when he essays to expose his ideas makes such
inordinate drafts upon the parts of speech that the dictionary is almost
emptied these defective observers jump to the conclusion that his
intrinsic notions are of corresponding weight this is not unseldom
quite untrue what makes philosophy so garrulous is not the profundity
of philosophers but their lack of art they are like physicians who
sought to cure a slight hyperacidity by giving the patient a carload of
burned oystershells to eat there is too the endless pollparrotting
that goes on each new philosopher must prove his learning by
laboriously rehearsing the ideas of all previous philosophers
nietzsche avoided both faults he always assumed that his readers knew
the books and that it was thus unnecessary to rewrite them and having
an idea that seemed to him to be novel and original he stated it in as
few words as possible and then shut down sometimes he got it into a
hundred words sometimes it took a thousand now and then as in the
present case he developed a series of related ideas into a connected
book but he never wrote a word too many he never pumped up an idea to
make it appear bigger than it actually was the pedagogues alas are
not accustomed to that sort of writing in serious fields they resent
it and sometimes they even try to improve it there exists in fact a
huge and solemn tome on nietzsche by a learned man of america in which
all of his brilliancy is painfully translated into the windy phrases of
the seminaries the tome is satisfactorily ponderous but the meat of
the cocoanut is left out there is actually no discussion of the
nietzschean view of christianity always nietzsche daunts the
pedants he employed too few words for themand he had too many ideas
                                   
the present translation of the antichrist is published by agreement
with dr oscar levy editor of the english edition of nietzsche there
are two earlier translations one by thomas common and the other by
anthony m ludovici that of mr common follows the text very closely
and thus occasionally shows some essentially german turns of phrase
that of mr ludovici is more fluent but rather less exact i do not
offer my own version on the plea that either of these is useless on the
contrary i cheerfully acknowledge that they have much merit and that
they helped me at almost every line i began this new englishing of the
book not in any hope of supplanting them and surely not with any
notion of meeting a great public need but simply as a private amusement
in troubled days but as i got on with it i began to see ways of putting
some flavour of nietzsches peculiar style into the english and so
amusement turned into a more or less serious labour the result of
course is far from satisfactory but it at least represents a very
diligent attempt nietzsche always under the influence of french
models wrote a german that differs materially from any other german
that i know it is more nervous more varied more rapid in tempo it
runs to more effective climaxes it is never stodgy his marks begin to
show upon the writing of the younger germans of today they are getting
away from the old thunderous manner with its long sentences and its
tedious grammatical complexities in the course of time i daresay they
will develop a german almost as clear as french and almost as colourful
and resilient as english
i owe thanks to dr levy for his imprimatur to mr theodor hemberger
for criticism and to messrs common and ludovici for showing me the way
around many a difficulty

preface
this book belongs to the most rare of men perhaps not one of them is
yet alive it is possible that they may be among those who understand my
zarathustra how could i confound myself with those who are now
sprouting earsfirst the day after tomorrow must come for me some men
are born posthumously
the conditions under which any one understands me and necessarily
understands mei know them only too well even to endure my
seriousness my passion he must carry intellectual integrity to the
verge of hardness he must be accustomed to living on mountain topsand
to looking upon the wretched gabble of politics and nationalism as
beneath him he must have become indifferent he must never ask of the
truth whether it brings profit to him or a fatality to him he must
have an inclination born of strength for questions that no one has the
courage for the courage for the forbidden predestination for the
labyrinth the experience of seven solitudes new ears for new music
new eyes for what is most distant a new conscience for truths that have
hitherto remained unheard and the will to economize in the grand
mannerto hold together his strength his enthusiasm reverence for
self love of self absolute freedom of self
very well then of that sort only are my readers my true readers my
readers foreordained of what account are the restthe rest are
merely humanityone must make ones self superior to humanity in
power in loftiness of soulin contempt

let us look each other in the face we are hyperboreanswe know well
enough how remote our place is neither by land nor by water will you
find the road to the hyperboreans even pindar1 in his day knew
that much about us beyond the north beyond the ice beyond
deathour life our happiness we have discovered that
happiness we know the way we got our knowledge of it from thousands of
years in the labyrinth who else has found itthe man of todayi
dont know either the way out or the way in i am whatever doesnt know
either the way out or the way inso sighs the man of today this
is the sort of modernity that made us illwe sickened on lazy peace
cowardly compromise the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and
nay this tolerance and largeur of the heart that forgives
everything because it understands everything is a sirocco to us
rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such
southwinds we were brave enough we spared neither ourselves nor
others but we were a long time finding out where to direct our
courage we grew dismal they called us fatalists our fateit was
the fulness the tension the storing up of powers we thirsted for
the lightnings and great deeds we kept as far as possible from the
happiness of the weakling from resignation there was thunder in
our air nature as we embodied it became overcastfor we had not yet
found the way the formula of our happiness a yea a nay a straight
line a goal
1 cf the tenth pythian ode see also the fourth book of herodotus
the hyperboreans were a mythical people beyond the rhipaean mountains
in the far north they enjoyed unbroken happiness and perpetual youth
2
what is goodwhatever augments the feeling of power the will to
power power itself in man
what is evilwhatever springs from weakness
what is happinessthe feeling that power increasesthat resistance
is overcome
not contentment but more power not peace at any price but war
not virtue but efficiency virtue in the renaissance sense virtu
virtue free of moral acid
the weak and the botched shall perish first principle of our charity
and one should help them to it
what is more harmful than any vicepractical sympathy for the botched
and the weakchristianity
3
the problem that i set here is not what shall replace mankind in the
order of living creatures man is an end but what type of man must
be bred must be willed as being the most valuable the most worthy
of life the most secure guarantee of the future
this more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past but
always as a happy accident as an exception never as deliberately
willed very often it has been precisely the most feared hitherto it
has been almost the terror of terrorsand out of that terror the
contrary type has been willed cultivated and attained the domestic
animal the herd animal the sick brutemanthe christian
4
mankind surely does not represent an evolution toward a better or
stronger or higher level as progress is now understood this progress
is merely a modern idea which is to say a false idea the european of
today in his essential worth falls far below the european of the
renaissance the process of evolution does not necessarily mean
elevation enhancement strengthening
true enough it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various
parts of the earth and under the most widely different cultures and in
these cases a higher type certainly manifests itself something which
compared to mankind in the mass appears as a sort of superman such
happy strokes of high success have always been possible and will remain
possible perhaps for all time to come even whole races tribes and
nations may occasionally represent such lucky accidents
5
we should not deck out and embellish christianity it has waged a war to
the death against this higher type of man it has put all the deepest
instincts of this type under its ban it has developed its concept of
evil of the evil one himself out of these instinctsthe strong man as
the typical reprobate the outcast among men christianity has taken
the part of all the weak the low the botched it has made an ideal out
of antagonism to all the selfpreservative instincts of sound life it
has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are
intellectually most vigorous by representing the highest intellectual
values as sinful as misleading as full of temptation the most
lamentable example the corruption of pascal who believed that his
intellect had been destroyed by original sin whereas it was actually
destroyed by christianity
6
it is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me i have drawn
back the curtain from the rottenness of man this word in my mouth
is at least free from one suspicion that it involves a moral accusation
against humanity it is usedand i wish to emphasize the fact
againwithout any moral significance and this is so far true that the
rottenness i speak of is most apparent to me precisely in those quarters
where there has been most aspiration hitherto toward virtue and
godliness as you probably surmise i understand rottenness in the
sense of dcadence my argument is that all the values on which
mankind now fixes its highest aspirations are dcadencevalues
i call an animal a species an individual corrupt when it loses its
instincts when it chooses when it prefers what is injurious to it
a history of the higher feelings the ideals of humanityand it is
possible that ill have to write itwould almost explain why man is so
degenerate life itself appears to me as an instinct for growth for
survival for the accumulation of forces for power whenever the will
to power fails there is disaster my contention is that all the highest
values of humanity have been emptied of this willthat the values of
dcadence of nihilism now prevail under the holiest names
7
christianity is called the religion of pitypity stands in
opposition to all the tonic passions that augment the energy of the
feeling of aliveness it is a depressant a man loses power when he
pities through pity that drain upon strength which suffering works is
multiplied a thousandfold suffering is made contagious by pity under
certain circumstances it may lead to a total sacrifice of life and
living energya loss out of all proportion to the magnitude of the
cause the case of the death of the nazarene this is the first view
of it there is however a still more important one if one measures
the effects of pity by the gravity of the reactions it sets up its
character as a menace to life appears in a much clearer light pity
thwarts the whole law of evolution which is the law of natural
selection it preserves whatever is ripe for destruction it fights on
the side of those disinherited and condemned by life by maintaining
life in so many of the botched of all kinds it gives life itself a
gloomy and dubious aspect mankind has ventured to call pity a virtue
in every superior moral system it appears as a weakness going
still further it has been called the virtue the source and
foundation of all other virtuesbut let us always bear in mind that
this was from the standpoint of a philosophy that was nihilistic and
upon whose shield the denial of life was inscribed schopenhauer was
right in this that by means of pity life is denied and made worthy of
denialpity is the technic of nihilism let me repeat this depressing
and contagious instinct stands against all those instincts which work
for the preservation and enhancement of life in the rle of protector
of the miserable it is a prime agent in the promotion of
dcadencepity persuades to extinction of course one doesnt say
extinction one says the other world or god or the true
life or nirvana salvation blessedness this innocent rhetoric
from the realm of religiousethical balderdash appears a good deal
less innocent when one reflects upon the tendency that it conceals
beneath sublime words the tendency to destroy life schopenhauer was
hostile to life that is why pity appeared to him as a virtue
aristotle as every one knows saw in pity a sickly and dangerous state
of mind the remedy for which was an occasional purgative he regarded
tragedy as that purgative the instinct of life should prompt us to seek
some means of puncturing any such pathological and dangerous
accumulation of pity as that appearing in schopenhauers case and also
alack in that of our whole literary dcadence from st petersburg to
paris from tolstoi to wagner that it may burst and be discharged
nothing is more unhealthy amid all our unhealthy modernism than
christian pity to be the doctors here to be unmerciful here to
wield the knife hereall this is our business all this is our
sort of humanity by this sign we are philosophers we hyperboreans
8
it is necessary to say just whom we regard as our antagonists
theologians and all who have any theological blood in their veinsthis
is our whole philosophy one must have faced that menace at close
hand better still one must have had experience of it directly and
almost succumbed to it to realize that it is not to be taken lightly
the alleged freethinking of our naturalists and physiologists seems
to me to be a jokethey have no passion about such things they have
not suffered this poisoning goes a great deal further than most
people think i find the arrogant habit of the theologian among all who
regard themselves as idealistsamong all who by virtue of a higher
point of departure claim a right to rise above reality and to look
upon it with suspicion the idealist like the ecclesiastic carries
all sorts of lofty concepts in his hand and not only in his hand
he launches them with benevolent contempt against understanding the
senses honor good living science he sees such things as
beneath him as pernicious and seductive forces on which the soul
soars as a pure thinginitselfas if humility chastity poverty in a
word holiness had not already done much more damage to life than all
imaginable horrors and vices the pure soul is a pure lie so long
as the priest that professional denier calumniator and poisoner of
life is accepted as a higher variety of man there can be no answer
to the question what is truth truth has already been stood on its
head when the obvious attorney of mere emptiness is mistaken for its
representative
9
upon this theological instinct i make war i find the tracks of it
everywhere whoever has theological blood in his veins is shifty and
dishonourable in all things the pathetic thing that grows out of this
condition is called faith in other words closing ones eyes upon
ones self once for all to avoid suffering the sight of incurable
falsehood people erect a concept of morality of virtue of holiness
upon this false view of all things they ground good conscience upon
faulty vision they argue that no other sort of vision has value any
more once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of god
salvation and eternity i unearth this theological instinct in all
directions it is the most widespread and the most subterranean form
of falsehood to be found on earth whatever a theologian regards as true
must be false there you have almost a criterion of truth his
profound instinct of selfpreservation stands against truth ever coming
into honour in any way or even getting stated wherever the influence
of theologians is felt there is a transvaluation of values and the
concepts true and false are forced to change places whatever is
most damaging to life is there called true and whatever exalts it
intensifies it approves it justifies it and makes it triumphant is
there called false when theologians working through the
consciences of princes or of peoples stretch out their hands for
power there is never any doubt as to the fundamental issue the will
to make an end the nihilistic will exerts that power
10
among germans i am immediately understood when i say that theological
blood is the ruin of philosophy the protestant pastor is the
grandfather of german philosophy protestantism itself is its peccatum
originale definition of protestantism hemiplegic paralysis of
christianityand of reason one need only utter the words
tbingen school to get an understanding of what german philosophy is
at bottoma very artful form of theology the suabians are the best
liars in germany they lie innocently why all the rejoicing over
the appearance of kant that went through the learned world of germany
threefourths of which is made up of the sons of preachers and
teacherswhy the german conviction still echoing that with kant came a
change for the better the theological instinct of german scholars
made them see clearly just what had become possible again a
backstairs leading to the old ideal stood open the concept of the true
world the concept of morality as the essence of the world the two
most vicious errors that ever existed were once more thanks to a
subtle and wily scepticism if not actually demonstrable then at
least no longer refutable reason the prerogative of reason
does not go so far out of reality there had been made appearance
an absolutely false world that of being had been turned into
reality the success of kant is merely a theological success he was
like luther and leibnitz but one more impediment to german integrity
already far from steady
11
a word now against kant as a moralist a virtue must be our invention
it must spring out of our personal need and defence in every other
case it is a source of danger that which does not belong to our life
menaces it a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the
concept of virtue as kant would have it is pernicious virtue
duty good for its own sake goodness grounded upon impersonality or
a notion of universal validitythese are all chimeras and in them one
finds only an expression of the decay the last collapse of life the
chinese spirit of knigsberg quite the contrary is demanded by the most
profound laws of selfpreservation and of growth to wit that every man
find his own virtue his own categorical imperative a nation goes
to pieces when it confounds its duty with the general concept of duty
nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every
impersonal duty every sacrifice before the moloch of abstractionto
think that no one has thought of kants categorical imperative as
dangerous to life the theological instinct alone took it under
protectionan action prompted by the lifeinstinct proves that it is a
right action by the amount of pleasure that goes with it and yet that
nihilist with his bowels of christian dogmatism regarded pleasure as
an objection what destroys a man more quickly than to work think
and feel without inner necessity without any deep personal desire
without pleasureas a mere automaton of duty that is the recipe for
dcadence and no less for idiocy kant became an idiotand such
a man was the contemporary of goethe this calamitous spinner of cobwebs
passed for the german philosopherstill passes today i forbid
myself to say what i think of the germans didnt kant see in the
french revolution the transformation of the state from the inorganic
form to the organic didnt he ask himself if there was a single event
that could be explained save on the assumption of a moral faculty in
man so that on the basis of it the tendency of mankind toward the
good could be explained once and for all time kants answer that
is revolution instinct at fault in everything and anything instinct
as a revolt against nature german dcadence as a philosophythat is
kant
12
i put aside a few sceptics the types of decency in the history of
philosophy the rest havent the slightest conception of intellectual
integrity they behave like women all these great enthusiasts and
prodigiesthey regard beautiful feelings as arguments the heaving
breast as the bellows of divine inspiration conviction as the
criterion of truth in the end with german innocence kant tried to
give a scientific flavour to this form of corruption this dearth of
intellectual conscience by calling it practical reason he
deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions when it
was desirable not to trouble with reasonthat is when morality when
the sublime command thou shalt was heard when one recalls the fact
that among all peoples the philosopher is no more than a development
from the old type of priest this inheritance from the priest this
fraud upon self ceases to be remarkable when a man feels that he has
a divine mission say to lift up to save or to liberate mankindwhen a
man feels the divine spark in his heart and believes that he is the
mouthpiece of supernatural imperativeswhen such a mission inflames
him it is only natural that he should stand beyond all merely
reasonable standards of judgment he feels that he is himself
sanctified by this mission that he is himself a type of a higher
order what has a priest to do with philosophy he stands far above
itand hitherto the priest has ruledhe has determined the meaning
of true and not true
13
let us not underestimate this fact that we
ourselves we free spirits are already a transvaluation of all
values a visualized declaration of war and victory against all the
old concepts of true and not true the most valuable intuitions are
the last to be attained the most valuable of all are those which
determine methods all the methods all the principles of the
scientific spirit of today were the targets for thousands of years of
the most profound contempt if a man inclined to them he was excluded
from the society of decent peoplehe passed as an enemy of god as
a scoffer at the truth as one possessed as a man of science he
belonged to the chandala2 we have had the whole pathetic stupidity
of mankind against ustheir every notion of what the truth ought to
be of what the service of the truth ought to betheir every thou
shalt was launched against us our objectives our methods our
quiet cautious distrustful mannerall appeared to them as absolutely
discreditable and contemptiblelooking back one may almost ask ones
self with reason if it was not actually an aesthetic sense that kept
men blind so long what they demanded of the truth was picturesque
effectiveness and of the learned a strong appeal to their senses it
was our modesty that stood out longest against their taste how
well they guessed that these turkeycocks of god
2 the lowest of the hindu castes
14
we have unlearned something we have become more modest in every way we
no longer derive man from the spirit from the godhead we have
dropped him back among the beasts we regard him as the strongest of the
beasts because he is the craftiest one of the results thereof is his
intellectuality on the other hand we guard ourselves against a conceit
which would assert itself even here that man is the great second
thought in the process of organic evolution he is in truth anything
but the crown of creation beside him stand many other animals all at
similar stages of development and even when we say that we say a bit
too much for man relatively speaking is the most botched of all the
animals and the sickliest and he has wandered the most dangerously from
his instinctsthough for all that to be sure he remains the most
interestingas regards the lower animals it was descartes who first
had the really admirable daring to describe them as machina the whole
of our physiology is directed toward proving the truth of this doctrine
moreover it is illogical to set man apart as descartes did what we
know of man today is limited precisely by the extent to which we have
regarded him too as a machine formerly we accorded to man as his
inheritance from some higher order of beings what was called free
will now we have taken even this will from him for the term no longer
describes anything that we can understand the old word will now
connotes only a sort of result an individual reaction that follows
inevitably upon a series of partly discordant and partly harmonious
stimulithe will no longer acts or moves formerly it was
thought that mans consciousness his spirit offered evidence of his
high origin his divinity that he might be perfected he was advised
tortoiselike to draw his senses in to have no traffic with earthly
things to shuffle off his mortal coilthen only the important part of
him the pure spirit would remain here again we have thought out the
thing better to us consciousness or the spirit appears as a symptom
of a relative imperfection of the organism as an experiment a groping
a misunderstanding as an affliction which uses up nervous force
unnecessarilywe deny that anything can be done perfectly so long as it
is done consciously the pure spirit is a piece of pure stupidity
take away the nervous system and the senses the socalled mortal
shell and the rest is miscalculationthat is all
15
under christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of
contact with actuality it offers purely imaginary causes god
soul ego spirit free willor even unfree and purely
imaginary effects sin salvation grace punishment
forgiveness of sins intercourse between imaginary beings god
spirits souls an imaginary natural history anthropocentric a
total denial of the concept of natural causes an imaginary
psychology misunderstandings of self misinterpretations of agreeable
or disagreeable general feelingsfor example of the states of the
nervus sympathicus with the help of the signlanguage of
religioethical balderdash repentance pangs of conscience
temptation by the devil the presence of god an imaginary
teleology the kingdom of god the last judgment eternal
lifethis purely fictitious world greatly to its disadvantage is
to be differentiated from the world of dreams the latter at least
reflects reality whereas the former falsifies it cheapens it and
denies it once the concept of nature had been opposed to the concept
of god the word natural necessarily took on the meaning of
abominablethe whole of that fictitious world has its sources in
hatred of the natural the real and is no more than evidence of a
profound uneasiness in the presence of reality this explains
everything who alone has any reason for living his way out of reality
the man who suffers under it but to suffer from reality one must be a
botched reality the preponderance of pains over pleasures is the
cause of this fictitious morality and religion but such a preponderance
also supplies the formula for dcadence
16
a criticism of the christian concept of god leads inevitably to the
same conclusiona nation that still believes in itself holds fast to
its own god in him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to
survive to its virtuesit projects its joy in itself its feeling of
power into a being to whom one may offer thanks he who is rich will
give of his riches a proud people need a god to whom they can make
sacrifices religion within these limits is a form of gratitude
a man is grateful for his own existence to that end he needs a
godsuch a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries he
must be able to play either friend or foehe is wondered at for the
good he does as well as for the evil he does but the castration
against all nature of such a god making him a god of goodness alone
would be contrary to human inclination mankind has just as much need
for an evil god as for a good god it doesnt have to thank mere
tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence what would be
the value of a god who knew nothing of anger revenge envy scorn
cunning violence who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous
ardeurs of victory and of destruction no one would understand such a
god why should any one want himtrue enough when a nation is on the
downward path when it feels its belief in its own future its hope of
freedom slipping from it when it begins to see submission as a first
necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of selfpreservation
then it must overhaul its god he then becomes a hypocrite timorous
and demure he counsels peace of soul hatenomore leniency love
of friend and foe he moralizes endlessly he creeps into every private
virtue he becomes the god of every man he becomes a private citizen a
cosmopolitan formerly he represented a people the strength of a
people everything aggressive and thirsty for power in the soul of a
people now he is simply the good god the truth is that there is
no other alternative for gods either they are the will to powerin
which case they are national godsor incapacity for powerin which
case they have to be good
17
wherever the will to power begins to decline in whatever form there is
always an accompanying decline physiologically a dcadence the
divinity of this dcadence shorn of its masculine virtues and
passions is converted perforce into a god of the physiologically
degraded of the weak of course they do not call themselves the
weak they call themselves the good no hint is needed to indicate
the moments in history at which the dualistic fiction of a good and an
evil god first became possible the same instinct which prompts the
inferior to reduce their own god to goodnessinitself also prompts
them to eliminate all good qualities from the god of their superiors
they make revenge on their masters by making a devil of the latters
godthe good god and the devil like himboth are abortions of
dcadencehow can we be so tolerant of the navet of christian
theologians as to join in their doctrine that the evolution of the
concept of god from the god of israel the god of a people to the
christian god the essence of all goodness is to be described as
progressbut even renan does this as if renan had a right to be
nave the contrary actually stares one in the face when everything
necessary to ascending life when all that is strong courageous
masterful and proud has been eliminated from the concept of a god when
he has sunk step by step to the level of a staff for the weary a
sheetanchor for the drowning when he becomes the poor mans god the
sinners god the invalids god par excellence and the attribute of
saviour or redeemer remains as the one essential attribute of
divinityjust what is the significance of such a metamorphosis
what does such a reduction of the godhead implyto be
sure the kingdom of god has thus grown larger formerly he had only
his own people his chosen people but since then he has gone
wandering like his people themselves into foreign parts he has given
up settling down quietly anywhere finally he has come to feel at home
everywhere and is the great cosmopolitanuntil now he has the great
majority on his side and half the earth but this god of the great
majority this democrat among gods has not become a proud heathen god
on the contrary he remains a jew he remains a god in a corner a god
of all the dark nooks and crevices of all the noisesome quarters of the
world his earthly kingdom now as always is a kingdom of the
underworld a souterrain kingdom a ghetto kingdom and he himself
is so pale so weak so dcadent even the palest of the pale are
able to master himmessieurs the metaphysicians those albinos of the
intellect they spun their webs around him for so long that finally he
was hypnotized and began to spin himself and became another
metaphysician thereafter he resumed once more his old business of
spinning the world out of his inmost being sub specie spinozae
thereafter he became ever thinner and palerbecame the ideal became
pure spirit became the absolute became the thinginitself
the collapse of a god he became a thinginitself
18
the christian concept of a godthe god as the patron of the sick the
god as a spinner of cobwebs the god as a spiritis one of the most
corrupt concepts that has ever been set up in the world it probably
touches lowwater mark in the ebbing evolution of the godtype god
degenerated into the contradiction of life instead of being its
transfiguration and eternal yea in him war is declared on life on
nature on the will to live god becomes the formula for every slander
upon the here and now and for every lie about the beyond in him
nothingness is deified and the will to nothingness is made holy
19
the fact that the strong races of northern europe did not repudiate this
christian god does little credit to their gift for religionand not
much more to their taste they ought to have been able to make an end of
such a moribund and wornout product of the dcadence a curse lies
upon them because they were not equal to it they made illness
decrepitude and contradiction a part of their instinctsand since then
they have not managed to create any more gods two thousand years have
come and goneand not a single new god instead there still exists
and as if by some intrinsic rightas if he were the ultimatum and
maximum of the power to create gods of the creator spiritus in
mankindthis pitiful god of christian monotonotheism this hybrid
image of decay conjured up out of emptiness contradiction and vain
imagining in which all the instincts of dcadence all the cowardices
and wearinesses of the soul find their sanction
20
in my condemnation of christianity i surely hope i do no injustice to a
related religion with an even larger number of believers i allude to
buddhism both are to be reckoned among the nihilistic religionsthey
are both dcadence religionsbut they are separated from each other
in a very remarkable way for the fact that he is able to compare them
at all the critic of christianity is indebted to the scholars of
indiabuddhism is a hundred times as realistic as christianityit is
part of its living heritage that it is able to face problems objectively
and coolly it is the product of long centuries of philosophical
speculation the concept god was already disposed of before it
appeared buddhism is the only genuinely positive religion to be
encountered in history and this applies even to its epistemology which
is a strict phenomenalism it does not speak of a struggle with sin
but yielding to reality of the struggle with suffering sharply
differentiating itself from christianity it puts the selfdeception
that lies in moral concepts behind it it is in my phrase beyond
good and evilthe two physiological facts upon which it grounds itself
and upon which it bestows its chief attention are first an excessive
sensitiveness to sensation which manifests itself as a refined
susceptibility to pain and secondly an extraordinary spirituality a
too protracted concern with concepts and logical procedures under the
influence of which the instinct of personality has yielded to a notion
of the impersonal both of these states will be familiar to a few
of my readers the objectivists by experience as they are to me
these physiological states produced a depression and buddha tried to
combat it by hygienic measures against it he prescribed a life in the
open a life of travel moderation in eating and a careful selection of
foods caution in the use of intoxicants the same caution in arousing
any of the passions that foster a bilious habit and heat the blood
finally no worry either on ones own account or on account of
others he encourages ideas that make for either quiet contentment or
good cheerhe finds means to combat ideas of other sorts he
understands good the state of goodness as something which promotes
health prayer is not included and neither is asceticism there is
no categorical imperative nor any disciplines even within the walls of
a monastery it is always possible to leave these things would
have been simply means of increasing the excessive sensitiveness above
mentioned for the same reason he does not advocate any conflict with
unbelievers his teaching is antagonistic to nothing so much as to
revenge aversion ressentiment enmity never brings an end to
enmity the moving refrain of all buddhism and in all this he was
right for it is precisely these passions which in view of his main
regiminal purpose are unhealthful the mental fatigue that he
observes already plainly displayed in too much objectivity that is
in the individuals loss of interest in himself in loss of balance and
of egoism he combats by strong efforts to lead even the spiritual
interests back to the ego in buddhas teaching egoism is a duty the
one thing needful the question how can you be delivered from
suffering regulates and determines the whole spiritual diet
perhaps one will here recall that athenian who also declared war upon
pure scientificality to wit socrates who also elevated egoism to
the estate of a morality
21
the things necessary to buddhism are a very mild climate customs of
great gentleness and liberality and no militarism moreover it must
get its start among the higher and better educated classes
cheerfulness quiet and the absence of desire are the chief desiderata
and they are attained buddhism is not a religion in which perfection
is merely an object of aspiration perfection is actually normal
under christianity the instincts of the subjugated and the oppressed
come to the fore it is only those who are at the bottom who seek their
salvation in it here the prevailing pastime the favourite remedy for
boredom is the discussion of sin selfcriticism the inquisition of
conscience here the emotion produced by power called god is
pumped up by prayer here the highest good is regarded as
unattainable as a gift as grace here too open dealing is lacking
concealment and the darkened room are christian here body is despised
and hygiene is denounced as sensual the church even ranges itself
against cleanliness the first christian order after the banishment of
the moors closed the public baths of which there were 270 in cordova
alone christian too is a certain cruelty toward ones self and
toward others hatred of unbelievers the will to persecute sombre and
disquieting ideas are in the foreground the most esteemed states of
mind bearing the most respectable names are epileptoid the diet is so
regulated as to engender morbid symptoms and overstimulate the nerves
christian again is all deadly enmity to the rulers of the earth to
the aristocraticalong with a sort of secret rivalry with them one
resigns ones body to them one wants only ones soul and
christian is all hatred of the intellect of pride of courage of
freedom of intellectual libertinage christian is all hatred of the
senses of joy in the senses of joy in general

when christianity departed from its native soil that of the lowest
orders the underworld of the ancient world and began seeking power
among barbarian peoples it no longer had to deal with exhausted men
but with men still inwardly savage and capable of selftorturein
brief strong men but bungled men here unlike in the case of the
buddhists the cause of discontent with self suffering through self is
not merely a general sensitiveness and susceptibility to pain but on
the contrary an inordinate thirst for inflicting pain on others a
tendency to obtain subjective satisfaction in hostile deeds and ideas
christianity had to embrace barbaric concepts and valuations in order
to obtain mastery over barbarians of such sort for example are the
sacrifices of the firstborn the drinking of blood as a sacrament the
disdain of the intellect and of culture torture in all its forms
whether bodily or not the whole pomp of the cult buddhism is a
religion for peoples in a further state of development for races that
have become kind gentle and overspiritualized europe is not yet
ripe for it it is a summons that takes them back to peace and
cheerfulness to a careful rationing of the spirit to a certain
hardening of the body christianity aims at mastering beasts of prey
its modus operandi is to make them illto make feeble is the
christian recipe for taming for civilizing buddhism is a religion
for the closing overwearied stages of civilization christianity
appears before civilization has so much as begununder certain
circumstances it lays the very foundations thereof
23
buddhism i repeat is a hundred times more austere more honest more
objective it no longer has to justify its pains its susceptibility
to suffering by interpreting these things in terms of sinit simply
says as it simply thinks i suffer to the barbarian however
suffering in itself is scarcely understandable what he needs first of
all is an explanation as to why he suffers his mere instinct
prompts him to deny his suffering altogether or to endure it in
silence here the word devil was a blessing man had to have an
omnipotent and terrible enemythere was no need to be ashamed of
suffering at the hands of such an enemy
at the bottom of christianity there are several subtleties that belong
to the orient in the first place it knows that it is of very little
consequence whether a thing be true or not so long as it is believed
to be true truth and faith here we have two wholly distinct worlds
of ideas almost two diametrically opposite worldsthe road to the
one and the road to the other lie miles apart to understand that fact
thoroughlythis is almost enough in the orient to make one a sage
the brahmins knew it plato knew it every student of the esoteric knows
it when for example a man gets any pleasure out of the notion that
he has been saved from sin it is not necessary for him to be actually
sinful but merely to feel sinful but when faith is thus exalted
above everything else it necessarily follows that reason knowledge and
patient inquiry have to be discredited the road to the truth becomes a
forbidden roadhope in its stronger forms is a great deal more
powerful stimulans to life than any sort of realized joy can ever be
man must be sustained in suffering by a hope so high that no conflict
with actuality can dash itso high indeed that no fulfilment can
satisfy it a hope reaching out beyond this world precisely because
of this power that hope has of making the suffering hold out the greeks
regarded it as the evil of evils as the most malign of evils it
remained behind at the source of all evil3in order that love may
be possible god must become a person in order that the lower instincts
may take a hand in the matter god must be young to satisfy the ardor of
the woman a beautiful saint must appear on the scene and to satisfy
that of the men there must be a virgin these things are necessary if
christianity is to assume lordship over a soil on which some
aphrodisiacal or adonis cult has already established a notion as to what
a cult ought to be to insist upon chastity greatly strengthens the
vehemence and subjectivity of the religious instinctit makes the cult
warmer more enthusiastic more soulfullove is the state in which man
sees things most decidedly as they are not the force of illusion
reaches its highest here and so does the capacity for sweetening for
transfiguring when a man is in love he endures more than at any other
time he submits to anything the problem was to devise a religion which
would allow one to love by this means the worst that life has to offer
is overcomeit is scarcely even noticedso much for the three
christian virtues faith hope and charity i call them the three
christian ingenuitiesbuddhism is in too late a stage of
development too full of positivism to be shrewd in any such way
3 that is in pandoras box
24
here i barely touch upon the problem of the origin of christianity
the first thing necessary to its solution is this that christianity
is to be understood only by examining the soil from which it sprungit
is not a reaction against jewish instincts it is their inevitable
product it is simply one more step in the aweinspiring logic of the
jews in the words of the saviour salvation is of the jews4the
second thing to remember is this that the psychological type of the
galilean is still to be recognized but it was only in its most
degenerate form which is at once maimed and overladen with foreign
features that it could serve in the manner in which it has been used
as a type of the saviour of mankind
4 john iv 22
the jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world for
when they were confronted with the question to be or not to be they
chose with perfectly unearthly deliberation to be at any price this
price involved a radical falsification of all nature of all
naturalness of all reality of the whole inner world as well as of
the outer they put themselves against all those conditions under
which hitherto a people had been able to live or had even been
permitted to live out of themselves they evolved an idea which stood
in direct opposition to natural conditionsone by one they distorted
religion civilization morality history and psychology until each
became a contradiction of its natural significance we meet with the
same phenomenon later on in an incalculably exaggerated form but only
as a copy the christian church put beside the people of god shows a
complete lack of any claim to originality precisely for this reason the
jews are the most fateful people in the history of the world their
influence has so falsified the reasoning of mankind in this matter that
today the christian can cherish antisemitism without realizing that it
is no more than the final consequence of judaism
in my genealogy of morals i give the first psychological explanation
of the concepts underlying those two antithetical things a noble
morality and a ressentiment morality the second of which is a mere
product of the denial of the former the judaeochristian moral system
belongs to the second division and in every detail in order to be able
to say nay to everything representing an ascending evolution of
lifethat is to wellbeing to power to beauty to selfapprovalthe
instincts of ressentiment here become downright genius had to invent
an other world in which the acceptance of life appeared as the most
evil and abominable thing imaginable psychologically the jews are a
people gifted with the very strongest vitality so much so that when
they found themselves facing impossible conditions of life they chose
voluntarily and with a profound talent for selfpreservation the side
of all those instincts which make for dcadencenot as if mastered
by them but as if detecting in them a power by which the world could
be defied the jews are the very opposite of dcadents they have
simply been forced into appearing in that guise and with a degree of
skill approaching the non plus ultra of histrionic genius they have
managed to put themselves at the head of all dcadent movements for
example the christianity of paul and so make of them something
stronger than any party frankly saying yes to life to the sort of
men who reach out for power under judaism and christianitythat is to
say to the priestly classdcadence is no more than a means to an
end men of this sort have a vital interest in making mankind sick and
in confusing the values of good and bad true and false in a
manner that is not only dangerous to life but also slanders it
25
the history of israel is invaluable as a typical history of an attempt
to denaturize all natural values i point to five facts which bear
this out originally and above all in the time of the monarchy israel
maintained the right attitude of things which is to say the natural
attitude its jahveh was an expression of its consciousness of power
its joy in itself its hopes for itself to him the jews looked for
victory and salvation and through him they expected nature to give them
whatever was necessary to their existenceabove all rain jahveh is
the god of israel and consequently the god of justice this is the
logic of every race that has power in its hands and a good conscience in
the use of it in the religious ceremonial of the jews both aspects of
this selfapproval stand revealed the nation is grateful for the high
destiny that has enabled it to obtain dominion it is grateful for the
benign procession of the seasons and for the good fortune attending its
herds and its cropsthis view of things remained an ideal for a long
while even after it had been robbed of validity by tragic blows
anarchy within and the assyrian without but the people still retained
as a projection of their highest yearnings that vision of a king who
was at once a gallant warrior and an upright judgea vision best
visualized in the typical prophet i e critic and satirist of the
moment isaiahbut every hope remained unfulfilled the old god no
longer could do what he used to do he ought to have been abandoned
but what actually happened simply this the conception of him was
changedthe conception of him was denaturized this was the price
that had to be paid for keeping himjahveh the god of justicehe
is in accord with israel no more he no longer vizualizes the national
egoism he is now a god only conditionally the public notion of this
god now becomes merely a weapon in the hands of clerical agitators who
interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment
for obedience or disobedience to him for sin that most fraudulent of
all imaginable interpretations whereby a moral order of the world is
set up and the fundamental concepts cause and effect are stood on
their heads once natural causation has been swept out of the world by
doctrines of reward and punishment some sort of unnatural causation
becomes necessary and all other varieties of the denial of nature
follow it a god who demandsin place of a god who helps who gives
counsel who is at bottom merely a name for every happy inspiration of
courage and selfreliance morality is no longer a reflection of
the conditions which make for the sound life and development of the
people it is no longer the primary lifeinstinct instead it has become
abstract and in opposition to lifea fundamental perversion of the
fancy an evil eye on all things what is jewish what is
christian morality chance robbed of its innocence unhappiness polluted
with the idea of sin wellbeing represented as a danger as a
temptation a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of
conscience
26
the concept of god falsified the concept of morality falsifiedbut
even here jewish priestcraft did not stop the whole history of israel
ceased to be of any value out with itthese priests accomplished that
miracle of falsification of which a great part of the bible is the
documentary evidence with a degree of contempt unparalleled and in the
face of all tradition and all historical reality they translated the
past of their people into religious terms which is to say they
converted it into an idiotic mechanism of salvation whereby all
offences against jahveh were punished and all devotion to him was
rewarded we would regard this act of historical falsification as
something far more shameful if familiarity with the ecclesiastical
interpretation of history for thousands of years had not blunted our
inclinations for uprightness in historicis and the philosophers
support the church the lie about a moral order of the world runs
through the whole of philosophy even the newest what is the meaning
of a moral order of the world that there is a thing called the will
of god which once and for all time determines what man ought to do and
what he ought not to do that the worth of a people or of an individual
thereof is to be measured by the extent to which they or he obey this
will of god that the destinies of a people or of an individual are
controlled by this will of god which rewards or punishes according to
the degree of obedience manifestedin place of all that pitiable lie
reality has this to say the priest a parasitical variety of man
who can exist only at the cost of every sound view of life takes the
name of god in vain he calls that state of human society in which he
himself determines the value of all things the kingdom of god he
calls the means whereby that state of affairs is attained the will of
god with coldblooded cynicism he estimates all peoples all ages and
all individuals by the extent of their subservience or opposition to the
power of the priestly order one observes him at work under the hand of
the jewish priesthood the great age of israel became an age of
decline the exile with its long series of misfortunes was
transformed into a punishment for that great ageduring which priests
had not yet come into existence out of the powerful and wholly free
heroes of israels history they fashioned according to their changing
needs either wretched bigots and hypocrites or men entirely godless
they reduced every great event to the idiotic formula obedient or
disobedient to godthey went a step further the will of god in
other words some means necessary for preserving the power of the
priests had to be determinedand to this end they had to have a
revelation in plain english a gigantic literary fraud had to be
perpetrated and holy scriptures had to be concoctedand so with the
utmost hierarchical pomp and days of penance and much lamentation over
the long days of sin now ended they were duly published the will of
god it appears had long stood like a rock the trouble was that
mankind had neglected the holy scriptures but the will of god
had already been revealed to moses what happened simply this the
priest had formulated once and for all time and with the strictest
meticulousness what tithes were to be paid to him from the largest to
the smallest not forgetting the most appetizing cuts of meat for
the priest is a great consumer of beefsteaks in brief he let it be
known just what he wanted what the will of god was from this
time forward things were so arranged that the priest became
indispensable everywhere at all the great natural events of life at
birth at marriage in sickness at death not to say at the
sacrifice that is at mealtimes the holy parasite put in his
appearance and proceeded to denaturize itin his own phrase to
sanctify it for this should be noted that every natural habit
every natural institution the state the administration of justice
marriage the care of the sick and of the poor everything demanded by
the lifeinstinct in short everything that has any value in itself
is reduced to absolute worthlessness and even made the reverse of
valuable by the parasitism of priests or if you chose by the moral
order of the world the fact requires a sanctiona power to grant
values becomes necessary and the only way it can create such values is
by denying nature the priest depreciates and desecrates nature it
is only at this price that he can exist at alldisobedience to god
which actually means to the priest to the law now gets the name of
sin the means prescribed for reconciliation with god are of
course precisely the means which bring one most effectively under the
thumb of the priest he alone can save psychologically considered
sins are indispensable to every society organized on an ecclesiastical
basis they are the only reliable weapons of power the priest lives
upon sins it is necessary to him that there be sinning prime
axiom god forgiveth him that repentethin plain english him that
submitteth to the priest
27
christianity sprang from a soil so corrupt that on it everything
natural every natural value every reality was opposed by the deepest
instincts of the ruling classit grew up as a sort of war to the death
upon reality and as such it has never been surpassed the holy
people who had adopted priestly values and priestly names for all
things and who with a terrible logical consistency had rejected
everything of the earth as unholy worldly sinfulthis people
put its instinct into a final formula that was logical to the point of
selfannihilation as christianity it actually denied even the last
form of reality the holy people the chosen people jewish
reality itself the phenomenon is of the first order of importance the
small insurrectionary movement which took the name of jesus of nazareth
is simply the jewish instinct redivivusin other words it is the
priestly instinct come to such a pass that it can no longer endure the
priest as a fact it is the discovery of a state of existence even more
fantastic than any before it of a vision of life even more unreal
than that necessary to an ecclesiastical organization christianity
actually denies the church
i am unable to determine what was the target of the insurrection said to
have been led whether rightly or wrongly by jesus if it was not the
jewish churchchurch being here used in exactly the same sense that
the word has today it was an insurrection against the good and just
against the prophets of israel against the whole hierarchy of
societynot against corruption but against caste privilege order
formalism it was unbelief in superior men a nay flung at
everything that priests and theologians stood for but the hierarchy
that was called into question if only for an instant by this movement
was the structure of piles which above everything was necessary to the
safety of the jewish people in the midst of the watersit represented
their last possibility of survival it was the final residuum of
their independent political existence an attack upon it was an attack
upon the most profound national instinct the most powerful national
will to live that has ever appeared on earth this saintly anarchist
who aroused the people of the abyss the outcasts and sinners the
chandala of judaism to rise in revolt against the established order of
thingsand in language which if the gospels are to be credited would
get him sent to siberia todaythis man was certainly a political
criminal at least in so far as it was possible to be one in so
absurdly unpolitical a community this is what brought him to the
cross the proof thereof is to be found in the inscription that was put
upon the cross he died for his own sinsthere is not the slightest
ground for believing no matter how often it is asserted that he died
for the sins of others
28
as to whether he himself was conscious of this contradictionwhether
in fact this was the only contradiction he was cognizant ofthat is
quite another question here for the first time i touch upon the
problem of the psychology of the saviouri confess to begin with
that there are very few books which offer me harder reading than the
gospels my difficulties are quite different from those which enabled
the learned curiosity of the german mind to achieve one of its most
unforgettable triumphs it is a long while since i like all other young
scholars enjoyed with all the sapient laboriousness of a fastidious
philologist the work of the incomparable strauss5 at that time i was
twenty years old now i am too serious for that sort of thing what do i
care for the contradictions of tradition how can any one call pious
legends traditions the histories of saints present the most dubious
variety of literature in existence to examine them by the scientific
method in the entire absence of corroborative documents seems to me
to condemn the whole inquiry from the startit is simply learned
idling
5 david friedrich strauss 180874 author of das leben jesu
18356 a very famous work in its day nietzsche here refers to it
29
what concerns me is the psychological type of the saviour this type
might be depicted in the gospels in however mutilated a form and
however much overladen with extraneous charactersthat is in spite
of the gospels just as the figure of francis of assisi shows itself in
his legends in spite of his legends it is not a question of mere
truthful evidence as to what he did what he said and how he actually
died the question is whether his type is still conceivable whether it
has been handed down to usall the attempts that i know of to read the
history of a soul in the gospels seem to me to reveal only a
lamentable psychological levity m renan that mountebank in
psychologicus has contributed the two most unseemly notions to this
business of explaining the type of jesus the notion of the genius and
that of the hero hros but if there is anything essentially
unevangelical it is surely the concept of the hero what the gospels
make instinctive is precisely the reverse of all heroic struggle of
all taste for conflict the very incapacity for resistance is here
converted into something moral resist not evilthe most profound
sentence in the gospels perhaps the true key to them to wit the
blessedness of peace of gentleness the inability to be an enemy
what is the meaning of glad tidingsthe true life the life eternal
has been foundit is not merely promised it is here it is in you
it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions
from all keeping of distances every one is the child of godjesus
claims nothing for himself aloneas the child of god each man is the
equal of every other man imagine making jesus a heroand what a
tremendous misunderstanding appears in the word genius our whole
conception of the spiritual the whole conception of our civilization
could have had no meaning in the world that jesus lived in in the
strict sense of the physiologist a quite different word ought to be
used here we all know that there is a morbid sensibility of the
tactile nerves which causes those suffering from it to recoil from every
touch and from every effort to grasp a solid object brought to its
logical conclusion such a physiological habitus becomes an
instinctive hatred of all reality a flight into the intangible into
the incomprehensible a distaste for all formulae for all conceptions
of time and space for everything establishedcustoms institutions
the church a feeling of being at home in a world in which no sort of
reality survives a merely inner world a true world an eternal
world the kingdom of god is within you
30
the instinctive hatred of reality the consequence of an extreme
susceptibility to pain and irritationso great that merely to be
touched becomes unendurable for every sensation is too profound
the instinctive exclusion of all aversion all hostility all bounds
and distances in feeling the consequence of an extreme susceptibility
to pain and irritationso great that it senses all resistance all
compulsion to resistance as unbearable anguish that is to say as
harmful as prohibited by the instinct of selfpreservation and
regards blessedness joy as possible only when it is no longer
necessary to offer resistance to anybody or anything however evil or
dangerouslove as the only as the ultimate possibility of life
these are the two physiological realities upon and out of which the
doctrine of salvation has sprung i call them a sublime
superdevelopment of hedonism upon a thoroughly unsalubrious soil what
stands most closely related to them though with a large admixture of
greek vitality and nerveforce is epicureanism the theory of salvation
of paganism epicurus was a typical dcadent i was the first to
recognize himthe fear of pain even of infinitely slight painthe
end of this can be nothing save a religion of love
31
i have already given my answer to the problem the prerequisite to it is
the assumption that the type of the saviour has reached us only in a
greatly distorted form this distortion is very probable there are many
reasons why a type of that sort should not be handed down in a pure
form complete and free of additions the milieu in which this strange
figure moved must have left marks upon him and more must have been
imprinted by the history the destiny of the early christian
communities the latter indeed must have embellished the type
retrospectively with characters which can be understood only as serving
the purposes of war and of propaganda that strange and sickly world
into which the gospels lead usa world apparently out of a russian
novel in which the scum of society nervous maladies and childish
idiocy keep a trystmust in any case have coarsened the type the
first disciples in particular must have been forced to translate an
existence visible only in symbols and incomprehensibilities into their
own crudity in order to understand it at allin their sight the type
could take on reality only after it had been recast in a familiar
mould the prophet the messiah the future judge the teacher of
morals the worker of wonders john the baptistall these merely
presented chances to misunderstand it finally let us not underrate
the proprium of all great and especially all sectarian veneration it
tends to erase from the venerated objects all its original traits and
idiosyncrasies often so painfully strangeit does not even see
them it is greatly to be regretted that no dostoyevsky lived in the
neighbourhood of this most interesting dcadenti mean some one who
would have felt the poignant charm of such a compound of the sublime
the morbid and the childish in the last analysis the type as a type
of the dcadence may actually have been peculiarly complex and
contradictory such a possibility is not to be lost sight of
nevertheless the probabilities seem to be against it for in that case
tradition would have been particularly accurate and objective whereas
we have reasons for assuming the contrary meanwhile there is a
contradiction between the peaceful preacher of the mount the seashore
and the fields who appears like a new buddha on a soil very unlike
indias and the aggressive fanatic the mortal enemy of theologians and
ecclesiastics who stands glorified by renans malice as le grand
matre en ironie i myself havent any doubt that the greater part of
this venom and no less of esprit got itself into the concept of the
master only as a result of the excited nature of christian propaganda
we all know the unscrupulousness of sectarians when they set out to turn
their leader into an apologia for themselves when the early
christians had need of an adroit contentious pugnacious and
maliciously subtle theologian to tackle other theologians they
created a god that met that need just as they put into his mouth
without hesitation certain ideas that were necessary to them but that
were utterly at odds with the gospelsthe second coming the last
judgment all sorts of expectations and promises current at the
time
32
i can only repeat that i set myself against all efforts to intrude the
fanatic into the figure of the saviour the very word imprieux used
by renan is alone enough to annul the type what the glad tidings
tell us is simply that there are no more contradictions the kingdom of
heaven belongs to children the faith that is voiced here is no more
an embattled faithit is at hand it has been from the beginning it is
a sort of recrudescent childishness of the spirit the physiologists at
all events are familiar with such a delayed and incomplete puberty in
the living organism the result of degeneration a faith of this sort is
not furious it does not denounce it does not defend itself it does
not come with the swordit does not realize how it will one day set
man against man it does not manifest itself either by miracles or by
rewards and promises or by scriptures it is itself first and last
its own miracle its own reward its own promise its own kingdom of
god this faith does not formulate itselfit simply lives and so
guards itself against formulae to be sure the accident of environment
of educational background gives prominence to concepts of a certain
sort in primitive christianity one finds only concepts of a
judaeosemitic character that of eating and drinking at the last
supper belongs to this categoryan idea which like everything else
jewish has been badly mauled by the church but let us be careful not
to see in all this anything more than symbolical language semantics6
an opportunity to speak in parables it is only on the theory that no
work is to be taken literally that this antirealist is able to speak at
all set down among hindus he would have made use of the concepts of
sankhya7 and among chinese he would have employed those of
laotse8and in neither case would it have made any difference to
himwith a little freedom in the use of words one might actually call
jesus a free spirit9he cares nothing for what is established the
word killeth10 whatever is established killeth the idea of
life as an experience as he alone conceives it stands opposed to
his mind to every sort of word formula law belief and dogma he
speaks only of inner things life or truth or light is his word
for the innermostin his sight everything else the whole of reality
all nature even language has significance only as sign as
allegoryhere it is of paramount importance to be led into no error by
the temptations lying in christian or rather ecclesiastical
prejudices such a symbolism par excellence stands outside all
religion all notions of worship all history all natural science all
worldly experience all knowledge all politics all psychology all
books all arthis wisdom is precisely a pure ignorance11 of all
such things he has never heard of culture he doesnt have to make
war on ithe doesnt even deny it the same thing may be said of the
state of the whole bourgeoise social order of labour of warhe has
no ground for denying the world for he knows nothing of the
ecclesiastical concept of the world denial is precisely the
thing that is impossible to himin the same way he lacks argumentative
capacity and has no belief that an article of faith a truth may be
established by proofs his proofs are inner lights subjective
sensations of happiness and selfapproval simple proofs of power
such a doctrine cannot contradict it doesnt know that other
doctrines exist or can exist and is wholly incapable of imagining
anything opposed to it if anything of the sort is ever encountered
it laments the blindness with sincere sympathyfor it alone has
lightbut it does not offer objections

semantik is what nietzsche had in mind

10 that is the strict letter of the lawthe chief target of jesuss

11 a reference to the pure ignorance reine thorheit of parsifal
33
in the whole psychology of the gospels the concepts of guilt and
punishment are lacking and so is that of reward sin which means
anything that puts a distance between god and man is abolishedthis
is precisely the glad tidings eternal bliss is not merely promised
nor is it bound up with conditions it is conceived as the only
realitywhat remains consists merely of signs useful in speaking of it
the results of such a point of view project themselves into a new way
of life the special evangelical way of life it is not a belief that
marks off the christian he is distinguished by a different mode of
action he acts differently he offers no resistance either by word
or in his heart to those who stand against him he draws no distinction
between strangers and countrymen jews and gentiles neighbour of
course means fellowbeliever jew he is angry with no one and he
despises no one he neither appeals to the courts of justice nor heeds
their mandates swear not at all12 he never under any
circumstances divorces his wife even when he has proofs of her
infidelityand under all of this is one principle all of it arises
from one instinct
12 matthew v 34
the life of the saviour was simply a carrying out of this way of
lifeand so was his death he no longer needed any formula or ritual
in his relations with godnot even prayer he had rejected the whole of
the jewish doctrine of repentance and atonement he knew that it was
only by a way of life that one could feel ones self divine
blessed evangelical a child of god not by repentance not
by prayer and forgiveness is the way to god only the gospel way
leads to godit is itself godwhat the gospels abolished was
the judaism in the concepts of sin forgiveness of sin faith
salvation through faiththe whole ecclesiastical dogma of the jews
was denied by the glad tidings
the deep instinct which prompts the christian how to live so that he
will feel that he is in heaven and is immortal despite many reasons
for feeling that he is not in heaven this is the only psychological
reality in salvationa new way of life not a new faith
34
if i understand anything at all about this great symbolist it is this
that he regarded only subjective realities as realities as
truthsthat he saw everything else everything natural temporal
spatial and historical merely as signs as materials for parables the
concept of the son of god does not connote a concrete person in
history an isolated and definite individual but an eternal fact a
psychological symbol set free from the concept of time the same thing
is true and in the highest sense of the god of this typical
symbolist of the kingdom of god and of the sonship of god nothing
could be more unchristian than the crude ecclesiastical notions of
god as a person of a kingdom of god that is to come of a kingdom
of heaven beyond and of a son of god as the second person of the
trinity all thisif i may be forgiven the phraseis like thrusting
ones fist into the eye and what an eye of the gospels a disrespect
for symbols amounting to worldhistorical cynicism but it is
nevertheless obvious enough what is meant by the symbols father and
sonnot of course to every one the word son expresses
entrance into the feeling that there is a general transformation of
all things beatitude and father expresses that feeling
itselfthe sensation of eternity and of perfectioni am ashamed to
remind you of what the church has made of this symbolism has it not set
an amphitryon story13 at the threshold of the christian faith and a
dogma of immaculate conception for good measure and thereby it
has robbed conception of its immaculateness
13 amphitryon was the son of alcaeus king of tiryns
his wife was alcmene during his absence she was visited by zeus and
bore heracles
the kingdom of heaven is a state of the heartnot something to come
beyond the world or after death the whole idea of natural death is
absent from the gospels death is not a bridge not a passing it is
absent because it belongs to a quite different a merely apparent world
useful only as a symbol the hour of death is not a christian
ideahours time the physical life and its crises have no existence
for the bearer of glad tidings the kingdom of god is not
something that men wait for it had no yesterday and no day after
tomorrow it is not going to come at a millenniumit is an experience
of the heart it is everywhere and it is nowhere
35
this bearer of glad tidings died as he lived and taughtnot to
save mankind but to show mankind how to live it was a way of life
that he bequeathed to man his demeanour before the judges before the
officers before his accusershis demeanour on the cross he does not
resist he does not defend his rights he makes no effort to ward off
the most extreme penaltymore he invites it and he prays
suffers and loves with those in those who do him evil not to
defend ones self not to show anger not to lay blames on the
contrary to submit even to the evil oneto love him
36
we free spiritswe are the first to have the necessary prerequisite
to understanding what nineteen centuries have misunderstoodthat
instinct and passion for integrity which makes war upon the holy lie
even more than upon all other lies mankind was unspeakably far from
our benevolent and cautious neutrality from that discipline of the
spirit which alone makes possible the solution of such strange and
subtle things what men always sought with shameless egoism was their
own advantage therein they created the church out of denial of the
gospels
whoever sought for signs of an ironical divinitys hand in the great
drama of existence would find no small indication thereof in the
stupendous questionmark that is called christianity that mankind
should be on its knees before the very antithesis of what was the
origin the meaning and the law of the gospelsthat in the concept of
the church the very things should be pronounced holy that the bearer
of glad tidings regards as beneath him and behind himit would be
impossible to surpass this as a grand example of worldhistorical
irony
37
our age is proud of its historical sense how then could it delude
itself into believing that the crude fable of the wonderworker and
saviour constituted the beginnings of christianityand that everything
spiritual and symbolical in it only came later quite to the contrary
the whole history of christianityfrom the death on the cross
onwardis the history of a progressively clumsier misunderstanding of
an original symbolism with every extension of christianity among
larger and ruder masses even less capable of grasping the principles
that gave birth to it the need arose to make it more and more vulgar
and barbarousit absorbed the teachings and rites of all the
subterranean cults of the imperium romanum and the absurdities
engendered by all sorts of sickly reasoning it was the fate of
christianity that its faith had to become as sickly as low and as
vulgar as the needs were sickly low and vulgar to which it had to
administer a sickly barbarism finally lifts itself to power as the
churchthe church that incarnation of deadly hostility to all honesty
to all loftiness of soul to all discipline of the spirit to all
spontaneous and kindly humanitychristian valuesnoble values it
is only we we free spirits who have reestablished this greatest of
all antitheses in values
38
i cannot at this place avoid a sigh there are days when i am
visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholycontempt of
man let me leave no doubt as to what i despise whom i despise
it is the man of today the man with whom i am unhappily
contemporaneous the man of todayi am suffocated by his foul
breath toward the past like all who understand i am full of
tolerance which is to say generous selfcontrol with gloomy caution
i pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world call it
christianity christian faith or the christian church as you
willi take care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies but
my feeling changes and breaks out irresistibly the moment i enter modern
times our times our age knows better what was formerly merely
sickly now becomes indecentit is indecent to be a christian today
and here my disgust beginsi look about me not a word survives of
what was once called truth we can no longer bear to hear a priest
pronounce the word even a man who makes the most modest pretensions to
integrity must know that a theologian a priest a pope of today not
only errs when he speaks but actually liesand that he no longer
escapes blame for his lie through innocence or ignorance the priest
knows as every one knows that there is no longer any god or any
sinner or any saviourthat free will and the moral order of the
world are lies serious reflection the profound selfconquest of the
spirit allow no man to pretend that he does not know it all
the ideas of the church are now recognized for what they areas the
worst counterfeits in existence invented to debase nature and all
natural values the priest himself is seen as he actually isas the
most dangerous form of parasite as the venomous spider of creation
we know our conscience now knowsjust what the real value of all
those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and what ends
they have served with their debasement of humanity to a state of
selfpollution the very sight of which excites loathingthe concepts
the other world the last judgment the immortality of the soul
the soul itself they are all merely so many instruments of torture
systems of cruelty whereby the priest becomes master and remains
master every one knows this but nevertheless things remain as
before what has become of the last trace of decent feeling of
selfrespect when our statesmen otherwise an unconventional class of
men and thoroughly antichristian in their acts now call themselves
christians and go to the communiontable a prince at the head of his
armies magnificent as the expression of the egoism and arrogance of his
peopleand yet acknowledging without any shame that he is a
christian whom then does christianity deny what does it call
the world to be a soldier to be a judge to be a patriot to
defend ones self to be careful of ones honour to desire ones own
advantage to be proud  every act of everyday every instinct
every valuation that shows itself in a deed is now antichristian
what a monster of falsehood the modern man must be to call himself
nevertheless and without shame a christian
39
i shall go back a bit and tell you the authentic history of
christianitythe very word christianity is a misunderstandingat
bottom there was only one christian and he died on the cross the
gospels died on the cross what from that moment onward was called
the gospels was the very reverse of what he had lived bad
tidings a dysangelium14 it is an error amounting to
nonsensicality to see in faith and particularly in faith in salvation
through christ the distinguishing mark of the christian only the
christian way of life the life lived by him who died on the cross
is christian to this day such a life is still possible and for
certain men even necessary genuine primitive christianity will
remain possible in all ages not faith but acts above all an
avoidance of acts a different state of being states of
consciousness faith of a sort the acceptance for example of anything
as trueas every psychologist knows the value of these things is
perfectly indifferent and fifthrate compared to that of the instincts
strictly speaking the whole concept of intellectual causality is false
to reduce being a christian the state of christianity to an acceptance
of truth to a mere phenomenon of consciousness is to formulate the
negation of christianity in fact there are no christians the
christianhe who for two thousand years has passed as a christianis
simply a psychological selfdelusion closely examined it appears
that despite all his faith he has been ruled only by his
instinctsand what instinctsin all agesfor example in the case
of lutherfaith has been no more than a cloak a pretense a curtain
behind which the instincts have played their gamea shrewd blindness
to the domination of certain of the instincts i have already
called faith the specially christian form of shrewdnesspeople
always talk of their faith and act according to their
instincts in the world of ideas of the christian there is nothing
that so much as touches reality on the contrary one recognizes
an instinctive hatred of reality as the motive power the only motive
power at the bottom of christianity what follows therefrom that even
here in psychologicis there is a radical error which is to say one
conditioning fundamentals which is to say one in substance take
away one idea and put a genuine reality in its placeand the whole of
christianity crumbles to nothingnessviewed calmly this strangest of
all phenomena a religion not only depending on errors but inventive
and ingenious only in devising injurious errors poisonous to life
and to the heartthis remains a spectacle for the godsfor those
gods who are also philosophers and whom i have encountered for
example in the celebrated dialogues at naxos at the moment when their
disgust leaves them and us they will be thankful for the
spectacle afforded by the christians perhaps because of this curious
exhibition alone the wretched little planet called the earth deserves a
glance from omnipotence a show of divine interest therefore let us
not underestimate the christians the christian false to the point of
innocence is far above the apein its application to the christians a
wellknown theory of descent becomes a mere piece of politeness
14 so in the text one of nietzsches numerous coinages obviously
suggested by evangelium the german for gospel
40
the fate of the gospels was decided by deathit hung on the cross
it was only death that unexpected and shameful death it was only
the cross which was usually reserved for the canaille onlyit was only
this appalling paradox which brought the disciples face to face with the
real riddle who was it what was itthe feeling of dismay of
profound affront and injury the suspicion that such a death might
involve a refutation of their cause the terrible question why just
in this waythis state of mind is only too easy to understand here
everything must be accounted for as necessary everything must have a
meaning a reason the highest sort of reason the love of a disciple
excludes all chance only then did the chasm of doubt yawn who put
him to death who was his natural enemythis question flashed like a
lightningstroke answer dominant judaism its ruling class from that
moment one found ones self in revolt against the established order
and began to understand jesus as in revolt against the established
order until then this militant this naysaying naydoing element in
his character had been lacking what is more he had appeared to present
its opposite obviously the little community had not understood what
was precisely the most important thing of all the example offered by
this way of dying the freedom from and superiority to every feeling of
ressentimenta plain indication of how little he was understood at
all all that jesus could hope to accomplish by his death in itself
was to offer the strongest possible proof or example of his
teachings in the most public manner but his disciples were very far
from forgiving his deaththough to have done so would have accorded
with the gospels in the highest degree and neither were they prepared
to offer themselves with gentle and serene calmness of heart for a
similar death on the contrary it was precisely the most
unevangelical of feelings revenge that now possessed them it seemed
impossible that the cause should perish with his death recompense and
judgment became necessary yet what could be less evangelical than
recompense punishment and sitting in judgment once more the
popular belief in the coming of a messiah appeared in the foreground
attention was rivetted upon an historical moment the kingdom of god
is to come with judgment upon his enemies but in all this there was
a wholesale misunderstanding imagine the kingdom of god as a last
act as a mere promise the gospels had been in fact the incarnation
the fulfilment the realization of this kingdom of god it was only
now that all the familiar contempt for and bitterness against pharisees
and theologians began to appear in the character of the masterhe was
thereby turned into a pharisee and theologian himself on the other
hand the savage veneration of these completely unbalanced souls could
no longer endure the gospel doctrine taught by jesus of the equal
right of all men to be children of god their revenge took the form of
elevating jesus in an extravagant fashion and thus separating him
from themselves just as in earlier times the jews to revenge
themselves upon their enemies separated themselves from their god and
placed him on a great height the one god and the only son of god both
were products of ressentiment
41
and from that time onward an absurd problem offered itself how
could god allow it to which the deranged reason of the little
community formulated an answer that was terrifying in its absurdity god
gave his son as a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins at once there
was an end of the gospels sacrifice for sin and in its most obnoxious
and barbarous form sacrifice of the innocent for the sins of the
guilty what appalling paganismjesus himself had done away with the
very concept of guilt he denied that there was any gulf fixed between
god and man he lived this unity between god and man and that was
precisely his glad tidings and not as a mere privilegefrom
this time forward the type of the saviour was corrupted bit by bit by
the doctrine of judgment and of the second coming the doctrine of death
as a sacrifice the doctrine of the resurrection by means of which
the entire concept of blessedness the whole and only reality of the
gospels is juggled awayin favour of a state of existence after
death st paul with that rabbinical impudence which shows itself in
all his doings gave a logical quality to that conception that
indecent conception in this way if christ did not rise from the
dead then all our faith is in vainand at once there sprang from the
gospels the most contemptible of all unfulfillable promises the
shameless doctrine of personal immortality paul even preached it
as a reward
42
one now begins to see just what it was that came to an end with the
death on the cross a new and thoroughly original effort to found a
buddhistic peace movement and so establish happiness on earthreal
not merely promised for this remainsas i have already pointed
outthe essential difference between the two religions of dcadence
buddhism promises nothing but actually fulfils christianity promises
everything but fulfils nothinghard upon the heels of the glad
tidings came the worst imaginable those of paul in paul is incarnated
the very opposite of the bearer of glad tidings he represents the
genius for hatred the vision of hatred the relentless logic of hatred
what indeed has not this dysangelist sacrificed to hatred above
all the saviour he nailed him to his own cross the life the
example the teaching the death of christ the meaning and the law of
the whole gospelsnothing was left of all this after that counterfeiter
in hatred had reduced it to his uses surely not reality surely not
historical truth once more the priestly instinct of the jew
perpetrated the same old master crime against historyhe simply struck
out the yesterday and the day before yesterday of christianity and
invented his own history of christian beginnings going further he
treated the history of israel to another falsification so that it
became a mere prologue to his achievement all the prophets it now
appeared had referred to his saviour later on the church even
falsified the history of man in order to make it a prologue to
christianity the figure of the saviour his teaching his way of
life his death the meaning of his death even the consequences of his
deathnothing remained untouched nothing remained in even remote
contact with reality paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that
whole life to a place behind this existencein the lie of the
risen jesus at bottom he had no use for the life of the
saviourwhat he needed was the death on the cross and something
more to see anything honest in such a man as paul whose home was at
the centre of the stoical enlightenment when he converts an
hallucination into a proof of the resurrection of the saviour or even
to believe his tale that he suffered from this hallucination
himselfthis would be a genuine niaiserie in a psychologist paul
willed the end therefore he also willed the means what he himself
didnt believe was swallowed readily enough by the idiots among whom he
spread his teachingwhat he wanted was power in paul the priest
once more reached out for powerhe had use only for such concepts
teachings and symbols as served the purpose of tyrannizing over the
masses and organizing mobs what was the only part of christianity
that mohammed borrowed later on pauls invention his device for
establishing priestly tyranny and organizing the mob the belief in the
immortality of the soulthat is to say the doctrine of
judgment
43
when the centre of gravity of life is placed not in life itself but
in the beyondin nothingnessthen one has taken away its centre of
gravity altogether the vast lie of personal immortality destroys all
reason all natural instincthenceforth everything in the instincts
that is beneficial that fosters life and that safeguards the future is
a cause of suspicion so to live that life no longer has any meaning
this is now the meaning of life why be publicspirited why take
any pride in descent and forefathers why labour together trust one
another or concern ones self about the common welfare and try to
serve it merely so many temptations so many strayings from the
straight pathone thing only is necessary that every man
because he has an immortal soul is as good as every other man that
in an infinite universe of things the salvation of every individual
may lay claim to eternal importance that insignificant bigots and the
threefourths insane may assume that the laws of nature are constantly
suspended in their behalfit is impossible to lavish too much
contempt upon such a magnification of every sort of selfishness to
infinity to insolence and yet christianity has to thank precisely
this miserable flattery of personal vanity for its triumphit was
thus that it lured all the botched the dissatisfied the fallen upon
evil days the whole refuse and offscouring of humanity to its side
the salvation of the soulin plain english the world revolves
around me the poisonous doctrine equal rights for all has
been propagated as a christian principle out of the secret nooks and
crannies of bad instinct christianity has waged a deadly war upon all
feelings of reverence and distance between man and man which is to
say upon the first prerequisite to every step upward to every
development of civilizationout of the ressentiment of the masses it
has forged its chief weapons against us against everything noble
joyous and highspirited on earth against our happiness on earth to
allow immortality to every peter and paul was the greatest the most
vicious outrage upon noble humanity ever perpetratedand let us
not underestimate the fatal influence that christianity has had even
upon politics nowadays no one has courage any more for special rights
for the right of dominion for feelings of honourable pride in himself
and his equalsfor the pathos of distance our politics is sick
with this lack of couragethe aristocratic attitude of mind has been
undermined by the lie of the equality of souls and if belief in the
privileges of the majority makes and will continue to make
revolutionsit is christianity let us not doubt and christian
valuations which convert every revolution into a carnival of blood and
crime christianity is a revolt of all creatures that creep on the
ground against everything that is lofty the gospel of the lowly
lowers
44
the gospels are invaluable as evidence of the corruption that was
already persistent within the primitive community that which paul
with the cynical logic of a rabbi later developed to a conclusion was
at bottom merely a process of decay that had begun with the death of the
saviourthese gospels cannot be read too carefully difficulties lurk
behind every word i confessi hope it will not be held against
methat it is precisely for this reason that they offer firstrate joy
to a psychologistas the opposite of all merely nave corruption as
refinement par excellence as an artistic triumph in psychological
corruption the gospels in fact stand alone the bible as a whole is
not to be compared to them here we are among jews this is the first
thing to be borne in mind if we are not to lose the thread of the
matter this positive genius for conjuring up a delusion of personal
holiness unmatched anywhere else either in books or by men this
elevation of fraud in word and attitude to the level of an artall
this is not an accident due to the chance talents of an individual or
to any violation of nature the thing responsible is race the whole
of judaism appears in christianity as the art of concocting holy lies
and there after many centuries of earnest jewish training and hard
practice of jewish technic the business comes to the stage of mastery
the christian that ultima ratio of lying is the jew all over
againhe is threefold the jew the underlying will to make use
only of such concepts symbols and attitudes as fit into priestly
practice the instinctive repudiation of every other mode of thought
and every other method of estimating values and utilitiesthis is not
only tradition it is inheritance only as an inheritance is it able
to operate with the force of nature the whole of mankind even the best
minds of the best ages with one exception perhaps hardly human
have permitted themselves to be deceived the gospels have been read as
a book of innocence  surely no small indication of the high skill
with which the trick has been doneof course if we could actually
see these astounding bigots and bogus saints even if only for an
instant the farce would come to an endand it is precisely because
i cannot read a word of theirs without seeing their attitudinizing
that i have made an end of them i simply cannot endure the way
they have of rolling up their eyesfor the majority happily enough
books are mere literaturelet us not be led astray they say judge
not and yet they condemn to hell whoever stands in their way in
letting god sit in judgment they judge themselves in glorifying god
they glorify themselves in demanding that every one show the virtues
which they themselves happen to be capable ofstill more which they
must have in order to remain on topthey assume the grand air of men
struggling for virtue of men engaging in a war that virtue may prevail
we live we die we sacrifice ourselves for the good the truth
the light the kingdom of god in point of fact they simply do
what they cannot help doing forced like hypocrites to be sneaky to
hide in corners to slink along in the shadows they convert their
necessity into a duty it is on grounds of duty that they account for
their lives of humility and that humility becomes merely one more proof
of their piety ah that humble chaste charitable brand of fraud
virtue itself shall bear witness for us one may read the gospels
as books of moral seduction these petty folks fasten themselves to
moralitythey know the uses of morality morality is the best of all
devices for leading mankind by the nosethe fact is that the
conscious conceit of the chosen here disguises itself as modesty it is
in this way that they the community the good and just range
themselves once and for always on one side the side of the
truthand the rest of mankind the world on the other in that
we observe the most fatal sort of megalomania that the earth has ever
seen little abortions of bigots and liars began to claim exclusive
rights in the concepts of god the truth the light the spirit
love wisdom and life as if these things were synonyms of
themselves and thereby they sought to fence themselves off from the
world little superjews ripe for some sort of madhouse turned
values upside down in order to meet their notions just as if the
christian were the meaning the salt the standard and even the last
judgment of all the rest the whole disaster was only made possible
by the fact that there already existed in the world a similar
megalomania allied to this one in race to wit the jewish once a
chasm began to yawn between jews and judaeochristians the latter had
no choice but to employ the selfpreservative measures that the jewish
instinct had devised even against the jews themselves whereas the
jews had employed them only against nonjews the christian is simply a
jew of the reformed confession
45
i offer a few examples of the sort of thing these petty people have
got into their headswhat they have put into the mouth of the master
the unalloyed creed of beautiful souls
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart
thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them
verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha
in the day of judgment than for that city mark vi 11how
evangelical
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in
me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
and he were cast into the sea mark ix 42how evangelical
and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for
thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes
to be cast into hell fire where the worm dieth not and the fire is not
quenched mark ix 4715it is not exactly the eye that is
meant
15 to which without mentioning it nietzsche adds verse 48
verily i say unto you that there be some of them that stand here
which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of god
come with power mark ix 1well lied lion16
16 a paraphrase of demetrius well roard lion in act v scene 1
of a midsummer nights dream the lion of course is the familiar
christian symbol for mark
whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his
cross and follow me for note of a psychologist christian
morality is refuted by its fors its reasons are against itthis
makes it christian mark viii 34
judge not that ye be not judged with what measure ye mete it shall
be measured to you again matthew vii 117what a notion of
justice of a just judge
17 nietzsche also quotes part of verse 2
for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even
the publicans the same and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye
more than others do not even the publicans so matthew v
4618principle of christian love it insists upon being well
paid in the end
18 the quotation also includes verse 47
but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father
forgive your trespasses matthew vi 15very compromising for the
said father
but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all
these things shall be added unto you matthew vi 33all these
things namely food clothing all the necessities of life an error
to put it mildly a bit before this god appears as a tailor at least
in certain cases
rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is
great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the
prophets luke vi 23impudent rabble it compares itself to the
prophets
know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god
dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god
destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are paul
1 corinthians iii 1619for that sort of thing one cannot have
enough contempt
19 and 17
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world
shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters
paul 1 corinthians vi 2unfortunately not merely the speech of
a lunatic this frightful impostor then proceeds know ye not
that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this
life
hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in
the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by
the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe not many wise
men after the flesh not men mighty not many noble are called but
god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise
and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are
despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to
nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence
paul 1 corinthians i 20ff20in order to understand this
passage a firstrate example of the psychology underlying every
chandalamorality one should read the first part of my genealogy of
morals there for the first time the antagonism between a noble
morality and a morality born of ressentiment and impotent vengefulness
is exhibited paul was the greatest of all apostles of revenge
20 verses 20 21 26 27 28 29
46
what follows then that one had better put on gloves before reading
the new testament the presence of so much filth makes it very
advisable one would as little choose early christians for companions
as polish jews not that one need seek out an objection to them
neither has a pleasant smelli have searched the new testament in vain
for a single sympathetic touch nothing is there that is free kindly
openhearted or upright in it humanity does not even make the first
step upwardthe instinct for cleanliness is lacking only evil
instincts are there and there is not even the courage of these evil
instincts it is all cowardice it is all a shutting of the eyes a
selfdeception every other book becomes clean once one has read the
new testament for example immediately after reading paul i took up
with delight that most charming and wanton of scoffers petronius of
whom one may say what domenico boccaccio wrote of csar borgia to the
duke of parma  tutto festoimmortally healthy immortally
cheerful and sound these petty bigots make a capital miscalculation
they attack but everything they attack is thereby distinguished
whoever is attacked by an early christian is surely not befouled
on the contrary it is an honour to have an early christian as an
opponent one cannot read the new testament without acquired admiration
for whatever it abusesnot to speak of the wisdom of this world
which an impudent windbag tries to dispose of by the foolishness of
preaching even the scribes and pharisees are benefitted by such
opposition they must certainly have been worth something to have been
hated in such an indecent manner hypocrisyas if this were a charge
that the early christians dared to makeafter all they were the
privileged and that was enough the hatred of the chandala needed no
other excuse the early christianand also i fear the last
christian whom i may perhaps live to seeis a rebel against all
privilege by profound instincthe lives and makes war for ever for
equal rights strictly speaking he has no alternative when a man
proposes to represent in his own person the chosen of godor to be
a temple of god or a judge of the angelsthen every other
criterion whether based upon honesty upon intellect upon manliness
and pride or upon beauty and freedom of the heart becomes simply
worldlyevil in itself moral every word that comes from the
lips of an early christian is a lie and his every act is
instinctively dishonestall his values all his aims are noxious but
whoever he hates whatever he hates has real value the
christian and particularly the christian priest is thus a criterion
of values
must i add that in the whole new testament there appears but a
solitary figure worthy of honour pilate the roman viceroy to regard
a jewish imbroglio seriouslythat was quite beyond him one jew more
or lesswhat did it matter the noble scorn of a roman before whom
the word truth was shamelessly mishandled enriched the new testament
with the only saying that has any valueand that is at once its
criticism and its destruction what is truth
47
the thing that sets us apart is not that we are unable to find god
either in history or in nature or behind naturebut that we regard
what has been honoured as god not as divine but as pitiable as
absurd as injurious not as a mere error but as a crime against
life we deny that god is god if any one were to show us this
christian god wed be still less inclined to believe in himin a
formula deus qualem paulus creavit dei negatiosuch a religion as
christianity which does not touch reality at a single point and which
goes to pieces the moment reality asserts its rights at any point must
be inevitably the deadly enemy of the wisdom of this world which is
to say of scienceand it will give the name of good to whatever
means serve to poison calumniate and cry down all intellectual
discipline all lucidity and strictness in matters of intellectual
conscience and all noble coolness and freedom of the mind faith as
an imperative vetoes sciencein praxi lying at any price paul
well knew that lyingthat faithwas necessary later on the church
borrowed the fact from paulthe god that paul invented for himself a
god who reduced to absurdity the wisdom of this world especially
the two great enemies of superstition philology and medicine is in
truth only an indication of pauls resolute determination to
accomplish that very thing himself to give ones own will the name of
god thorathat is essentially jewish paul wants to dispose of the
wisdom of this world his enemies are the good philologians and
physicians of the alexandrine schoolon them he makes his war as a
matter of fact no man can be a philologian or a physician without
being also antichrist that is to say as a philologian a man sees
behind the holy books and as a physician he sees behind the
physiological degeneration of the typical christian the physician says
incurable the philologian says fraud
48
has any one ever clearly understood the celebrated story at the
beginning of the bibleof gods mortal terror of science no one
in fact has understood it this priestbook par excellence opens as
is fitting with the great inner difficulty of the priest he faces
only one great danger ergo god faces only one great danger
the old god wholly spirit wholly the highpriest wholly perfect is
promenading his garden he is bored and trying to kill time against
boredom even gods struggle in vain21 what does he do he creates
manman is entertaining but then he notices that man is also bored
gods pity for the only form of distress that invades all paradises
knows no bounds so he forthwith creates other animals gods first
mistake to man these other animals were not entertaininghe sought
dominion over them he did not want to be an animal himselfso god
created woman in the act he brought boredom to an endand also many
other things woman was the second mistake of godwoman at bottom
is a serpent hevaevery priest knows that from woman comes every
evil in the worldevery priest knows that too ergo she is also to
blame for science it was through woman that man learned to taste
of the tree of knowledgewhat happened the old god was seized by
mortal terror man himself had been his greatest blunder he had
created a rival to himself science makes men godlikeit is all up
with priests and gods when man becomes scientificmoral science is
the forbidden per se it alone is forbidden science is the first of
sins the germ of all sins the original sin this is all there is of
moralitythou shall not knowthe rest follows from thatgods
mortal terror however did not hinder him from being shrewd how is one
to protect ones self against science for a long while this was the
capital problem answer out of paradise with man happiness leisure
foster thoughtand all thoughts are bad thoughtsman must not
thinkand so the priest invents distress death the mortal dangers of
childbirth all sorts of misery old age decrepitude above all
sicknessnothing but devices for making war on science the troubles
of man dont allow him to think neverthelesshow terrible the
edifice of knowledge begins to tower aloft invading heaven shadowing
the godswhat is to be donethe old god invents war he separates
the peoples he makes men destroy one another the priests have always
had need of war waramong other things a great disturber of
scienceincredible knowledge deliverance from the priests
prospers in spite of warso the old god comes to his final resolution
man has become scientificthere is no help for it he must be
drowned
21 a paraphrase of schillers against stupidity even gods struggle in
vain
49
i have been understood at the opening of the bible there is the
whole psychology of the priestthe priest knows of only one great
danger that is sciencethe sound comprehension of cause and effect
but science flourishes on the whole only under favourable
conditionsa man must have time he must have an overflowing
intellect in order to know therefore man must be made
unhappythis has been in all ages the logic of the priestit is
easy to see just what by this logic was the first thing to come into
the worldsin the concept of guilt and punishment the whole
moral order of the world was set up against scienceagainst the
deliverance of man from priests man must not look outward he must
look inward he must not look at things shrewdly and cautiously to
learn about them he must not look at all he must suffer and he
must suffer so much that he is always in need of the priestaway with
physicians what is needed is a saviourthe concept of guilt and
punishment including the doctrines of grace of salvation of
forgivenesslies through and through and absolutely without
psychological realitywere devised to destroy mans sense of
causality they are an attack upon the concept of cause and
effectand not an attack with the fist with the knife with honesty
in hate and love on the contrary one inspired by the most cowardly
the most crafty the most ignoble of instincts an attack of priests
an attack of parasites the vampirism of pale subterranean
leeches when the natural consequences of an act are no longer
natural but are regarded as produced by the ghostly creations of
superstitionby god by spirits by soulsand reckoned as merely
moral consequences as rewards as punishments as hints as lessons
then the whole groundwork of knowledge is destroyedthen the greatest
of crimes against humanity has been perpetratedi repeat that sin
mans selfdesecration par excellence was invented in order to make
science culture and every elevation and ennobling of man impossible
the priest rules through the invention of sin

in this place i cant permit myself to omit a psychology of belief
of the believer for the special benefit of believers if there
remain any today who do not yet know how indecent it is to be
believingor how much a sign of dcadence of a broken will to
livethen they will know it well enough tomorrow my voice reaches even
the deafit appears unless i have been incorrectly informed that
there prevails among christians a sort of criterion of truth that is
called proof by power faith makes blessed therefore it is
trueit might be objected right here that blessedness is not
demonstrated it is merely promised it hangs upon faith as a
conditionone shall be blessed because one believes but what of
the thing that the priest promises to the believer the wholly
transcendental beyondhow is that to be demonstratedthe proof
by power thus assumed is actually no more at bottom than a belief
that the effects which faith promises will not fail to appear in a
formula i believe that faith makes for blessednesstherefore it is
true but this is as far as we may go this therefore would be
absurdum itself as a criterion of truthbut let us admit for the
sake of politeness that blessedness by faith may be demonstrated
not merely hoped for and not merely promised by the suspicious
lips of a priest even so could blessednessin a technical term
pleasureever be a proof of truth so little is this true that it is
almost a proof against truth when sensations of pleasure influence the
answer to the question what is true or at all events it is enough
to make that truth highly suspicious the proof by pleasure is a
proof of pleasurenothing more why in the world should it be
assumed that true judgments give more pleasure than false ones and
that in conformity to some preestablished harmony they necessarily
bring agreeable feelings in their trainthe experience of all
disciplined and profound minds teaches the contrary man has had to
fight for every atom of the truth and has had to pay for it almost
everything that the heart that human love that human trust cling to
greatness of soul is needed for this business the service of truth is
the hardest of all serviceswhat then is the meaning of integrity
in things intellectual it means that a man must be severe with his own
heart that he must scorn beautiful feelings and that he makes every
yea and nay a matter of consciencefaith makes blessed therefore
it lies
51
the fact that faith under certain circumstances may work for
blessedness but that this blessedness produced by an ide fixe by no
means makes the idea itself true and the fact that faith actually moves
no mountains but instead raises them up where there were none before
all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a lunatic
asylum not of course to a priest for his instincts prompt him to
the lie that sickness is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic
asylums christianity finds sickness necessary just as the greek
spirit had need of a superabundance of healththe actual ulterior
purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to make
people ill and the church itselfdoesnt it set up a catholic lunatic
asylum as the ultimate idealthe whole earth as a madhousethe sort
of religious man that the church wants is a typical dcadent the
moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked
by epidemics of nervous disorder the inner world of the religious man
is so much like the inner world of the overstrung and exhausted that
it is difficult to distinguish between them the highest states of
mind held up before mankind by christianity as of supreme worth are
actually epileptoid in formthe church has granted the name of holy
only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds in majorem dei honorem once
i ventured to designate the whole christian system of training22 in
penance and salvation now best studied in england as a method of
producing a folie circulaire upon a soil already prepared for it
which is to say a soil thoroughly unhealthy not every one may be a
christian one is not converted to christianityone must first
be sick enough for it we others who have the courage for health
and likewise for contemptwe may well despise a religion that
teaches misunderstanding of the body that refuses to rid itself of the
superstition about the soul that makes a virtue of insufficient
nourishment that combats health as a sort of enemy devil temptation
that persuades itself that it is possible to carry about a perfect
soul in a cadaver of a body and that to this end had to devise for
itself a new concept of perfection a pale sickly idiotically
ecstatic state of existence socalled holinessa holiness that is
itself merely a series of symptoms of an impoverished enervated and
incurably disordered body the christian movement as a european
movement was from the start no more than a general uprising of all
sorts of outcast and refuse elements who now under cover of
christianity aspire to power it does not represent the decay of a
race it represents on the contrary a conglomeration of dcadence
products from all directions crowding together and seeking one another
out it was not as has been thought the corruption of antiquity of
noble antiquity which made christianity possible one cannot too
sharply challenge the learned imbecility which today maintains that
theory at the time when the sick and rotten chandala classes in the
whole imperium were christianized the contrary type the nobility
reached its finest and ripest development the majority became master
democracy with its christian instincts triumphed christianity
was not national it was not based on raceit appealed to all the
varieties of men disinherited by life it had its allies everywhere
christianity has the rancour of the sick at its very corethe instinct
against the healthy against health everything that is
wellconstituted proud gallant and above all beautiful gives offence
to its ears and eyes again i remind you of pauls priceless saying
and god hath chosen the weak things of the world the foolish
things of the world the base things of the world and things which
are despised23 this was the formula in hoc signo the
dcadence triumphedgod on the crossis man always to miss the
frightful inner significance of this symboleverything that suffers
everything that hangs on the cross is divine we all hang on the
cross consequently we are divine we alone are divine
christianity was thus a victory a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed
by itchristianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of
humanity
22 the word training is in english in the text
23 1 corinthians i 27 28
52
christianity also stands in opposition to all intellectual
wellbeingsick reasoning is the only sort that it can use as
christian reasoning it takes the side of everything that is idiotic it
pronounces a curse upon intellect upon the superbia of the healthy
intellect since sickness is inherent in christianity it follows that
the typically christian state of faith must be a form of sickness
too and that all straight straightforward and scientific paths to
knowledge must be banned by the church as forbidden ways doubt is
thus a sin from the start the complete lack of psychological
cleanliness in the priestrevealed by a glance at himis a phenomenon
resulting from dcadenceone may observe in hysterical women and
in rachitic children how regularly the falsification of instincts
delight in lying for the mere sake of lying and incapacity for looking
straight and walking straight are symptoms of dcadence faith
means the will to avoid knowing what is true the pietist the priest of
either sex is a fraud because he is sick his instinct demands that
the truth shall never be allowed its rights on any point whatever
makes for illness is good whatever issues from abundance from
superabundance from power is evil so argues the believer the
impulse to lieit is by this that i recognize every foreordained
theologiananother characteristic of the theologian is his unfitness
for philology what i here mean by philology is in a general sense
the art of reading with profitthe capacity for absorbing facts
without interpreting them falsely and without losing caution
patience and subtlety in the effort to understand them philology as
ephexis24 in interpretation whether one be dealing with books with
newspaper reports with the most fateful events or with weather
statisticsnot to mention the salvation of the soul the way in
which a theologian whether in berlin or in rome is ready to explain
say a passage of scripture or an experience or a victory by the
national army by turning upon it the high illumination of the psalms of
david is always so daring that it is enough to make a philologian run
up a wall but what shall he do when pietists and other such cows from
suabia25 use the finger of god to convert their miserably
commonplace and huggermugger existence into a miracle of grace a
providence and an experience of salvation the most modest exercise
of the intellect not to say of decency should certainly be enough to
convince these interpreters of the perfect childishness and unworthiness
of such a misuse of the divine digital dexterity however small our
piety if we ever encountered a god who always cured us of a cold in the
head at just the right time or got us into our carriage at the very
instant heavy rain began to fall he would seem so absurd a god that
hed have to be abolished even if he existed god as a domestic servant
as a letter carrier as an almanacmanat bottom he is a mere name for
the stupidest sort of chance divine providence which every third
man in educated germany still believes in is so strong an argument
against god that it would be impossible to think of a stronger and in
any case it is an argument against germans
24 that is to say scepticism among the greeks scepticism was also
occasionally called ephecticism

biblical criticism the leader of this school was f c baur and one of
the men greatly influenced by it was nietzsches pet abomination david

it is so little true that martyrs offer any support to the truth of
a cause that i am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything
to do with the truth at all in the very tone in which a martyr flings
what he fancies to be true at the head of the world there appears so low
a grade of intellectual honesty and such insensibility to the problem
of truth that it is never necessary to refute him truth is not
something that one man has and another man has not at best only
peasants or peasantapostles like luther can think of truth in any
such way one may rest assured that the greater the degree of a mans
intellectual conscience the greater will be his modesty his
discretion on this point to know in five cases and to refuse
with delicacy to know anything further truth as the word is
understood by every prophet every sectarian every freethinker every
socialist and every churchman is simply a complete proof that not even
a beginning has been made in the intellectual discipline and
selfcontrol that are necessary to the unearthing of even the smallest
truththe deaths of the martyrs it may be said in passing have been
misfortunes of history they have misled the conclusion that all
idiots women and plebeians come to that there must be something in a
cause for which any one goes to his death or which as under primitive
christianity sets off epidemics of deathseekingthis conclusion has
been an unspeakable drag upon the testing of facts upon the whole
spirit of inquiry and investigation the martyrs have damaged the
truth even to this day the crude fact of persecution is enough to
give an honourable name to the most empty sort of sectarianismbut
why is the worth of a cause altered by the fact that some one had laid
down his life for itan error that becomes honourable is simply an
error that has acquired one seductive charm the more do you suppose
messrs theologians that we shall give you the chance to be martyred
for your liesone best disposes of a cause by respectfully putting it
on icethat is also the best way to dispose of theologians this was
precisely the worldhistorical stupidity of all the persecutors that
they gave the appearance of honour to the cause they opposedthat they
made it a present of the fascination of martyrdom women are still on
their knees before an error because they have been told that some one
died on the cross for it is the cross then an argumentbut about
all these things there is one and one only who has said what has been
needed for thousands of yearszarathustra
     they made signs in blood along the way that they went and their
     folly taught them that the truth is proved by blood
     but blood is the worst of all testimonies to the truth blood
     poisoneth even the purest teaching and turneth it into madness and
     hatred in the heart
     and when one goeth through fire for his teachingwhat doth that
     prove verily it is more when ones teaching cometh out of ones
     own burning26
26 the quotations are from also sprach zarathustra ii 24 of
priests

do not let yourself be deceived great intellects are sceptical
zarathustra is a sceptic the strength the freedom which proceed from
intellectual power from a superabundance of intellectual power
manifest themselves as scepticism men of fixed convictions do not
count when it comes to determining what is fundamental in values and
lack of values men of convictions are prisoners they do not see far
enough they do not see what is below them whereas a man who would
talk to any purpose about value and nonvalue must be able to see five
hundred convictions beneath himand behind him a mind that
aspires to great things and that wills the means thereto is
necessarily sceptical freedom from any sort of conviction belongs to
strength and to an independent point of view that grand passion
which is at once the foundation and the power of a sceptics existence
and is both more enlightened and more despotic than he is himself
drafts the whole of his intellect into its service it makes him
unscrupulous it gives him courage to employ unholy means under certain
circumstances it does not begrudge him even convictions conviction as
a means one may achieve a good deal by means of a conviction a grand
passion makes use of and uses up convictions it does not yield to
themit knows itself to be sovereignon the contrary the need of
faith of something unconditioned by yea or nay of carlylism if i may
be allowed the word is a need of weakness the man of faith the
believer of any sort is necessarily a dependent mansuch a man
cannot posit himself as a goal nor can he find goals within himself
the believer does not belong to himself he can only be a means to an
end he must be used up he needs some one to use him up his instinct
gives the highest honours to an ethic of selfeffacement he is prompted
to embrace it by everything his prudence his experience his vanity
every sort of faith is in itself an evidence of selfeffacement of
selfestrangement when one reflects how necessary it is to the great
majority that there be regulations to restrain them from without and
hold them fast and to what extent control or in a higher sense
slavery is the one and only condition which makes for the wellbeing
of the weakwilled man and especially woman then one at once
understands conviction and faith to the man with convictions they are
his backbone to avoid seeing many things to be impartial about
nothing to be a party man through and through to estimate all values
strictly and infalliblythese are conditions necessary to the existence
of such a man but by the same token they are antagonists of the
truthful manof the truth the believer is not free to answer the
question true or not true according to the dictates of his own
conscience integrity on this point would work his instant downfall
the pathological limitations of his vision turn the man of convictions
into a fanaticsavonarola luther rousseau robespierre
saintsimonthese types stand in opposition to the strong
emancipated spirit but the grandiose attitudes of these sick
intellects these intellectual epileptics are of influence upon the
great massesfanatics are picturesque and mankind prefers observing
poses to listening to reasons
55
one step further in the psychology of conviction of faith it is
now a good while since i first proposed for consideration the question
whether convictions are not even more dangerous enemies to truth than
lies human alltoohuman i aphorism 48327 this time i desire
to put the question definitely is there any actual difference between
a lie and a convictionall the world believes that there is but what
is not believed by all the worldevery conviction has its history its
primitive forms its stage of tentativeness and error it becomes a
conviction only after having been for a long time not one and then
for an even longer time hardly one what if falsehood be also one of
these embryonic forms of convictionsometimes all that is needed is a
change in persons what was a lie in the father becomes a conviction in
the soni call it lying to refuse to see what one sees or to refuse
to see it as it is whether the lie be uttered before witnesses or not
before witnesses is of no consequence the most common sort of lie is
that by which a man deceives himself the deception of others is a
relatively rare offencenow this will not to see what one sees
this will not to see it as it is is almost the first requisite for
all who belong to a party of whatever sort the party man becomes
inevitably a liar for example the german historians are convinced that
rome was synonymous with despotism and that the germanic peoples brought
the spirit of liberty into the world what is the difference between
this conviction and a lie is it to be wondered at that all partisans
including the german historians instinctively roll the fine phrases of
morality upon their tonguesthat morality almost owes its very
survival to the fact that the party man of every sort has need of it
every momentthis is our conviction we publish it to the whole
world we live and die for itlet us respect all who have
convictionsi have actually heard such sentiments from the mouths of
antisemites on the contrary gentlemen an antisemite surely does not
become more respectable because he lies on principle the priests
who have more finesse in such matters and who well understand the
objection that lies against the notion of a conviction which is to say
of a falsehood that becomes a matter of principle because it serves a
purpose have borrowed from the jews the shrewd device of sneaking in
the concepts god the will of god and the revelation of god at
this place kant too with his categorical imperative was on the same
road this was his practical reason28 there are questions regarding
the truth or untruth of which it is not for man to decide all the
capital questions all the capital problems of valuation are beyond
human reason to know the limits of reasonthat alone is genuine
philosophy why did god make a revelation to man would god have done
anything superfluous man could not find out for himself what was good
and what was evil so god taught him his will moral the priest does
not liethe question true or untrue has nothing to do with such
things as the priest discusses it is impossible to lie about these
things in order to lie here it would be necessary to know what is
true but this is more than man can know therefore the priest is
simply the mouthpiece of godsuch a priestly syllogism
is by no means merely jewish and christian the right to lie and the
shrewd dodge of revelation belong to the general priestly typeto
the priest of the dcadence as well as to the priest of pagan times
pagans are all those who say yes to life and to whom god is a word
signifying acquiescence in all thingsthe law the will of god
the holy book and inspirationall these things are merely words
for the conditions under which the priest comes to power and with
which he maintains his powerthese concepts are to be found at the
bottom of all priestly organizations and of all priestly or
priestlyphilosophical schemes of governments the holy liecommon
alike to confucius to the code of manu to mohammed and to the
christian churchis not even wanting in plato truth is here this
means no matter where it is heard the priest lies
27 the aphorism which is headed the enemies of truth makes the
direct statement convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than
lies
28 a reference of course to kants kritik der praktischen vernunft
critique of practical reason
56
in the last analysis it comes to this what is the end of lying the
fact that in christianity holy ends are not visible is my
objection to the means it employs only bad ends appear the
poisoning the calumniation the denial of life the despising of the
body the degradation and selfcontamination of man by the concept of
sintherefore its means are also badi have a contrary feeling
when i read the code of manu an incomparably more intellectual and
superior work which it would be a sin against the intelligence to so
much as name in the same breath with the bible it is easy to see why
there is a genuine philosophy behind it in it not merely an
evilsmelling mess of jewish rabbinism and superstitionit gives even
the most fastidious psychologist something to sink his teeth into and
not to forget what is most important it differs fundamentally from
every kind of bible by means of it the nobles the philosophers and
the warriors keep the whiphand over the majority it is full of noble
valuations it shows a feeling of perfection an acceptance of life and
triumphant feeling toward self and lifethe sun shines upon the whole
bookall the things on which christianity vents its fathomless
vulgarityfor example procreation women and marriageare here
handled earnestly with reverence and with love and confidence how can
any one really put into the hands of children and ladies a book which
contains such vile things as this to avoid fornication let every man
have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband  it is
better to marry than to burn29 and is it possible to be a
christian so long as the origin of man is christianized which is to
say befouled by the doctrine of the immaculata conceptio i
know of no book in which so many delicate and kindly things are said of
women as in the code of manu these old greybeards and saints have a
way of being gallant to women that it would be impossible perhaps to
surpass the mouth of a woman it says in one place the breasts of a
maiden the prayer of a child and the smoke of sacrifice are always
pure in another place there is nothing purer than the light of the
sun the shadow cast by a cow air water fire and the breath of a
maiden finally in still another placeperhaps this is also a holy
lie all the orifices of the body above the navel are pure and all
below are impure only in the maiden is the whole body pure

one catches the unholiness of christian means in flagranti by the
simple process of putting the ends sought by christianity beside the
ends sought by the code of manuby putting these enormously
antithetical ends under a strong light the critic of christianity
cannot evade the necessity of making christianity contemptiblea
book of laws such as the code of manu has the same origin as every other
good lawbook it epitomizes the experience the sagacity and the
ethical experimentation of long centuries it brings things to a
conclusion it no longer creates the prerequisite to a codification of
this sort is recognition of the fact that the means which establish the
authority of a slowly and painfully attained truth are fundamentally
different from those which one would make use of to prove it a lawbook
never recites the utility the grounds the casuistical antecedents of a
law for if it did so it would lose the imperative tone the thou
shall on which obedience is based the problem lies exactly hereat
a certain point in the evolution of a people the class within it of the
greatest insight which is to say the greatest hindsight and foresight
declares that the series of experiences determining how all shall
liveor can livehas come to an end the object now is to reap as
rich and as complete a harvest as possible from the days of experiment
and hard experience in consequence the thing that is to be avoided
above everything is further experimentationthe continuation of the
state in which values are fluent and are tested chosen and criticized
ad infinitum against this a double wall is set up on the one hand
revelation which is the assumption that the reasons lying behind the
laws are not of human origin that they were not sought out and
found by a slow process and after many errors but that they are of
divine ancestry and came into being complete perfect without a
history as a free gift a miracle and on the other hand
tradition which is the assumption that the law has stood unchanged
from time immemorial and that it is impious and a crime against ones
forefathers to bring it into question the authority of the law is thus
grounded on the thesis god gave it and the fathers lived itthe
higher motive of such procedure lies in the design to distract
consciousness step by step from its concern with notions of right
living that is to say those that have been proved to be right by
wide and carefully considered experience so that instinct attains to a
perfect automatisma primary necessity to every sort of mastery to
every sort of perfection in the art of life to draw up such a lawbook
as manus means to lay before a people the possibility of future
mastery of attainable perfectionit permits them to aspire to the
highest reaches of the art of life to that end the thing must be made
unconscious that is the aim of every holy liethe order of castes
the highest the dominating law is merely the ratification of an order
of nature of a natural law of the first rank over which no arbitrary
fiat no modern idea can exert any influence in every healthy
society there are three physiological types gravitating toward
differentiation but mutually conditioning one another and each of these
has its own hygiene its own sphere of work its own special mastery and
feeling of perfection it is not manu but nature that sets off in one
class those who are chiefly intellectual in another those who are
marked by muscular strength and temperament and in a third those who
are distinguished in neither one way or the other but show only
mediocritythe lastnamed represents the great majority and the first
two the select the superior castei call it the fewesthas as the
most perfect the privileges of the few it stands for happiness for
beauty for everything good upon earth only the most intellectual of
men have any right to beauty to the beautiful only in them can
goodness escape being weakness pulchrum est paucorum hominum30
goodness is a privilege nothing could be more unbecoming to them than
uncouth manners or a pessimistic look or an eye that sees
uglinessor indignation against the general aspect of things
indignation is the privilege of the chandala so is pessimism the
world is perfectso prompts the instinct of the intellectual the
instinct of the man who says yes to life imperfection whatever is
inferior to us distance the pathos of distance even the chandala
themselves are parts of this perfection the most intelligent men like
the strongest find their happiness where others would find only
disaster in the labyrinth in being hard with themselves and with
others in effort their delight is in selfmastery in them asceticism
becomes second nature a necessity an instinct they regard a difficult
task as a privilege it is to them a recreation to play with burdens
that would crush all others knowledgea form of asceticismthey
are the most honourable kind of men but that does not prevent them
being the most cheerful and most amiable they rule not because they
want to but because they are they are not at liberty to play
secondthe second caste to this belong the guardians of the law
the keepers of order and security the more noble warriors above all
the king as the highest form of warrior judge and preserver of the law
the second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals
the next to them in rank taking from them all that is rough in the
business of rulingtheir followers their right hand their most apt
disciplesin all this i repeat there is nothing arbitrary nothing
made up whatever is to the contrary is made upby it nature is
brought to shame the order of castes the order of rank simply
formulates the supreme law of life itself the separation of the three
types is necessary to the maintenance of society and to the evolution
of higher types and the highest typesthe inequality of rights is
essential to the existence of any rights at alla right is a
privilege every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of
existence let us not underestimate the privileges of the mediocre
life is always harder as one mounts the heightsthe cold increases
responsibility increases a high civilization is a pyramid it can stand
only on a broad base its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly
consolidated mediocrity the handicrafts commerce agriculture
science the greater part of art in brief the whole range of
occupational activities are compatible only with mediocre ability and
aspiration such callings would be out of place for exceptional men the
instincts which belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as
to anarchism the fact that a man is publicly useful that he is a
wheel a function is evidence of a natural predisposition it is not
society but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable
of that makes them intelligent machines to the mediocre mediocrity is
a form of happiness they have a natural instinct for mastering one
thing for specialization it would be altogether unworthy of a profound
intellect to see anything objectionable in mediocrity in itself it is
in fact the first prerequisite to the appearance of the exceptional
it is a necessary condition to a high degree of civilization when the
exceptional man handles the mediocre man with more delicate fingers than
he applies to himself or to his equals this is not merely kindness of
heartit is simply his duty whom do i hate most heartily among
the rabbles of today the rabble of socialists the apostles to the
chandala who undermine the workingmans instincts his pleasure his
feeling of contentment with his petty existencewho make him envious
and teach him revenge wrong never lies in unequal rights it lies in
the assertion of equal rights what is bad but i have already
answered all that proceeds from weakness from envy from
revengethe anarchist and the christian have the same ancestry
30 few men are noble
58
in point of fact the end for which one lies makes a great difference
whether one preserves thereby or destroys there is a perfect likeness
between christian and anarchist their object their instinct points
only toward destruction one need only turn to history for a proof of
this there it appears with appalling distinctness we have just studied
a code of religious legislation whose object it was to convert the
conditions which cause life to flourish into an eternal social
organizationchristianity found its mission in putting an end to such
an organization because life flourished under it there the benefits
that reason had produced during long ages of experiment and insecurity
were applied to the most remote uses and an effort was made to bring in
a harvest that should be as large as rich and as complete as possible
here on the contrary the harvest is blighted overnight that
which stood there aere perennis the imperium romanum the most
magnificent form of organization under difficult conditions that has
ever been achieved and compared to which everything before it and after
it appears as patchwork bungling dilletantismthose holy anarchists
made it a matter of piety to destroy the world which is to say
the imperium romanum so that in the end not a stone stood upon
anotherand even germans and other such louts were able to become its
masters the christian and the anarchist both are dcadents both
are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating poisonous
degenerating bloodsucking both have an instinct of mortal hatred
of everything that stands up and is great and has durability and
promises life a future christianity was the vampire of the imperium
romanumovernight it destroyed the vast achievement of the romans
the conquest of the soil for a great culture that could await its
time can it be that this fact is not yet understood the imperium
romanum that we know and that the history of the roman provinces
teaches us to know better and betterthis most admirable of all works
of art in the grand manner was merely the beginning and the structure
to follow was not to prove its worth for thousands of years to this
day nothing on a like scale sub specie aeterni has been brought into
being or even dreamed ofthis organization was strong enough to
withstand bad emperors the accident of personality has nothing to do
with such thingsthe first principle of all genuinely great
architecture but it was not strong enough to stand up against the
corruptest of all forms of corruptionagainst christians these
stealthy worms which under the cover of night mist and duplicity
crept upon every individual sucking him dry of all earnest interest in
real things of all instinct for realitythis cowardly effeminate
and sugarcoated gang gradually alienated all souls step by step
from that colossal edifice turning against it all the meritorious
manly and noble natures that had found in the cause of rome their own
cause their own serious purpose their own pride the sneakishness of
hypocrisy the secrecy of the conventicle concepts as black as hell
such as the sacrifice of the innocent the unio mystica in the
drinking of blood above all the slowly rekindled fire of revenge of
chandala revengeall that sort of thing became master of rome the
same kind of religion which in a preexistent form epicurus had
combatted one has but to read lucretius to know what epicurus made
war uponnot paganism but christianity which is to say the
corruption of souls by means of the concepts of guilt punishment and
immortalityhe combatted the subterranean cults the whole of latent
christianityto deny immortality was already a form of genuine
salvationepicurus had triumphed and every respectable intellect in
rome was epicureanwhen paul appeared  paul the chandala hatred
of rome of the world in the flesh and inspired by geniusthe jew
the eternal jew par excellence what he saw was how with the aid
of the small sectarian christian movement that stood apart from judaism
a world conflagration might be kindled how with the symbol of god
on the cross all secret seditions all the fruits of anarchistic
intrigues in the empire might be amalgamated into one immense power
salvation is of the jewschristianity is the formula for exceeding
and summing up the subterranean cults of all varieties that of
osiris that of the great mother that of mithras for instance in his
discernment of this fact the genius of paul showed itself his instinct
was here so sure that with reckless violence to the truth he put the
ideas which lent fascination to every sort of chandala religion into the
mouth of the saviour as his own inventions and not only into the
mouthhe made out of him something that even a priest of mithras
could understand this was his revelation at damascus he grasped the
fact that he needed the belief in immortality in order to rob the
world of its value that the concept of hell would master romethat
the notion of a beyond is the death of life nihilist and
christian they rhyme in german and they do more than rhyme

the whole labour of the ancient world gone for naught i have no word
to describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in meand
considering the fact that its labour was merely preparatory that with
adamantine selfconsciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to
go on for thousands of years the whole meaning of antiquity
disappears to what end the greeks to what end the romansall the
prerequisites to a learned culture all the methods of science were
already there man had already perfected the great and incomparable art
of reading profitablythat first necessity to the tradition of
culture the unity of the sciences the natural sciences in alliance
with mathematics and mechanics were on the right roadthe sense of
fact the last and more valuable of all the senses had its schools
and its traditions were already centuries old is all this properly
understood every essential to the beginning of the work was
readyand the most essential it cannot be said too often are
methods and also the most difficult to develop and the longest opposed
by habit and laziness what we have today reconquered with unspeakable
selfdiscipline for ourselvesfor certain bad instincts certain
christian instincts still lurk in our bodiesthat is to say the keen
eye for reality the cautious hand patience and seriousness in the
smallest things the whole integrity of knowledgeall these things
were already there and had been there for two thousand years more
there was also a refined and excellent tact and taste not as mere
braindrilling not as german culture with its loutish manners but
as body as bearing as instinctin short as reality all gone for
naught overnight it became merely a memorythe greeks the romans
instinctive nobility taste methodical inquiry genius for organization
and administration faith in and the will to secure the future of man
a great yes to everything entering into the imperium romanum and
palpable to all the senses a grand style that was beyond mere art but
had become reality truth lifeall overwhelmed in a night but
not by a convulsion of nature not trampled to death by teutons and
others of heavy hoof but brought to shame by crafty sneaking
invisible anmic vampires not conqueredonly sucked dry hidden
vengefulness petty envy became master everything wretched
intrinsically ailing and invaded by bad feelings the whole
ghettoworld of the soul was at once on topone needs but read
any of the christian agitators for example st augustine in order to
realize in order to smell what filthy fellows came to the top it
would be an error however to assume that there was any lack of
understanding in the leaders of the christian movementah but they
were clever clever to the point of holiness these fathers of the
church what they lacked was something quite different nature
neglectedperhaps forgotto give them even the most modest endowment
of respectable of upright of cleanly instincts between
ourselves they are not even men if islam despises christianity it
has a thousandfold right to do so islam at least assumes that it is
dealing with men

christianity destroyed for us the whole harvest of ancient civilization
and later it also destroyed for us the whole harvest of mohammedan
civilization the wonderful culture of the moors in spain which was
fundamentally nearer to us and appealed more to our senses and tastes
than that of rome and greece was trampled down i do not say by
what sort of feet why because it had to thank noble and manly
instincts for its originbecause it said yes to life even to the rare
and refined luxuriousness of moorish life the crusaders later made
war on something before which it would have been more fitting for them
to have grovelled in the dusta civilization beside which even that of
our nineteenth century seems very poor and very senilewhat they
wanted of course was booty the orient was rich let us put aside
our prejudices the crusades were a higher form of piracy nothing more
the german nobility which is fundamentally a viking nobility was in
its element there the church knew only too well how the german nobility
was to be won the german noble always the swiss guard of the
church always in the service of every bad instinct of the churchbut
well paid consider the fact that it is precisely the aid of german
swords and german blood and valour that has enabled the church to carry
through its war to the death upon everything noble on earth at this
point a host of painful questions suggest themselves the german
nobility stands outside the history of the higher civilization the
reason is obvious christianity alcoholthe two great means of
corruption intrinsically there should be no more choice between
islam and christianity than there is between an arab and a jew the
decision is already reached nobody remains at liberty to choose here
either a man is a chandala or he is not war to the knife with rome
peace and friendship with islam this was the feeling this was the
act of that great free spirit that genius among german emperors
frederick ii what must a german first be a genius a free spirit
before he can feel decently i cant make out how a german could ever
feel christian

here it becomes necessary to call up a memory that must be a hundred
times more painful to germans the germans have destroyed for europe the
last great harvest of civilization that europe was ever to reapthe
renaissance is it understood at last will it ever be understood
what the renaissance was the transvaluation of christian
valuesan attempt with all available means all instincts and all the
resources of genius to bring about a triumph of the opposite values
the more noble values this has been the one great war of the past
there has never been a more critical question than that of the
renaissanceit is my question too there has never been a form of
attack more fundamental more direct or more violently delivered by a
whole front upon the center of the enemy to attack at the critical
place at the very seat of christianity and there enthrone the more
noble valuesthat is to say to insinuate them into the instincts
into the most fundamental needs and appetites of those sitting there 
i see before me the possibility of a perfectly heavenly enchantment
and spectacleit seems to me to scintillate with all the vibrations of
a fine and delicate beauty and within it there is an art so divine so
infernally divine that one might search in vain for thousands of years
for another such possibility i see a spectacle so rich in significance
and at the same time so wonderfully full of paradox that it should
arouse all the gods on olympus to immortal laughtercsar borgia as
pope am i understood well then that would have been the
sort of triumph that i alone am longing for today by it
christianity would have been swept awaywhat happened a german
monk luther came to rome this monk with all the vengeful instincts
of an unsuccessful priest in him raised a rebellion against the
renaissance in rome instead of grasping with profound thanksgiving
the miracle that had taken place the conquest of christianity at its
capitalinstead of this his hatred was stimulated by the spectacle
a religious man thinks only of himselfluther saw only the depravity
of the papacy at the very moment when the opposite was becoming
apparent the old corruption the peccatum originale christianity
itself no longer occupied the papal chair instead there was life
instead there was the triumph of life instead there was a great yea to
all lofty beautiful and daring things and luther restored the
church he attacked it the renaissancean event without meaning a
great futilityah these germans what they have not cost us
futilitythat has always been the work of the germansthe
reformation leibnitz kant and socalled german philosophy the war
of liberation the empireevery time a futile substitute for
something that once existed for something irrecoverable these
germans i confess are my enemies i despise all their uncleanliness
in concept and valuation their cowardice before every honest yea
and nay for nearly a thousand years they have tangled and confused
everything their fingers have touched they have on their conscience
all the halfway measures all the threeeighthsway measures that
europe is sick ofthey also have on their conscience the uncleanest
variety of christianity that exists and the most incurable and
indestructibleprotestantism if mankind never manages to get rid
of christianity the germans will be to blame
62
with this i come to a conclusion and pronounce my judgment i
condemn christianity i bring against the christian church the most
terrible of all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his
mouth it is to me the greatest of all imaginable corruptions it
seeks to work the ultimate corruption the worst possible corruption
the christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity it has
turned every value into worthlessness and every truth into a lie and
every integrity into baseness of soul let any one dare to speak to me
of its humanitarian blessings its deepest necessities range it
against any effort to abolish distress it lives by distress it
creates distress to make itself immortal for example the worm
of sin it was the church that first enriched mankind with this
miserythe equality of souls before godthis fraud this pretext
for the rancunes of all the basemindedthis explosive concept
ending in revolution the modern idea and the notion of overthrowing
the whole social orderthis is christian dynamite the
humanitarian blessings of christianity forsooth to breed out of
humanitas a selfcontradiction an art of selfpollution a will to
lie at any price an aversion and contempt for all good and honest
instincts all this to me is the humanitarianism of
christianityparasitism as the only practice of the church with its
anmic and holy ideals sucking all the blood all the love all the
hope out of life the beyond as the will to deny all reality the cross
as the distinguishing mark of the most subterranean conspiracy ever
heard ofagainst health beauty wellbeing intellect kindness of
soulagainst life itself
this eternal accusation against christianity i shall write upon all
walls wherever walls are to be foundi have letters that even the
blind will be able to see i call christianity the one great curse
the one great intrinsic depravity the one great instinct of revenge
for which no means are venomous enough or secret subterranean and
small enoughi call it the one immortal blemish upon the human
race
and mankind reckons time from the dies nefastus when this fatality
befellfrom the first day of christianitywhy not rather from its
lastfrom todaythe transvaluation of all values
