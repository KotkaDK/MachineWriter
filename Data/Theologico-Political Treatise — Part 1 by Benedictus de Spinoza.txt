preface
1men would never be superstitious if they could govern all their
circumstances by set rules or if they were always favoured by fortune but
being frequently driven into straits where rules are useless and being
often kept fluctuating pitiably between hope and fear by the uncertainty
of fortunes greedily coveted favours they are consequently for the most
part very prone to credulity 2 the human mind is readily swayed this way
or that in times of doubt especially when hope and fear are struggling for
the mastery though usually it is boastful over  confident and vain
3 this as a general fact i suppose everyone knows though few i believe
know their own nature no one can have lived in the world without observing
that most people when in prosperity are so overbrimming with wisdom
however inexperienced they may be that they take every offer of advice as
a personal insult whereas in adversity they know not where to turn but beg
and pray for counsel from every passerby 4 no plan is then too futile
too absurd or too fatuous for their adoption the most frivolous causes
will raise them to hope or plunge them into despair  if anything happens
during their fright which reminds them of some past good or ill they think
it portends a happy or unhappy issue and therefore though it may have
proved abortive a hundred times before style it a lucky or unlucky omen
5 anything which excites their astonishment they believe to be a portent
signifying the anger of the gods or of the supreme being and mistaking
superstition for religion account it impious not to avert the evil with
prayer and sacrifice 6 signs and wonders of this sort they conjure up
perpetually till one might think nature as mad as themselves they
interpret her so fantastically
7 thus it is brought prominently before us that superstitions chief
victims are those persons who greedily covet temporal advantages they it
is who especially when they are in danger and cannot help themselves are
wont with prayers and womanish tears to implore help from god upbraiding
reason as blind because she cannot show a sure path to the shadows they
pursue and rejecting human wisdom as vain but believing the phantoms of
imagination dreams and other childish absurdities to be the very oracles
of heaven 8 as though god had turned away from the wise and written his
decrees not in the mind of man but in the entrails of beasts or left them
to be proclaimed by the inspiration and instinct of fools madmen and
birds such is the unreason to which terror can drive mankind
9 superstition then is engendered preserved and fostered by fear if
anyone desire an example let him take alexander who only began
superstitiously to seek guidance from seers when he first learnt to fear
fortune in the passes of sysis curtius v 4 whereas after he had
conquered darius he consulted prophets no more till a second time
frightened by reverses 10 when the scythians were provoking a battle the
bactrians had deserted and he himself was lying sick of his wounds he
once more turned to superstition the mockery of human wisdom and bade
aristander to whom he confided his credulity inquire the issue of affairs
with sacrificed victims 11 very numerous examples of a like nature might
be cited clearly showing the fact that only while under the dominion of
fear do men fall a prey to superstition that all the portents ever invested
with the reverence of misguided religion are mere phantoms of dejected and
fearful minds and lastly that prophets have most power among the people
and are most formidable to rulers precisely at those times when the state
is in most peril 12 i think this is sufficiently plain to all and will
therefore say no more on the subject
13 the origin of superstition above given affords us a clear reason for
the fact that it comes to all men naturally though some refer its rise to
a dim notion of god universal to mankind and also tends to show that it
is no less inconsistent and variable than other mental hallucinations and
emotional impulses and further that it can only be maintained by hope
hatred anger and deceit since it springs not from reason but solely
from the more powerful phases of emotion 14 furthermore we may readily
understand how difficult it is to maintain in the same course men prone to
every form of credulity 15 for as the mass of mankind remains always at
about the same pitch of misery it never assents long to any one remedy but
is always best pleased by a novelty which has not yet proved illusive
16 this element of inconsistency has been the cause of many terrible wars
and revolutions for as curtius well says lib iv chap 10 the mob has
no ruler more potent than superstition and is easily led on the plea of
religion at one moment to adore its kings as gods and anon to execrate and
abjure them as humanitys common bane 17 immense pains have therefore
been taken to counteract this evil by investing religion whether true or
false with such pomp and ceremony that it may rise superior to every
shock and be always observed with studious reverence by the whole peoplea
system which has been brought to great perfection by the turks for they
consider even controversy impious and so clog mens minds with dogmatic
formulas that they leave no room for sound reason not even enough to doubt
with
18 but if in despotic statecraft the supreme and essential mystery be to
hoodwink the subjects and to mask the fear which keeps them clown with
the specious garb of religion so that men may fight as bravely for slavery
as for safety and count it not shame but highest honour to risk their blood
and their lives for the vainglory of a tyrant yet in a free state no more
mischievous expedient could be planned or attempted 19 wholly repugnant
to the general freedom are such devices as enthralling mens minds with
prejudices forcing their judgment or employing any of the weapons of
quasireligious sedition indeed such seditions only spring up when law
enters the domain of speculative thought and opinions are put on trial and
condemned on the same footing as crimes while those who defend and follow
them are sacrificed not to public safety but to their opponents
hatred and cruelty 20 if deeds only could be made the grounds of
criminal charges and words were always allowed to pass free such seditions
would be divested of every semblance of justification and would be
separated from mere controversies by a hard and fast line
20 now seeing that we have the rare happiness of living in a republic
where everyones judgment is free and unshackled where each may worship god
as his conscience dictates and where freedom is esteemed before all things
dear and precious i have believed that i should be undertaking no
ungrateful or unprofitable task in demonstrating that not only can
such freedom be granted without prejudice to the public peace but also
that without such freedom piety cannot flourish nor the public peace be
secure
21 such is the chief conclusion i seek to establish in this treatise but
in order to reach it i must first point out the misconceptions which like
scars of our former bondage still disfigure our notion of religion and
must expose the false views about the civil authority which many have most
impudently advocated endeavouring to turn the mind of the people still
prone to heathen superstition away from its legitimate rulers and so bring
us again into slavery 22 as to the order of my treatise i will speak
presently but first i will recount the causes which led me to write
23 i have often wondered that persons who make a boast of professing the
christian religion namely love joy peace temperance and charity to all
men should quarrel with such rancorous animosity and display daily towards
one another such bitter hatred that this rather than the virtues they
claim is the readiest criterion of their faith 24 matters have long
since come to such a pass that one can only pronounce a man christian
turk jew or heathen by his general appearance and attire by his
frequenting this or that place of worship or employing the phraseology of a
particular sect  as for manner of life it is in all cases the same 25
inquiry into the cause of this anomaly leads me unhesitatingly to ascribe it
to the fact that the ministries of the church are regarded by the masses
merely as dignities her offices as posts of emolument  in short popular
religion may be summed up as respect for ecclesiastics 26 the spread of
this misconception inflamed every worthless fellow with an intense desire to
enter holy orders and thus the love of diffusing gods religion degenerated
into sordid avarice and ambition 27 every church became a theatre where
orators instead of church teachers harangued caring not to instruct the
people but striving to attract admiration to bring opponents to public
scorn and to preach only novelties and paradoxes such as would tickle
the ears of their congregation 28 this state of things necessarily
stirred up an amount of controversy envy and hatred which no lapse of
time could appease so that we can scarcely wonder that of the old religion
nothing survives but its outward forms even these in the mouth of the
multitude seem rather adulation than adoration of the deity and that
faith has become a mere compound of credulity and prejudices  aye
prejudices too which degrade man from rational being to beast which
completely stifle the power of judgment between true and false which seem
in fact carefully fostered for the purpose of extinguishing the last spark
of reason 29 piety great god and religion are become a tissue of
ridiculous mysteries men who flatly despise reason who reject and turn
away from understanding as naturally corrupt these i say these of all
men are thought o lie most horrible to possess light from on high 30
verily if they had but one spark of light from on high they would not
insolently rave but would learn to worship god more wisely and would be as
marked among their fellows for mercy as they now are for malice if they
were concerned for their opponents souls instead of for their own
reputations they would no longer fiercely persecute but rather be filled
with pity and compassion
31 furthermore if any divine light were in them it would appear from
their doctrine 32 i grant that they are never tired of professing their
wonder at the profound mysteries of holy writ still i cannot discover that
they teach anything but speculations of platonists and aristotelians to
which in order to save their credit for christianity they have made holy
writ conform not content to rave with the greeks themselves they want to
make the prophets rave also showing conclusively that never even in sleep
have they caught a glimpse of scriptures divine nature 33 the very
vehemence of their admiration for the mysteries plainly attests that
their belief in the bible is a formal assent rather than a living faith and
the fact is made still more apparent by their laying down beforehand as a
foundation for the study and true interpretation of scripture the principle
that it is in every passage true and divine 34 such a doctrine should be
reached only after strict scrutiny and thorough comprehension of the sacred
books which would teach it much better for they stand in need no human
factions and not be set up on the threshold as it were of inquiry
35 as i pondered over the facts that the light of reason is not only
despised but by many even execrated as a source of impiety that human
commentaries are accepted as divine records and that credulity is extolled
as faith as i marked the fierce controversies of philosophers raging in
church and state the source of bitter hatred and dissension the ready
instruments of sedition and other ills innumerable i determined to examine
the bible afresh in a careful impartial and unfettered spirit making no
assumptions concerning it and attributing to it no doctrines which i do
not find clearly therein set down 36 with these precautions i constructed
a method of scriptural interpretation and thus equipped proceeded to
inquire  what is prophecy 37 in what sense did god reveal himself to the
prophets and why were these particular men  chosen by him 38 was it on
account of the sublimity of their thoughts about the deity and nature or
was it solely on account of their piety 39 these questions being
answered i was easily able to conclude that the authority of the prophets
has weight only in matters of morality and that their speculative doctrines
affect us little
40 next i inquired why the hebrews were called gods chosen people
and discovering that it was only because god had chosen for them a
certain strip of territory where they might live peaceably and at
ease i learnt that the law revealed by god to moses was merely the law
of the individual hebrew state therefore that it was binding on none
but hebrews and not even on hebrews after the downfall of their
nation 41 further in order to ascertain whether it could be
concluded from scripture that the human understanding is naturally
corrupt i inquired whether the universal religion the divine law
revealed through the prophets and apostles to the whole human race
differs from that which is taught by the light of natural reason
whether miracles can take place in violation of the laws of nature and
if so whether they imply the existence of god more surely and clearly
than events which we understand plainly and distinctly through their
immediate natural causes
42 now as in the whole course of my investigation i found nothing taught
expressly by scripture which does not agree with our understanding or
which is repugnant thereto and as i saw that the prophets taught nothing
which is not very simple and easily to be grasped by all and further that
they clothed their teaching in the style and confirmed it with the reasons
which would most deeply move the mind of the masses to devotion towards god
i became thoroughly convinced that the bible leaves reason absolutely free
that it has nothing in common with philosophy in fact that revelation and
philosophy stand on different footings in order to set this forth
categorically and exhaust the whole question i point out the way in which
the bible should be interpreted and show that all of spiritual questions
should be sought from it alone and not from the objects of ordinary
knowledge 43 thence i pass on to indicate the false notions which have
from the fact that the multitude  ever prone to superstition and caring
more for the shreds of antiquity for eternal truths  pays homage to the
books of the bible rather than to the word of god 44 i show that the
word of god has not been revealed as a certain number of books was
displayed to the prophets as a simple idea of the mind namely obedience to
god in singleness of heart and in the practice of justice and charity and
i further point out that this doctrine is set forth in scripture in
accordance with the opinions and understandings of those among whom the
apostles and prophets preached to the end that men might receive it
willingly and with their whole heart
45 having thus laid bare the bases of belief i draw the conclusion that
revelation has obedience for its sole object therefore in purpose no less
than in foundation and method stands entirely aloof from ordinary
knowledge each has its separate province neither can be called the
handmaid of the other
46 furthermore as mens habits of mind differ so that some more readily
embrace one form of faith some another for what moves one to pray may move
another only to scoff i conclude in accordance with what has gone before
that everyone should be free to choose for himself the foundations of his
creed and that faith should be judged only by its fruits each would then
obey god freely with his whole heart while nothing would be publicly
honoured save justice and charity
47 having thus drawn attention to the liberty conceded to everyone by the
revealed law of god i pass on to another part of my subject and prove that
this same liberty can and should be accorded with safety to the state and
the magisterial authority  in fact that it cannot be withheld without
great danger to peace and detriment to the community
48 in order to establish my point i start from the natural rights of the
individual which are coextensive with his desires and power and from the
fact that no one is bound to live as another pleases but is the guardian of
his own liberty 49 i show that these rights can only be transferred to
those whom we depute to defend us who acquire with the duties of defence
the power of ordering our lives and i thence infer that rulers possess
rights only limited by their power that they are the sole guardians of
justice and liberty and that their subjects should act in all things as
they dictate nevertheless since no one can so utterly abdicate his own
power of selfdefence as to cease to be a man i conclude that no one can be
deprived of his natural rights absolutely but that subjects either by
tacit agreement or by social contract retain a certain number which
cannot be taken from them without great danger to the state
50 from these considerations i pass on to the hebrew state which i
describe at some length in order to trace the manner in which religion
acquired the force of law and to touch on other noteworthy points 51 i
then prove that the holders of sovereign power are the depositories and
interpreters of religious no less than of civil ordinances and that they
alone have the right to decide what is just or unjust pious or impious
lastly i conclude by showing that they best retain this right and secure
safety to their state by allowing every man to think what he likes and say
what he thinks
52 such philosophical reader are the questions i submit to your notice
counting on your approval for the subject matter of the whole book and of
the several chapters is important and profitable 53 i would say more but
i do not want my preface to extend to a volume especially as i know that
its leading propositions are to philosophers but common places 54 to the
rest of mankind i care not to commend my treatise for i cannot expect that
it contains anything to please them i know how deeply rooted are the
prejudices embraced under the name of religion i am aware that in the mind
of the masses superstition is no less deeply rooted than fear i recognize
that their constancy is mere obstinacy and that they are led to praise or
blame by impulse rather than reason 55 therefore the multitude and those
of like passions with the multitude i ask not to read my book nay i would
rather that they should utterly neglect it than that they should
misinterpret it after their wont 56 they would gain no good themselves
and might prove a stumblingblock to others whose philosophy is hampered by
the belief that reason is a mere handmaid to theology and whom i seek in
this work especially to benefit 57 but as there will be many who have
neither the leisure nor perhaps the inclination to read through all i
have written i feel bound here as at the end of my treatise to declare
that i have written nothing which i do not most willingly submit to the
examination and judgment of my countrys rulers and that i am ready to
retract anything which they shall decide to be repugnant to the laws or
prejudicial to the public good 58 i know that i am a man and as a
man liable to error but against error i have taken scrupulous care and
striven to keep in entire accordance with the laws of my country with
loyalty and with morality
chapter i  of prophecy
1 prophecy or revelation is sure knowledge revealed by god to man
2 a prophet is one who interprets the revelations of god to those who
are unable to attain to sure knowledge of the matters revealed and
therefore can only apprehend them by simple faith
3 the hebrew word for prophet is nabiendnote 1 ie speaker or
interpreter but in scripture its meaning is restricted to interpreter
of god as we may learn from exodus vii1 where god says to moses
see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be
thy prophet implying that since in interpreting moses words to
pharaoh aaron acted the part of a prophet moses would be to pharaoh
as a god or in the attitude of a god
4 prophets i will treat of in the next chapter and at present consider
prophecy
5 now it is evident from the definition above given that prophecy really
includes ordinary knowledge for the knowledge which we acquire by our
natural faculties depends on knowledge of god and his eternal laws but
ordinary knowledge is common to all men as men and rests on foundations
which all share whereas the multitude always strains after rarities
and exceptions and thinks little of the gifts of nature so that when
prophecy is talked of ordinary knowledge is not supposed to be included
6 nevertheless it has as much right as any other to be called divine for
gods nature in so far as we share therein and gods laws dictate it to
us nor does it suffer from that to which we give the preeminence except in
so far as the latter transcends its limits and cannot be accounted for by
natural laws taken in themselves 7 in respect to the certainty it
involves and the source from which it is derived ie god ordinary
knowledge is no whit inferior to prophetic unless indeed we believe or
rather dream that the prophets had human bodies but superhuman minds and
therefore that their sensations and consciousness were entirely different
from our own
8 but although ordinary knowledge is divine its professors cannot be
called prophets endnote 2 for they teach what the rest of mankind could
perceive and apprehend not merely by simple faith but as surely and
honourably as themselves
9 seeing then that our mind subjectively contains in itself and partakes
of the nature of god and solely from this cause is enabled to form notions
explaining natural phenomena and inculcating morality it follows that we
may rightly assert the nature of the human mind in so far as it is thus
conceived to be a primary cause of divine revelation 10 all that we
clearly and distinctly understand is dictated to us as i have just pointed
out by the idea and nature of god not indeed through words but in a way
far more excellent and agreeing perfectly with the nature of the mind as
all who have enjoyed intellectual certainty will doubtless attest 11
here however my chief purpose is to speak of matters having reference to
scripture so these few words on the light of reason will suffice
12 i will now pass on to and treat more fully the other ways and means
by which god makes revelations to mankind both of that which transcends
ordinary knowledge and of that within its scope for there is no reason why
god should not employ other means to communicate what we know already by the
power of reason
13 our conclusions on the subject must be drawn solely from scripture for
what can we affirm about matters transcending our knowledge except what is
told us by the words or writings of prophets 14 and since there are so
far as i know no prophets now alive we have no alternative but to read the
books of prophets departed taking care the while not to reason from
metaphor or to ascribe anything to our authors which they do not themselves
distinctly state 15 i must further premise that the jews never make any
mention or account of secondary or particular causes but in a spirit of
religion piety and what is commonly called godliness refer all things
directly to the deity 16 for instance if they make money by a
transaction they say god gave it to them if they desire anything they say
god has disposed their hearts towards it if they think anything they say
god told them 17 hence we must not suppose that everything is prophecy or
revelation which is described in scripture as told by god to anyone but
only such things as are expressly announced as prophecy or revelation or
are plainly pointed to as such by the context
18 a perusal of the sacred books will show us that all gods revelations
to the prophets were made through words or appearances or a combination of
the two 19 these words and appearances were of two kinds 1 real when
external to the mind of the prophet who heard or saw them 2 imaginary
when the imagination of the prophet was in a state which led him distinctly
to suppose that he heard or saw them
20 with a real voice god revealed to moses the laws which he wished to be
transmitted to the hebrews as we may see from exodus xxv22 where god
says and there i will meet with thee and i will commune with thee from the
mercy seat which is between the cherubim 21 some sort of real voice must
necessarily have been employed for moses found god ready to commune with
him at any time this as i shall shortly show is the only instance of a
real voice
22 we might perhaps suppose that the voice with which god called samuel
was real for in 1 sam iii21 we read and the lord appeared again in
shiloh for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the
lord implying that the appearance of the lord consisted in his making
himself known to samuel through a voice in other words that samuel heard
the lord speaking 23 but we are compelled to distinguish between the
prophecies of moses and those of other prophets and therefore must decide
that this voice was imaginary a conclusion further supported by the voices
resemblance to the voice of eli which samuel was in the habit of hearing
and therefore might easily imagine when thrice called by the lord samuel
supposed it to have been eli
24 the voice which abimelech heard was imaginary for it is written
gen xx6 and god said unto him in a dream 25 so that the will of god
was manifest to him not in waking but only in sleep that is when the
imagination is most active and uncontrolled 26 some of the jews believe
that the actual words of the decalogue were not spoken by god but that the
israelites heard a noise only without any distinct words and during its
continuance apprehended the ten commandments by pure intuition to this
opinion i myself once inclined seeing that the words of the decalogue in
exodus are different from the words of the decalogue in deuteronomy for the
discrepancy seemed to imply since god only spoke once that the ten
commandments were not intended to convey the actual words of the lord but
only his meaning 27 however unless we would do violence to scripture we
must certainly admit that the israelites heard a real voice for scripture
expressly says deut v4 god spake with you face to face ie as two
men ordinarily interchange ideas through the instrumentality of their two
bodies and therefore it seems more consonant with holy writ to suppose that
god really did create a voice of some kind with which the decalogue was
revealed 28 the discrepancy of the two versions is treated of in
chap viii
29 yet not even thus is all difficulty removed for it seems scarcely
reasonable to affirm that a created thing depending on god in the same
manner as other created things would be able to express or explain the
nature of god either verbally or really by means of its individual
organism for instance by declaring in the first person i am the lord
your god
30 certainly when anyone says with his mouth i understand we do not
attribute the understanding to the mouth but to the mind of the speaker
yet this is because the mouth is the natural organ of a man speaking and
the hearer knowing what understanding is easily comprehends by a
comparison with himself that the speakers mind is meant but if we knew
nothing of god beyond the mere name and wished to commune with him and be
assured of his existence i fail to see how our wish would be satisfied by
the declaration of a created thing depending on god neither more nor less
than ourselves i am the lord 31 if god contorted the lips of moses
or i will not say moses but some beast till they pronounced the words
i am the lord should we apprehend the lords existence therefrom
32 scripture seems clearly to point to the belief that god spoke himself
having descended from heaven to mount sinai for the purpose  and not only
that the israelites heard him speaking but that their chief men beheld him
exxxiv 33 further the law of moses which might neither be added to
nor curtailed and which was set up as a national standard of right nowhere
prescribed the belief that god is without body or even without form or
figure but only ordained that the jews should believe in his existence and
worship him alone it forbade them to invent or fashion any likeness of the
deity but this was to insure purity of service because never having seen
god they could not by means of images recall the likeness of god but only
the likeness of some created thing which might thus gradually take the place
of god as the object of their adoration 34 nevertheless the bible
clearly implies that god has a form and that moses when he heard god
speaking was permitted to behold it or at least its hinder parts
35 doubtless some mystery lurks in this question which we will discuss
more fully below 36 for the present i will call attention to the passages
in scripture indicating the means by which god has revealed his laws to man
37 revelation may be through figures only as in i chronxxii where god
displays his anger to david by means of an angel bearing a sword and also
in the story of balaam
38 maimonides and others do indeed maintain that these and every other
instance of angelic apparitions eg to manoah and to abraham offering up
isaac occurred during sleep for that no one with his eyes open ever could
see an angel but this is mere nonsense 39 the sole object of such
commentators seems to be to extort from scripture confirmations of
aristotelian quibbles and their own inventions a proceeding which i regard
as the acme of absurdity
40 in figures not real but existing only in the prophets imagination
god revealed to joseph his future lordship and in words and figures he
revealed to joshua that he would fight for the hebrews causing to appear an
angel as it were the captain of the lords host bearing a sword and by
this means communicating verbally 41 the forsaking of israel by
providence was portrayed to isaiah by a vision of the lord the thrice holy
sitting on a very lofty throne and the hebrews stained with the mire of
their sins sunk as it were in uncleanness and thus as far as possible
distant from god 42 the wretchedness of the people at the time was thus
revealed while future calamities were foretold in words i could cite from
holy writ many similar examples but i think they are sufficiently well
known already
43 however we get a still more clear confirmation of our position in num
xii67 as follows if there be any prophet among you i the lord will
make myself known unto him in a vision ie by appearances and signs for
god says of the prophecy of moses that it was a vision without signs and
will speak unto him in a dream ie not with actual words and an actual
voice 44 my servant moses is not so with him will i speak mouth to
mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the
lord he shall behold ie looking on me as a friend and not afraid he
speaks with me cf ex xxxiii17
45 this makes it indisputable that the other prophets did not hear a real
voice and we gather as much from deut xxxiv10 and there arose not a
prophet since in israel like unto moses whom the lord knew face to face
which must mean that the lord spoke with none other for not even moses saw
the lords face 46 these are the only media of communication between
god and man which i find mentioned in scripture and therefore the only ones
which may be supposed or invented 47 we may be able quite to comprehend
that god can communicate immediately with man for without the intervention
of bodily means he communicates to our minds his essence still a man who
can by pure intuition comprehend ideas which are neither contained in nor
deducible from the foundations of our natural knowledge must necessarily
possess a mind far superior to those of his fellow men nor do i believe
that any have been so endowed save christ 48 to him the ordinances of god
leading men to salvation were revealed directly without words or visions so
that god manifested himself to the apostles through the mind of christ as he
formerly did to moses through the supernatural voice 49 in this sense the
voice of christ like the voice which moses heard may be called the voice
of god and it may be said that the wisdom of god ie wisdom more than
human took upon itself in christ human nature and that christ was the way
of salvation 50 i must at this juncture declare that those doctrines
which certain churches put forward concerning christ i neither affirm nor
deny for i freely confess that i do not understand them 51 what i have
just stated i gather from scripture where i never read that god appeared to
christ or spoke to christ but that god was revealed to the apostles
through christ that christ was the way of life and that the old law was
given through an angel and not immediately by god whence it follows that
if moses spoke with god face to face as a man speaks with his friend ie
by means of their two bodies christ communed with god mind to mind
52 thus we may conclude that no one except christ received the revelations
of god without the aid of imagination whether in words or vision 53
therefore the power of prophecy implies not a peculiarly perfect mind but a
peculiarly vivid imagination as i will show more clearly in the next
chapter 54 we will now inquire what is meant in the bible by the
spirit of god breathed into the prophets or by the prophets speaking with
the spirit of god to that end we must determine the exact signification of
the hebrew word ruagh commonly translated spirit
55 the word ruagh literally means a wind eg the south
wind but it is frequently employed in other derivative significations
it is used as equivalent to
56 1 breath neither is there any spirit in his mouth ps cxxxv17
57 2 life or breathing and his spirit returned to him
          1 sam xxx12 ie he breathed again
58 3 courage and strength neither did there remain any more spirit
          in any man josh ii11 and the spirit entered into me and
          made me stand on my feet ezek ii2
59 4 virtue and fitness days should speak and multitudes of years
          should teach wisdom but there is a spirit in man job xxxii7
          ie wisdom is not always found among old men for i now discover
          that it depends on individual virtue and capacity so a man in
          whom is the spirit numbers xxvii18
60 5 habit of mind because he had another spirit with him
          numbers xiv24 ie another habit of mind behold i will pour
          out my spirit unto you prov i23
61 6 will purpose desire impulse whither the spirit was to go
          they went ezek 112 that cover with a covering but not of my
          spirit is xxx1 for the lord hath poured out on you the
          spirit of deep sleep is xxix10 then was their spirit
          softened judges viii3 he that ruleth his spirit is better
          than he that taketh a city prov xvi32 he that hath no ru
          over his own spirit prov xxv28 your spirit as fire shall
          devour you isaiah xxxiii1
from the meaning of disposition we get 
62 7 passions and faculties a lofty spirit means pride a lowly spirit
          humility an evil spirit hatred and melancholy so too the
          expressions spirits of jealousy fornication wisdom counsel
          bravery stand for a jealous lascivious wise prudent or brave
          mind for we hebrews use substantives in preference to
          adjectives or these various qualities
63 8 the mind itself or the life yea they have all one spirit
          eccles iii19 the spirit shall return to god who gave it
64 9 the quarters of the world from the winds which blow thence or
          even the side of anything turned towards a particular quarter 
          ezek xxxvii9 xlii16 17 18 19 c
65 i have already alluded to the way in which things are referred to god
and said to be of god
66 1 as belonging to his nature and being as it were part of him
          eg the power of god the eyes of god
67 2 as under his dominion and depending on his pleasure thus the
          heavens are called the heavens of the lord as being his chariot
          and habitation so nebuchadnezzar is called the servant of god
          assyria the scourge of god c
68 3 as dedicated to him eg the temple of god a nazarene of god
          the bread of god
69 4 as revealed through the prophets and not through our natural
          faculties in this sense the mosaic law is called the law of god
70 5 as being in the superlative degree very high mountains are styled
          the mountains of god a very deep sleep the sleep of god c in
          this sense we must explain amos iv11 i have overthrown you as
          the overthrow of the lord came upon sodom and gomorrah ie that
          memorable overthrow for since god himself is the speaker the
          passage cannot well be taken otherwise the wisdom of solomon is
          called the wisdom of god or extraordinary the size of the cedars
          of lebanon is alluded to in the psalmists expression the cedars
          of the lord
71 similarly if the jews were at a loss to understand any phenomenon or
were ignorant of its cause they referred it to god 72 thus a storm was
termed the chiding of god thunder and lightning the arrows of god for it
was thought that god kept the winds confined in caves his treasuries thus
differing merely in name from the greek windgod eolus 73 in like manner
miracles were called works of god as being especially marvellous though in
reality of course all natural events are the works of god and take place
solely by his power 74 the psalmist calls the miracles in egypt the works
of god because the hebrews found in them a way of safety which they had not
looked for and therefore especially marvelled at
75 as then unusual natural phenomena are called works of god and trees
of unusual size are called trees of god we cannot wonder that very strong
and tall men though impious robbers and whoremongers are in genesis called
sons of god
76 this reference of things wonderful to god was not peculiar to the jews
77 pharaoh on hearing the interpretation of his dream exclaimed that the
mind of the gods was in joseph 78 nebuchadnezzar told daniel that he
possessed the mind of the holy gods so also in latin anything well made is
often said to be wrought with divine hands which is equivalent to the
hebrew phrase wrought with the hand of god
80 we can now very easily understand and explain those passages of
scripture which speak of the spirit of god 81 in some places the
expression merely means a very strong dry and deadly wind as in
isaiah xl7 the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of
the lord bloweth upon it 82 similarly in gen i2 the spirit of the
lord moved over the face of the waters 83 at other times it is used as
equivalent to a high courage thus the spirit of gideon and of samson is
called the spirit of the lord as being very bold and prepared for any
emergency 84 any unusual virtue or power is called the spirit or virtue
of the lord ex xxxi3 i will fill him bezaleel with the spirit of the
lord ie as the bible itself explains with talent above mans usual
endowment 85 so isa xi2 and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon
him is explained afterwards in the text to mean the spirit of wisdom and
understanding of counsel and might
86 the melancholy of saul is called the melancholy of the lord or a very
deep melancholy the persons who applied the term showing that they
understood by it nothing supernatural in that they sent for a musician to
assuage it by harpplaying 87 again the spirit of the lord is used
as equivalent to the mind of man for instance job xxvii3 and the spirit
of the lord in my nostrils the allusion being to gen ii7 and god
breathed into mans nostrils the breath of life 88 ezekiel also
prophesying to the dead says xxvii14 and i will give to you my spirit
and ye shall live ie i will restore you to life 89 in job xxxiv14
we read if he gather unto himself his spirit and breath in gen vi3
my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh
ie since man acts on the dictates of his body and not the spirit which i
gave him to discern the good i will let him alone 90 so too ps li12
create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me cast
me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me 91
it was supposed that sin originated only from the body and that good
impulses come from the mind therefore the psalmist invokes the aid of god
against the bodily appetites but prays that the spirit which the lord the
holy one had given him might be renewed 92 again inasmuch as the bible
in concession to popular ignorance describes god as having a mind a heart
emotions  nay even a body and breath  the expression spirit of the lord
is used for gods mind disposition emotion strength or breath
93 thus isa xl13 who hath disposed the spirit of the lord ie who
save himself hath caused the mind of the lord to will anything and
isa lxiii10 but they rebelled and vexed the holy spirit
94 the phrase comes to be used of the law of moses which in a sense
expounds gods will is lxiii 11 where is he that put his holy spirit
within him meaning as we clearly gather from the context the law of
moses 95 nehemiah speaking of the giving of the law says i20
thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them 96 this is referred
to in deut iv6 this is your wisdom and understanding and in
ps cxliii10 thy good spirit will lead me into the land of uprightness
97 the spirit of the lord may mean the breath of the lord for breath no
less than a mind a heart and a body are attributed to god in scripture as
in ps xxxiii6 98 hence it gets to mean the power strength or faculty
of god as in job xxxiii4 the spirit of the lord made me ie the
power or if you prefer the decree of the lord 99 so the psalmist in
poetic language declares xxxiii6 by the word of the lord were the
heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth ie by
a mandate issued as it were in one breath 100 also ps cxxxix7
whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy
presence ie whither shall i go so as to be beyond thy power and thy
presence
101 lastly the spirit of the lord is used in scripture to express the
emotions of god eg his kindness and mercy micah ii7 is the spirit
ie the mercy of the lord straitened 102 are these cruelties his
doings 103 zech iv6 not by might or by power but my spirit ie
mercy saith the lord of hosts 104 the twelfth verse of the seventh
chapter of the same prophet must i think be interpreted in like manner
yea they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the
law and the words which the lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit ie in
his mercy by the former prophets 105 so also haggai ii5 so my spirit
remaineth among you fear not
106 the passage in isaiah xlviii16 and now the lord and his spirit hath
sent me may be taken to refer to gods mercy or his revealed law for the
prophet says from the beginning ie from the time when i first came to
you to preach gods anger and his sentence forth against you i spoke not
in secret from the time that it was there am i and now i am sent by
the mercy of god as a joyful messenger to preach your restoration 107 or
we may understand him to mean by the revealed law that he had before come to
warn them by the command of the law levit xix17 in the same manner under
the same conditions as moses had warned them that now like moses he ends
by preaching their restoration 108 but the first explanation seems to me
the best
109 returning then to the main object of our discussion we find that
the scriptural phrases the spirit of the lord was upon a prophet the
lord breathed his spirit into men men were filled with the spirit of god
with the holy spirit c are quite clear to us and mean that prophets
were endowed with a peculiar and extraordinary power and devoted themselves
to piety with especial constancy3 that thus they perceived the mind or
the thought of god for we have shown that gods spirit signifies in hebrew
gods mind or thought and that the law which shows his mind and thought is
called his spirit hence that the imagination of the prophets inasmuch as
through it were revealed the decrees of god may equally be called the mind
of god and the prophets be said to have possessed the mind of god 110 on
our minds also the mind of god and his eternal thoughts are impressed but
this being the same for all men is less taken into account especially by
the hebrews who claimed a preeminence and despised other men and other
mens knowledge
111 lastly the prophets were said to possess the spirit of god because
men knew not the cause of prophetic knowledge and in their wonder referred
it with other marvels directly to the deity styling it divine knowledge
112 we need no longer scruple to affirm that the prophets only
perceived gods revelation by the aid of imagination that is by words and
figures either real or imaginary 113 we find no other means mentioned in
scripture and therefore must not invent any 114 as to the particular law
of nature by which the communications took place i confess my ignorance
115 i might indeed say as others do that they took place by the power
of god but this would be mere trifling and no better than explaining some
unique specimen by a transcendental term 116 everything takes place by
the power of god 117 nature herself is the power of god under another
name and our ignorance of the power of god is coextensive with our
ignorance of nature 118 it is absolute folly therefore to ascribe an
event to the power of god when we know not its natural cause which is the
power of god
119 however we are not now inquiring into the causes of prophetic
knowledge 120 we are only attempting as i have said to examine the
scriptural documents and to draw our conclusions from them as from ultimate
natural facts the causes of the documents do not concern us
121 as the prophets perceived the revelations of god by the aid of
imagination they could indisputably perceive much that is beyond the
boundary of the intellect for many more ideas can be constructed from words
and figures than from the principles and notions on which the whole fabric
of reasoned knowledge is reared
122 thus we have a clue to the fact that the prophets perceived nearly
everything in parables and allegories and clothed spiritual truths in
bodily forms for such is the usual method of imagination 122 we need no
longer wonder that scripture and the prophets speak so strangely and
obscurely of gods spirit or mind cf numbers xi17 1 kings xxii21 c
that the lord was seen by micah as sitting by daniel as an old man clothed
in white by ezekiel as a fire that the holy spirit appeared to those with
christ as a descending dove to the apostles as fiery tongues to paul on
his conversion as a great light 124 all these expressions are plainly in
harmony with the current ideas of god and spirits
125 inasmuch as imagination is fleeting and inconstant we find that the
power of prophecy did not remain with a prophet for long nor manifest
itself frequently but was very rare manifesting itself only in a few men
and in them not often
126 we must necessarily inquire how the prophets became assured of the
truth of what they perceived by imagination and not by sure mental laws
but our investigation must be confined to scripture for the subject is one
on which we cannot acquire certain knowledge and which we cannot explain by
the immediate causes 127 scripture teaching about the assurance of
prophets i will treat of in the next chapter
chapter ii  of prophets
1 it follows from the last chapter that as i have said the prophets were
endowed with unusually vivid imaginations and not with unusually perfect
minds 2 this conclusion is amply sustained by scripture for we are told
that solomon was the wisest of men but had no special faculty of prophecy
3 heman calcol and dara though men of great talent were not prophets
whereas uneducated countrymen nay even women such as hagar abrahams
handmaid were thus gifted 4 nor is this contrary to ordinary experience
and reason 5 men of great imaginative power are less fitted for abstract
reasoning whereas those who excel in intellect and its use keep their
imagination more restrained and controlled holding it in subjection so to
speak lest it should usurp the place of reason
6 thus to suppose that knowledge of natural and spiritual phenomena can be
gained from the prophetic books is an utter mistake which i shall
endeavour to expose as i think philosophy the age and the question itself
demand 7 i care not for the girdings of superstition for superstition is
the bitter enemy of all true knowledge and true morality 8 yes it has
come to this 9 men who openly confess that they can form no idea of god
and only know him through created things of which they know not the causes
can unblushingly accuse philosophers of atheism
10 treating the question methodically i will show that prophecies
varied not only according to the imagination and physical temperament
of the prophet but also according to his particular opinions and
further that prophecy never rendered the prophet wiser than he was
before 11 but i will first discuss the assurance of truth which the
prophets received for this is akin to the subjectmatter of the
chapter and will serve to elucidate somewhat our present point
12 imagination does not in its own nature involve any certainty of
truth such as is implied in every clear and distinct idea but requires
some extrinsic reason to assure us of its objective reality hence prophecy
cannot afford certainty and the prophets were assured of gods revelation
by some sign and not by the fact of revelation as we may see from abraham
who when he had heard the promise of god demanded a sign not because he
did not believe in god but because he wished to be sure that it was god who
made the promise 13 the fact is still more evident in the case of gideon
show me he says to god show me a sign that i may know that it is thou
that talkest with me 14 god also says to moses and let this be a
sign that i have sent thee 15 hezekiah though he had long known isaiah
to be a prophet none the less demanded a sign of the cure which he
predicted 15 it is thus quite evident that the prophets always received
some sign to certify them of their prophetic imaginings and for this reason
moses bids the jews deut xviii ask of the prophets a sign namely the
prediction of some coming event 16 in this respect prophetic knowledge
is inferior to natural knowledge which needs no sign and in itself implies
certitude 17 moreover scripture warrants the statement that the
certitude of the prophets was not mathematical but moral 18 moses lays
down the punishment of death for the prophet who preaches new gods even
though he confirm his doctrine by signs and wonders deut xiii for he
says the lord also worketh signs and wonders to try his people 19 and
jesus christ warns his disciples of the same thing matt xxiv24 20
furthermore ezekiel xiv9 plainly states that god sometimes deceives
men with false revelations and micaiah bears like witness in the case of
the prophets of ahab
21 although these instances go to prove that revelation is open to doubt
it nevertheless contains as we have said a considerable element of
certainty for god never deceives the good nor his chosen but according
to the ancient proverb and as appears in the history of abigail and her
speech god uses the good as instruments of goodness and the wicked as
means to execute his wrath 22 this may be seen from the case of micaiah
above quoted for although god had determined to deceive ahab through
prophets he made use of lying prophets to the good prophet he revealed the
truth and did not forbid his proclaiming it
23 still the certitude of prophecy remains as i have said merely
moral for no one can justify himself before god nor boast that he is an
instrument for gods goodness 24 scripture itself teaches and shows that
god led away david to number the people though it bears ample
witness to davids piety
25 the whole question of the certitude of prophecy was based on these
three considerations
   1 that the things revealed were imagined very vividly affecting the
      prophets in the same way as things seen when awake
   2 the presence of a sign
   3 lastly and chiefly that the mind of the prophet was given wholly
      to what was right and  good
26 although scripture does not always make mention of a sign we must
nevertheless suppose that a sign was always vouchsafed for scripture does
not always relate every condition and circumstance as many have
remarked but rather takes them for granted 27 we may however admit
that no sign was needed when the prophecy declared nothing that was not
already contained in the law of moses because it was confirmed by that law
28 for instance jeremiahs prophecy of the destruction of jerusalem was
confirmed by the prophecies of other prophets and by the threats in the
law and therefore it needed no sign whereas hananiah who contrary to
all the prophets foretold the speedy restoration of the state stood in
need of a sign or he would have been in doubt as to the truth of his
prophecy until it was confirmed by facts 29 the prophet which
prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to
pass then shall the prophet be known that the lord hath truly sent him
30 as then the certitude afforded to the prophet by signs was not
mathematical ie did not necessarily follow from the perception of the
thing perceived or seen but only moral and as the signs were only given
to convince the prophet it follows that such signs were given according to
the opinions and capacity of each prophet so that a sign which
convince one prophet would fall far short of convincing another who was
imbued with different opinions 31 therefore the signs varied according to
the individual prophet
32 so also did the revelation vary as we have stated according to
individual disposition and temperament and according to the opinions
previously held
33 it varied according to disposition in this way if a prophet was
cheerful victories peace and events which make men glad were revealed to
him in that he was naturally more likely to imagine such things 34 if
on the contrary he was melancholy wars massacres and calamities were
revealed and so according as a prophet was merciful gentle quick to
anger or severe he was more fitted for one kind of revelation than
another 35 it varied according to the temper of imagination in this way
if a prophet was cultivated he perceived the mind of god in a cultivated
way if he was confused he perceived it confusedly 36 and so with
revelations perceived through visions 37 if a prophet was a countryman he
saw visions of oxen cows and the like if he was a soldier he saw
generals and armies if a courtier a royal throne and so on
38 lastly prophecy varied according to the opinions held by the prophets
for instance to the magi who believed in the follies of astrology the
birth of christ was revealed through the vision of a star in the east 39
to the augurs of nebuchadnezzar the destruction of jerusalem was revealed
through entrails whereas the king himself inferred it from oracles and the
direction of arrows which he shot into the air 40 to prophets who
believed that man acts from free choice and by his own power god was
revealed as standing apart from and ignorant of future human actions 41
all of which we will illustrate from scripture
42 the first point is proved from the case of elisha who in order to
prophecy to jehoram asked for a harp and was unable to perceive the divine
purpose till he had been recreated by its music then indeed he prophesied
to jehoram and to his allies glad tidings which previously he had been
unable to attain to because he was angry with the king and these who are
angry with anyone can imagine evil of him but not good 43 the theory
that god does not reveal himself to the angry or the sad is a mere dream
for god revealed to moses while angry the terrible slaughter of the
firstborn and did so without the intervention of a harp 44 to cain in
his rage god was revealed and to ezekiel impatient with anger was
revealed the contumacy and wretchedness of the jews 45 jeremiah
miserable and weary of life prophesied the disasters of the hebrews so
that josiah would not consult him but inquired of a woman inasmuch as it
was more in accordance with womanly nature that god should reveal his mercy
thereto 46 so micaiah never prophesied good to ahab though other true
prophets had done so but invariably evil 46 thus we see that individual
prophets were by temperament more fitted for one sort of revelation than
another
47 the style of the prophecy also varied according to the eloquence of the
individual prophet 48 the prophecies of ezekiel and amos are not written
in a cultivated style like those of isaiah and nahum but more rudely 49
any hebrew scholar who wishes to inquire into this point more closely and
compares chapters of the different prophets treating of the same subject
will find great dissimilarity of style 50 compare for instance chap i
of the courtly isaiah verse 11 to verse 20 with chap v of the countryman
amos verses 2124 51 compare also the order and reasoning of the
prophecies of jeremiah written in idumaea chap xlix with the order and
reasoning of obadiah 52 compare lastly isa xl19 20 and xliv8 with
hosea viii6 and xiii2 and so on
53 a due consideration of these passage will clearly show us that god has
no particular style in speaking but according to the learning and capacity
of the prophet is cultivated compressed severe untutored prolix or
obscure
54 there was moreover a certain variation in the visions vouchsafed to
the prophets and in the symbols by which they expressed them for isaiah
saw the glory of the lord departing from the temple in a different form from
that presented to ezekiel 55 the rabbis indeed maintain that both
visions were really the same but that ezekiel being a countryman was
above measure impressed by it and therefore set it forth in full detail
but unless there is a trustworthy tradition on the subject which i do not
for a moment believe this theory is plainly an invention isaiah saw
seraphim with six wings ezekiel beasts with four wings isaiah saw god
clothed and sitting on a royal throne ezekiel saw him in the likeness of a
fire each doubtless saw god under the form in which he usually imagined
him
56 further the visions varied in clearness as well as in details for the
revelations of zechariah were too obscure to be understood by the prophet
without explanation as appears from his narration of them the visions of
daniel could not be understood by him even after they had been explained
and this obscurity did not arise from the difficulty of the matter revealed
for being merely human affairs these only transcended human capacity in
being future but solely in the fact that daniels imagination was not so
capable for prophecy while he was awake as while he was asleep and this is
further evident from the fact that at the very beginning of the vision he
was so terrified that he almost despaired of his strength 57 thus on
account of the inadequacy of his imagination and his strength the things
revealed were so obscure to him that he could not understand them even after
they had been explained 58 here we may note that the words heard by
daniel were as we have shown above simply imaginary so that it is hardly
wonderful that in his frightened state he imagined them so confusedly and
obscurely that afterwards he could make nothing of them 59 those who say
that god did not wish to make a clear revelation do not seem to have read
the words of the angel who expressly says that he came to make the prophet
understand what should befall his people in the latter days dan x14
60 the revelation remained obscure because no one was found at that time
with imagination sufficiently strong to conceive it more clearly 61
lastly the prophets to whom it was revealed that god would take away
elijah wished to persuade elisha that he had been taken somewhere where
they would find him showing sufficiently clearly that they had not
understood gods revelation aright
62 there is no need to set this out more amply for nothing is more plain
in the bible than that god endowed some prophets with far greater gifts of
prophecy than others 63 but i will show in greater detail and length for
i consider the point more important that the prophecies varied according to
the opinions previously embraced by the prophets and that the prophets held
diverse and even contrary opinions and prejudices 64 i speak be it
understood solely of matters speculative for in regard to uprightness and
morality the case is widely different 65 from thence i shall conclude
that prophecy never rendered the prophets more learned but left them with
their former opinions and that we are therefore not at all bound to
trust them in matters of intellect
66 everyone has been strangely hasty in affirming that the prophets knew
everything within the scope of human intellect and although certain
passages of scripture plainly affirm that the prophets were in certain
respects ignorant such persons would rather say that they do not
understand the passages than admit that there was anything which the
prophets did not know or else they try to wrest the scriptural words away
from their evident meaning
67 if either of these proceedings is allowable we may as well shut our
bibles for vainly shall we attempt to prove anything from them if their
plainest passages may be classed among obscure and impenetrable mysteries
or if we may put any interpretation on them which we fancy 68 for
instance nothing is more clear in the bible than that joshua and perhaps
also the author who wrote his history thought that the sun revolves round
the earth and that the earth is fixed and further that the sun for a
certain period remained still 69 many who will not admit any movement in
the heavenly bodies explain away the passage till it seems to mean
something quite different others who have learned to philosophize more
correctly and understand that the earth moves while the sun is still or at
any rate does not revolve round the earth try with all their might to wrest
this meaning from scripture though plainly nothing of the sort is
intended 70 such quibblers excite my wonder 71 are we forsooth bound
to believe that joshua the soldier was a learned astronomer or that a
miracle could not be revealed to him or that the light of the sun could not
remain longer than usual above the horizon without his knowing the cause
72 to me both alternatives appear ridiculous and therefore i would
rather say that joshua was ignorant of the true cause of the lengthened
day and that he and the whole host with him thought that the sun moved
round the earth every day and that on that particular occasion it stood
still for a time thus causing the light to remain longer and i would
say that they did not conjecture that from the amount of snow in the air
see josh x11 the refraction may have been greater than usual or that
there may have been some other cause which we will not now inquire into
73 so also the sign of the shadow going back was revealed to isaiah
according to his understanding that is as proceeding from a going
backwards of the sun for he too thought that the sun moves and that the
earth is still of parhelia he perhaps never even dreamed 74 we may
arrive at this conclusion without any scruple for the sign could really
have come to pass and have been predicted by isaiah to the king without
the prophet being aware of the real cause
75 with regard to the building of the temple by solomon if it was really
dictated by god we must maintain the same doctrine namely that all the
measurements were revealed according to the opinions and understanding of
the king for as we are not bound to believe that solomon was a
mathematician we may affirm that he was ignorant of the true ratio between
the circumference and the diameter of a circle and that like the
generality of workmen he thought that it was as three to one 76 but if
it is allowable to declare that we do not understand the passage in good
sooth i know nothing in the bible that we can understand for the process of
building is there narrated simply and as a mere matter of history 77 if
again it is permitted to pretend that the passage has another meaning and
was written as it is from some reason unknown to us this is no less than a
complete subversal of the bible for every absurd and evil invention of
human perversity could thus without detriment to scriptural authority be
defended and fostered 78 our conclusion is in no wise impious for though
solomon isaiah joshua c were prophets they were none the less men and
as such not exempt from human shortcomings
79 according to the understanding of noah it was revealed to him that god
as about to destroy the whole human race for noah thought that beyond the
limits of palestine the world was not inhabited
80 not only in matters of this kind but in others more important
the prophets could be and in fact were ignorant for they taught
nothing special about the divine attributes but held quite ordinary
notions about god and to these notions their revelations were adapted
as i will demonstrate by ample scriptural testimony from all which one
may easily see that they were praised and commended not so much for
the sublimity and eminence of their intellect as for their piety and
faithfulness
81 adam the first man to whom god was revealed did not know that he is
omnipotent and omniscient for he hid himself from him and attempted to
make excuses for his fault before god as though he had had to do with a
man therefore to him also was god revealed according to his understanding 
that is as being unaware of his situation or his sin for adam
heard or seemed to hear the lord walking in the garden calling him and
asking him where he was and then on seeing his shamefacedness asking him
whether he had eaten of the forbidden fruit 82 adam evidently only knew
the deity as the creator of all things 83 to cain also god was revealed
according to his understanding as ignorant of human affairs nor was a
higher conception of the deity required for repentance of his sin
83 to laban the lord revealed himself as the god of abraham because laban
believed that each nation had its own special divinity see gen xxxi29
84 abraham also knew not that god is omnipresent and has foreknowledge of
all things for when he heard the sentence against the inhabitants of sodom
he prayed that the lord should not execute it till he had ascertained
whether they all merited such punishment for he said see gen xviii24
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city and in accordance
with this belief god was revealed to him as abraham imagined he spake
thus i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know
85 further the divine testimony concerning abraham asserts nothing but
that he was obedient and that he commanded his household after him that
they should keep the way of the lord gen xviii19 it does not state
that he held sublime conceptions of the deity
86 moses also was not sufficiently aware that god is omniscient and
directs human actions by his sole decree for although god himself says that
the israelites should hearken to him moses still considered the matter
doubtful and repeated but if they will not believe me nor hearken unto my
voice 87 to him in like manner god was revealed as taking no part in
and as being ignorant of future human actions the lord gave him two signs
and said and it shall come to pass that if they will not believe thee
neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the
voice of the latter sign but if not thou shalt take of the water of the
river c 88 indeed if any one considers without prejudice the recorded
opinions of moses he will plainly see that moses conceived the deity as a
being who has always existed does exist and always will exist and for
this cause he calls him by the name jehovah which in hebrew signifies these
three phases of existence as to his nature moses only taught that he is
merciful gracious and exceeding jealous as appears from many passages in
the pentateuch 89 lastly he believed and taught that this being was so
different from all other beings that he could not be expressed by the image
of any visible thing also that he could not be looked upon and that not
so much from inherent impossibility as from human infirmity further that
by reason of his power he was without equal and unique 90 moses admitted
indeed that there were beings doubtless by the plan and command of the
lord who acted as gods vicegerents  that is beings to whom god had given
the right authority and power to direct nations and to provide and care
for them but he taught that this being whom they were bound to obey was
the highest and supreme god or to use the hebrew phrase god of gods and
thus in the song exod xv11 he exclaims who is like unto thee o lord
among the gods and jethro says exod xviii11 now i know that the lord
is greater than all gods 91 that is to say i am at length compelled to
admit to moses that jehovah is greater than all gods and that his power
is unrivalled 92 we must remain in doubt whether moses thought that
these beings who acted as gods vicegerents were created by him for he
has stated nothing so far as we know about their creation and origin 93
he further taught that this being had brought the visible world into order
from chaos and had given nature her germs and therefore that he
possesses supreme right and power over all things further that by reason
of this supreme right and power he had chosen for himself alone the hebrew
nation and a certain strip of territory and had handed over to the care of
other gods substituted by himself the rest of the nations and territories
and that therefore he was called the god of israel and the god of jerusalem
whereas the other gods were called the gods of the gentiles 94 for this
reason the jews believed that the strip of territory which god had chosen
for himself demanded a divine worship quite apart and different from the
worship which obtained elsewhere and that the lord would not suffer the
worship of other gods adapted to other countries 95 thus they thought
that the people whom the king of assyria had brought into judaea were torn
in pieces by lions because they knew not the worship of the national
divinity 2 kings xvii25
96 jacob according to aben ezras opinion therefore admonished his sons
when he wished them to seek out a new country that they should prepare
themselves for a new worship and lay aside the worship of strange gods 
that is of the gods of the land where they were gen xxxv2 3
97 david in telling saul that he was compelled by the kings persecution
to live away from his country said that he was driven out from the heritage
of the lord and sent to worship other gods 1 sam xxvi19 98 lastly
he believed that this being or deity had his habitation in the heavens
deut xxxiii27 an opinion very common among the gentiles
99 if we now examine the revelations to moses we shall find that they
were accommodated to these opinions as he believed that the divine nature
was subject to the conditions of mercy graciousness c so god was
revealed to him in accordance with his idea and under these attributes see
exodus xxxiv6 7 and the second commandment 100 further it is related
ex xxxiii18 that moses asked of god that he might behold him but as
moses as we have said had formed no mental image of god and god as i
have shown only revealed himself to the prophets in accordance with the
disposition of their imagination he did not reveal himself in any form
101 this i repeat was because the imagination of moses was unsuitable
for other prophets bear witness that they saw the lord for instance
isaiah ezekiel daniel c 102 for this reason god answered moses thou
canst not see my face and inasmuch as moses believed that god can be
looked upon  that is that no contradiction of the divine nature is therein
involved for otherwise he would never have preferred his request  it is
added for no one shall look on me and live thus giving a reason in
accordance with moses idea for it is not stated that a contradiction of
the divine nature would be involved as was really the case but that the
thing would not come to pass because of human infirmity
103 when god would reveal to moses that the israelites because they
worshipped the calf were to be placed in the same category as other
nations he said ch xxxiii2 3 that he would send an angel that is a
being who should have charge of the israelites instead of the supreme
being and that he himself would no longer remain among them thus leaving
moses no ground for supposing that the israelites were more beloved by god
than the other nations whose guardianship he had entrusted to other beings
or angels vide verse 16
104 lastly as moses believed that god dwelt in the heavens god was
revealed to him as coming down from heaven on to a mountain and in order to
talk with the lord moses went up the mountain which he certainly need not
have done if he could have conceived of god as omnipresent
105 the israelites knew scarcely anything of god although he was revealed
to them and this is abundantly evident from their transferring a few days
afterwards the honour and worship due to him to a calf which they believed
to be the god who had brought them out of egypt 106 in truth it is
hardly likely that men accustomed to the superstitions of egypt
uncultivated and sunk in most abject slavery should have held any sound
notions about the deity or that moses should have taught them anything
beyond a rule of right living inculcating it not like a philosopher as the
result of freedom but like a lawgiver compelling them to be moral by
legal authority 107 thus the rule of right living the worship and love
of god was to them rather a bondage than the true liberty the gift and
grace of the deity 108 moses bid them love god and keep his law because
they had in the past received benefits from him such as the
deliverance from slavery in egypt and further terrified them with threats
if they transgressed his commands holding out many promises of good if they
should observe them thus treating them as parents treat irrational
children it is therefore certain that they knew not the excellence of
virtue and the true happiness
109 jonah thought that he was fleeing from the sight of god which seems
to show that he too held that god had entrusted the care of the nations
outside judaea to other substituted powers 110 no one in the whole of the
old testament speaks more rationally of god than solomon who in fact
surpassed all the men of his time in natural ability 111 yet he
considered himself above the law esteeming it only to have been given for
men without reasonable and intellectual grounds for their actions and made
small account of the laws concerning kings which are mainly three nay he
openly violated them in this he did wrong and acted in a manner unworthy
of a philosopher by indulging in sensual pleasure and taught that all
fortunes favours to mankind are vanity that humanity has no nobler gift
than wisdom and no greater punishment than folly
112 see proverbs xvi22 23
113 but let us return to the prophets whose conflicting opinions we have
undertaken to note
114 the expressed ideas of ezekiel seemed so diverse from those of
moses to the rabbis who have left us the extant prophetic books as is
told in the treatise of sabbathus i13 2 that they had serious
thoughts of omitting his prophecy from the canon and would doubtless
have thus excluded it if a certain hananiah had not undertaken to
explain it a task which as is there narrated he with great zeal and
labour accomplished 115 how he did so does not sufficiently appear
whether it was by writing a commentary which has now perished or by
altering ezekiels words and audaciously striking out phrases according
to his fancy 116 however this may be chapter xviii certainly does
not seem to agree with exodus xxxiv7 jeremiah xxxii18 c
117  samuel believed that the lord never repented of anything he had
decreed 1 sam xv29 for when saul was sorry for his sin and wished to
worship god and ask for forgiveness samuel said that the lord would not go
back from his decree
118 to jeremiah on the other hand it was revealed that if that nation
against whom i the lord have pronounced turn from their evil i will
repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them 119 if it do evil in my
sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent of the good wherewith i
said i would benefit them jer xviii810 120 joel ii13 taught that
the lord repented him only of evil 121 lastly it is clear from gen iv 7
that a man can overcome the temptations of sin and act righteously for
this doctrine is told to cain though as we learn from josephus and the
scriptures he never did so overcome them 122 and this agrees with the
chapter of jeremiah just cited for it is there said that the lord repents
of the good or the evil pronounced if the men in question change their ways
and manner of life 123 but on the other hand paul romix10 teaches
as plainly as possible that men have no control over the temptations of the
flesh save by the special vocation and grace of god 124 and when
rom iii5 and vi19 he attributes righteousness to man he corrects
himself as speaking merely humanly and through the infirmity of the flesh
125 we have now more than sufficiently proved our point that god adapted
revelations to the understanding and opinions of the prophets and that in
matters of theory without bearing on charity or morality the prophets could
be and in fact were ignorant and held conflicting opinions 126 it
therefore follows that we must by no means go to the prophets for knowledge
either of natural or of spiritual phenomena
127 we have determined then that we are only bound to believe in the
prophetic writings the object and substance of the revelation with regard
to the details every one may believe or not as he likes
128 for instance the revelation to cain only teaches us that god
admonished him to lead the true life for such alone is the object and
substance of the revelation not doctrines concerning free will and
philosophy 129 hence though the freedom of the will is clearly implied
in the words of the admonition we are at liberty to hold a contrary
opinion since the words and reasons were adapted to the understanding of
cain
130 so too the revelation to micaiah would only teach that god revealed
to him the true issue of the battle between ahab and aram and this is all
we are bound to believe 131 whatever else is contained in the revelation
concerning the true and the false spirit of god the army of heaven standing
on the right hand and on the left and all the other details does not
affect us at all 132 everyone may believe as much of it as his reason
allows
132 the reasonings by which the lord displayed his power to job if they
really were a revelation and the author of the history is narrating and
not merely as some suppose rhetorically adorning his own conceptions
would come under the same category  that is they were adapted to jobs
understanding for the purpose of convincing him and are not universal
or for the convincing of all men
133 we can come to no different conclusion with respect to the reasonings
of christ by which he convicted the pharisees of pride and ignorance and
exhorted his disciples to lead the true life 134 he adapted them to each
mans opinions and principles 135 for instance when he said to the
pharisees matt xii26 and if satan cast out devils his house is
divided against itself how then shall his kingdom stand 136 he only
wished to convince the pharisees according to their own principles not to
teach that there are devils or any kingdom of devils 137 so too
when he said to his disciples matt viii10 see that ye despise not one
of these little ones for i say unto you that their angels c he merely
desired to warn them against pride and despising any of their fellows not
to insist on the actual reason given which was simply adopted in order to
persuade them more easily
138 lastly we should say exactly the same of the apostolic signs and
reasonings but there is no need to go further into the subject 139 if i
were to enumerate all the passages of scripture addressed only to
individuals or to a particular mans understanding and which cannot
without great danger to philosophy be defended as divine doctrines i
should go far beyond the brevity at which i aim 140 let it suffice then
to have indicated a few instances of general application and let the
curious reader consider others by himself 141 although the points we
have just raised concerning prophets and prophecy are the only ones which
have any direct bearing on the end in view namely the separation of
philosophy from theology still as i have touched on the general question
i may here inquire whether the gift of prophecy was peculiar to the hebrews
or whether it was common to all nations 142 i must then come to a
conclusion about the vocation of the hebrews all of which i shall do in the
ensuing chapter
chapter iii  of the vocation of the hebrews and
whether the gift of prophecy was peculiar to them
1 every mans true happiness and blessedness consist solely in the
enjoyment of what is good not in the pride that he alone is enjoying it to
the exclusion of others 2 he who thinks himself the more blessed because
he is enjoying benefits which others are not or because he is more blessed
or more fortunate than his fellows is ignorant of true happiness and
blessedness and the joy which he feels is either childish or envious and
malicious 3 for instance a mans true happiness consists only in wisdom
and the knowledge of the truth not at all in the fact that he is wiser than
others or that others lack such knowledge such considerations do not
increase his wisdom or true happiness
4 whoever therefore rejoices for such reasons rejoices in anothers
misfortune and is so far malicious and bad knowing neither true
happiness nor the peace of the true life
5 when scripture therefore in exhorting the hebrews to obey the law
says that the lord has chosen them for himself before other nations
deut x15 that he is near them but not near others deut iv7 that
to them alone he has given just laws deut iv8 and lastly that he has
marked them out before others deut iv32 it speaks only according to the
understanding of its hearers who as we have shown in the last chapter and
as moses also testifies deut ix6 7 knew not true blessedness 6 for
in good sooth they would have been no less blessed if god had called all men
equally to salvation nor would god have been less present to them for being
equally present to others their laws would have been no less just if they
had been ordained for all and they themselves would have been no less wise
7 the miracles would have shown gods power no less by being wrought for
other nations also lastly the hebrews would have been just as much bound
to worship god if he had bestowed all these gifts equally on all men
8 when god tells solomon 1 kings iii12 that no one shall be as wise as
he in time to come it seems to be only a manner of expressing surpassing
wisdom it is little to be believed that god would have promised solomon
for his greater happiness that he would never endow anyone with so much
wisdom in time to come this would in no wise have increased solomons
intellect and the wise king would have given equal thanks to the lord if
everyone had been gifted with the same faculties
9 still though we assert that moses in the passages of the pentateuch
just cited spoke only according to the understanding of the hebrews we
have no wish to deny that god ordained the mosaic law for them alone nor
that he spoke to them alone nor that they witnessed marvels beyond those
which happened to any other nation but we wish to emphasize that
moses desired to admonish the hebrews in such a manner and with such
reasonings as would appeal most forcibly to their childish understanding
and constrain them to worship the deity 10 further we wished to show
that the hebrews did not surpass other nations in knowledge or in piety
but evidently in some attribute different from these or to speak like the
scriptures according to their understanding that the hebrews were not
chosen by god before others for the sake of the true life and sublime ideas
though they were often thereto admonished but with some other object 11
what that object was i will duly show
12 but before i begin i wish in a few words to explain what i mean by the
guidance of god by the help of god external and inward and lastly what
i understand by fortune
13 by the help of god i mean the fixed and unchangeable order of nature
or the chain of natural events for i have said before and shown elsewhere
that the universal laws of nature according to which all things exist and
are determined are only another name for the eternal decrees of god which
always involve eternal truth and necessity
14 so that to say that everything happens according to natural laws and
to say that everything is ordained by the decree and ordinance of god is
the same thing 15 now since the power in nature is identical with the
power of god by which alone all things happen and are determined it
follows that whatsoever man as a part of nature provides himself with to
aid and preserve his existence or whatsoever nature affords him without his
help is given to him solely by the divine power acting either through
human nature or through external circumstance 16 so whatever human nature
can furnish itself with by its own efforts to preserve its existence may
be fitly called the inward aid of god whereas whatever else accrues to
mans profit from outward causes may be called the external aid of god
17 we can now easily understand what is meant by the election of god 18
for since no one can do anything save by the predetermined order of nature
that is by gods eternal ordinance and decree it follows that no one can
choose a plan of life for himself or accomplish any work save by gods
vocation choosing him for the work or the plan of life in question rather
than any other 19 lastly by fortune i mean the ordinance of god in so
far as it directs human life through external and unexpected means 20
with these preliminaries i return to my purpose of discovering the reason
why the hebrews were said to be elected by god before other nations and
with the demonstration i thus proceed
21 all objects of legitimate desire fall generally speaking under one
of these three categories
    1 the knowledge of things through their primary causes
    2 the government of the passions or the acquirement of the habit of
       virtue
    3 secure and healthy life
22 the means which most directly conduce towards the first two of these
ends and which may be considered their proximate and efficient causes are
contained in human nature itself so that their acquisition hinges only on
our own power and on the laws of human nature 23 it may be concluded
that these gifts are not peculiar to any nation but have always been shared
by the whole human race unless indeed we would indulge the dream that
nature formerly created men of different kinds 24 but the means which
conduce to security and health are chiefly in external circumstance and are
called the gifts of fortune because they depend chiefly on objective causes
of which we are ignorant for a fool may be almost as liable to happiness
or unhappiness as a wise man 25 nevertheless human management and
watchfulness can greatly assist towards living in security and warding off
the injuries of our fellowmen and even of beasts 26 reason and
experience show no more certain means of attaining this object than
the formation of a society with fixed laws the occupation of a strip of
territory and the concentration of all forces as it were into one body
that is the social body 27 now for forming and preserving a society no
ordinary ability and care is required that society will be most
secure most stable and least liable to reverses which is founded and
directed by farseeing and careful men while on the other hand a society
constituted by men without trained skill depends in a great measure on
fortune and is less constant 28 if in spite of all such a society
lasts a long time it is owing to some other directing influence than its
own if it overcomes great perils and its affairs prosper it will perforce
marvel at and adore the guiding spirit of god in so far that is as god
works through hidden means and not through the nature and mind of man
for everything happens to it unexpectedly and contrary to anticipation it
may even be said and thought to be by miracle 29 nations then are
distinguished from one another in respect to the social organization and the
laws under which they live and are governed the hebrew nation was not
chosen by god in respect to its wisdom nor its tranquillity of mind but in
respect to its social organization and the good fortune with which it
obtained supremacy and kept it so many years 30 this is abundantly clear
from scripture even a cursory perusal will show us that the only respects
in which the hebrews surpassed other nations are in their successful
conduct of matters relating to government and in their surmounting great
perils solely by gods external aid in other ways they were on a par with
their fellows and god was equally gracious to all 31 for in respect to
intellect as we have shown in the last chapter they held very ordinary
ideas about god and nature so that they cannot have been gods chosen in
this respect nor were they so chosen in respect of virtue and the true
life for here again they with the exception of a very few elect were on
an equality with other nations therefore their choice and vocation
consisted only in the temporal happiness and advantages of independent rule
32 in fact we do not see that god promised anything beyond this to the
patriarchs endnote 4 or their successors in the law no other reward is
offered for obedience than the continual happiness of an independent
commonwealth and other goods of this life while on the other hand against
contumacy and the breaking of the covenant is threatened the downfall of the
commonwealth and great hardships 33 nor is this to be wondered at for
the ends of every social organization and commonwealth are as appears from
what we have said and as we will explain more at length hereafter security
and comfort a commonwealth can only exist by the laws being binding on all
34 if all the members of a state wish to disregard the law by that very
fact they dissolve the state and destroy the commonwealth 35 thus the
only reward which could be promised to the hebrews for continued obedience
to the law was security endnote 5 and its attendant advantages while no
surer punishment could be threatened for disobedience than the ruin of the
state and the evils which generally follow therefrom in addition to such
further consequences as might accrue to the jews in particular from the ruin
of their especial state 36 but there is no need here to go into this
point at more length 37 i will only add that the laws of the old
testament were revealed and ordained to the jews only for as god chose them
in respect to the special constitution of their society and government they
must of course have had special laws 38 whether god ordained special
laws for other nations also and revealed himself to their lawgivers
prophetically that is under the attributes by which the latter were
accustomed to imagine him i cannot sufficiently determine 39 it is
evident from scripture itself that other nations acquired supremacy and
particular laws by the external aid of god witness only the two following
passages
40 in genesis xiv18 19 20 it is related that melchisedek was king of
jerusalem and priest of the most high god that in exercise of his priestly
functions he blessed abraham and that abraham the beloved of the lord gave
to this priest of god a tithe of all his spoils 41 this sufficiently
shows that before he founded the israelitish nation god constituted kings
and priests in jerusalem and ordained for them rites and laws 42 whether
he did so prophetically is as i have said not sufficiently clear but i am
sure of this that abraham whilst he sojourned in the city lived
scrupulously according to these laws for abraham had received no special
rites from god and yet it is stated gen xxvi5 that he observed the
worship the precepts the statutes and the laws of god which must be
interpreted to mean the worship the statutes the precepts and the laws of
king melchisedek 43 malachi chides the jews as follows i1011 who
is there among you that will shut the doors of the temple neither do ye
kindle fire on mine altar for nought 44 i have no pleasure in you saith
the lord of hosts 45 for from the rising of the sun even until the going
down of the same my name shall be great among the gentiles and in every
place incense shall be offered in my name and a pure offering for my name
is great among the heathen saith the lord of hosts 46 these words
which unless we do violence to them could only refer to the current
period abundantly testify that the jews of that time were not more beloved
by god than other nations that god then favoured other nations with more
miracles than he vouchsafed to the jews who had then partly recovered their
empire without miraculous aid and lastly that the gentiles possessed
rites and ceremonies acceptable to god 47 but i pass over these points
lightly it is enough for my purpose to have shown that the election of the
jews had regard to nothing but temporal physical happiness and freedom in
other words autonomous government and to the manner and means by which
they obtained it consequently to the laws in so far as they were
necessary to the preservation of that special government and lastly to
the manner in which they were revealed in regard to other matters wherein
mans true happiness consists they were on a par with the rest of the
nations
48 when therefore it is said in scripture deut iv7 that the lord is
not so nigh to any other nation as he is to the jews reference is only made
to their government and to the period when so many miracles happened to
them for in respect of intellect and virtue  that is in respect of
blessedness  god was as we have said already and are now demonstrating
equally gracious to all 49 scripture itself bears testimony to this fact
for the psalmist says cxlv18 the lord is near unto all them that call
upon him to all that call upon him in truth 50 so in the same psalm
verse 9 the lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all
his works in ps xxxiii16 it is clearly stated that god has granted to
all men the same intellect in these words he fashioneth their hearts
alike the heart was considered by the hebrews as i suppose everyone
knows to be the seat of the soul and the intellect
51 lastly from job xxxviii28 it is plain that god had ordained for the
whole human race the law to reverence god to keep from evil doing or to do
well and that job although a gentile was of all men most acceptable to
god because he exceeded all in piety and religion 52 lastly from jonah
iv2 it is very evident that not only to the jews but to all men god was
gracious merciful longsuffering and of great goodness and repented him
of the evil for jonah says therefore i determined to flee before unto
tarshish for i know that thou art a gracious god and merciful slow to
anger and of great kindness c and that therefore god would pardon
the ninevites 53 we conclude therefore inasmuch as god is to all men
equally gracious and the hebrews were only chosen by him in respect to
their social organization and government that the individual jew taken
apart from his social organization and government possessed no
gift of god above other men and that there was no difference between jew
and gentile 54 as it is a fact that god is equally gracious merciful
and the rest to all men and as the function of the prophet was to teach
men not so much the laws of their country as true virtue and to exhort
them thereto it is not to be doubted that all nations possessed prophets
and that the prophetic gift was not peculiar to the jews 55 indeed
history both profane and sacred bears witness to the fact 56 although
from the sacred histories of the old testament it is not evident that the
other nations had as many prophets as the hebrews or that any gentile
prophet was expressly sent by god to the nations this does not affect the
question for the hebrews were careful to record their own affairs not
those of other nations 57 it suffices then that we find in the old
testament gentiles and uncircumcised as noah enoch abimelech
balaam c exercising prophetic gifts further that hebrew prophets were
sent by god not only to their own nation but to many others also 58
ezekiel prophesied to all the nations then known obadiah to none that we
are aware of save the idumeans and jonah was chiefly the prophet to the
ninevites 59 isaiah bewails and predicts the calamities and hails the
restoration not only of the jews but also of other nations for he says
chap xvi9 therefore i will bewail jazer with weeping and in chap
xix he foretells first the calamities and then the restoration of
the egyptians see verses 19 20 21 25 saying that god shall send them a
saviour to free them that the lord shall be known in egypt and further
that the egyptians shall worship god with sacrifice and oblation and at
last he calls that nation the blessed egyptian people of god all of which
particulars are specially noteworthy
60 jeremiah is called not the prophet of the hebrew nation but simply
the prophet of the nations see jer i5 61 he also mournfully foretells
the calamities of the nations and predicts their restoration for he says
xlviii 31 of the moabites therefore will i howl for moab and i will
cry out for all moab verse 36 and therefore mine heart shall sound
for moab like pipes in the end he prophesies their restoration as also
the restoration of the egyptians ammonites and elamites 62 wherefore it
is beyond doubt that other nations also like the jews had their
prophets who prophesied to them
63 although scripture only makes mention of one man balaam to whom the
future of the jews and the other nations was revealed we must not suppose
that balaam prophesied only once for from the narrative itself it is
abundantly clear that he had long previously been famous for prophesy and
other divine gifts 64 for when balak bade him to come to him he said
num xxii6 for i know that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he
whom thou cursest is cursed 65 thus we see that he possessed the gift
which god had bestowed on abraham further as accustomed to prophesy
balaam bade the messengers wait for him till the will of the lord was
revealed to him 66 when he prophesied that is when he interpreted
the true mind of god he was wont to say this of himself he hath said
which heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the most high which
saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes
open 67 further after he had blessed the hebrews by the command of god
he began as was his custom to prophesy to other nations and to predict
their future all of which abundantly shows that he had always been a
prophet or had often prophesied and as we may also remark here possessed
that which afforded the chief certainty to prophets of the truth of their
prophecy namely a mind turned wholly to what is right and good for he did
not bless those whom he wished to bless nor curse those whom he wished to
curse as balak supposed but only those whom god wished to be blessed or
cursed 68 thus he answered balak if balak should give me his house full
of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord to do
either good or bad of my own mind but what the lord saith that will i
speak 69 as for god being angry with him in the way the same happened
to moses when he set out to egypt by the command of the lord and as to his
receiving money for prophesying samuel did the same 1 sam ix7 8 if in
anyway he sinned there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and
sinneth not eccles vii20 vide 2 epist peter ii15 16 and
jude 511
70 his speeches must certainly have had much weight with god and his
power for cursing must assuredly have been very great from the number of
times that we find stated in scripture in proof of gods great mercy to the
jews that god would not hear balaam and that he changed the cursing to
blessing see deut xxiii6 josh xxiv10 neh xiii2 71 wherefore he
was without doubt most acceptable to god for the speeches and cursings of
the wicked move god not at all 72 as then he was a true prophet and
nevertheless joshua calls him a soothsayer or augur it is certain that this
title had an honourable signification and that those whom the gentiles
called augurs and soothsayers were true prophets while those whom scripture
often accuses and condemns were false soothsayers who deceived the
gentiles as false prophets deceived the jews indeed this is made evident
from other passages in the bible whence we conclude that the gift of
prophecy was not peculiar to the jews but common to all nations 73 the
pharisees however vehemently contend that this divine gift was peculiar to
their nation and that the other nations foretold the future what will
superstition invent next by some unexplained diabolical faculty 74 the
principal passage of scripture which they cite by way of confirming their
theory with its authority is exodus xxxiii16 where moses says to god
for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace
in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be
separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of
the earth 75 from this they would infer that moses asked of god that he
should be present to the jews and should reveal himself to them
prophetically further that he should grant this favour to no other nation
76 it is surely absurd that moses should have been jealous of gods
presence among the gentiles or that he should have dared to ask any such
thing 77 the fact is as moses knew that the disposition and spirit of his
nation was rebellious he clearly saw that they could not carry out what
they had begun without very great miracles and special external aid from
god nay that without such aid they must necessarily perish as it was
evident that god wished them to be preserved he asked for this special
external aid 78 thus he says ex xxxiv9 if now i have found grace in
thy sight o lord let my lord i pray thee go among us for it is a
stiffnecked people 79 the reason therefore for his seeking special
external aid from god was the stiffneckedness of the people and it is made
still more plain that he asked for nothing beyond this special external aid
by gods answer  for god answered at once verse 10 of the same chapter 
behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as
have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation 80 therefore
moses had in view nothing beyond the special election of the jews as i have
explained it and made no other request to god 81 i confess that in
pauls epistle to the romans i find another text which carries more weight
namely where paul seems to teach a different doctrine from that here set
down for he there says rom iii1 what advantage then hath the jew or
what profit is there of circumcision 82 much every way chiefly because
that unto them were committed the oracles of god
83 but if we look to the doctrine which paul especially desired to teach
we shall find nothing repugnant to our present contention on the contrary
his doctrine is the same as ours for he says rom iii29 that god is the
god of the jews and of the gentiles and ch ii25 26 but
if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision
84 therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law
shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision 85 further in
chap ivverse 9 he says that all alike jew and gentile were under sin
and that without commandment and law there is no sin 86 wherefore it is
most evident that to all men absolutely was revealed the law under which all
lived  namely the law which has regard only to true virtue not the law
established in respect to and in the formation of a particular state and
adapted to the disposition of a particular people 87 lastly paul
concludes that since god is the god of all nations that is is equally
gracious to all and since all men equally live under the law and under sin
so also to all nations did god send his christ to free all men equally from
the bondage of the law that they should no more do right by the
command of the law but by the constant determination of their hearts 88
so that paul teaches exactly the same as ourselves 89 when therefore he
says to the jews only were entrusted the oracles of god we must either
understand that to them only were the laws entrusted in writing while they
were given to other nations merely in revelation and conception or else as
none but jews would object to the doctrine he desired to advance that paul
was answering only in accordance with the understanding and current ideas of
the jews for in respect to teaching things which he had partly seen partly
heard he was to the greeks a greek and to the jews a jew
90 it now only remains to us to answer the arguments of those who would
persuade themselves that the election of the jews was not temporal and
merely in respect of their commonwealth but eternal for they say we see
the jews after the loss of their commonwealth and after being scattered so
many years and separated from all other nations still surviving which is
without parallel among other peoples and further the scriptures seem to
teach that god has chosen for himself the jews for ever so that though they
have lost their commonwealth they still nevertheless remain gods elect
91 the passages which they think teach most clearly this eternal election are chiefly
1 jer xxxi36 where the prophet testifies that the seed of israel
shall for ever remain the nation of god comparing them with the
stability of the heavens and nature
2 ezek xx32 where the prophet seems to intend that though the jews
wanted after the help afforded them to turn their backs on the worship of
the lord that god would nevertheless gather them together again from all
the lands in which they were dispersed and lead them to the wilderness of
the peoples  as he had led their fathers to the wilderness of the land of
egypt  and would at length after purging out from among them the rebels
and transgressors bring them thence to his holy mountain where the whole
house of israel should worship him other passages are also cited
especially by the pharisees but i think i shall satisfy everyone if i
answer these two and this i shall easily accomplish after showing from
scripture itself that god chose not the hebrews for ever but only on the
condition under which he had formerly chosen the canaanites for these last
as we have shown had priests who religiously worshipped god and whom god
at length rejected because of their luxury pride and corrupt worship
92 moses lev xviii27 warned the israelites that they be not polluted
with whoredoms lest the land spue them out as it had spued out the nations
who had dwelt there before and in deut viii19 20 in the plainest terms
he threatens their total ruin for he says i testify against you that ye
shall surely perish 93 as the nations which the lord destroyeth before
your face so shall ye perish in like manner many other passages are found
in the law which expressly show that god chose the hebrews neither
absolutely nor for ever 94 if then the prophets foretold for them a new
covenant of the knowledge of god love and grace such a promise is easily
proved to be only made to the elect for ezekiel in the chapter which we
have just quoted expressly says that god will separate from them the
rebellious and transgressors and zephaniah iii12 13 says that god
will take away the proud from the midst of them and leave the poor 95
now inasmuch as their election has regard to true virtue it is not to be
thought that it was promised to the jews alone to the exclusion of others
but we must evidently believe that the true gentile prophets and every
nation as we have shown possessed such promised the same to the faithful
of their own people who were thereby comforted 96 wherefore this eternal
covenant of the knowledge of god and love is universal as is clear
moreover from zeph iii10 11 no difference in this respect can be
admitted between jew and gentile nor did the former enjoy any special
election beyond that which we have pointed out
97 when the prophets in speaking of this election which regards only true
virtue mixed up much concerning sacrifices and ceremonies and the
rebuilding of the temple and city they wished by such figurative
expressions after the manner and nature of prophecy to expound matters
spiritual so as at the same time to show to the jews whose prophets they
were the true restoration of the state and of the temple to be expected
about the time of cyrus
98 at the present time therefore there is absolutely nothing which the
jews can arrogate to themselves beyond other people
99 as to their continuance so long after dispersion and the loss of
empire there is nothing marvellous in it for they so separated themselves
from every other nation as to draw down upon themselves universal hate not
only by their outward rites rites conflicting with those of other nations
but also by the sign of circumcision which they most scrupulously observe
100 that they have been preserved in great measure by gentile hatred
experience demonstrates 101 when the king of spain formerly
compelled the jews to embrace the state religion or to go into exile a
large number of jews accepted catholicism 102 now as these renegades
were admitted to all the native privileges of spaniards and deemed worthy
of filling all honourable offices it came to pass that they straightway
became so intermingled with the spaniards as to leave of themselves no relic
or remembrance 103 but exactly the opposite happened to those whom the
king of portugal compelled to become christians for they always though
converted lived apart inasmuch as they were considered unworthy of any
civic honours
104 the sign of circumcision is as i think so important that i could
persuade myself that it alone would preserve the nation for ever 105 nay
i would go so far as to believe that if the foundations of their religion
have not emasculated their minds they may even if occasion offers so
changeable are human affairs raise up their empire afresh and that god may
a second time elect them
106 of such a possibility we have a very famous example in the chinese
107 they too have some distinctive mark on their heads which they most
scrupulously observe and by which they keep themselves apart from everyone
else and have thus kept themselves during so many thousand years that they
far surpass all other nations in antiquity 108 they have not always
retained empire but they have recovered it when lost and doubtless will do
so again after the spirit of the tartars becomes relaxed through the luxury
of riches and pride
109 lastly if any one wishes to maintain that the jews from this or from
any other cause have been chosen by god for ever i will not gainsay him if
he will admit that this choice whether temporary or eternal has no regard
in so far as it is peculiar to the jews to aught but dominion and physical
advantages for by such alone can one nation be distinguished from
another whereas in regard to intellect and true virtue every nation is on
a par with the rest and god has not in these respects chosen one people
rather than another
chapter iv  of the divine law
1 the word law taken in the abstract means that by which an individual
or all things or as many things as belong to a particular species act in
one and the same fixed and definite manner which manner depends either on
natural necessity or on human decree 2 a law which depends on natural
necessity is one which necessarily follows from the nature or from the
definition of the thing in question a law which depends on human decree
and which is more correctly called an ordinance is one which men have laid
down for themselves and others in order to live more safely or conveniently
or from some similar reason
3 for example the law that all bodies impinging on lesser bodies lose as
much of their own motion as they communicate to the latter is a universal
law of all bodies and depends on natural necessity 4 so too the law
that a man in remembering one thing straightway remembers another either
like it or which he had perceived simultaneously with it is a law which
necessarily follows from the nature of man 5 but the law that men must
yield or be compelled to yield somewhat of their natural right and that
they bind themselves to live in a certain way depends on human decree 6
now though i freely admit that all things are predetermined by universal
natural laws to exist and operate in a given fixed and definite
manner i still assert that the laws i have just mentioned depend on human
decree
1 7 because man in so far as he is a part of nature constitutes a
part of the power of nature 8 whatever therefore follows necessarily
from the necessity of human nature that is from nature herself in so far
as we conceive of her as acting through man follows even though it be
necessarily from human power 9 hence the sanction of such laws may very
well be said to depend on mans decree for it principally depends on the
power of the human mind so that the human mind in respect to its perception
of things as true and false can readily be conceived as without such laws
but not without necessary law as we have just defined it
2 10 i have stated that these laws depend on human decree because it is
well to define and explain things by their proximate causes 11 the
general consideration of fate and the concatenation of causes would aid us
very little in forming and arranging our ideas concerning particular
questions 12 let us add that as to the actual coordination and
concatenation of things that is how things are ordained and linked
together we are obviously ignorant therefore it is more profitable for
right living nay it is necessary for us to consider things as contingent
13 so much about law in the abstract
14 now the word law seems to be only applied to natural phenomena by
analogy and is commonly taken to signify a command which men can either
obey or neglect inasmuch as it restrains human nature within certain
originally exceeded limits and therefore lays down no rule beyond human
strength 15 thus it is expedient to define law more particularly as a
plan of life laid down by man for himself or others with a certain object
16 however as the true object of legislation is only perceived by a few
and most men are almost incapable of grasping it though they live under its
conditions legislators with a view to exacting general obedience have
wisely put forward another object very different from that which
necessarily follows from the nature of law they promise to the observers of
the law that which the masses chiefly desire and threaten its violators
with that which they chiefly fear thus endeavouring to restrain the masses
as far as may be like a horse with a curb whence it follows that the word
law is chiefly applied to the modes of life enjoined on men by the sway of
others hence those who obey the law are said to live under it and to be
under compulsion 17 in truth a man who renders everyone their due
because he fears the gallows acts under the sway and compulsion of others
and cannot be called just 18 but a man who does the same from a knowledge
of the true reason for laws and their necessity acts from a firm purpose
and of his own accord and is therefore properly called just 19 this i
take it is pauls meaning when he says that those who live under the law
cannot be justified through the law for justice as commonly defined is
the constant and perpetual will to render every man his due 20 thus
solomon says prov xxi15 it is a joy to the just to do judgment but
the wicked fear
21 law then being a plan of living which men have for a certain object
laid down for themselves or others may as it seems be divided into human
law and divine law
22 by human law i mean a plan of living which serves only to render life
and the state secure 23 by divine law i mean that which only regards the
highest good in other words the true knowledge of god and love
24 i call this law divine because of the nature of the highest good which
i will here shortly explain as clearly as i can
25 inasmuch as the intellect is the best part of our being it is evident
that we should make every effort to perfect it as far as possible if we
desire to search for what is really profitable to us 26 for in
intellectual perfection the highest good should consist 27 now since all
our knowledge and the certainty which removes every doubt depend solely on
the knowledge of god firstly because without god nothing can exist or be
conceived secondly because so long as we have no clear and distinct idea
of god we may remain in universal doubt  it follows that our highest good
and perfection also depend solely on the knowledge of god 28 further
since without god nothing can exist or be conceived it is evident that all
natural phenomena involve and express the conception of god as far as their
essence and perfection extend so that we have greater and more perfect
knowledge of god in proportion to our knowledge of natural phenomena
conversely since the knowledge of an effect through its cause is the same
thing as the knowledge of a particular property of a cause the greater our
knowledge of natural phenomena the more perfect is our knowledge of the
essence of god which is the cause of all things 29 so then our
highest good not only depends on the knowledge of god but wholly consists
therein and it further follows that man is perfect or the reverse in
proportion to the nature and perfection of the object of his special desire
hence the most perfect and the chief sharer in the highest blessedness is he
who prizes above all else and takes especial delight in the intellectual
knowledge of god the most perfect being
30 hither then our highest good and our highest blessedness aim 
namely to the knowledge and love of god therefore the means demanded by
this aim of all human actions that is by god in so far as the idea of him
is in us may be called the commands of god because they proceed as it
were from god himself inasmuch as he exists in our minds and the plan of
life which has regard to this aim may be fitly called the law of god
31 the nature of the means and the plan of life which this aim demands
how the foundations of the best states follow its lines and how mens life
is conducted are questions pertaining to general ethics 32 here i only
proceed to treat of the divine law in a particular application
33 as the love of god is mans highest happiness and blessedness and the
ultimate end and aim of all human actions it follows that he alone lives by
the divine law who loves god not from fear of punishment or from love of
any other object such as sensual pleasure fame or the like but solely
because he has knowledge of god or is convinced that the knowledge and love
of god is the highest good 34 the sum and chief precept then of the
divine law is to love god as the highest good namely as we have said not
from fear of any pains and penalties or from the love of any other object
in which we desire to take pleasure 35 the idea of god lays down
the rule that god is our highest good  in other words that the knowledge
and love of god is the ultimate aim to which all our actions should be
directed 36 the worldling cannot understand these things they appear
foolishness to him because he has too meager a knowledge of god and also
because in this highest good he can discover nothing which he can handle or
eat or which affects the fleshly appetites wherein he chiefly delights for
it consists solely in thought and the pure reason 37 they on the other
hand who know that they possess no greater gift than intellect and sound
reason will doubtless accept what i have said without question
38 we have now explained that wherein the divine law chiefly consists and
what are human laws namely all those which have a different aim
unless they have been ratified by revelation for in this respect also
things are referred to god as we have shown above and in this sense the
law of moses although it was not universal but entirely adapted to the
disposition and particular preservation of a single people may yet be
called a law of god or divine law inasmuch as we believe that it was
ratified by prophetic insight 39 if we consider the nature of natural
divine law as we have just explained it we shall see
40 i that it is universal or common to all men for we have deduced it
from universal human nature
41 ii that it does not depend on the truth of any historical narrative
whatsoever for inasmuch as this natural divine law is comprehended solely
by the consideration of human nature it is plain that we can conceive it as
existing as well in adam as in any other man as well in a man living among
his fellows as in a man who lives by himself
42 the truth of a historical narrative however assured cannot give us
the knowledge nor consequently the love of god for love of god springs from
knowledge of him and knowledge of him should be derived from general ideas
in themselves certain and known so that the truth of a historical narrative
is very far from being a necessary requisite for our attaining our highest
good
43 still though the truth of histories cannot give us the knowledge and
love of god i do not deny that reading them is very useful with a view to
life in the world for the more we have observed and known of mens customs
and circumstances which are best revealed by their actions the more warily
we shall be able to order our lives among them and so far as reason
dictates to adapt our actions to their dispositions
44 iii we see that this natural divine law does not demand the
performance of ceremonies  that is actions in themselves indifferent
which are called good from the fact of their institution or actions
symbolizing something profitable for salvation or if one prefers this
definition actions of which the meaning surpasses human understanding 45
the natural light of reason does not demand anything which it is itself
unable to supply but only such as it can very clearly show to be good or a
means to our blessedness 46 such things as are good simply because they
have been commanded or instituted or as being symbols of something good
are mere shadows which cannot be reckoned among actions that are the
offsprings as it were or fruit of a sound mind and of intellect 47 there
is no need for me to go into this now in more detail
48 iv lastly we see that the highest reward of the divine law is the law
itself namely to know god and to love him of our free choice and with an
undivided and fruitful spirit while its penalty is the absence of these
things and being in bondage to the flesh  that is having an inconstant
and wavering spirit
49 these points being noted i must now inquire
50 i whether by the natural light of reason we can conceive of
        god as a lawgiver or potentate ordaining laws for men
51 ii what is the teaching of holy writ concerning this
         natural light of reason and natural law
52 iii with what objects were ceremonies formerly instituted
53 iv lastly what is the good gained by knowing the
         sacred histories and believing them
54 of the first two i will treat in this chapter of the remaining two
in the following one
55 our conclusion about the first is easily deduced from the nature of
gods will which is only distinguished from his understanding in relation
to our intellect  that is the will and the understanding of god are in
reality one and the same and are only distinguished in relation to
our thoughts which we form concerning gods understanding 56 for
instance if we are only looking to the fact that the nature of a triangle
is from eternity contained in the divine nature as an eternal verity we say
that god possesses the idea of a triangle or that he understands the
nature of a triangle but if afterwards we look to the fact that the nature
of a triangle is thus contained in the divine nature solely by the
necessity of the divine nature and not by the necessity of the nature and
essence of a triangle  in fact that the necessity of a triangles essence
and nature in so far as they are conceived of as eternal verities depends
solely on the necessity of the divine nature and intellect we then style
gods will or decree that which before we styled his intellect 57
wherefore we make one and the same affirmation concerning god when we say
that he has from eternity decreed that three angles of a triangle are equal
to two right angles as when we say that he has understood it
58 hence the affirmations and the negations of god always involve
necessity or truth so that for example if god said to adam that he did
not wish him to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil it would have
involved a contradiction that adam should have been able to eat of it and
would therefore have been impossible that he should have so eaten for the
divine command would have involved an eternal necessity and truth 59 but
since scripture nevertheless narrates that god did give this command to
adam and yet that none the less adam ate of the tree we must perforce say
that god revealed to adam the evil which would surely follow if he should
eat of the tree but did not disclose that such evil would of necessity
come to pass 60 thus it was that adam took the revelation to be not an
eternal and necessary truth but a law  that is an ordinance followed by
gain or loss not depending necessarily on the nature of the act performed
but solely on the will and absolute power of some potentate so that the
revelation in question was solely in relation to adam and solely through
his lack of knowledge a law and god was as it were a lawgiver and
potentate 61 from the same cause namely from lack of knowledge the
decalogue in relation to the hebrews was a law for since they knew not the
existence of god as an eternal truth they must have taken as a law that
which was revealed to them in the decalogue namely that god exists and
that god only should be worshipped 62 but if god had spoken to them
without the intervention of any bodily means immediately they would have
perceived it not as a law but as an eternal truth
63 what we have said about the israelites and adam applies also to all
the prophets who wrote laws in gods name  they did not adequately conceive
gods decrees as eternal truths 64 for instance we must say of moses
that from revelation from the basis of what was revealed to him he
perceived the method by which the israelitish nation could best be united in
a particular territory and could form a body politic or state and further
that he perceived the method by which that nation could best be constrained
to obedience but he did not perceive nor was it revealed to him that this
method was absolutely the best nor that the obedience of the people in a
certain strip of territory would necessarily imply the end he had in view
65 wherefore he perceived these things not as eternal truths but as
precepts and ordinances and he ordained them as laws of god and thus it
came to be that he conceived god as a ruler a legislator a king as
merciful just c whereas such qualities are simply attributes of human
nature and utterly alien from the nature of the deity 66thus much we may
affirm of the prophets who wrote laws in the name of god but we must not
affirm it of christ for christ although he too seems to have written laws
in the name of god must be taken to have had a clear and adequate
perception for christ was not so much a prophet as the mouthpiece of god
67 for god made revelations to mankind through christ as he had before
done through angels  that is a created voice visions c 68 it would
be as unreasonable to say that god had accommodated his revelations to the
opinions of christ as that he had before accommodated them to the opinions
of angels that is of a created voice or visions as matters to be revealed
to the prophets a wholly absurd hypothesis 69 moreover christ was sent
to teach not only the jews but the whole human race and therefore it was
not enough that his mind should be accommodated to the opinions the jews
alone but also to the opinion and fundamental teaching common to the whole
human race  in other words to ideas universal and true 70 inasmuch as
god revealed himself to christ or to christs mind immediately and not as
to the prophets through words and symbols we must needs suppose that christ
perceived truly what was revealed in other words he understood it for a
matter is understood when it is perceived simply by the mind without words
or symbols
71 christ then perceived truly and adequately what was revealed and
if he ever proclaimed such revelations as laws he did so because of the
ignorance and obstinacy of the people acting in this respect the part of
god inasmuch as he accommodated himself to the comprehension of the
people and though he spoke somewhat more clearly than the other prophets
yet he taught what was revealed obscurely and generally through parables
especially when he was speaking to those to whom it was not yet given to
understand the kingdom of heaven see matt xiii10 c 72 to those to
whom it was given to understand the mysteries of heaven he doubtless taught
his doctrines as eternal truths and did not lay them down as laws thus
freeing the minds of his hearers from the bondage of that law which he
further confirmed and established 73 paul apparently points to this more
than once eg rom vii6 and iii28 though he never himself seems to
wish to speak openly but to quote his own words rom iii6 and vi19
merely humanly 74 this he expressly states when he calls god just and
it was doubtless in concession to human weakness that he attributes mercy
grace anger and similar qualities to god adapting his language to the
popular mind or as he puts it 1 cor iii1 2 to carnal men 75 in
rom ix18 he teaches undisguisedly that gods auger and mercy depend not
on the actions of men but on gods own nature or will further that no
one is justified by the works of the law but only by faith which he seems
to identify with the full assent of the soul lastly that no one is blessed
unless he have in him the mind of christ rom viii9 whereby he perceives
the laws of god as eternal truths 76 we conclude therefore that god is
described as a lawgiver or prince and styled just merciful c merely in
concession to popular understanding and the imperfection of popular
knowledge that in reality god acts and directs all things simply by the
necessity of his nature and perfection and that his decrees and volitions
are eternal truths and always involve necessity 77 so much for the first
point which i wished to explain and demonstrate
78 passing on to the second point let us search the sacred pages for
their teaching concerning the light of nature and this divine law 79 the
first doctrine we find in the history of the first man where it is narrated
that god commanded adam not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil this seems to mean that god commanded adam to do
and to seek after righteousness because it was good not because the
contrary was evil that is to seek the good for its own sake not from fear
of evil 80 we have seen that he who acts rightly from the true knowledge
and love of right acts with freedom and constancy whereas he who acts from
fear of evil is under the constraint of evil and acts in bondage under
external control 81 so that this commandment of god to adam comprehends
the whole divine natural law and absolutely agrees with the dictates of the
light of nature nay it would be easy to explain on this basis the whole
history or allegory of the first man 82 but i prefer to pass over the
subject in silence because in the first place i cannot be absolutely
certain that my explanation would be in accordance with the intention of the
sacred writer and secondly because many do not admit that this history is
an allegory maintaining it to be a simple narrative of facts 83 it will
be better therefore to adduce other passages of scripture especially such
as were written by him who speaks with all the strength of his natural
understanding in which he surpassed all his contemporaries and whose
sayings are accepted by the people as of equal weight with
those of the prophets 84 i mean solomon whose prudence and wisdom are
commended in scripture rather than his piety and gift of prophecy 85 life
being taken to mean the true life as is evident from deut xxx19 the
fruit of the understanding consists only in the true life and its
absence constitutes punishment 86 all this absolutely agrees with what
was set out in our fourth point concerning natural law 87 moreover our
position that it is the wellspring of life and that the intellect alone
lays down laws for the wise is plainly taught by the sage for he says
prov xiii14 the law of the wise is a fountain of life  that is as
we gather from the preceding text the understanding 88 in chap iii13
he expressly teaches that the understanding renders man blessed and happy
and gives him true peace of mind happy is the man that findeth wisdom and
the man that getteth understanding for wisdom gives length of days and
riches and honour her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths
peace xiiii6 17 89 according to solomon therefore it is only
the wise who live in peace and equanimity not like the wicked whose minds
drift hither and thither and as isaiah says chap lvii20 are like the
troubled sea for them there is no peace
90 lastly we should especially note the passage in chap ii of solomons
proverbs which most clearly confirms our contention if thou criest after
knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding    then shalt thou
understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god for the lord
giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
91 these words clearly enunciate 1 that wisdom or intellect alone
teaches us to fear god wisely  that is to worship him truly 2 that
wisdom and knowledge flow from gods mouth and that god bestows on us this
gift this we have already shown in proving that our understanding and our
knowledge depend on spring from and are perfected by the idea or
knowledge of god and nothing else 92 solomon goes on to say in so many
words that this knowledge contains and involves the true principles of
ethics and politics when wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is
pleasant to thy soul discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall
keep thee then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and
equity yea every good path 93 all of which is in obvious agreement with
natural knowledge for after we have come to the understanding of things
and have tasted the excellence of knowledge she teaches us ethics and true
virtue
94 thus the happiness and the peace of him who cultivates his natural
understanding lies according to solomon also not so much under the
dominion of fortune or gods external aid as in inward personal virtue or
gods internal aid for the latter can to a great extent be preserved by
vigilance right action and thought
95 lastly we must by no means pass over the passage in pauls epistle to
the romans i20 in which he says for the invisible things of god from
the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things
that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without
excuse because when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither
were they thankful 96 these words clearly show that everyone can by the
light of nature clearly understand the goodness and the eternal divinity of
god and can thence know and deduce what they should seek for and what
avoid wherefore the apostle says that they are without excuse and cannot
plead ignorance as they certainly might if it were a question of
supernatural light and the incarnation passion and resurrection of christ
97 wherefore he goes on to say ib 24 god gave them up to
uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts and so on through the
rest of the chapter he describes the vices of ignorance and sets them
forth as the punishment of ignorance 98 this obviously agrees with the
verse of solomon already quoted the instruction of fools is folly so
that it is easy to understand why paul says that the wicked are without
excuse 99 as every man sows so shall he reap out of evil evils
necessarily spring unless they be wisely counteracted
100 thus we see that scripture literally approves of the light of natural
reason and the natural divine law and i have fulfilled the promises made at
the beginning of this chapter
chapter v  of the ceremonial law
1 in the foregoing chapter we have shown that the divine law which
renders men truly blessed and teaches them the true life is universal to
all men nay we have so intimately deduced it from human nature that it
must be esteemed innate and as it were ingrained in the human mind
2 but with regard to the ceremonial observances which were ordained in the
old testament for the hebrews only and were so adapted to their state that
they could for the most part only be observed by the society as a whole and
not by each individual it is evident that they formed no part of the divine
law and had nothing to do with blessedness and virtue but had reference
only to the election of the hebrews that is as i have shown in chap ii
to their temporal bodily happiness and the tranquillity of their kingdom
and that therefore they were only valid while that kingdom lasted 3 if in
the old testament they are spoken of as the law of god it is only because
they were founded on revelation or a basis of revelation 4 still as
reason however sound has little weight with ordinary theologians i will
adduce the authority of scripture for what i here assert and will further
show for the sake of greater clearness why and how these ceremonials
served to establish and preserve the jewish kingdom 5 isaiah teaches most
plainly that the divine law in its strict sense signifies that universal law
which consists in a true manner of life and does not signify ceremonial
observances 6 in chapter i10 the prophet calls on his countrymen to
hearken to the divine law as he delivers it and first excluding all kinds
of sacrifices and all feasts he at length sums up the law in these few
words cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the
oppressed 7 not less striking testimony is given in psalm xl7 9 where
the psalmist addresses god sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire
mine ears hast thou opened burnt offering and sinoffering hast thou not
required i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my
heart 8 here the psalmist reckons as the law of god only that which is
inscribed in his heart and excludes ceremonies therefrom for the latter
are good and inscribed on the heart only from the fact of their institution
and not because of their intrinsic value
9 other passages of scripture testify to the same truth but these two
will suffice 10 we may also learn from the bible that ceremonies are no
aid to blessedness but only have reference to the temporal prosperity of
the kingdom for the rewards promised for their observance are
merely temporal advantages and delights blessedness being reserved for the
universal divine law 11 in all the five books commonly attributed to
moses nothing is promised as i have said beyond temporal benefits such as
honours fame victories riches enjoyments and health 12 though many
moral precepts besides ceremonies are contained in these five books they
appear not as moral doctrines universal to all men but as commands
especially adapted to the understanding and character of the hebrew people
and as having reference only to the welfare of the kingdom 13 for
instance moses does not teach the jews as a prophet not to kill or to
steal but gives these commandments solely as a lawgiver and judge he does
not reason out the doctrine but affixes for its nonobservance a penalty
which may and very properly does vary in different nations 14 so too
the command not to commit adultery is given merely with reference to the
welfare of the state for if the moral doctrine had been intended with
reference not only to the welfare of the state but also to the tranquillity
and blessedness of the individual moses would have condemned not merely the
outward act but also the mental acquiescence as is done by christ who
taught only universal moral precepts and for this cause promises a
spiritual instead of a temporal reward 15 christ as i have said was
sent into the world not to preserve the state nor to lay down laws but
solely to teach the universal moral law so we can easily understand that he
wished in nowise to do away with the law of moses inasmuch as he introduced
no new laws of his own  his sole care was to teach moral doctrines and
distinguish them from the laws of the state for the pharisees in their
ignorance thought that the observance of the state law and the mosaic law
was the sum total of morality whereas such laws merely had reference to the
public welfare and aimed not so much at instructing the jews as at keeping
them under constraint 16 but let us return to our subject and cite other
passages of scripture which set forth temporal benefits as rewards for
observing the ceremonial law and blessedness as reward for the universal
law
17 none of the prophets puts the point more clearly than isaiah 18
after condemning hypocrisy he commends liberty and charity towards ones
self and ones neighbours and promises as a reward then shall thy light
break forth as the morning and thy health shall spring forth speedily thy
righteousness shall go before thee and the glory of the lord shall be thy
reward chap lviii8 19 shortly afterwards he commends the sabbath
and for a due observance of it promises then shalt thou delight thyself
in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the
earth and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of
the lord has spoken it 20 thus the prophet for liberty bestowed and
charitable works promises a healthy mind in a healthy body and the glory
of the lord even after death whereas for ceremonial exactitude he only
promises security of rule prosperity and temporal happiness
21 in psalms xv and xxiv no mention is made of ceremonies but only of
moral doctrines inasmuch as there is no question of anything but
blessedness and blessedness is symbolically promised it is quite certain
that the expressions the hill of god and his tents and the dwellers
therein refer to blessedness and security of soul not to the actual mount
of jerusalem and the tabernacle of moses for these latter were not dwelt in
by anyone and only the sons of levi ministered there 22 further all
those sentences of solomon to which i referred in the last chapter for the
cultivation of the intellect and wisdom promise true blessedness for by
wisdom is the fear of god at length understood and the knowledge of god
found
23 that the jews themselves were not bound to practise their ceremonial
observances after the destruction of their kingdom is evident from jeremiah
24 for when the prophet saw and foretold that the desolation of the city
was at hand he said that god only delights in those who know and understand
that he exercises lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the
earth and that such persons only are worthy of praise jer ix23 25
as though god had said that after the desolation of the city he would
require nothing special from the jews beyond the natural law by which all
men are bound
26 the new testament also confirms this view for only moral doctrines are
therein taught and the kingdom of heaven is promised as a reward whereas
ceremonial observances are not touched on by the apostles after they began
to preach the gospel to the gentiles 27 the pharisees certainly continued
to practise these rites after the destruction of the kingdom but more with
a view of opposing the christians than of pleasing god for after the first
destruction of the city when they were led captive to babylon not being
then so far as i am aware split up into sects they straightway neglected
their rites bid farewell to the mosaic law buried their national customs
in oblivion as being plainly superfluous and began to mingle with other
nations as we may abundantly learn from ezra and nehemiah 28 we cannot
therefore doubt that they were no more bound by the law of moses after the
destruction of their kingdom than they had been before it had been begun
while they were still living among other peoples before the exodus from
egypt and were subject to no special law beyond the natural law and also
doubtless the law of the state in which they were living in so far as it
was consonant with the divine natural law
29 as to the fact that the patriarchs offered sacrifices i think they did
so for the purpose of stimulating their piety for their minds had been
accustomed from childhood to the idea of sacrifice which we know had been
universal from the time of enoch and thus they found in sacrifice their
most powerful incentive 30 the patriarchs then did not sacrifice to god
at the bidding of a divine right or as taught by the basis of the divine
law but simply in accordance with the custom of the time and if in so
doing they followed any ordinance it was simply the ordinance of the
country they were living in by which as we have seen before in the case of
melchisedek they were bound
31 i think that i have now given scriptural authority for my view it
remains to show why and how the ceremonial observances tended to preserve
and confirm the hebrew kingdom and this i can very briefly do on grounds
universally accepted
32 the formation of society serves not only for defensive purposes but is
also very useful and indeed absolutely necessary as rendering possible
the division of labour 33 if men did not render mutual assistance to each
other no one would have either the skill or the time to provide for his own
sustenance and preservation for all men are not equally apt for all work
and no one would be capable of preparing all that he individually stood in
need of 34 strength and time i repeat would fail if every one had in
person to plough to sow to reap to grind corn to cook to weave to
stitch and perform the other numerous functions required to keep life
going to say nothing of the arts and sciences which are also entirely
necessary to the perfection and blessedness of human nature 35 we see
that peoples living in uncivilized barbarism lead a wretched and almost
animal life and even they would not be able to acquire their few rude
necessaries without assisting one another to a certain extent
36 now if men were so constituted by nature that they desired nothing but
what is designated by true reason society would obviously have no need of
laws it would be sufficient to inculcate true moral doctrines and men
would freely without hesitation act in accordance with their true
interests 37 but human nature is framed in a different fashion every
one indeed seeks his own interest but does not do so in accordance with
the dictates of sound reason for most mens ideas of desirability and
usefulness are guided by their fleshly instincts and emotions which take no
thought beyond the present and the immediate object 38 therefore no
society can exist without government and force and laws to restrain and
repress mens desires and immoderate impulses 39 still human nature will
not submit to absolute repression 40 violent governments as seneca says
never last long the moderate governments endure 41 so long as men act
simply from fear they act contrary to their inclinations taking no thought
for the advantages or necessity of their actions but simply endeavouring to
escape punishment or loss of life 42 they must needs rejoice in any evil
which befalls their ruler even if it should involve themselves and must
long for and bring about such evil by every means in their power 43
again men are especially intolerant of serving and being ruled by their
equals 44 lastly it is exceedingly difficult to revoke liberties once
granted
45 from these considerations it follows firstly that authority should
either be vested in the hands of the whole state in common so that everyone
should be bound to serve and yet not be in subjection to his equals or
else if power be in the hands of a few or one man that one man should be
something above average humanity or should strive to get himself accepted
as such 46 secondly laws should in every government be so arranged that
people should be kept in bounds by the hope of some greatly desired good
rather than by fear for then everyone will do his duty willingly
47 lastly as obedience consists in acting at the bidding of external
authority it would have no place in a state where the government is vested
in the whole people and where laws are made by common consent 48 in such
a society the people would remain free whether the laws were added to or
diminished inasmuch as it would not be done on external authority but
their own free consent 49 the reverse happens when the sovereign power is
vested in one man for all act at his bidding and therefore unless they
had been trained from the first to depend on the words of their ruler the
latter would find it difficult in case of need to abrogate liberties once
conceded and impose new laws
50 from these universal considerations let us pass on to the kingdom of
the jews 51 the jews when they first came out of egypt were not bound by
any national laws and were therefore free to ratify any laws they liked or
to make new ones and were at liberty to set up a government and occupy a
territory wherever they chose 52 however they were entirely unfit
to frame a wise code of laws and to keep the sovereign power vested in the
community they were all uncultivated and sunk in a wretched slavery
therefore the sovereignty was bound to remain vested in the hands of one man
who would rule the rest and keep them under constraint make laws and
interpret them 53 this sovereignty was easily retained by moses
because he surpassed the rest in virtue and persuaded the people of the
fact proving it by many testimonies see exod chap xiv last verse and
chap xix9 54 he then by the divine virtue he possessed made laws and
ordained them for the people taking the greatest care that they should be
obeyed willingly and not through fear being specially induced to adopt this
course by the obstinate nature of the jews who would not have submitted to
be ruled solely by constraint and also by the imminence of war for it is
always better to inspire soldiers with a thirst for glory than to terrify
them with threats each man will then strive to distinguish himself
by valour and courage instead of merely trying to escape punishment 55
moses therefore by his virtue and the divine command introduced a
religion so that the people might do their duty from devotion rather than
fear 56 further he bound them over by benefits and prophesied
many advantages in the future nor were his laws very severe as anyone may
see for himself especially if he remarks the number of circumstances
necessary in order to procure the conviction of an accused person
57 lastly in order that the people which could not govern itself should
be entirely dependent on its ruler he left nothing to the free choice of
individuals who had hitherto been slaves the people could do nothing but
remember the law and follow the ordinances laid down at the good pleasure
of their ruler they were not allowed to plough to sow to reap nor even
to eat to clothe themselves to shave to rejoice or in fact to do
anything whatever as they liked but were bound to follow the directions
given in the law and not only this but they were obliged to have marks on
their doorposts on their hands and between their eyes to admonish them to
perpetual obedience
58 this then was the object of the ceremonial law that men should do
nothing of their own free will but should always act under external
authority and should continually confess by their actions and thoughts that
they were not their own masters but were entirely under the control of
others
59 from all these considerations it is clearer than day that ceremonies
have nothing to do with a state of blessedness and that those mentioned in
the old testament ie the whole mosaic law had reference merely to the
government of the jews and merely temporal advantages
60 as for the christian rites such as baptism the lords supper
festivals public prayers and any other observances which are and always
have been common to all christendom if they were instituted by christ or
his apostles which is open to doubt they were instituted as external
signs of the universal church and not as having anything to do with
blessedness or possessing any sanctity in themselves 61 therefore
though such ceremonies were not ordained for the sake of upholding a
government they were ordained for the preservation of a society and
accordingly he who lives alone is not bound by them nay those who live in
a country where the christian religion is forbidden are bound to abstain
from such rites and can none the less live in a state of blessedness 62
we have an example of this in japan where the christian religion is
forbidden and the dutch who live there are enjoined by their east india
company not to practise any outward rites of religion 63 i need not cite
other examples though it would be easy to prove my point from the
fundamental principles of the new testament and to adduce many confirmatory
instances but i pass on the more willingly as i am anxious to proceed to
my next proposition 64 i will now therefore pass on to what i proposed
to treat of in the second part of this chapter namely what persons are
bound to believe in the narratives contained in scripture and how far they
are so bound 65 examining this question by the aid of natural reason i
will proceed as follows
66 if anyone wishes to persuade his fellows for or against anything which
is not selfevident he must deduce his contention from their admissions
and convince them either by experience or by ratiocination either by
appealing to facts of natural experience or to selfevident intellectual
axioms 67 now unless the experience be of such a kind as to be clearly
and distinctly understood though it may convince a man it will not have
the same effect on his mind and disperse the clouds of his doubt so
completely as when the doctrine taught is deduced entirely from intellectual
axioms  that is by the mere power of the understanding and logical order
and this is especially the case in spiritual matters which have nothing to
do with the senses
68 but the deduction of conclusions from general truths a priori usually
requires a long chain of arguments and moreover very great caution
acuteness and selfrestraint  qualities which are not often met with
therefore people prefer to be taught by experience rather than deduce
their conclusion from a few axioms and set them out in logical order 69
whence it follows that if anyone wishes to teach a doctrine to a whole
nation not to speak of the whole human race and to be understood by all
men in every particular he will seek to support his teaching with
experience and will endeavour to suit his reasonings and the definitions of
his doctrines as far as possible to the understanding of the common people
who form the majority of mankind and he will not set them forth in logical
sequence nor adduce the definitions which serve to establish them 70
otherwise he writes only for the learned  that is he will be understood by
only a small proportion of the human race
71 all scripture was written primarily for an entire people and
secondarily for the whole human race therefore its contents must
necessarily be adapted as far as possible to the understanding of the
masses and proved only by examples drawn from experience 72 we will
explain ourselves more clearly 73 the chief speculative doctrines taught
in scripture are the existence of god or a being who made all things and
who directs and sustains the world with consummate wisdom furthermore that
god takes the greatest thought for men or such of them as live piously and
honourably while he punishes with various penalties those who do
evil separating them from the good 74 all this is proved in scripture
entirely through experiencethat is through the narratives there related
75 no definitions of doctrine are given but all the sayings and
reasonings are adapted to the understanding of the masses 76 although
experience can give no clear knowledge of these things nor explain the
nature of god nor how he directs and sustains all things it can
nevertheless teach and enlighten men sufficiently to impress obedience
and devotion on their minds
77 it is now i think sufficiently clear what persons are bound to
believe in the scripture narratives and in what degree they are so bound
for it evidently follows from what has been said that the knowledge of and
belief in them is particularly necessary to the masses whose intellect is
not capable of perceiving things clearly and distinctly 78 further he
who denies them because he does not believe that god exists or takes thought
for men and the world may be accounted impious but a man who is ignorant
of them and nevertheless knows by natural reason that god exists as we
have said and has a true plan of life is altogether blessed  yes more
blessed than the common herd of believers because besides true opinions he
possesses also a true and distinct conception 79 lastly he who is
ignorant of the scriptures and knows nothing by the light of reason though
he may not be impious or rebellious is yet less than human and almost
brutal having none of gods gifts
80 we must here remark that when we say that the knowledge of the sacred
narrative is particularly necessary to the masses we do not mean the
knowledge of absolutely all the narratives in the bible but only of the
principal ones those which taken by themselves plainly display the
doctrine we have just stated and have most effect over mens minds
81 if all the narratives in scripture were necessary for the proof of this
doctrine and if no conclusion could be drawn without the general
consideration of every one of the histories contained in the sacred
writings truly the conclusion and demonstration of such doctrine would
overtask the understanding and strength not only of the masses but of
humanity who is there who could give attention to all the narratives at
once and to all the circumstances and all the scraps of doctrine to be
elicited from such a host of diverse histories 82 i cannot believe that
the men who have left us the bible as we have it were so abounding in talent
that they attempted setting about such a method of demonstration still less
can i suppose that we cannot understand scriptural doctrine till we have
given heed to the quarrels of isaac the advice of achitophel to absalom
the civil war between jews and israelites and other similar chronicles nor
can i think that it was more difficult to teach such doctrine by means of
history to the jews of early times the contemporaries of moses than it was
to the contemporaries of esdras 83 but more will be said on this point
hereafter we may now only note that the masses are only bound to know those
histories which can most powerfully dispose their mind to obedience and
devotion 84 however the masses are not sufficiently skilled to draw
conclusions from what they read they take more delight in the actual
stories and in the strange and unlookedfor issues of events than in the
doctrines implied therefore besides reading these narratives they are
always in need of pastors or church ministers to explain them to their
feeble intelligence
85 but not to wander from our point let us conclude with what has been
our principal object  namely that the truth of narratives be they what
they may has nothing to do with the divine law and serves for nothing
except in respect of doctrine the sole element which makes one history
better than another 86 the narratives in the old and new testaments
surpass profane history and differ among themselves in merit simply by
reason of the salutary doctrines which they inculcate 87 therefore if a
man were to read the scripture narratives believing the whole of them but
were to give no heed to the doctrines they contain and make no amendment in
his life he might employ himself just as profitably in reading the koran
or the poetic drama or ordinary chronicles with the attention usually
given to such writings on the other hand if a man is absolutely ignorant
of the scriptures and none the less has right opinions and a true
plan of life he is absolutely blessed and truly possesses in himself the
spirit of christ
88 the jews are of a directly contrary way of thinking for they hold that
true opinions and a true plan of life are of no service in attaining
blessedness if their possessors have arrived at them by the light of reason
only and not like the documents prophetically revealed to moses 89
maimonides ventures openly to make this assertion every man who takes to
heart the seven precepts and diligently follows them is counted with the
pious among the nation and an heir of the world to come that is to say if
he takes to heart and follows them because god ordained them in the law and
revealed them to us by moses because they were of aforetime precepts to the
sons of noah but he who follows them as led thereto by reason is not
counted as a dweller among the pious or among the wise of the nations 90
such are the words of maimonides to which r joseph the son of shem job
adds in his book which he calls kebod elohim or gods glory that
although aristotle whom he considers to have written the best ethics and to
be above everyone else has not omitted anything that concerns
true ethics and which he has adopted in his own book carefully following
the lines laid down yet this was not able to suffice for his salvation
inasmuch as he embraced his doctrines in accordance with the dictates of
reason and not as divine documents prophetically revealed
91 however that these are mere figments and are not supported by
scriptural authority will i think be sufficiently evident to the attentive
reader so that an examination of the theory will be sufficient for its
refutation 92 it is not my purpose here to refute the assertions of those
who assert that the natural light of reason can teach nothing of any value
concerning the true way of salvation 93 people who lay no claims to
reason for themselves are not able to prove by reason this their assertion
and if they hawk about something superior to reason it is a mere figment
and far below reason as their general method of life sufficiently shows
94 but there is no need to dwell upon such persons 95 i will merely add
that we can only judge of a man by his works 96 if a man abounds in the
fruits of the spirit charity joy peace longsuffering kindness
goodness faith gentleness chastity against which as paul says
gal v22 there is no law such an one whether he be taught by reason
only or by the scripture only has been in very truth taught by god and is
altogether blessed 97 thus have i said all that i undertook to say
concerning divine law

prophecy as i believe is well known to the learned
endnote 2 1 although ordinary knowledge is divine its professors
cannot be called prophets that is interpreters of god 2 for he alone
is an interpreter of god who interprets the decrees which god has revealed
to him to others who have not received such revelation and whose belief
therefore rests merely on the prophets authority and the confidence
reposed in him 3 if it were otherwise and all who listen to prophets
became prophets themselves as all who listen to philosophers become
philosophers a prophet would no longer be the interpreter of divine
decrees inasmuch as his hearers would know the truth not on the authority
of the prophet but by means of actual divine revelation and inward
testimony 4 thus the sovereign powers are the interpreters of their own
rights of sway because these are defended only by their authority and
supported by their testimony
endnote 3 1 prophets were endowed with a peculiar and
extraordinary power 2 though some men enjoy gifts which nature has not
bestowed on their fellows they are not said to surpass the bounds of human
nature unless their special qualities are such as cannot be said to be
deducible from the definition of human nature 3 for instance a giant is
a rarity but still human 4 the gift of composing poetry extempore is
given to very few yet it is human 5 the same may therefore be said of
the faculty possessed by some of imagining things as vividly as though they
saw them before them and this not while asleep but while awake 6 but if
anyone could be found who possessed other means and other foundations for
knowledge he might be said to transcend the limits of human nature
