the general design of the following sheets is to inlist imagination
under the banner of science and to lead her votaries from the looser
analogies which dress out the imagery of poetry to the stricter ones
which form the ratiocination of philosophy while their particular
design is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of botany
by introducing them to the vestibule of that delightful science and
recommending to their attention the immortal works of the celebrated
swedish naturalist linneus
in the first poem or economy of vegetation the physiology of plants is
delivered and the operation of the elements as far as they may be
supposed to affect the growth of vegetables in the second poem or
loves of the plants the sexual system of linneus is explained with the
remarkable properties of many particular plants
                                apology
it may be proper here to apologize for many of the subsequent
conjectures on some articles of natural philosophy as not being
supported by accurate investigation or conclusive experiments
extravagant theories however in those parts of philosophy where our
knowledge is yet imperfect are not without their use as they encourage
the execution of laborious experiments or the investigation of
ingenious deductions to confirm or refute them and since natural
objects are allied to each other by many affinities every kind of
theoretic distribution of them adds to our knowledge by developing some
of their analogies
the rosicrucian doctrine of gnomes sylphs nymphs and salamanders was
thought to afford a proper machinery for a botanic poem as it is
probable that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic figures
representing the elements
many of the important operations of nature were shadowed or allegorized
in the heathen mythology as the first cupid springing from the egg of
night the marriage of cupid and psyche the rape of proserpine the
congress of jupiter and juno death and resuscitation of adonis c
many of which are ingeniously explained in the works of bacon vol v
p 47 4th edit london 1778 the egyptians were possessed of many
discoveries in philosophy and chemistry before the invention of letters
these were then expressed in hieroglyphic paintings of men and animals
which after the discovery of the alphabet were described and animated by
the poets and became first the deities of egypt and afterwards of
greece and rome allusions to those fables were therefore thought proper
ornaments to a philosophical poem and are occasionally introduced
either as represented by the poets or preserved on the numerous gems
and medallions of antiquity

     the rills that gurgle round shall soothe her ear
     the weeping rocks shall number tear for tear
     there as sad philomel alike forlorn
     sings to the night from her accustomed thorn

disasterous love l 26 the scenery is taken from a botanic garden
about a mile from lichfield where a cold bath was erected by sir john
floyer there is a grotto surrounded by projecting rocks from the edges
of which trickles a perpetual shower of water and it is here
represented as adapted to lovescenes as being thence a proper
residence for the modern goddess of botany and the easier to introduce
the next poem on the loves of the plants according to the system of
linneus
       winds of the north restrain your icy gales
 40  nor chill the bosom of these happy vales

       thus spoke the genius as he stept along
     and bade these lawns to peace and truth belong
     down the steep slopes he led with modest skill
     the willing pathway and the truant rill
 55  stretchd oer the marshy vale yon willowy mound

     the golden bits with flowery studs are deckd
     and knots of flowers the crimson reins connect
 65  and now on earth the silver axle rings
     and the shell sinks upon its slender springs
     light from her airy seat the goddess bounds
     and steps celestial press the pansied grounds
       fair spring advancing calls her featherd quire
 70  and tunes to softer notes her laughing lyre
     bids her gay hours on purple pinions move
     and arms her zephyrs with the shafts of love

pleased gnomes l 73 the rosicrucian doctrine of gnomes sylphs
nymphs and salamanders affords proper machinery for a philosophic poem
as it is probable that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic
figures of the elements or of genii presiding over their operations
the fairies of more modern days seem to have been derived from them and
to have inherited their powers the gnomes and sylphs as being more
nearly allied to modern fairies are represented as either male or
female which distinguishes the latter from the aurae of the latin
poets which were only female except the winds as zephyrus and auster
may be supposed to have been their husbands

     so the clear lens collects with magic power

nymphs of primeval fire l 97 the fluid matter of heat is perhaps
the most extensive element in nature all other bodies are immersed in
it and are preserved in their present state of solidity or fluidity by
the attraction of their particles to the matter of heat since all known
bodies are contractible into less space by depriving them of some
portion of their heat and as there is no part of nature totally
deprived of heat there is reason to believe that the particles of
bodies do not touch but are held towards each other by their self
attraction and recede from each other by their attraction to the mass
of heat which surrounds them and thus exist in an equilibrium between
these two powers if more of the matter of heat be applied to them they
recede further from each other and become fluid if still more be
applied they take an aerial form and are termed gasses by the modern
chemists thus when water is heated to a certain degree it would
instantly assume the form of steam but for the pressure of the
atmosphere which prevents this change from taking place so easily the
same is true of quicksilver diamonds and of perhaps all other bodies
in nature they would first become fluid and then aeriform by
appropriated degrees of heat on the contrary this elastic matter of
heat termed calorique in the new nomenclature of the french
academicians is liable to become consolidated itself in its
combinations with some bodies as perhaps in nitre and probably in
combustible bodies as sulphur and charcoal see note on l 232 of this
canto modern philosophers have not yet been able to decide whether
light and heat be different fluids or modifications of the same fluid
as they have many properties in common see note on l 462 of this
canto
when love divine l 101 from having observed the gradual evolution
of the young animal or plant from its egg or seed and afterwards its
successive advances to its more perfect state or maturity philosophers
of all ages seem to have imagined that the great world itself had
likewise its infancy and its gradual progress to maturity this seems to
have given origin to the very antient and sublime allegory of eros or
divine love producing the world from the egg of night as it floated in
chaos see l 419 of this canto
the external crust of the earth as far as it has been exposed to our
view in mines or mountains countenances this opinion since these have
evidently for the most part had their origin from the shells of fishes
the decomposition of vegetables and the recrements of other animal
materials and must therefore have been formed progressively from small
beginnings there are likewise some apparently useless or incomplete
appendages to plants and animals which seem to shew they have gradually
undergone changes from their original state such as the stamens without
anthers and styles without stigmas of several plants as mentioned in
the note on curcuma vol ii of this work such is the halteres or
rudiments of wings of some twowinged insects and the paps of male
animals thus swine have four toes but two of them are imperfectly
formed and not long enough for use the allantoide in some animals
seems to have become extinct in others is above tenfold the size which
would seem necessary for its purpose buffon du cochon t 6 p 257
perhaps all the supposed monstrous births of nature are remains of their
habits of production in their former less perfect state or attempts
towards greater perfection
through all his realms l 105 mr herschel has given a very sublime
and curious account of the construction of the heavens with his
discovery of some thousand nebulae or clouds of stars many of which
are much larger collections of stars than all those put together which
are visible to our naked eyes added to those which form the galaxy or
milky zone which surrounds us he observes that in the vicinity of
these clusters of stars there are proportionally fewer stars than in
other parts of the heavens and hence he concludes that they have
attracted each other on the supposition that infinite space was at
first equally sprinkled with them as if it had at the beginning been
filled with a fluid mass which had coagulated mr herschel has further
shewn that the whole sidereal system is gradually moving round some
centre which may be an opake mass of matter philos trans v lxxiv
if all these suns are moving round some great central body they must
have had a projectile force as well as a centripetal one and may
thence be supposed to have emerged or been projected from the material
where they were produced we can have no idea of a natural power which
could project a sun out of chaos except by comparing it to the
explosions or earthquakes owing to the sudden evolution of aqueous or of
other more elastic vapours of the power of which under immeasurable
degrees of heat and compression we are yet ignorant
it may be objected that if the stars had been projected from a chaos by
explosions that they must have returned again into it from the known
laws of gravitation this however would not happen if the whole of
chaos like grains of gunpowder was exploded at the same time and
dispersed through infinite space at once or in quick succession in
every possible direction the same objection may be stated against the
possibility of the planets having been thrown from the sun by
explosions and the secondary planets from the primary ones which will
be spoken of more at large in the second canto but if the planets are
supposed to have been projected from their suns and the secondary from
the primary ones at the beginning of their course they might be so
influenced or diverted by the attractions of the suns or sun in their
vicinity as to prevent their tendency to return into the body from
which they were projected
if these innumerable and immense suns thus rising out of chaos are
supposed to have thrown out their attendant planets by new explosions
as they ascended and those their respective satellites filling in a
moment the immensity of space with light and motion a grander idea
cannot be conceived by the mind of man

where lighter gases l 123 mr cavendish has shewn that the gas
called inflammable air is at least ten times lighter than common air
mr lavoisier contends that it is one of the component parts of water
and is by him called hydrogene it is supposed to afford their principal
nourishment to vegetables and thence to animals and is perpetually
rising from their decomposition this source of it in hot climates and
in summer months is so great as to exceed estimation now if this light
gas passes through the atmosphere without combining with it it must
compose another atmosphere over the aerial one which must expand when
the pressure above it is thus taken away to inconceivable tenuity
if this supernatural gasseous atmosphere floats upon the aerial one
like ether upon water what must happen 1 it will flow from the line
where it will be produced in the greatest quantities and become much
accumulated over the poles of the earth 2 the common air or lower
stratum of the atmosphere will be much thinner over the poles than at
the line because if a glass globe be filled with oil and water and
whirled upon its axis the centrifugal power will carry the heavier
fluid to the circumference and the lighter will in consequence be found
round the axis 3 there may be a place at some certain latitude between
the poles and the line on each side the equator where the inflammable
supernatant atmosphere may end owing to the greater centrifugal force
of the heavier aerial atmosphere 4 between the termination of the
aerial and the beginning of the gasseous atmosphere the airs will
occasionally be intermixed and thus become inflammable by the electric
spark these circumstances will assist in explaining the phenomena of
fireballs northern lights and of some variable winds and long
continued rains
since the above note was first written mr volta i am informed has
applied the supposition of a supernatant atmosphere of inflammable air
to explain some phenomena in meteorology and mr lavoisier has
announced his design to write on this subject trait de chimie tom i
i am happy to find these opinions supported by such respectable
authority
and bend the twilight l 126 the crepuscular atmosphere or the
region where the light of the sun ceases to be refracted to us is
estimated by philosophers to be between 40 and 50 miles high at which
time the sun is about 18 degrees below the horizon and the rarity of
the air is supposed to be from 4000 to 10000 times greater than at the
surface of the earth cotess hydrost p 123 the duration of twilight
differs in different seasons and in different latitudes in england the
shortest twilight is about the beginning of october and of march in
more northern latitudes where the sun never sinks more than 18 degrees
below the horizon the twilight continues the whole night the time of
its duration may also be occasionally affected by the varying height of
the atmosphere a number of observations on the duration of twilight in
different latitudes might afford considerable information concerning the
aerial strata in the higher regions of the atmosphere and might assist
in determining whether an exterior atmosphere of inflammable gas or
hydrogene exists over the aerial one

     while with loud shouts to etna heccla calls
     and andes answers from his beacond walls
155  seawilderd crews the mountainstars admire
     and beauty beams amid tremendous fire
hurl innocuous embers l 152 the immediate cause of volcanic
eruptions is believed to be owing to the water of the sea or from
lakes or inundations finding itself a passage into the subterraneous
fires which may lie at great depths this must first produce by its
coldness a condensation of the vapour there existing or a vacuum and
thus occasion parts of the earths crust or shell to be forced down by
the pressure of the incumbent atmosphere afterwards the water being
suddenly raised into steam produces all the explosive effects of
earthquakes and by new accessions of water during the intervals of the
explosions the repetition of the shocks is caused these circumstances
were hourly illustrated by the fountains of boiling water in iceland in
which the surface of the water in the boiling wells sunk down low before
every new ebullition
besides these eruptions occasioned by the steam of water there seems to
be a perpetual effusion of other vapours more noxious and as far as it
is yet known perhaps greatly more expansile than water from the
volcanos in various parts of the world as these volcanos are supposed
to be spiracula or breathing holes to the great subterraneous fires it
is probable that the escape of elastic vapours from them is the cause
that the earthquakes of modern days are of such small extent compared to
those of antient times of which vestiges remain in every part of the
world and on this account may be said not only to be innocuous but
useful
       thus when of old as mystic bards presume
     huge cyclops dwelt in etnas rocky womb
     on thundering anvils rung their loud alarms
160  and leagued with vulcan forged immortal arms
     descending venus sought the dark abode
     and soothd the labours of the grisly god
     while frowning loves the threatening falchion wield
     and tittering graces peep behind the shield
165  with jointed mail their fairy limbs oerwhelm
     or nod with pausing step the plumed helm
     with radiant eye she viewd the boiling ore
     heard undismayd the breathing bellows roar

     with smiles celestial blessd their dazzled sight
     and beauty blazed amid infernal night
       iv effulgent maids you round deciduous day

185  touchd by his orient beam responsive rings
     the living lyre and vibrates all its strings
     accordant ailes the tender tones prolong
     and holy echoes swell the adoring song
confine with folds of air l 176 the air like all other bad
conductors of electricity is known to be a bad conductor of heat and
thence prevents the heat acquired from the suns rays by the earths
surface from being so soon dissipated in the same manner as a blanket
which may be considered as a sponge filled with air prevents the escape
of heat from the person wrapped in it this seems to be one cause of the
great degree of cold on the tops of mountains where the rarity of the
air is greater and it therefore becomes a better conductor both of heat
and electricity see note on barometz vol ii of this work
there is however another cause to which the great coldness of mountains
and of the higher regions of the atmosphere is more immediately to be
ascribed explained by dr darwin in the philos trans vol lxxviii
who has there proved by experiments with the airgun and airpump that
when any portion of the atmosphere becomes mechanically expanded it
absorbs heat from the bodies in its vicinity and as the air which
creeps along the plains expands itself by a part of the pressure being
taken off when it ascends the sides of mountains it at the same time
attracts heat from the summits of those mountains or other bodies which
happen to be immersed in it and thus produces cold hence he concludes
that the hot air at the bottom of the andes becomes temperate by its own
rarefaction when it ascends to the city of quito and by its further
rarefaction becomes cooled to the freezing point when it ascends to the
snowy regions on the summits of those mountains to this also he
attributes the great degree of cold experienced by the aeronauts in
their balloons and which produces hail in summer at the height of only
two or three miles in the atmosphere
diffuse phosphoric light l 177 i have often been induced to
believe from observation that the twilight of the evenings is lighter
than that of the mornings at the same distance from noon some may
ascribe this to the greater height of the atmosphere in the evenings
having been rarefied by the sun during the day but as its density must
at the same time be diminished its power of refraction would continue
the same i should rather suppose that it may be owing to the
phosphorescent quality as it is called of almost all bodies that is
when they have been exposed to the sun they continue to emit light for a
considerable time afterwards this is generally believed to arise either
from such bodies giving out the light which they had previously
absorbed or to the continuance of a slow combustion which the light
they had been previously exposed to had excited see the next note
beccaris shells l 182 beccari made many curious experiments on
the phosphoric light as it is called which becomes visible on bodies
brought into a dark room after having been previously exposed to the
sunshine it appears from these experiments that almost all inflammable
bodies possess this quality in a greater or less degree white paper or
linen thus examined after having been exposed to the sunshine is
luminous to an extraordinary degree and if a person shut up in a dark
room puts one of his hands out into the suns light for a short time
and then retracts it he will be able to see that hand distinctly and
not the other these experiments seem to countenance the idea of light
being absorbed and again emitted from bodies when they are removed into
darkness but beccari further pretended that some calcareous
compositions when exposed to red yellow or blue light through
coloured glasses would on their being brought into a dark room emit
coloured lights this mistaken fact of beccaris mr wilson decidedly
refutes and among many other curious experiments discovered that if
oystershells were thrown into a common fire and calcined for about half
an hour and then brought to a person who had previously been some
minutes in a dark room that many of them would exhibit beautiful irises
of prismatic colours from whence probably arose beccaris mistake mr
wilson from hence contends that these kinds of phosphori do not emit
the light they had previously received but that they are set on fire by
the suns rays and continue for some time a slow combustion after they
are withdrawn from the light wilsons experiments on phosphori

the bolognian stone is a selenite or gypsum and has been long
celebrated for its phosphorescent quality after having been burnt in a
sulphurous fire and exposed when cold to the suns light it may be
thus well imitated calcine oystershells half an hour pulverize them
when cold and add one third part of flowers of sulphur press them
close into a small crucible and calcine them for an hour or longer and
keep the powder in a phial close stopped a part of this powder is to be
exposed for a minute or two to the sunbeams and then brought into a
dark room the calcined bolognian stone becomes a calcareous hepar of
sulphur but the calcined shells as they contain the animal acid may
also contain some of the phosphorus of kunkel

the dread gymnotus l 202 the gymnotus electricus is a native of
the river of surinam in south america those which were brought over to
england about eight years ago were about three or four feet long and
gave an electric shock as i experienced by putting one finger on the
back near its head and another of the opposite hand into the water near
its tail in their native country they are said to exceed twenty feet in
length and kill any man who approaches them in an hostile manner it is
not only to escape its enemies that this surprizing power of the fish is
used but also to take its prey which it does by benumbing them and
then devouring them before they have time to recover or by perfectly
killing them for the quantity of the power seemed to be determined by
the will or anger of the animal as it sometimes struck a fish twice
before it was sufficiently benumbed to be easily swallowed
the organs productive of this wonderful accumulation of electric matter
have been accurately dissected and described by mr j hunter philos
trans vol lxv and are so divided by membranes as to compose a very
extensive surface and are supplied with many pairs of nerves larger
than any other nerves of the body but how so large a quantity is so
quickly accumulated as to produce such amazing effects in a fluid ill
adapted for the purpose is not yet satisfactorily explained the torpedo
possesses a similar power in a less degree as was shewn by mr walch
and another fish lately described by mr paterson philo trans vol
lxxvi
in the construction of the leydenphial as it is called which is
coated on both sides it is known that above one hundred times the
quantity of positive electricity can be condensed on every square inch
of the coating on one side than could have been accumulated on the same
surface if there had been no opposite coating communicating with the
earth because the negative electricity or that part of it which caused
its expansion is now drawn off through the glass it is also well
known that the thinner the glass is which is thus coated on both sides
so as to make a leydenphial or plate the more electricity can be
condensed on one of its surfaces till it becomes so thin as to break
and thence discharge itself
now it is possible that the quantity of electricity condensible on one
side of a coated phial may increase in some high ratio in respect to the
thinness of the glass since the power of attraction is known to
decrease as the squares of the distances to which this circumstance of
electricity seems to bear some analogy hence if an animal membrane as
thin as the silkworm spins its silk could be so situated as to be
charged like the leyden bottle without bursting as such thin glass
would be liable to do it would be difficult to calculate the immense
quantity of electric fluid which might be accumulated on its surface
no land animals are yet discovered which possess this power though the
air would have been a much better medium for producing its effects
perhaps the size of the necessary apparatus would have been inconvenient
to land animals

of devouring fire l 212 the first and most important discovery of
mankind seems to have been that of fire for many ages it is probable
fire was esteemed a dangerous enemy known only by its dreadful
devastations and that many lives must have been lost and many
dangerous burns and wounds must have afflicted those who first dared to
subject it to the uses of life it is said that the tall monkies of
borneo and sumatra lie down with pleasure round any accidental fire in
their woods and are arrived to that degree of reason that knowledge of
causation that they thrust into the remaining fire the halfburnt ends
of the branches to prevent its going out one of the nobles of the
cultivated people of otaheita when captain cook treated them with tea
catched the boiling water in his hand from the cock of the teaurn and
bellowed with pain not conceiving that water could become hot like red
fire
tools of steel constitute another important discovery in consequence of
fire and contributed perhaps principally to give the european nations
so great superiority over the american world by these two agents fire
and tools of steel mankind became able to cope with the vegetable
kingdom and conquer provinces of forests which in uncultivated
countries almost exclude the growth of other vegetables and of those
animals which are necessary to our existence add to this that the
quantity of our food is also increased by the use of fire for some
vegetables become salutary food by means of the heat used in cookery
which are naturally either noxious or difficult of digestion as
potatoes kidneybeans onions cabbages the cassava when made into
bread is perhaps rendered mild by the heat it undergoes more than by
expressing its superfluous juice the roots of white bryony and of arum

or fix in sulphur l 226 the phenomena of chemical explosions
cannot be accounted for without the supposition that some of the bodies
employed contain concentrated or solid heat combined with them to which
the french chemists have given the name of calorique when air is
expanded in the airpump or water evaporated into steam they drink up
or absorb a great quantity of heat from this analogy when gunpowder is
exploded it ought to absorb much heat that is in popular language it
ought to produce a great quantity of cold when vital air is united with
phlogistic matter in respiration which seems to be a slow combustion
its volume is lessened the carbonic acid and perhaps phosphoric acid
are produced and heat is given out which according to the experiments
of dr crawford would seem to be deposited from the vital air but as
the vital air in nitrous acid is condensed from a light elastic gas to
that of a heavy fluid it must possess less heat than before and hence
a great part of the heat which is given out in firing gunpowder i
should suppose must reside in the sulphur or charcoal
mr lavoisier has shewn that vital air or oxygene looses less of its
heat when it becomes one of the component parts of nitrous acid than in
any other of its combinations and is hence capable of giving out a
great quantity of heat in the explosion of gunpowder but as there seems
to be great analogy between the matter of heat or calorique and the
electric matter and as the worst conductors of electricity are believed
to contain the greatest quantity of that fluid there is reason to
suspect that the worst conductors of heat may contain the most of that
fluid as sulphur wax silk air glass see note on l 174 of this

vitrescent sparks l 229 when flints are struck against other
flints they have the property of giving sparks of light but it seems to
be an internal light perhaps of electric origin very different from
the ignited sparks which are struck from flint and steel the sparks
produced by the collision of steel with flint appear to be globular
particles of iron which have been fused and imperfectly scorified or
vitrified they are kindled by the heat produced by the collision but
their vivid light and their fusion and vitrification are the effects of
a combustion continued in these particles during their passage through
the air this opinion is confirmed by an experiment of mr hawksbee who
found that these sparks could not be produced in the exhausted receiver

the permanently elastic fluid generated in the firing of gunpowder is
calculated by mr robins to be about 244 if the bulk of the powder be 1
and that the heat generated at the time of the explosion occasions the
rarefied air thus produced to occupy about 1000 times the space of the
gunpowder this pressure may therefore be called equal to 1000
atmospheres or six tons upon a square inch as the suddenness of this
explosion must contribute much to its power it would seem that the
chamber of powder to produce its greatest effect should be lighted in
the centre of it which i believe is not attended to in the manufacture
of muskets or pistols
from the cheapness with which a very powerful gunpowder is likely soon
to be manufactured from aerated marine acid or from a new method of
forming nitrous acid by means of mangonese or other calciform ores it
may probably in time be applied to move machinery and supersede the use
of steam
there is a bitter invective in don quixot against the inventors of gun
powder as it levels the strong with the weak the knight cased in steel

those who are totally unskilful in the use of it and throws down all
the splendid distinctions of mankind these very reasons ought to have
been urged to shew that the discovery of gunpowder has been of public
utility by weakening the tyranny of the few over the many

marquis of worcester and destroyed them professing himself then to
have discovered the power of steam by accident which seems to have been
an unfounded slander savery applied it to the raising of water to
supply houses and gardens but could not accomplish the draining of
mines by it which was afterwards done by mr newcomen and mr john
cowley at dartmouth in the year 1712 who added the piston
a few years ago mr watt of glasgow much improved this machine and with
mr boulton of birmingham has applied it to variety of purposes such as
raising water from mines blowing bellows to fuse the ore supplying
towns with water grinding corn and many other purposes there is reason
to believe it may in time be applied to the rowing of barges and the
moving of carriages along the road as the specific levity of air is too
great for the support of great burthens by balloons there seems no
probable method of flying conveniently but by the power of steam or

for davis 1781 yet if we may compare the parts of nature with each
other there are some circumstances of her economy which seem to
contribute more to the general scale of happiness than others thus the
nourishment of animal bodies is derived from three sources 1 the milk
given from the mother to the offspring in this excellent contrivance
the mother has pleasure in affording the sustenance to the child and
the child has pleasure in receiving it 2 another source of the food of
animals includes seeds or eggs in these the embryon is in a torpid or
insensible state and there is along with it laid up for its early
nourishment a store of provision as the fruit belonging to some seeds
and the oil and starch belonging to others when these are consumed by
animals the unfeeling seed or egg receives no pain but the animal
receives pleasure which consumes it under this article may be included
the bodies of animals which die naturally 3 but the last method of
supporting animal bodies by the destruction of other living animals as
lions preying upon lambs these upon living vegetables and mankind upon
them all would appear to be a less perfect part of the economy of
nature than those before mentioned as contributing less to the sum of
general happiness

hercules seems to have related to times before the invention of the bow
and arrow or of spinning flax other stories of hercules are perhaps of
later date and appear to be allegorical as his conquering the river
god achilous and bringing cerberus up to day light the former might
refer to his turning the course of a river and draining a morass and
the latter to his exposing a part of the superstition of the times the

the cause which now constantly operates so as to make the surface of

very much lower before a passage for the water through the streights was
opened it is probable before such an event took place the coasts and
islands of the mediterranean extended much further into that sea and
were then for a great extent of country destroyed by the floods
occasioned by the new rise of water and have since remained beneath the

electric fluid by means of the glassglobe and cushion is difficult to
comprehend dr franklins idea of the pores of the glass being opened
by the friction and thence rendered capable of attracting more electric
fluid which it again parts with as the pores contract again seems
analogous in some measure to the heat produced by the vibration or
condensation of bodies as when a nail is hammered or filed till it
becomes hot as mentioned in additional notes no vii some
philosophers have endeavoured to account for this phenomenon by
supposing the existence of two electric fluids which may be called the
vitreous and resinous ones instead of the plus and minus of the same
ether but its accumulation on the rubbed glass bears great analogy to
its accumulation on the surface of the leyden bottle and can not
perhaps be explained from any known mechanical or chemical principle

the holy halo l 358 i believe it is not known with certainty at
what time the painters first introduced the luminous circle round the
head to import a saint or holy person it is now become a part of the
symbolic language of painting and it is much to be wished that this
kind of hieroglyphic character was more frequent in that art as it is
much wanted to render historic pictures both more intelligible and more
sublime and why should not painting as well as poetry express itself in
metaphor or in indistinct allegory a truly great modern painter lately
endeavoured to enlarge the sphere of pictorial language by putting a
demon behind the pillow of a wicked man on his death bed which
unfortunately for the scientific part of painting the cold criticism of
the present day has depreciated and thus barred perhaps the only road
to the further improvement in this science

nerves in animal bodies for the purpose of perceiving heat since the
degree of this fluid is so necessary to health that we become presently
injured either by its access or defect and because almost every part of
our bodies is supplied with branches from different pairs of nerves
which would not seem necessary for their motion alone it is therefore
probable that our sensation of electricity is only of its violence in
passing through our system by its suddenly distending the muscles like
any other mechanical violence and that it is general pain alone that we
feel and not any sensation analogous to the specific quality of the
object nature may seem to have been niggardly to mankind in bestowing
upon them so few senses since a sense to have perceived electricity
and another to have perceived magnetism might have been of great service
to them many ages before these fluids were discovered by accidental
experiment but it is possible an increased number of senses might have
incommoded us by adding to the size of our bodies

moves at the same time the temporary motion of a paralytic limb is
likewise caused by passing the electric shock through it which would
seem to indicate some analogy between the electric fluid and the
nervous fluid which is seperated from the blood by the brain and
thence diffused along the nerves for the purposes of motion and
sensation it probably destroys life by its sudden expansion of the
nerves or fibres of the brain in the same manner as it fuses metals and
splinters wood or stone and removes the atmosphere when it passes from
one object to another in a dense state

when richman reared l 373 dr richman professor of natural
philosophy at petersburgh about the year 1763 elevated an insulated
metallic rod to collect the aerial electricity as dr franklin had
previously done at philadelphia and as he was observing the repulsion
of the balls of his electrometer approached too near the conductor and
receiving the lightening in his head with a loud explosion was struck
dead amidst his family
       3 you led your franklin to your glazed retreats
     your airbuilt castles and your silken seats
385  bade his bold arm invade the lowering sky
     and seize the tiptoe lightnings ere they fly
     oer the young sage your mystic mantle spread
     and wreathd the crown electric round his head
     thus when on wanton wing intrepid love
390  snatchd the raised lightning from the arm of jove
     quick oer his knee the triple bolt he bent
     the clusterd darts and forky arrows rent
     snappd with illumind hands each flaming shaft
     his tingling fingers shook and stampd and laughd

     and gods retreating trembled as they gazd
     the immortal sire indulgent to his child
     bowd his ambrosial locks and heaven relenting smiled
you led your franklin l 383 dr franklin was the first that
discovered that lightening consisted of electric matter he elevated a
tall rod with a wire wrapped round it and fixing the bottom of a rod
into a glass bottle and preserving it from falling by means of silk
strings he found it electrified whenever a cloud parted over it
receiving sparks by his finger from it and charging coated phials this
great discovery taught us to defend houses and ships and temples from
lightning and also to understand that people are always perfectly
safe in a room during a thunder storm if they keep themselves at three
or four feet distance from the walls for the matter of lightning in
passing from the clouds to the earth or from the earth to the clouds
runs through the walls of a house the trunk of a tree or other
elevated object except there be some moister body as an animal in
contact with them or nearly so and in that case the lightning leaves
the wall or tree and passes through the animal but as it can pass
through metals with still greater facility it will leave animal bodies
to pass through metallic ones
if a person in the open air be surprized by a thunderstorm he will know
his danger by observing on a second watch the time which passes between
the flash and the crack and reckoning a mile for every four seconds and
a half and a little more for sound travels at the rate of 1142 feet in
a second of time and the velocity of light through such small distances
is not to be estimated in these circumstances a person will be safer by
lying down on the ground than erect and still safer if within a few
feet of his horse which being then a more elevated animal will receive
the shock in preference as the cloud passes over see additional notes

transient heat dispart l 401 dr crawford in his ingenious work on
animal heat has endeavoured to prove that during the combination of the
pure part of the atmosphere with the phlogistic part of the blood that
much of the matter of the heat is given out from the air and that this
is the great and perpetual source of the heat of animals to which we
may add that the phosphoric acid is probably produced by this
combination by which acid the colour of the blood is changed in the
lungs from a deep crimson to a bright scarlet there seems to be however
another source of animal heat though of a similar nature and that is
from the chemical combinations produced in all the glands since by
whatever cause any glandular secretion is increased as by friction or
topical imflammation the heat of that part becomes increased at the
same time thus after the hands have been for a time immersed in snow
on coming into a warm room they become red and hot without any
increased pulmonary action besides this there would seem to be another
material received from the air by respiration which is so necessary to
life that the embryon must learn to breathe almost within a minute
after
its birth or it dies the perpetual necessity of breathing shews that
the material thus acquired is perpetually consuming or escaping and on
that account requires perpetual renovation perhaps the spirit of
animation itself is thus acquired from the atmosphere which if it be
supposed to be finer or more subtle than the electric matter could not
long be retained in our bodies and must therefore require perpetual
renovation

of the western wind l 430 the principal frosts of this country are
accompanied or produced by a ne wind and the thaws by a sw wind
the reason of which is that the ne winds consist of regions of air
brought from the north which appear to acquire an easterly direction as
they advance and the sw winds consist of regions of air brought from
the south which appear to acquire a westerly direction as they advance
the surface of the earth nearer the pole moves slower than it does in
our latitude whence the regions of air brought from thence move
slower when they arrive hither than the earths surface with which
they now become in contact that is they acquire an apparent easterly
direction as the earth moves from west to east faster than this new
part of its atmosphere the sw winds on the contrary consist of
regions of air brought from the south where the surface of the earth
moves faster than in our latitude and have therefore a westerly
direction when they arrive hither by their moving faster than the
surface of the earth with which they are in contact and in general the
nearer to the west and the greater the velocity of these winds the
warmer they should be in respect to the season of the year since they
have been brought more expeditiously from the south than those winds
which have less westerly direction and have thence been less cooled in
their passage
sometimes i have observed the thaw to commence immediately on the change
of the wind even within an hour if i am not mistaken or sooner at
other times the sw wind has continued a day or even two before the
thaw has commenced during which time some of the frosty air which had
gone southwards is driven back over us and in consequence has taken a
westerly direction as well as a southern one at other times i have
observed a frost with a ne wind every morning and a thaw with a sw
wind every noon for several days together see additional note xxxiii
the fiend of frost l 439 the principal injury done to vegetation
by frost is from the expansion of the water contained in the vessels of
plants water converted into ice occupies a greater space than it did
before as appears by the bursting of bottles filled with water at the
time of their freezing hence frost destroys those plants of our island
first which are most succulent and the most succulent parts first of
other plants as their leaves and last years shoots the vessels of
which are distended and burst by the expansion of their freezing fluids
while the drier or more resinous plants as pines yews laurels and
other evergreens are less liable to injury from cold the trees in
vallies are on this account more injured by the vernal frosts than those
on eminencies because their early succulent shoots come out sooner
hence fruit trees covered by a sixinch coping of a wall are less
injured by the vernal frosts because their being shielded from showers
and the descending nightdews has prevented them from being moist at the
time of their being frozen which circumstance has given occasion to a
vulgar error amongst gardeners who suppose frost to descend
as the common heat of the earth in this climate is 48 degrees those
tender trees which will bear bending down are easily secured from the
frost by spreading them upon the ground and covering them with straw or
fern this particularly suits figtrees as they easily bear bending to
the ground and are furnished with an acrid juice which secures them
from the depredations of insects but are nevertheless liable to be
eaten by mice see additional notes no xii

in buds imprisond l 460 the buds and bulbs of plants constitute
what is termed by linneus the hybernaculum or winter cradle of the
embryon vegetable the buds arise from the bark on the branches of
trees and the bulbs from the caudex of bulbousrooted plants or the
part from which the fibres of the root are produced they are defended
from too much moisture and from frosts and from the depredations of
insects by various contrivances as by scales hairs resinous
varnishes and by acrid rinds
the buds of trees are of two kinds either flowerbuds or leaf buds the
former of these produce their seeds and die the latter produce other
leaf buds or flower buds and die so that all the buds of trees may be
considered as annual plants having their embryon produced during the
preceeding summer the same seems to happen with respect to bulbs thus
a tulip produces annually one flowerbearing bulb sometimes two and
several leafbearing bulbs and then the old root perishes next year
the flowerbearing bulb produces seeds and other bulbs and perishes
while the leafbearing bulb producing other bulbs only perishes
likewise these circumstances establish a strict analogy between bulbs
and buds see additional notes no xiv
viewless floods of heat l 462 the fluid matter of heat or
calorique in which all bodies are immersed is as necessary to
vegetable as to animal existence it is not yet determinable whether
heat and light be different materials or modifications of the same
materials as they have some properties in common they appear to be
both of them equally necessary to vegetable health since without light
green vegetables become first yellow that is they lose the blue
colour which contributed to produce the green and afterwards they also
lose the yellow and become white as is seen in cellery blanched or
etiolated for the table by excluding the light from it
the upper surface of leaves which i suppose to be their organ of
respiration seems to require light as well as air since plants which
grow in windows on the inside of houses are equally sollicitous to turn
the upper side of their leaves to the light vegetables at the same time
exsude or perspire a great quantity from their leaves as animals do
from their lungs this perspirable matter as it rises from their fine
vessels perhaps much finer than the pores of animal skins is divided
into inconcievable tenuity and when acted upon by the suns light
appears to be decomposed the hydrogene becomes a part of the vegetable
composing oils or resins and the oxygene combined with light or
calorique ascends producing the pure part of the atmosphere or vital
air hence during the light of the day vegetables give up more pure air
than their respiration injures but not so in the night even though
equally exposed to warmth this single fact would seem to shew that
light is essentially different from heat and it is perhaps by its
combination with bodies that their combined or latent heat is set at
liberty and becomes sensible see additional note xxxiv
electric torrents pour l 463 the influence of electricity in
forwarding the germination of plants and their growth seems to be pretty
well established though mr ingenhouz did not succeed in his
experiments and thence doubts the success of those of others and
though m rouland from his new experiments believes that neither
positive nor negative electricity increases vegetation both which
philosophers had previously been supporters of the contrary doctrine
for many other naturalists have since repeated their experiments
relative to this object and their new results have confirmed their
former ones mr dormoy and the two roziers have found the same success
in numerous experiments which they have made in the last two years and
mr carmoy has shewn in a convincing manner that electricity accelerates
germination
mr dormoy not only found various seeds to vegetate sooner and to grow
taller which were put upon his insulated table and supplied with
electricity but also that silkworms began to spin much sooner which
were kept electrified than those of the same hatch which were kept in
the same place and manner except that they were not electrified these
experiments of m dormoy are detailed at length in the journal de
physique of rozier tom xxxv p 270
m bartholon who had before written a tract on this subject and
proposed ingenious methods for applying electricity to agriculture and
gardening has also repeated a numerous set of experiments and shews
both that natural electricity as well as the artificial increases the
growth of plants and the germination of seeds and opposes mr
ingenhouz by very numerous and conclusive facts ib tom xxxv p 401
since by the late discoveries or opinions of the chemists there is
reason to believe that water is decomposed in the vessels of vegetables
and that the hydrogene or inflammable air of which it in part consists
contributes to the nourishment of the plant and to the production of
its oils rosins gums sugar c and lastly as electricity decomposes
water into these two airs termed oxygene and hydrogene there is a
powerful analogy to induce us to believe that it accelerates or
contributes to the growth of vegetation and like heat may possibly
enter into combination with many bodies or form the basis of some yet
unanalised acid

on icebuilt isles l 529 there are many reasons to believe from
the accounts of travellers and navigators that the islands of ice in
the higher northern latitudes as well as the glaciers on the alps
continue perpetually to increase in bulk at certain times in the ice
mountains of switzerland there happen cracks which have shewn the great
thickness of the ice as some of these cracks have measured three or
four hundred ells deep the great islands of ice in the northern seas
near hudsons bay have been observed to have been immersed above one
hundred fathoms beneath the surface of the sea and to have risen a
fifth or sixth part above the surface and to have measured between
three and four miles in circumference phil trans no 465 sect 2
dr lister endeavoured to shew that the ice of seawater contains some
salt and perhaps less air than common ice and that it is therefore much
more difficult of solution whence he accounts for the perpetual and
great increase of these floating islands of ice philos trans no 169
as by a famous experiment of mr boyles it appears that ice evaporates
very fast in severe frosty weather when the wind blows upon it and as
ice in a thawing state is known to contain six times more cold than
water at the same degree of sensible coldness it is easy to understand
that winds blowing over islands and continents of ice perhaps much below
nothing on farenheits scale and coming from thence into our latitude
must bring great degrees of cold along with them if we add to this the
quantity of cold produced by the evaporation of the water as well as by
the solution of the ice we cannot doubt but that the northern ice is
the principle source of the coldness of our winters and that it is
brought hither by the regions of air blowing from the north and which
take an apparent easterly direction by their coming to a part of the
surface of the earth which moves faster than the latitude they come
from hence the increase of the ice in the polar regions by increasing
the cold of our climate adds at the same time to the bulk of the
glaciers of italy and switzerland
if the nations who inhabit this hemisphere of the globe instead of
destroying their seamen and exhausting their wealth in unnecessary
wars could be induced to unite their labours to navigate these immense
masses of ice into the more southern oceans two great advantages would
result to mankind the tropic countries would be much cooled by their
solution and our winters in this latitude would be rendered much milder
for perhaps a century or two till the masses of ice became again
enormous
mr bradley describes the cold winds and wet weather which sometimes
happen in may and june to the solution of iceislands accidentally
floating from the north treatise on husbandry and gardening vol ii
p 437 and adds that mr barham about the year 1718 in his voyage
from jamaica to england in the beginning of june met with iceislands
coming from the north which were surrounded with so great a fog that
the ship was in danger of striking upon them and that one of them
measured fifty miles in length
we have lately experienced an instance of iceislands brought from the
southern polar regions on which the guardian struck at the beginning of
her passage from the cape of good hope towards botany bay on december
22 1789 these islands were involved in mist were about one hundred
and fifty fathoms long and about fifty fathoms above the surface of the

calorique seems to acquire electric matter at the same time as appears
from an experiment of mr bennet he put some live coals into an
insulated funnel of metal and throwing on them a little water observed
that the ascending steam was electrised plus and the water which
descended through the funnel was electrised minus hence it appears that
though clouds by their change of form may sometimes become electrised
minus yet they have in general an accumulation of electricity this
accumulation of electric matter also evidently contributes to support
the atmospheric vapour when it is condensed into the form of clouds
because it is seen to descend rapidly after the flashes of lightning
have diminished its quantity whence there is reason to conclude that
very numerous metallic rods with fine points erected high in the air
might induce it at any time to part with some of its water
if we may trust the theory of mr lavoisier concerning the composition
and decomposition of water there would seem another source of thunder
showers and that is that the two gasses termed oxygene gas or vital
air and hydrogene gas or inflammable air may exist in the summer
atmosphere in a state of mixture but not of combination and that the
electric spark or flash of lightning may combine them and produce water
instantaneously

when from its vaporous air l 17 if the nucleus of the earth was
thrown out from the sun by an explosion along with as large a quantity
of surrounding hot vapour as its attraction would occasion to accompany
it the ponderous semifluid nucleus would take a spherical form from
the attraction of its own parts which would become an oblate spheroid
from its diurnal revolution as the vapour cooled the water would be
precipitated and an ocean would surround the spherical nucleus with a
superincumbent atmosphere the nucleus of solar lava would likewise
become harder as it became cooler to understand how the strata of the
earth were afterwards formed from the sediments of this circumfluent
ocean the reader is referred to an ingenious treatise on the theory of
the earth by mr whitehurst who was many years a watchmaker and
engineer at derby but whose ingenuity integrity and humanity were

these seaproductions are found clay iron coal salt and siliceous
sand or gritstone thus there seem to be three divisions of the globe
distinctly marked the first i suppose to have been the original nucleus
of the earth or lava projected from the sun 2 over this lie the
recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced in the ocean and 3
over these the recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced upon

combination of those already mentioned as siliceous sand fluor

raised her primeval islands l 36 the nucleus of the earth still
covered with water received perpetual increase by the immense
quantities of shells and coralloids either annually produced and
relinquishied or left after the death of the animals these would
gradually by their different degrees of cohesion be some of them more
and others less removable by the influence of solar tides and gentle
tropical breezes which then must have probably extended from one pole
to the other for it is supposed the moon was not yet produced and that
no storms or unequal winds had yet existence
hence then the primeval islands had their gradual origin were raised
but a few feet above the level of the sea and were not exposed to the
great or sudden variations of heat and cold as is so well explained in
mr whitehursts theory of the earth chap xvi whence the paradise of
the sacred writers and the golden age of the profane ones seems to
have had a real existence as there can be no rainbow when the heavens
are covered with clouds because the sunbeams are then precluded from
falling upon the raindrops opposite to the eye of the spectator the
rainbow is a mark of gentle or partial showers mr whitehurst has
endeavoured to show that the primitive islands were only moistened by
nocturnal dews and not by showers as occurs at this day to the delta of
egypt and is thence of opinion that the rainbow had no existence till
after the production of mountains and continents as the salt of the sea
has been gradually accumulating being washed down into it from the
recrements of animal and vegetable bodies the sea must originally have
been as fresh as river water and as it is not yet saturated with salt
must become annually more saline see note on l 119 of this canto

the first volcano l 68 as the earth before the existence of
earthquakes was nearly level and the greatest part of it covered with
sea when the first great fires began deep in the internal parts of it
those parts would become much expanded this expansion would be
gradually extended as the heat increased through the whole terraqueous
globe of 7000 miles diameter the crust would thence in many places open
into fissures which by admitting the sea to flow in upon the fire
would produce not only a quantity of steam beyond calculation by its
expansion but would also by its decomposition produce inflammable air
and vital air in quantities beyond conception sufficient to effect
those violent explosions the vestiges of which all over the world
excite our admiration and our study the difficulty of understanding how
subterraneous fires could exist without the presence of air has
disappeared since dr priestleys discoveries of such great quantities
of pure air which constitute all the acids and consequently exist in
all saline bodies as seasalt nitre limestone and in all calciform
ores as manganese calamy ochre and other mineral substances see an
ingenious treatise by mr michel on earthquakes in the philos trans
in these first tremendous ignitions of the globe as the continents were
heaved up the vallies which now hold the sea were formed by the earth
subsiding into the cavities made by the rising mountains as the steam
which raised them condensed which would thence not have any caverns of
great extent remain beneath them as some philosophers have imagined

to those of antient times and are ingeniously compared by m de luc to

her airless realms of frost l 82 if the moon had no atmosphere at
the time of its elevation from the earth or if its atmosphere was
afterwards stolen from it by the earths attraction the water on the
moon would rise quickly into vapour and the cold produced by a certain
quantity of this evaporation would congeal the remainder of it hence it
is not probable that the moon is at present inhabited but as it seems
to have suffered and to continue to suffer much by volcanos a
sufficient quantity of air may in process of time be generated to
produce an atmosphere which may prevent its heat from so easily
escaping and its water from so easily evaporating and thence become
fit for the production of vegetables and animals
that the moon possesses little or no atmosphere is deduced from the
undiminished lustre of the stars at the instant when they emerge from
behind her disk that the ocean of the moon is frozen is confirmed from
there being no appearance of lunar tides which if they existed would
cover the part of her disk nearest the earth see note on canto iii l

     when earth recoiling staggerd from her course
 85  when as her line in slower circles spun

     swept her vast wrecks of mountain vale and plain
     and while new tides their shouting floods unite

     and markd with lunar cycles solar years
when earth recoiling l 84 on supposition that the moon was thrown
from the earth by the explosion of water or the generation of other
vapours of greater power the remaining part of the globe would recede
from its orbit in one direction as the moon receded in another and that
in proportion to the respective momentum of each and would afterwards
revolve round their common centre of gravity
if the moon rose from any part of the earth except exactly at the line
or poles the shock would tend to turn the axis of the earth out of its
previous direction and as a mass of matter rising from deep parts of
the globe would have previously acquired less diurnal velocity than the
earths surface from whence it rose it would receive during the time of
its rising additional velocity from the earths surface and would
consequently so much retard the motion of the earth round its axis
when the earth thus receded the shock would overturn all its buildings
and forests and the water would rush with inconceivable violence over
its surface towards the new satellite from two causes both by its not
at first acquiring the velocity with which the earth receded and by the
attraction of the new moon as it leaves the earth on these accounts at
first there would be but one tide till the moon receded to a greater
distance and the earth moving round a common centre of gravity between
them the water on the side furthest from the moon would acquire a
centrifugal force in respect to this common centre between itself and
the moon

those limestones have been in such a situation that they could form
perfect crystals they are called spars some of which possess a double
refraction as observed by sir isaac newton when these crystals are
jumbled together or mixed with some colouring impurities it is termed
marble if its texture be equable and firm if its texture be coarse and
porous yet hard it is called limestone if its texture be very loose

unchanged and only covered or bedded with limestone which seems to
have been dissolved and sunk down amongst them in others the softer

that workmen have frequently lost their way their lights having been
burnt out and have perished before they could be found essais c par

bivalves and madrepores in the saltmines of wialiczka near cracow
during the evaporation of the lakes of saltwater as in artificial
saltworks the salt begins to crystallize near the edges where the
water is shallowest forming hollow inverted pyramids which when they
become of a certain size subside by their gravity if urged by a
stronger fire the salt fuses or forms large cubes whence the salt
shaped in hollow pyramids called flakesalt is better tasted and
preserves flesh better than the basket or powder salt because it is
made by less heat and thence contains more of the marine acid the sea

animal and vegetable matters are compleatly decomposed and which are
exposed to the action of the air as on the walls of stables and

dr priestley discovered that nitrous air or gas which he obtained by
dissolving metals in nitrous acid would combine rapidly with vital air
and produce with it a true nitrous acid forming red clouds during the
combination the two airs occupy only the space before occupied by one
of them and at the same time heat is given out from the new
combination this dimunition of the bulk of a mixture of nitrous gas and
vital air dr priestley ingeniously used as a test of the purity of the
latter a discovery of the greatest importance in the analysis of airs
mr cavendish has since demonstrated that two parts of vital air or
oxygene and one part of phlogistic air or azote being long exposed to
electric shocks unite and produce nitrous acid philos trans vols
lxxv and lxxviii
azote is one of the most abundant elements in nature and combined with
calorique or heat it forms azotic gas or phlogistic air and composes
two thirds of the atmosphere and is one of the principal component
parts of animal bodies and when united to vital air or oxygene produces
the nitrous acid mr lavoisier found that 2112 parts by weight of
azote and 4312 parts of oxygene produced 64 parts of nitrous gas and
by the further addition of 36 parts of oxygene nitrous acid was
produced trait de chimie when two airs become united so as to produce
an unelastic liquid much calorique or heat is of necessity expelled from
the new combination though perhaps nitrous acid and oxygenated marine
acid admit more heat into their combinations than other acids

hence dusky iron l 183 the production of iron from the
decomposition of vegetable bodies is perpetually presented to our view
the waters oozing from all morasses are chalybeate and deposit their
ochre on being exposed to the air the iron acquiring a calciform state
from its union with oxygene or vital air where thin morasses lie on
beds of gravel the latter are generally stained by the filtration of
some of the chalybeate water through them this formation of iron from
vegetable recrements is further evinced by the fern leaves and other
parts of vegetables so frequently found in the centre of the knobs or
nodules of some ironores
in some of these nodules there is a nucleus of whiter ironearth
surrounded by many concentric strata of darker and lighter ironearth
alternately in one which now lies before me the nucleus is a prism of
a triangular form with blunted angles and about half an inch high and
an inch and half broad on every side of this are concentric strata of
similar ironearth alternately browner and less brown each stratum is
about a tenth of an inch in thickness and there are ten of them in
number to what known cause can this exactly regular distribution of so
many earthy strata of different colours surrounding the nucleus be
ascribed i dont know that any mineralogists have attempted an
explanation of this wonderful phenomenon i suspect it is owing to the
polarity of the central nucleus if ironfilings be regularly laid on
paper by means of a small sieve and a magnet be placed underneath the
filings will dispose themselves in concentric curves with vacant
intervals between them now if these ironfilings are conceived to be
suspended in a fluid whose specific gravity is similar to their own
and a magnetic bar was introduced as an axis into this fluid it is easy
to foresee that the iron filings would dispose themselves into
concentric spheres with intervals of the circumnatant fluid between
them exactly as is seen in these nodules of ironearth as all the
lavas consist of one fourth of iron kirvans mineral and almost all
other known bodies whether of animal or vegetable origin possess more
or less of this property may not the distribution of a great portion of
the globe of the earth into strata of greater or less regularity be
owing to the polarity of the whole
and turn to adamant l 192 the circumstances which render iron more
valuable to mankind than any other metal are 1 its property of being
rendered hard to so great a degree and thus constituting such excellent
tools it was the discovery of this property of iron mr locke thinks
that gave such preeminence to the european world over the american one
2 its power of being welded that is when two pieces are made very hot
and applied together by hammering they unite compleatly unless any
scale of iron intervenes and to prevent this it is usual for smiths to
dip the very hot bar in sand a little of which fuses into fluid glass
with the scale and is squeezed out from between the uniting parts by the
force of hammering 3 its power of acquiring magnetism
it is however to be wished that gold or silver were discovered in as

last michells hands l 193 the discovery of the magnet seems to
have been in very early times it is mentioned by plato lucretius
pliny and galen and is said to have taken its name of magnes from
magnesia a seaport of antient lybia
as every piece of iron which was made magnetical by the touch of a
magnet became itself a magnet many attempts were made to improve these
artificial magnets but without much success till servingdon savary
esq made them of hardened steel bars which were so powerful that one
of them weighing three pounds averdupois would lift another of the same
weight philos trans
after this dr knight made very successful experiments on this subject
which though he kept his method secret seems to have excited others to
turn their attention to magnetism at this time the rev mr michell
invented an equally efficacious and more expeditious way of making
strong artificial magnets which he published in the end of the year
1750 in which he explained his method of what he called the double
touch and which since mr knights method has been known appears to
be somewhat different from it
this method of rendering bars of hardened steel magnetical consists in
holding vertically two or more magnetic bars nearly parallel to each
other with their opposite poles very near each other but nevertheless
separated to a small distance these are to be slided over a line of
bars laid horizontally a few times backward and forward see michell on
magnetism also a detailed account in chambers dictionary
what mr michell proposed by this method was to include a very small
portion of the horizontal bars intended to be made magnetical between
the joint forces of two or more bars already magnetical and by sliding
them from end to end every part of the line of bars became successively
included and thus bars possessed of a very small degree of magnetism to
begin with would in a few times sliding backwards and forwards make the
other ones much more magnetical than themselves which are then to be
taken up and used to touch the former which are in succession to be
laid down horizontally in a line
there is still a great field remains for future discoveries in magnetism
both in respect to experiment and theory the latter consists of vague
conjectures the more probable of which are perhaps those of elpinus as
they assimulate it to electricity
one conjecture i shall add viz that the polarity of magnetism may be
owing to the earths rotatory motion if heat electricity and
magnetism are supposed to be fluids of different gravities heat being
the heaviest of them electricity the next heavy and magnetism the
lightest it is evident that by the quick revolution of the earth the
heat will be accumulated most over the line electricity next beneath
this and that the magnetism will be detruded to the poles and axis of
the earth like the atmospheres of common air and of inflammable gas as
explained in the note on canto i l 123
electricity and heat will both of them displace magnetism and this
shows that they may gravitate on each other and hence when too great a
quantity of the electric fluid becomes accumulated at the poles by
descending snows or other unknown causes it may have a tendency to
rise towards the tropics by its centrifugal force and produce the
northern lights see additional notes no i

diffusive acids flow l 215 the production of marine acid from
decomposing vegetable and animal matters with vital air and of nitrous
acid from azote and vital air the former of which is united to its
basis by means of the exhalations from vegetable and animal matters
constitute an analogy which induces us to believe that many other acids
have either their bases or are united to vital air by means of some part
of decomposing vegetable and animal matters
the great quantities of flint sand whether formed in mountains or in the
sea would appear to derive its acid from the new world as it is found
above the strata of limestone and granite which constitute the old
world and as the earthy basis of flint is probably calcareous a great
part of it seems to be produced by a conjunction of the new and old
world the recrements of airbreathing animals and vegetables probably
afford the acid and the shells of marine animals the earthy basis
while another part may have derived its calcareous part also from the
decomposition of vegetable and animal bodies
the same mode of reasoning seems applicable to the siliceous stones
under various names as amethyst onyx agate mochoe opal c which
do not seem to have undergone any process from volcanic fires and as
these stones only differ from flint by a greater or less admixture of
argillaceous and calcareous earths the different proportions of which
in each kind of stone may be seen in mr kirwans valuable elements of
mineralogy see additional notes no xix
living diamonds blaze l 228 sir isaac newton having observed the
great power of refracting light which the diamond possesses above all
other crystallized or vitreous matter conjectured that it was an
inflammable body in some manner congealed insomuch that all the light
is reflected which falls on any of its interior surfaces at a greater
angle of incidence than 2412 degrees whereas an artificial gem of
glass does not reflect any light from its hinder surface unless that
surface is inclined in an angle of 41 degrees hence the diamond
reflects half as much more light as a factitious gem in similar
circumstances to which must be added its great transparency and the
excellent polish it is capable of the diamond had nevertheless been
placed at the head of crystals or precious stones by the mineralogists
till bergman ranged it of late in the combustible class of bodies
because by the focus of villettes burning mirror it was evaporated by a
heat not much greater than will melt silver and gave out light mr
hoepfner however thinks the dispersion of the diamond by this great heat
should be called a phosphorescent evaporation of it rather than a
combustion and from its other analogies of crystallization hardness
transparency and place of its nativity wishes again to replace it
amongst the precious stones observ sur la physique par rozier tom

inconstant jove l 229 the purer air or ether in the antient
mythology was represented by jupiter and the inferior air by juno and
the conjunction of these deities was said to produce the vernal showers
and procreate all things as is further spoken of in canto iii l 204
it is now discovered that pure air or oxygene uniting with variety of
bases forms the various kinds of acids as the vitriolic acid from pure
air and sulphur the nitrous acid from pure air and phlogistic air or
azote and carbonic acid or fixed air from pure air and charcoal
some of these affinities were perhaps portrayed by the magi of egypt
who were probably learned in chemistry in their hieroglyphic pictures

rocks have been cracked to very great depths at the time they were
raised up by subterranean fires in these cracks are found most of the
metallic ores except iron and perhaps manganese the former of which is
generally found in horizontal strata and the latter generally near the
surface of the earth
philosophers possessing so convenient a test for the discovery of iron
by the magnet have long since found it in all vegetable and animal
matters and of late mr scheele has discovered the existence of
manganese in vegetable ashes scheele 56 mem stock 1774 kirwan min
353 which accounts for the production of it near the surface of earth
and thence for its calciform appearance or union with vital air
bergman has likewise shewn that the limestones which become bluish or
dark coloured when calcined possess a mixture of manganese and are
thence preferable as a cement to other kinds of lime 2 bergman 229
which impregnation with manganese has probably been received from the
decomposition of superincumbent vegetable matters
these cracks or perpendicular caverns in the granite or limestone pass
to unknown depths and it is up these channels that i have endeavoured
to shew that the steam rises which becomes afterwards condensed and
produces the warm springs of this island and other parts of the world
see note on fucus vol ii and up these cracks i suppose certain
vapours arise which either alone or by meeting with something
descending into them from above have produced most of the metals and
several of the materials in which they are bedded thus the ponderous
earth barytes of derbyshire is found in these cracks and is
stratified frequently with leadore and frequently surrounds it this
ponderous earth has been found by dr hoepfner in a granite in
switzerland and may have thus been sublimed from immense depths by
great heat and have obtained its carbonic or vitriolic acid from above
annales de chimie there is also reason to conclude that something from
above is necessary to the formation of many of the metals at hawkstone
in shropshire the seat of sir richard hill there is an elevated rock
of siliceous sand which is coloured green with copper in many places
high in the air and i have in my possession a specimen of lead formed
in the cavity of an iron nodule and another of lead amid spar from a
crack of a coalstratum all which countenance the modern production of
those metals from descending materials to which should be added that
the highest mountains of granite which have therefore probably never
been covered with marine productions on account of their early
elevation nor with vegetable or animal matters on account of their
great coldness contain no metallic ores whilst the lower ones contain
copper and tin in their cracks or veins both in saxony silesia and
cornwall kirwans mineral p 374
the transmutation of one metal into another though hitherto
undiscovered by the alchymists does not appear impossible such
transmutations have been supposed to exist in nature thus lapis
calaminaris may have been produced from the destruction of leadore as
it is generally found on the top of the veins of lead where it has been
calcined or united with air and because masses of leadore are often
found intirely inclosed in it so silver is found mixed in almost all
leadores and sometimes in seperate filaments within the cavities of
leadore as i am informed by mr michell and is thence probably a
partial transmutation of the lead to silver the rapid progress of
modern chemistry having shewn the analogy between metallic calces and
acids may lead to the power of transmuting their bases a discovery
much to be wished

and stalking turrets l 478 at one oclock we alighted among some
acacia trees at waadi el halboub having gone twentyone miles we were
here at once surprised and terrified by a sight surely one of the most
magnificent in the world in that vast expanse of desert from w to
nw of us we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different
distances at times moving with great celerity at others stalking on
with a majestic slowness at intervals we thought they were coming in a
very few minutes to overwhelm us and small quantities of sand did
actually more than once reach us again they would retreat so as to be
almost out of sight their tops reaching to the very clouds there the
tops often separated from the bodies and these once disjoined
dispersed in the air and did not appear more sometimes they were
broken in the middle as if struck with large cannonshot about noon
they began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us the wind
being very strong at north eleven of them ranged along side of us about
the distance of three miles the greatest diameter of the largest
appeared to me at that distance as if it would measure ten feet they
retired from us with a wind at se leaving an impression upon my mind
to which i can give no name though surely one ingredient in it was
fear with a considerable deal of wonder and astonishment it was in
vain to think of flying the swiftest horse or fastest sailing ship
could be of no use to carry us out of this danger and the full
persuasion of this rivetted me as if to the spot where i stood
the same appearance of moving pillars of sand presented themselves to
us this day in form and disposition like those we had seen at waadi
halboub only they seemed to be more in number and less in size they
came several times in a direction close upon us that is i believe
within less than two miles they began immediately after sun rise like a
thick wood and almost darkened the sun his rays shining through them
for near an hour gave them an appearance of pillars of fire our people
now became desperate the greeks shrieked out and said it was the day of
judgment ismael pronounced it to be hell and the turcorories that the
world was on fire bruces travels vol iv p 553555
from this account it would appear that the eddies of wind were owing to
the long range of broken rocks which bounded one side of the sandy
desert and bent the currents of air which struck against their sides
and were thus like the eddies in a stream of water which falls against
oblique obstacles this explanation is probably the true one as these
whirlwinds were not attended with rain or lightening like the tornadoes
of the westindies

wooden wedges wound l 524 it is usual in seperating large mill
stones from the siliceous sandrocks in some parts of derbyshire to bore
horizontal holes under them in a circle and fill these with pegs made
of dry wood which gradually swell by the moisture of the earth and in
a day or two lift up the millstone without breaking it
with fires and acids l 534 hannibal was said to erode his way over
the alps by fire and vinegar the latter is supposed to allude to the
vinegar and water which was the beverage of his army in respect to the
former it is not improbable but where wood was to be had in great
abundance that fires made round limestone precipices would calcine them
to a considerable depth the nightdews or mountainmists would
penetrate these calcined parts and pulverize them by the force of the
steam which the generated heat would produce the winds would disperse
this limepowder and thus by repeated fires a precipice of limestone
might be destroyed and a passage opened it should be added that
according to ferbers observations these alps consist of limestone

the transmigrating ens l 574 the perpetual circulation of matter
in the growth and dissolution of vegetable and animal bodies seems to
have given pythagoras his idea of the metempsycosis or transmigration of
spirit which was afterwards dressed out or ridiculed in variety of
amusing fables other philosophers have supposed that there are two
different materials or essences which fill the universe one of these
which has the power of commencing or producing motion is called spirit
the other which has the power of receiving and of communicating motion
but not of beginning it is called matter the former of these is
supposed to be diffused through all space filling up the interstices of
the suns and planets and constituting the gravitations of the sidereal
bodies the attractions of chemistry with the spirit of vegetation and
of animation the latter occupies comparatively but small space
constituting the solid parts of the suns and planets and their
atmospheres hence these philosophers have supposed that both matter
and spirit are equally immortal and unperishable and that on the
dissolution of vegetable or animal organization the matter returns to
the general mass of matter and the spirit to the general mass of
spirit to enter again into new combinations according to the original
idea of pythagoras
the small apparent quantity of matter that exists in the universe
compared to that of spirit and the short time in which the recrements
of animal or vegetable bodies become again vivified in the forms of
vegetable mucor or microscopic insects seems to have given rise to
another curious fable of antiquity that jupiter threw down a large
handful of souls upon the earth and left them to scramble for the few

adonis l 576 the very antient story of the beautiful adonis
passing one half of the year with venus and the other with proserpine
alternately has had variety of interpretations some have supposed that
it allegorized the summer and winter solstice but this seems too
obvious a fact to have needed an hieroglyphic emblem others have
believed it to represent the corn which was supposed to sleep in the
earth during the winter months and to rise out of it in summer this
does not accord with the climate of egypt where the harvest soon
follows the seedtime
it seems more probably to have been a story explaining some hieroglyphic
figures representing the decomposition and resuscitation of animal
matter a sublime and interesting subject and which seems to have given
origin to the doctrine of the transmigration which had probably its
birth also from the hieroglyphic treasures of egypt it is remarkable
that the cypress groves in the ancient greek writers as in theocritus
were dedicated to venus and afterwards became funereal emblems which
was probably occasioned by the cypress being an accompaniment of venus
in the annual processions in which she was supposed to lament over the
funeral of adonis a ceremony which obtained over all the eastern world
from great antiquity and is supposed to be referred to by ezekiel who
accuses the idolatrous woman of weeping for thammus

    shade follows shade by laughing zephyrs drove
    and all the chequerd landscape seems to move
but were altered on account of the supposed false grammar in using the
word drove for driven according to the opinion of dr lowth at the
same time it may be observed 1 that this is in many cases only an
ellipsis of the letter n at the end of the word as froze for frozen
wove for woven spoke for spoken and that then the participle
accidentally becomes similar to the past tense 2 that the language
seems gradually tending to omit the letter n in other kind of words
for the sake of euphony as housen is become houses eyne eyes thine
thy c and in common conversation the words forgot spoke froze
rode are frequently used for forgotten spoken frozen ridden 3 it
does not appear that any confusion would follow the indiscriminate use
of the same word for the past tense and the participle passive since
the auxiliary verb have or the preceding noun or pronoun always
clearly distinguishes them and lastly rhimepoetry must lose the use
of many elegant words without this license

the winged vapours l 14 see additional note no xxv on
evaporation
on each broad cloud l 15 the clouds consist of condensed vapour
the particles of which are too small separately to overcome the tenacity
of the air and which therefore do not descend they are in such small
spheres as to repel each other that is they are applied to each other
by such very small surfaces that the attraction of the particles of
each drop to its own centre is greater than its attraction to the
surface of the drop in its vicinity every one has observed with what
difficulty small spherules of quicksilver can be made to unite owing to
the same cause and it is common to see on riding through shallow water
on a clear day numbers of very small spheres of water as they are
thrown from the horses feet run along the surface for many yards before
they again unite with it in many cases these spherules of water which
compose clouds are kept from uniting by a surplus of electric fluid
and fall in violent showers as soon as that is withdrawn from them as
in thunder storms see note on canto i l 553
if in this state a cloud becomes frozen it is torn to pieces in its
descent by the friction of the air and falls in white flakes of snow
or these flakes are rounded by being rubbed together by the winds and
by having their angles thawed off by the warmer air beneath as they
descend and part of the water produced by these angles thus dissolved
is absorbed into the body of the hailstone as may be seen by holding a
lump of snow over a candle and there becomes frozen into ice by the
quantity of cold which the hailstone possesses beneath the freezing
point or which is produced by its quick evaporation in falling and
thus hailstones are often found of greater or less density according as
they consist of a greater portion of snow or ice if hailstones
consisted of the large drops of showers frozen in their descent they
would consist of pure transparent ice
as hail is only produced in summer and is always attended with storms
some philosophers have believed that the sudden departure of electricity
from a cloud may effect something yet unknown in this phenomenon but it
may happen in summer independent of electricity because the aqueous
vapour is then raised higher in the atmosphere whence it has further to
fall and there is warmer air below for it to fall through
or sink in silver dews l 18 during the coldness of the night the
moisture before dissolved in the air is gradually precipitated and as
it subsides adheres to the bodies it falls upon where the attraction of
the body to the particles of water is greater than the attractions of
those particles to each other it becomes spread upon their surface or
slides down them in actual contact as on the broad parts of the blades
of moist grass where the attraction of the surface to the water is less
than the attraction of the particles of water to each other the dew
stands in drops as on the points and edges of grass or gorse where the
surface presented to the drop being small it attracts it so little as
but just to support it without much changing its globular form where
there is no attraction between the vegetable surface and the dew drops
as on cabbage leaves the drop does not come into contact with the leaf
but hangs over it repelled and retains it natural form composed of the
attraction and pressure of its own parts and thence looks like
quicksilver reflecting light from both its surfaces nor is this owing
to any oiliness of the leaf but simply to the polish of its surface as
a light needle may be laid on water in the same manner without touching
it for as the attractive powers of polished surfaces are greater when
in actual contact so the repulsive power is greater before contact
the blue mist l 20 mists are clouds resting on the ground they
generally come on at the beginning of night and either fill the moist
vallies or hang on the summits of hills according to the degree of
moisture previously dissolved and the eduction of heat from them the
air over rivers during the warmth of the day suspends much moisture and
as the changeful surface of rivers occasions them to cool sooner than
the land at the approach of evening mists are most frequently seen to
begin over rivers and to spread themselves over moist grounds and fill
the vallies while the mists on the tops of mountains are more properly
clouds condensed by the coldness of their situation
on ascending up the side of a hill from a misty valley i have observed
a beautiful coloured halo round the moon when a certain thickness of
mist was over me which ceased to be visible as soon as i emerged out of
it and well remember admiring with other spectators the shadow of the
three spires of the cathedral church at lichfield the moon rising
behind it apparently broken off and lying distinctly over our heads as
if horizontally on the surface of the mist which arose about as high as
the roof of the church there are some curious remarks on shadows or
reflexions seen on the surface of mists from high mountains in ulloas
voyages the dry mist of summer 1783 was probably occasioned by
volcanic eruption as mentioned in note on chunda vol ii and
therefore more like the atmosphere of smoke which hangs on still days
over great cities
there is a dry mist or rather a diminished transparence of the air
which according to mr saussure accompanies fair weather while great
transparence of air indicates rain thus when large rivers two miles
broad such as at liverpool appear narrow it is said to prognosticate
rain and when wide fair weather this want of transparence of the air
in dry weather may be owing to new combinations or decompositions of
the vapours dissolved in it but wants further investigation essais sur

card on the foam l 61 the phenomena of the tides have been well
investigated and satisfactorily explained by sir isaac newton and dr
halley from the reciprocal gravitations of the earth moon and sun as
the earth and moon move round a centre of motion near the earths
surface at the same time that they are proceeding in their annual orbit
round the sun it follows that the water on the side of the earth
nearest this centre of motion between the earth and moon will be more
attracted by the moon and the waters on the opposite side of the earth
will be less attracted by the moon than the central parts of the earth
add to this that the centrifugal force of the water on the side of the
earth furthest from the centre of the motion round which the earth and
moon move which as was said before is near the surface of the earth
is greater than that on the opposite side of the earth from both these
causes it is easy to comprehend that the water will rise on two sides of
the earth viz on that nearest to the moon and its opposite side and
that it will be flattened in consequence at the quadratures and thus
produce two tides in every lunar day which consists of about twenty
four hours and fortyeight minutes
these tides will be also affected by the solar attraction when it
coincides with the lunar one or opposes it as at new and full moon
and will also be much influenced by the opposing shores in every part of
the earth
now as the moon in moving round the centre of gravity between itself and
the earth describes a much larger orbit than the earth describes round
the same centre it follows that the centrifugal motion on the side of
the moon opposite to the earth must be much greater than the centrifugal
motion of the side of the earth opposite to the moon round the same
centre and secondly as the attraction of the earth exerted on the
moons surface next to the earth is much greater than the attraction of
the moon exerted on the earths surface the tides on the lunar sea if
such there be should be much greater than those of our ocean add to
this that as the same face of the moon always is turned to the earth
the lunar tides must be permanent and if the solid parts of the moon be
spherical must always cover the phasis next to us but as there are
evidently hills and vales and volcanos on this side of the moon the
consequence is that the moon has no ocean or that it is frozen

the gaudy conch l 66 the spiral form of many shells seem to have
afforded a more frugal manner of covering the long tail of the fish with
calcareous armour since a single thin partition between the adjoining
circles of the fish was sufficient to defend both surfaces and thus
much cretaceous matter is saved and it is probable that from this
spiral form they are better enabled to feel the vibrations of the
element in which they exist see note on canto iv l 162 this
cretaceous matter is formed by a mucous secretion from the skin of the
fish as is seen in crabfish and others which annually cast their
shells and is at first a soft mucous covering like that of a hens
egg when it is laid a day or two too soon and which gradually
hardens this may also be seen in common shell snails if a part of
their shell be broken it becomes repaired in a similar manner with
mucus which by degrees hardens into shell
it is probable the calculi or stones found in other animals may have a
similar origin as they are formed on mucous membranes as those of the
kidney and bladder chalkstones in the gout and gallstones and are
probably owing to the inflammation of the membrane where they are
produced and vary according to the degree of inflammation of the
membrane which forms them and the kind of mucous which it naturally
produces thus the shelly matter of different shellfish differs from
the courser kinds which form the shells of crabs to the finer kinds
which produces the motherpearl
the beautiful colours of some shells originate from the thinness of the
laminae of which they consist rather than to any colouring matter as
is seen in motherpearl which reflects different colours according to
the obliquity of the light which falls on it the beautiful prismatic
colours seen on the labrodore stone are owing to a similar cause viz
the thinness of the laminae of which it consists and has probably been
formed from motherpearl shells
it is curious that some of the most common fossil shells are not now
known in their recent state as the cornua ammonis and on the contrary

and drop a pearl l 84 many are the opinions both of antient and
modern concerning the production of pearls mr reaumur thinks they are
formed like the hard concretions in many land animals as stones of the
bladder gallstones and bezoar and hence concludes them to be a
disease of the fish but there seems to be a stricter analogy between
these and the calcareous productions found in crabfish called crabs
eyes which are formed near the stomach of the animal and constitute a
reservoir of calcareous matter against the renovation of the shell at
which time they are redissolved and deposited for that purpose as the
internal part of the shell of the pearl oyster or muscle consists of
motherpearl which is a similar material to the pearl and as the animal
has annually occasion to enlarge his shell there is reason to suspect the
loose pearls are similar reservoirs of the pearly matter for that
purpose

to be ascribed many large promontories of ice being occasionally thrown

removed many hundred yards from their situations at the foot of

with a small house near bilders bridge in shropshire about twenty
years ago from the foot of a mountain towards the river i well
remember it bore all the marks of having been thus lifted up pushed
away and as it were crumpled into ridges by a column of water
contained in the mountain
from water being thus confined in high columns between the strata of
mountainous countries it has often happened that when wells or

near derby at the head of which that spring of water once probably
existed and by its current formed the valley but which in after times

supply many streets in derby with springwater which are now only

land in respect to sea the tropic becomes more heated when the sun is
vertical over it than the line the periodical winds called monsoons
are produced and these are attended by rainy seasons for as the air at
the tropic is now more heated than at the line it ascends by decrease of
its specific gravity and floods of air rush in both from the south west
and north east and these being one warmer than the other the rain is
precipitated by their mixture as observed by dr hutton see additional
notes no xxv all late travellers have ascribed the rise of the nile
to the monsoons which deluge nubia and abyssinia with rain the whirling
of the ascending air was even seen by mr bruce in abyssinia he says
every morning a small cloud began to whirl round and presently after
the whole heavens became covered with clouds by this vortex of
ascending air the ne winds and the sw winds which flow in to supply
the place of the ascending column became mixed more rapidly and
deposited their rain in greater abundance
mr volney observes that the time of the rising of the nile commences
about the 19th of june and that abyssinia and the adjacent parts of
africa are deluged with rain in may june and july and produce a mass
of water which is three months in draining off the abbe le pluche

egypts showerless lands l 138 there seem to be two situations
which may be conceived to be exempted from rain falling upon them one
where the constant tradewinds meet beneath the line for here two
regions of warm air are mixed together and thence do not seem to have
any cause to precipitate their vapour and the other is where the winds
are brought from colder climates and become warmer by their contact with
the earth of a warmer one thus lower egypt is a flat country warmed by
the sun more than the higher lands of one side of it and than the
mediterranean on the other and hence the winds which blow over it
acquire greater warmth which ever way they come than they possessed
before and in consequence have a tendency to acquire and not to part
with their vapour like the northeast winds of this country there is
said to be a narrow spot upon the coast of peru where rain seldom
occurs at the same time according to ulloa on the mountainous regions
of the andes beyond there is almost perpetual rain for the wind blows
uniformly upon this hot part of the coast of peru but no cause of
devaporation occurs till it begins to ascend the mountainous andes and
then its own expansion produces cold sufficient to condense its vapour

it rose out of the earth could not be ascertained as water looses all
its heat above 212 as soon as it is at liberty to expand by the
exhalation of a part but the flinty bason which is deposited from it
shews that water with great degrees of heat will dissolve siliceous
matter van troils letters on iceland since the above account in the

arise from the decomposition of pyrites near the surface of the earth
but that they are produced by steam rising up the fissures of the
mountains from great depths owing to water falling on subterraneous
fires and that this steam is condensed between the strata of the

degrees of heat is called a warm bath and is so compared with common
springwater which possesses but 48 degrees of heat but is nevertheless
a cold bath compared to the heat of the body which is 98 on going into
this bath there is therefore always a chill perceived at the first
immersion but after having been in it a minute the chill ceases and a
sensation of warmth succeeds though the body continues to be immersed in
the water the cause of this curious phenomenon is to be looked for in
the laws of animal sensation and not from any properties of heat when a
person goes from clear daylight into an obscure room for a while it
appears gloomy which gloom however in a little time ceases and the
deficiency of light becomes no longer perceived this is not solely
owing to the enlargement of the iris of the eye since that is performed
in an instant but to this law of sensation that when a less stimulus
is applied within certain bounds the sensibility increases thus at
going into a bath as much colder than the body as that of buxton the
diminution of heat on the skin is at first perceived but in about a
minute the sensibility to heat increases and the nerves of the skin are
equally excited by the lessened stimulus the sensation of warmth at
emerging from a coldbath and the pain called the hotach after the
hands have been immersed in snow depend on the same principle viz the
increased sensibility of the skin after having been previously exposed
to a stimulus less than usual

and to pure air l 204 until very lately water was esteemed a
simple element nor are all the most celebrated chemists of europe yet
converts to the new opinion of its decomposition mr lavoisier and
others of the french school have most ingeniously endeavoured to shew
that water consists of pure air called by them oxygene and of
inflammable air called hydrogene with as much of the matter of heat
or calorique as is necessary to preserve them in the form of gas gas
is distinguished from steam by its preserving its elasticity under the
pressure of the atmosphere and in the greatest degrees of cold yet
known the history of the progress of this great discovery is detailed
in the memoires of the royal academy for 1781 and the experimental
proofs of it are delivered in lavoisiers elements of chemistry the
results of which are that water consists of eightyfive parts by weight
of oxygene and fifteen parts by weight of hydrogene with a sufficient
quantity of calorique not only numerous chemical phenomena but many
atmospherical and vegetable facts receive clear and beautiful
elucidation from this important analysis in the atmosphere inflammable
air is probably perpetually uniting with vital air and producing
moisture which descends in dews and showers while the growth of
vegetables by the assistance of light is perpetually again decomposing
the water they imbibe from the earth and while they retain the
inflammable air for the formation of oils wax honey resin c they
give up the vital air to replenish the atmosphere

very antient mythology which supposes jupiter to represent the superior
part of the atmosphere or ether and juno the inferior air and that the
conjunction of these two produces vernal showers as alluded to in
virgils georgics is so analogous to the present important discovery of
the production of water from pure air or oxygene and inflammable air
or hydrogene which from its greater levity probably resides over the
former that one should be tempted to believe that the very antient
chemists of egypt had discovered the composition of water and thus
represented it in their hieroglyphic figures before the invention of
letters

prolific showers on the bosom of juno whence the spring succeeds and

     the viewless columns of incumbent air
     pressd by the incumbent air the floods below
370  through opening valves in foaming torrents flow
     foot after foot with lessend impulse move
     and rising seek the vacancy above
     so when the mother bending oer his charms
     clasps her fair nurseling in delighted arms

     her soft embraces and endearing tones

380  spreads his inquiring hands and smiles and sips
lift her ponderous waves l 366 the invention of the pump is of
very antient date being ascribed to one ctesebes an athenian whence it
was called by the latins machina ctesebiana but it was long before it
was known that the ascent of the piston lifted the superincumbent column
of the atmosphere and that then the pressure of the surrounding air on
the surface of the well below forced the water up into the vacuum and
that on that account in the common lifting pump the water would rise
only about thirtyfive feet as the weight of such a column of water was
in general an equipoise to the surrounding atmosphere the foamy
appearance of water when the pressure of the air over it is diminished
is owing to the expansion and escape of the air previously dissolved by
it or existing in its pores when a child first sucks it only presses
or champs the teat as observed by the great harvey but afterwards it
learns to make an incipient vacuum in its mouth and acts by removing
the pressure of the atmosphere from the nipple like a pump

machines for raising water to extinguish fire was first introduced by
mr newsham of london and is now applied to similar engines for washing
walltrees in gardens and to all kinds of forcing pumps and might be
applied with advantage to lifting pumps where the water is brought from
a great distance horizontally another kind of machine was invented by
one greyl in which a vessel of water was every way dispersed by the
explosion of gunpowder lodging in the centre of it and lighted by an
adapted match from this idea mr godfrey proposed a waterbomb of
similar construction dr hales to prevent the spreading of fire

earth mr hartley proposed to prevent houses from taking fire by
covering the cieling with thin ironplates and lord mahon by a bed of
coarse mortar or plaister between the cieling and floor above it may
not this age of chemical science discover some method of injecting or
soaking timber with limewater and afterwards with vitriolic acid and
thus fill its pores with alabaster or of penetrating it with siliceous

from each chill leaf l 459 the upper side of the leaf is the organ
of vegetable respiration as explained in the additional notes no
xxxvii hence the leaf is liable to injury from much moisture on this
surface and is destroyed by being smeared with oil in these respects
resembling the lungs of animals or the spiracula of insects to prevent
these injuries some leaves repel the dewdrops from their upper surfaces
as those of cabbages other vegetables close the upper surfaces of their
leaves together in the night or in wet weather as the sensitive plant
others only hang their leaves downwards so as to shoot the wet from
them as kidneybeans and many trees see note on l 18 of this canto
golden bell l 460 there are muscles placed about the footstalks of
the leaves or leaflets of many plants for the purpose of closing their
upper surfaces together or of bending them down so as to shoot off the
showers or dewdrops as mentioned in the preceeding note the claws of
the petals or of the divisions of the calyx of many flowers are
furnished in a similar manner with muscles which are exerted to open or
close the corol and calyx of the flower as in tragopogon anemone this
action of opening and closing the leaves or flowers does not appear to
be produced simply by irritation on the muscles themselves but by the
connection of those muscles with a sensitive sensorium or brain
existing in each individual bud or flower 1st because many flowers
close from the defect of stimulus not by the excess of it as by
darkness which is the absence of the stimulus of light or by cold
which is the absence of the stimulus of heat now the defect of heat or
the absence of food or of drink affects our sensations which had
been previously accustomed to a greater quantity of them but a muscle
cannot be said to be stimulated into action by a defect of stimulus 2
because the muscles around the footstalks of the subdivisions of the
leaves of the sensitive plant are exerted when any injury is offered to
the other extremity of the leaf and some of the stamens of the flowers
of the class syngenesia contract themselves when others are irritated
see note on chondrilla vol ii of this work
from this circumstance the contraction of the muscles of vegetables
seems to depend on a disagreeable sensation in some distant part and
not on the irritation of the muscles themselves thus when a particle
of dust stimulates the ball of the eye the eyelids are instantly
closed and when too much light pains the retina the muscles of the
iris contract its aperture and this not by any connection or consent of
the nerves of those parts but as an effort to prevent or to remove a
disagreeable sensation which evinces that vegetables are endued with
sensation or that each bud has a common sensorium and is furnished
with a brain or a central place where its nerves were connected

spread the bright treasure l 540 the practice of flooding lands
long in use in china has been but lately introduced into this country
besides the supplying water to the herbage in dryer seasons it seems to
defend it from frost in the early part of the year and thus doubly
advances the vegetation the waters which rise from springs passing
through marl or limestone are replete with calcareous earth and when
thrown over morasses they deposit this earth and incrust or consolidate
the morass this kind of earth is deposited in great quantity from the
springs at matlock bath and supplies the soft porous limestone of which
the houses and walls are there constructed and has formed the whole
bank for near a mile on that side of the derwent on which they stand
the water of many springs contains much azotic gas or phlogistic air
besides carbonic gas or fixed air as that of buxton and bath this
being set at liberty may more readily contribute to the production of
nitre by means of the putrescent matters which it is exposed to by being
spread upon the surface of the land in the same manner as frequently
turning over heaps of manure facilitates the nitrous process by
imprisoning atmospheric air in the interstices of the putrescent
materials water arising by landfloods brings along with it much of the
most soluble parts of the manure from the higher lands to the lower
ones riverwater in its clear state and those springs which are called
soft are less beneficial for the purpose of watering lands as they
contain less earthy or saline matter and water from dissolving snow
from its slow solution brings but little earth along with it as may be
seen by the comparative clearness of the water of snowfloods
       thus where the veins their confluent branches bend
     and milky eddies with the purple blend
     the chyles white trunk diverging from its source

in the vegetable economy is seen from the very complicated apparatus
which nature has formed in some flowers for the preservation of their
honey from insects as in the aconites or monkshoods in other plants
instead of a great apparatus for its protection a greater secretion of
it is produced that thence a part may be spared to the depredation of
insects the cacalia suaveolens produces so much honey that on some days
it may be smelt at a great distance from the plant i remember once
counting on one of these plants besides bees of various kinds without
number above two hundred painted butterflies which gave it the
beautiful appearance of being covered with additional flowers

 45  with lifes first spark inspires the organic frame
     and as it wastes renews the subtile flame
the enamourd oxygene l 34 the common air of the atmosphere
appears by the analysis of dr priestley and other philosophers to
consist of about three parts of an elastic fluid unfit for respiration
or combustion called azote by the french school and about one fourth
of pure vital air fit for the support of animal life and of combustion
called oxygene the principal source of the azote is probably from the
decomposition of all vegetable and animal matters by putrefaction and
combustion the principal source of vital air or oxygene is perhaps from
the decomposition of water in the organs of vegetables by means of the
suns light the difficulty of injecting vegetable vessels seems to shew
that their perspirative pores are much less than those of animals and
that the water which constitutes their perspiration is so divided at the
time of its exclusion that by means of the suns light it becomes
decomposed the inflammable air or hydrogene which is one of its
constituent parts being retained to form the oil resin wax honey
c of the vegetable economy and the other part which united with
light or heat becomes vital air or oxygene gas rises into the
atmosphere and replenishes it with the food of life
dr priestley has evinced by very ingenious experiments that the blood
gives out phlogiston and receives vital air or oxygenegas by the
lungs and dr crawford has shewn that the blood acquires heat from this
vital air in respiration there is however still a something more subtil
than heat which must be obtained in respiration from the vital air a
something which life can not exist a few minutes without which seems
necessary to the vegetable as well as to the animal world and which as
no organized vessels can confine it requires perpetually to be renewed

air and whirlwinds ascend to greater heights there seems but one known
manner in which this channel of air could be effected and that is by
electricity
the volcanic origin of these winds is mentioned in the note on chunda in
vol ii of this work it must here be added that professor vairo at
naples found that during the eruption of vesuvius perpendicular iron
bars were electric and others have observed suffocating damps to attend
these eruptions ferbers travels in italy p 133 and lastly that a
current of air attends the passage of electric matter as is seen in
presenting an electrized point to the flame of a candle in mr bruces
account of this simoom it was in its course over a quite dry desert of
sand and which was in consequence unable to conduct an electric stream
into the earth beneath it to some moist rocks at but a few miles
distance and thence would appear to be a stream of electricity from a
volcano attended with noxious air and as the bodies of mr bruce and
his attendants were insulated on the sand they would not be sensible of
their increased electricity as it passed over them to which it may be
added that a sulphurous or suffocating sensation is said to accompany
flames of lightning and even strong sparks of artificial electricity
in the above account of the simoom a great redness in the air is said
to be a certain sign of its approach which may be occasioned by the
eruption of flame from a distant volcano in these extensive and
impenetrable deserts of sand see note on l 294 of this canto

     primeval silence reignd with ancient night
torricell and boyle l 128 the pressure of the atmosphere was
discovered by torricelli a disciple of galileo who had previously
found that the air had weight dr hook and m du hamel ascribe the
invention of the airpump to mr boyle who however confesses he had
some hints concerning its construction from de guerick the vacancy at
the summit of the barometer is termed the torricellian vacuum and the
exhausted receiver of an air pump the boylean vacuum in honour of these
two philosophers
the mist and descending dew which appear at first exhausting the
receiver of an airpump are explained in the phil trans vol lxxviii
from the cold produced by the expansion of air for a thermometer placed
in the receiver sinks some degrees and in a very little time as soon
as a sufficient quantity of heat can be acquired from the surrounding
bodies the dew becomes again taken up see additional notes no vii
mr saussure observed on placing his hygrometer in a receiver of an air
pump that though on beginning to exhaust it the air became misty and
parted with its moisture yet the hair of his hygrometer contracted and
the instrument pointed to greater dryness this unexpected occurrence is
explained by m monge annales de chymie tom v to depend on the want
of the usual pressure of the atmosphere to force the aqueous particles
into the pores of the hair and m saussure supposes that his vesicular
vapour requires more time to be redissolved than is necessary to dry
the hair of his thermometer essais sur lhygrom p 226 but i suspect
there is a less hypothetical way of understanding it when a colder body
is brought into warm and moist air as a bottle of springwater for
instance a steam is quickly collected on its surface the contrary
occurs when a warmer body is brought into cold and damp air it
continues free from dew so long as it continues warm for it warms the
atmosphere around it and renders it capable of receiving instead of
parting with moisture the moment the air becomes rarefied in the
receiver of the airpump it becomes colder as appears by the
thermometer and deposits its vapour but the hair of mr saussures
hygrometer is now warmer than the air in which it is immersed and in
consequence becomes dryer than before by warming the air which
immediately surrounds it a part of its moisture evaporating along with
its heat

better than rarer ones if two stones be struck together under the
water they may be heard a mile or two by any one whose head is immersed
at that distance according to an experiment of dr franklin if the ear
be applied to one end of a long beam of timber the stroke of a pin at
the other end becomes sensible if a poker be suspended in the middle of
a garter each end of which is pressed against the ear the least
percussions on the poker give great sounds and i am informed by laying
the ear on the ground the tread of a horse may be discerned at a great
distance in the night the organs of hearing belonging to fish are for
this reason much less complicated than of quadrupeds as the fluid they
are immersed in so much better conveys its vibrations and it is
probable that some shellfish which have twisted shells like the cochlea
and semicircular canals of the ears of men and quadrupeds may have no
appropriated organ for perceiving the vibrations of the element they
live in but may by their spiral form be in a manner all ear

where oft your priestley l 166 the fame of dr priestley is known
in every part of the earth where science has penetrated his various
discoveries respecting the analysis of the atmosphere and the
production of variety of new airs or gasses can only be clearly
understood by reading his experiments on airs 3 vols octavo johnson
london the following are amongst his many discoveries 1 the
discovery of nitrous and dephlogisticated airs 2 the exhibition of the
acids and alkalies in the form of air 3 ascertaining the purity of
respirable air by nitrous air 4 the restoration of vitiated air by
vegetation 5 the influence of light to enable vegetables to yield pure
air 6 the conversion by means of light of animal and vegetable
substances that would otherwise become putrid and offensive into
nourishment of vegetables 7 the use of respiration by the blood
parting with phlogiston and imbibing dephlogisticated air
the experiments here alluded to are 1 concerning the production of
nitrous gas from dissolving iron and many other metals in nitrous acid
which though first discovered by dr hales static ess vol i p 224
was fully investigated and applied to the important purpose of
distinguishing the purity of atmospheric air by dr priestley when
about two measures of common air and one of nitrous gas are mixed
together a red effervescence takes place and the two airs occupy about
one fourth less space than was previously occupied by the common air
alone
2 concerning the green substance which grows at the bottom of
reservoirs of water which dr priestley discovered to yield much pure
air when the sun shone on it his method of collecting this air is by
placing over the green substance which he believes to be a vegetable of
the genus conferva an inverted bellglass previously filled with water
which subsides as the air arises it has since been found that all
vegetables give up pure air from their leaves when the sun shines upon
them but not in the night which may be owing to the sleep of the
plant
3 the third refers to the great quantity of pure air contained in the
calces of metals the calces were long known to weigh much more than the
metallic bodies before calcination insomuch that 100 pounds of lead
will produce 112 pounds of minium the ore of manganese which is always
found near the surface of the earth is replete with pure air which is
now used for the purpose of bleaching other metals when exposed to the
atmosphere attract the pure air from it and become calces by its
combination as zinc lead iron and increase in weight in proportion
to the air which they imbibe

seized by pluto as she was gathering flowers is explained by lord bacon
to signify the combination or marriage of etherial spirit with earthly
materials bacons works vol v p 470 edit 4to lond 1778 this
allusion is still more curiously exact from the late discovery of pure
air being given up from vegetables and that then in its unmixed state
it more readily combines with metallic or inflammable bodies from these
fables which were probably taken from antient hieroglyphics there is
frequently reason to believe that the egyptians possessed much chemical
knowledge which for want of alphabetical writing perished with their
philosophers

led by the sage l 195 dr priestleys discovery of the production
of pure air from such variety of substances will probably soon be
applied to the improvement of the diving bell as the substances which
contain vital air in immense quantities are of little value as manganese
and minium see additional notes no xxxiii in every hundred weight of
minium there is combined about twelve pounds of pure air now as sixty
pounds of water are about a cubic foot and as air is eight hundred
times lighter than water five hundred weight of minium will produce
eight hundred cubic feet of air or about six thousand gallons now as
this is at least thrice as pure as atmospheric air a gallon of it may
be supposed to serve for three minutes respiration for one man at
present the air can not be set at liberty from minium by vitriolic acid
without the application of some heat this is however very likely soon
to be discovered and will then enable adventurers to journey beneath
the ocean in large inverted ships or diving balloons
mr boyle relates that cornelius drebelle contrived not only a vessel
to be rowed under water but also a liquor to be caried in that vessel
which would supply the want of fresh air the vessel was made by order
of james i and carried twelve rowers besides passengers it was tried
in the river thames and one of the persons who was in that submarine
voyage told the particulars of the experiments to a person who related
them to mr boyle annual register for 1774 p 248
day and spalding mourn l 217 mr day perished in a diving bell or
diving boat of his own construction at plymouth in june 1774 in which
he was to have continued for a wager twelve hours one hundred feet deep
in water and probably perished from his not possessing all the
hydrostatic knowledge that was necessary see note on ulva vol ii of
this work see annual register for 1774 p 245
mr spalding was professionally ingenious in the art of constructing and
managing the diving bell and had practised the business many years with
success he went down accompanied by one of his young men twice to view
the wreck of the imperial eastindiaman at the kish bank in ireland on
descending the third time in june 1783 they remained about an hour
under water and had two barrels of air sent down to them but on the
signals from below not being again repeated after a certain time they
were drawn up by their assistants and both found dead in the bell
annual register for 1783 p 206 these two unhappy events may for a
time check the ardor of adventurers in traversing the bottom of the
ocean but it is probable in another half century it may be safer to
travel under the ocean than over it since dr priestleys discovery of
procuring pure air in such great abundance from the calces of metals

great difficulty on the rocks but capt pierce finding it was
impossible to save the lives of the young ladies refused to quit the

these winds seem all to be of volcanic origin as before mentioned with
this difference that the simoom is attended with a stream of electric

be accomplished it would be the most happy discovery that ever has
happened to these northern latitudes since in this country the ne
winds bring frost and the sw ones are attended with warmth and
moisture if the inferior currents of air could be kept perpetually from
the sw supplied by new productions of air at the line or by superior
currents flowing in a contrary direction the vegetation of this country
would be doubled as in the moist vallies of africa which know no

are by him supposed to exceed a million on a leaf as the works of
nature are governed by general laws this exuberant reproduction prevents
the accidental extinction of the species at the same time that they
serve for food for the higher orders of animation
every seed possesses a reservoir of nutriment designed for the growth of
the future plant this consists of starch mucilage or oil within the
coat of the seed or of sugar and subacid pulp in the fruits which
belongs to it

teach the fine seed l 411 the seeds in their natural state fall on
the surface of the earth and having absorbed some moisture the root
shoots itself downwards into the earth and the plume rises in air thus
each endeavouring to seek its proper pabulum directed by a vegetable
irritability similar to that of the lacteal system and to the lungs in
animals
the pith seems to push up or elongate the bud by its elasticity like
the pith in the callow quills of birds this medulla linneus believes to
consist of a bundle of fibres which diverging breaks through the bark
yet gelatinous producing the buds
the lobes are reservoirs of prepared nutriment for the young seed which
is absorbed by its placental vessels and converted into sugar till it
has penetrated with its roots far enough into the earth to extract
sufficient moisture and has acquired leaves to convert it into
nourishment in some plants these lobes rise from the earth and supply
the place of leaves as in kidneybeans cucumbers and hence seem to
serve both as a placenta to the foetus and lungs to the young plant
during the process of germination the starch of the seed is converted
into sugar as is seen in the process of malting barley for the purpose
of brewing and is on this account very similar to the digestion of food
in the stomachs of animals which converts all their aliment into a
chyle which consists of mucilage oil and sugar the placentation of
buds will be spoken of hereafter

the most vigorous shoots with strong wire and even some of the large
roots and mr warner cuts what he calls a wild worm about the body of
the tree or scores the bark quite to the wood like a screw with a sharp
knife bradley on gardening vol ii p 155 mr fitzgerald produced
flowers and fruit on wall trees by cutting off a part of the bark phil
trans ann 1761 m buffon produced the same effect by a straight
bandage put round a branch act paris ann 1738 and concludes that an
ingrafted branch bears better from its vessels being compressed by the
callous
a compleat cylinder of the bark about an inch in height was cut off from
the branch of a pear tree against a wall in mr howards garden at
lichfield about five years ago the circumcised part is now not above
half the diameter of the branch above and below it yet this branch has
been full of fruit every year since when the other branches of the tree
bore only sparingly i lately observed that the leaves of this wounded
branch were smaller and paler and the fruit less in size and ripened
sooner than on the other parts of the tree another branch has the bark
taken off not quite all round with much the same effect
the theory of this curious vegetable fact has been esteemed difficult
but receives great light from the foregoing account of the individuality
of buds a flowerbud dies when it has perfected its seed like an
annual plant and hence requires no place on the bark for new roots to
pass downwards but on the contrary leafbuds as they advance into
shoots form new buds in the axilla of every leaf which new buds
require new roots to pass down the bark and thus thicken as well as
elongate the branch now if a wire or string be tied round the bark
many of these new roots cannot descend and thence more of the buds will
be converted into flowerbuds
it is customary to debark oaktrees in the spring which are intended to
be felled in the ensuing autumn because the bark comes off easier at
this season and the sapwood or alburnum is believed to become harder
and more durable if the tree remains till the end of summer the trees
thus stripped of their bark put forth shoots as usual with acorns on the
6th 7th and 8th joint like vines but in the branches i examined the
joints of the debarked trees were much shorter than those of other oak
trees the acorns were more numerous and no new buds were produced
above the joints which bore acorns from hence it appears that the
branches of debarked oaktrees produce fewer leafbuds and more flower
buds which last circumstance i suppose must depend on their being
sooner or later debarked in the vernal months and secondly that the
new buds of debarked oaktrees continue to obtain moisture from the
alburnum after the season of the ascent of sap in other vegetables
ceases which in this unnatural state of the debarked tree may act as
capillary tubes like the alburnum of the small debarked cylinder of a
peartree abovementioned or may continue to act as placental vessels
as happens to the animal embryon in cases of superfetation when the
fetus continues a month or two in the womb beyond its usual time of
which some instances have been recorded the placenta continues to
supply perhaps the double office both of nutrition and of respiration
and bend to earth l 466 mr hitt in his treatise on fruit trees
observes that if a vigorous branch of a wall tree be bent to the
horizon or beneath it it looses its vigour and becomes a bearing
branch the theory of this i suppose to depend on the difficulty with
which the leafshoots can protrude the roots necessary for their new
progeny of buds upwards along the bended branch to the earth contrary to
their natural habits or powers whence more flowershoots are produced
which do not require new roots to pass along the bark of the bended
branch but which let their offspring the seeds fall upon the earth
and seek roots for themselves
with new prolific power l 467 about midsummer the new buds are
formed but it is believed by some of the linnean school that these
buds may in their early state be either converted into flowerbuds or
leafbuds according to the vigour of the vegetating branch thus if the
upper part of a branch be cut away the buds near the extremity of the
remaining stem having a greater proportional supply of nutriment or
possessing a greater facility of shooting their roots or absorbent
vessels down the bark will become leafbuds which might otherwise
have been flowerbuds and the contrary as explained in note on l 463
of this canto
closed in the style l 469 i conceive the medulla of a plant to
consist of a bundle of nervous fibres and that the propelling vital
power separates their uppermost extremities these diverging penetrate
the bark which is now gelatinous and become multiplied in the new gem
or leafbud the ascending vessels of the bark being thus divided by the
nervous fibres which perforate it and the ascent of its fluids being
thus impeded the bark is extended into a leaf but the flower is
produced when the protrusion of the medulla is greater than the
retention of the including cortical part whence the substance of the
bark is expanded in the calyx that of the rind or interior bark in
the corol that of the wood in the stamens that of the medulla in the
pistil vegetation thus terminates in the production of new life the
ultimate medullary and cortical fibres being collected in the seeds

shew themselves about three feet above the inoculation and in a short
time afterwards yellow spots appeared on a shoot which came out of the
ground from another part of the plant bradley vol ii p 129 these
facts are the more curious since from experiments of ingrafting red
currants on black ib vol ii the fruit does not acquire any change
of flavour and by many other experiments neither colour nor any other
change is produced in the fruit ingrafted on other stocks
there is an apple described in bradleys work which is said to have one
side of it a sweet fruit which boils soft and the other side a sour
fruit which boils hard which mr bradley so long ago as the year 1721
ingeniously ascribes to the farina of one of these apples impregnating
the other which would seem the more probable if we consider that each
division of an apple is a separate womb and may therefore have a
separate impregnation like puppies of different kinds in one litter the
same is said to have occurred in oranges and lemons and grapes of
different colours

the upper sides of their leaves together in their sleep and thus
precluding that side of them from both light and air and from many
flowers closing up the polished or interior side of their petals which
we have also endeavoured to shew to be a respiratory organ
the irritability of plants is abundantly evinced by the absorption and
pulmonary circulation of their juices their sensibility is shewn by the
approaches of the males to the females and of the females to the males
in numerous instances and as the essential circumstance of sleep
consists in the temporary abolition of voluntary power alone the sleep
of plants evinces that they possess voluntary power which also
indisputably appears in many of them by closing their petals or their

temples and represented gods as well as metals and planets whence
silver is called diana or the moon in the books of alchemy
the process for making dianas silver tree is thus described by lemeri
dissolve one ounce of pure silver in acid of nitre very pure and
moderately strong mix this solution with about twenty ounces of
distilled water add to this two ounces of mercury and let it remain at
rest in about four days there will form upon the mercury a tree of
silver with branches imitating vegetation
1 as the mercury has a greater affinity than silver with the nitrous
acid the silver becomes precipitated and being deprived of the
nitrous oxygene by the mercury sinks down in its metallic form and
lustre 2 the attraction between silver and mercury which causes them
readily to amalgamate together occasions the precipitated silver to
adhere to the surface of the mercury in preference to any other part of
the vessel 3 the attraction of the particles of the precipitated
silver to each other causes the beginning branches to thicken and
elongate into trees and shrubs rooted on the mercury for other

there seem to be three concentric strata of our incumbent atmosphere in
which or between them are produced four kinds of meteors lightning
shooting stars fireballs and northern lights first the lower region
of air or that which is dense enough to resist by the adhesion of its
particles the descent of condensed vapour or clouds which may extend
from one to three or four miles high in this region the common
lightning is produced from the accumulation or defect of electric matter
in those floating fields of vapour either in respect to each other or
in respect to the earth beneath them or the dissolved vapour above
them which is constantly varying both with the change of the form of
the clouds which thus evolve a greater or less surface and also with
their everchanging degree of condensation as the lightning is thus
produced in dense air it proceeds but a short course on account of the
greater resistance which it encounters is attended with a loud
explosion and appears with a red light
2 the second region of the atmosphere i suppose to be that which has
too little tenacity to support condensed vapour or clouds but which yet
contains invisible vapour or water in aerial solution this aerial
solution of water differs from that dissolved in the matter of heat as
it is supported by its adhesion to the particles of air and is not
precipitated by cold in this stratum it seems probable that the meteors
called shooting stars are produced and that they consist of electric
sparks or lightning passing from one region to another of these
invisible fields of aeroaqueous solution the height of these shooting
stars has not yet been ascertained by sufficient observation dr
blagden thinks their situation is lower down in the atmosphere than that
of fireballs which he conjectures from their swift apparent motion and
ascribes their smallness to the more minute division of the electric
matter of which they are supposed to consist owing to the greater
resistance of the denser medium through which they pass than that in
which the fireballs exist mr brydone observed that the shooting stars
appeared to him to be as high in the atmosphere when he was near the
summit of mount etna as they do when observed from the plain phil
tran vol lxiii
as the stratum of air in which shooting stars are supposed to exist is
much rarer than that in which lightning resides and yet much denser
than that in which fireballs are produced they will be attracted at a
greater distance than the former and at a less than the latter from
this rarity of the air so small a sound will be produced by their
explosion as not to reach the lower parts of the atmosphere their
quantity of light from their greater distance being small is never seen
through dense air at all and thence does not appear red like lightning
or fire balls there are no apparent clouds to emit or to attract them
because the constituent parts of these aeroaqueous regions may possess
an abundance or deficiency of electric matter and yet be in perfect
reciprocal solution and lastly their apparent train of light is
probably owing only to a continuance of their impression on the eye as
when a firestick is whirled in the dark it gives the appearance of a
compleat circle of fire for these white trains of shooting stars
quickly vanish and do not seem to set any thing on fire in their
passage as seems to happen in the transit of fireballs
3 the second region or stratum of air terminates i suppose where the
twilight ceases to be refracted that is where the air is 3000 times
rarer than at the surface of the earth and where it seems probable that
the common air ends and is surrounded by an atmosphere of inflammable
gas tenfold rarer than itself in this region i believe fireballs
sometimes to pass and at other times the northern lights to exist one
of these fireballs or draco volans was observed by dr pringle and
many others on nov 26 1758 which was afterwards estimated to have
been a mile and a half in circumference to have been about one hundred
miles high and to have moved towards the north with a velocity of near
thirty miles in a second of time this meteor had a real tail many miles
long which threw off sparks in its course and the whole exploded with
a sound like distant thunder philos trans vol li
dr blagden has related the history of another large meteor or fire
ball which was seen the 18th of august 1783 with many ingenious
observations and conjectures this was estimated to be between 60 and 70
miles high and to travel 1000 miles at the rate of about twenty miles
in a second this fireball had likewise a real train of light left
behind it in its passage which varied in colour and in some part of
its course gave off sparks or explosions where it had been brightest
and a dusky red streak remained visible perhaps a minute philos trans
vol lxxiv
these fireballs differ from lightning and from shooting stars in many
remarkable circumstances as their very great bulk being a mile and a
half in diameter their travelling 1000 miles nearly horizontally their
throwing off sparks in their passage and changing colours from bright
blue to dusky red and leaving a train of fire behind them continuing
about a minute they differ from the northern lights in not being
diffused but passing from one point of the heavens to another in a
defined line and this in a region above the crepuscular atmosphere
where the air is 3000 tines rarer than at the surface of the earth
there has not yet been even a conjecture which can account for these
appearancesone i shall therefore hazard which if it does not
inform may amuse the reader
in the note on l 123 it was shewn that there is probably a supernatant
stratum of inflammable gas or hydrogene over the common atmosphere and
whose density at the surface where they meet must be at least ten times
less than that upon which it swims like chemical ether floating upon
water and perhaps without any real contact 1 in this region where
the aerial atmosphere terminates and the inflammable one begins the
quantity of tenacity or resistance must be almost inconceivable in
which a ball of electricity might pass 1000 miles with greater ease than
through a thousandth part of an inch of glass 2 such a ball of
electricity passing between inflammable and common air would set fire to
them in a line as it patted along which would differ in colour
according to the greater proportionate commixture of the two airs and
from the same cause there might occur greater degrees of inflammation
or branches of fire in some parts of its course
as these fireballs travel in a defined line it is pretty evident from
the known laws of electricity that they must be attracted and as they
are a mile or more in diameter they must be emitted from a large
surface of electric matter because large nobs give larger sparks less
diffused and more brightly luminous than less ones or points and
resist more forceably the emission of the electric matter what is there
in nature can attract them at so great a distance as 1000 miles and so
forceably as to detach an electric spark of a mile diameter can
volcanos at the time of their eruptions have this effect as they are
generally attended with lightning future observations must discover
these secret operations of nature as a stream of common air is carried
along with the passage of electric aura from one body to another it is
easy to conceive that the common air and the inflammable air between
which the fireball is supposed to pass will be partially intermixed by
being thus agitated and so far as it becomes intermixed it will take
fire and produce the linear flame and branching sparks above described
in this circumstance of their being attracted and thence passing in a
defined line the fireballs seem to differ from the coruscations of the
aurora borealis or northern lights which probably take place in the
same region of the atmosphere where the common air exists in extreme
tenuity and is covered by a still rarer sphere of inflammable gas ten
times lighter than itself
as the electric streams which constitute these northern lights seem to
be repelled or radiated from an accumulation of that fluid in the north
and not attracted like the fireballs this accounts for the diffusion of
their light as well as the silence of their passage while their
variety of colours and the permanency of them and even the breadth of
them in different places may depend on their setting on fire the
mixture of inflammable and common air through which they pass as seems
to happen in the transit of the fireballs
it was observed by dr priestley that the electric shock taken through
inflammable air was red in common air it is blueish to these
circumstances perhaps some of the colours of the northern lights may
bear analogy though the density of the medium through which light is
seen must principally vary its colour as is well explained by mr
morgan phil trans vol lxxv hence lightning is red when seen through
a dark cloud or near the horizon because the more refrangible rays
cannot permeate so dense a medium but the shooting stars consist of
white light as they are generally seen on clear nights and nearly
vertical in other situations their light is probably too faint to come
to us but as in some remarkable appearances of the northern lights as
in march 1716 all the prismatic colours were seen quickly to succeed
each other these appear to have been owing to real combustion as the
density of the interposed medium could not be supposed to change so
frequently and therefore these colours must have been owing to
different degrees of heat according to mr morgans theory of
combustion in smiths optics p 69 the prismatic colours and optical
deceptions of the northern lights are described by mr cotes
the torricellian vacuum if perfectly free from air is said by mr
morgan and others to be a perfect nonconductor this circumstance
therefore would preclude the electric streams from rising above the
atmosphere but as mr morgan did not try to pass an electric shock
through a vacuum and as air or something containing air surrounding
the transit of electricity may be necessary to the production of light
the conclusion may perhaps still be dubious if however the streams of
the northern lights were supposed to rise above our atmosphere they
would only be visible at each extremity of their course where they
emerge from or are again immerged into the atmosphere but not in their
journey through the vacuum for the absence of electric light in a
vacuum is sufficiently proved by the common experiment of shaking a
barometer in the dark the electricity produced by the friction of the
mercury in the glass at its top is luminous if the barometer has a
little air in it but there is no light if the vacuum be complete
the aurora borealis or northern dawn is very ingeniously accounted for
by dr franklin on principles of electricity he premises the following
electric phenomena 1 that all new fallen snow has much positive
electricity standing on its surface 2 that about twelve degrees of
latitude round the poles are covered with a crust of eternal ice which
is impervious to the electric fluid 3 that the dense part of the
atmosphere rises but a few miles high and that in the rarer parts of it
the electric fluid will pass to almost any distance
hence he supposes there must be a great accumulation of positive
electric matter on the fresh fallen snow in the polar regions which
not being able to pass through the crust of ice into the earth must
rise into the rare air of the upper parts of our atmosphere which will
the least resist its passage and passing towards the equator descend
again into the denser atmosphere and thence into the earth in silent
streams and that many of the appearances attending these lights are
optical deceptions owing to the situation of the eye that beholds them
which makes all ascending parallel lines appear to converge to a point
the idea above explained in note on l 123 of the existence of a
sphere of inflammable gas over the aerial atmosphere would much favour
this theory of dr franklin because in that case the dense aerial
atmosphere would rise a much less height in the polar regions
diminishing almost to nothing at the pole itself and thus give an
easier passage to the ascent of the electric fluid and from the great
difference in the specific gravity of the two airs and the velocity of
the earths rotation there must be a place between the poles and the
equator where the superior atmosphere of inflammable gas would
terminate which would account for these streams of the aurora borealis
not appearing near the equator add to this that it is probable the
electric fluid may be heavier than the magnetic one and will thence by
the rotation of the earths surface ascend over the magnetic one by its
centrifugal force and may thus be induced to rise through the thin
stratum of aerial atmosphere over the poles see note on canto ii l
193 i shall have occasion again to mention this great accumulation of
inflammable air over the poles and to conjecture that these northern
lights may be produced by the union of inflammable with common air
without the assistance of the electric spark to throw them into
combustion
the antiquity of the appearance of northern lights has been doubted as
none were recorded in our annals since the remarkable one on nov 14

following nights which were seen at the same time in ireland russia
and poland extending near 30 degrees of longitude and from about the
50th degree of latitude over almost all the north of europe there is
however reason to believe them of remote antiquity though inaccurately
described thus the following curious passage from the book of
maccabees b ii c v is such a description of them as might
probably be given by an ignorant and alarmed people through all the
city for the space of almost forty days there were seen horsemen
running in the air in cloth of gold and armed with lances like a band
of soldiers and troops of horsemen in array encountering and running
one against another with shaking of shields and multitude of pikes and
drawing of swords and casting of darts and glittering of golden
ornaments and harness

the manner in which the rainbow is produced was in some measure
understood before sir isaac newton had discovered his theory of colours
the first person who expressly shewed the rainbow to be formed by the
reflection of the sunbeams from drops of falling rain was antonio de
dominis this was afterwards more fully and distinctly explained by des
cartes but what caused the diversity of its colours was not then
understood it was reserved for the immortal newton to discover that the
rays of light consisted of seven combined colours of different
refrangibility which could be seperated at pleasure by a wedge of
glass pembertons view of newton
sir isaac newton discovered that the prismatic spectrum was composed of
seven colours in the following proportions violet 80 indigo 40 blue
60 green 60 yellow 48 orange 27 red 45 if all these colours be
painted on a circular card in the proportions above mentioned and the
card be rapidly whirled on its center they produce in the eye the
sensation of white and any one of these colours may be imitated by
painting a card with the two colours which are contiguous to it in the
same proportions as in the spectrum and whirling them in the same
manner my ingenious friend mr galton of birmingham ascertained in
this manner by a set of experiments the following propositions the
truth of which he had preconceived from the above data
1 any colour in the prismatic spectrum may be imitated by a mixture of
the two colours contiguous to it
2 if any three successive colours in the prismatic spectrum are mixed
they compose only the second or middlemost colour
3 if any four succesive colours in the prismatic spectrum be mixed a
tint similar to a mixture of the second and third colours will be
produced but not precisely the same because they are not in the same
proportion
4 if beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum you take of
the second colour a quantity equal to the first second and third and
add to that the fifth colour equal in quantity to the fourth fifth
and sixth and with these combine the seventh colour in the proportion
it exists in the spectrum white will be produced because the first
second and third compose only the second and the fourth fifth and
sixth compose only the fifth therefore if the seventh be added the
same effect is produced as if all the seven were employed
5 beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum if you take a
tint composed of a certain proportion of the second and third equal in
quantity to the first second third and fourth and add to this the
sixth colour equal in quantity to the fifth sixth and seventh white
will be produced
from these curious experiments of mr galton many phenomena in the
chemical changes of colours may probably become better understood
especially if as i suppose the same theory must apply to transmitted
colours as to reflected ones thus it is well known that if the glass
of mangonese which is a tint probably composed of violet and indigo be
mixed in a certain proportion with the glass of lead which is yellow
that the mixture becomes transparent now from mr galtons experiments
it appears that in reflected colours such a mixture would produce
white that is the same as if all the colours were reflected and
therefore in transmitted colours the same circumstances must produce
transparency that is the same as if all the colours were transmitted
for the particles which constitute the glass of mangonese will transmit
red violet indigo and blue and those of the glass of lead will
transmit orange yellow and green hence all the primary colours by a
mixture of these glasses become transmitted that is the glass becomes
transparent
mr galton has further observed that five successive prismatic colours
may be combined in such proportions as to produce but one colour a
circumstance which might be of consequence in the art of painting for
if you begin at any part of the circular spectrum above described and
take the first second and third colours in the proportions in which
they exist in the spectrum these will compose only the second colour
equal in quantity to the first second and third add to these the
third fourth and fifth in the proportion they exist in the spectrum
and these will produce the fourth colour equal in quantity to the third
fourth and fifth consequently this is precisely the same thing as
mixing the second and fourth colours only which mixture would only
produce the third colour therefore if you combine the first second
fourth and fifth in the proportions in which they exist in the
spectrum with double the quantity of the third colour this third
colour will be produced it is probable that many of the unexpected
changes in mixing colours on a painters easle as well as in more fluid
chemical mixtures may depend on these principles rather than on a new
arrangement or combination of their minute particles
mr galton further observes that white may universally be produced by
the combination of one prismatic colour and a tint intermediate to two
others which tint may be distinguished by a name compounded of the two
colours to which it is intermediate thus white is produced by a
mixture of red with bluegreen of orange with indigoblue of yellow
with violetindigo of green with redviolet of blue with orangered
of indigo with yelloworange of violet with greenyellow which he
further remarks exactly coincides with the theory and facts mentioned by
dr robert darwin of shrewsbury in his account of ocular spectra who
has shewn that when one of these contrasted colours has been long
viewed a spectrum or appearance of the other becomes visible in the
fatigued eye philos trans vol lxxvi for the year 1786
these experiments of mr galton might much assist the copperplate
printers of callicoes and papers in colours as three colours or more
might be produced by two copperplates thus suppose some yellow figures
were put on by the first plate and upon some parts of these yellow
figures and on other parts of the ground blue was laid on by another
copperplate the three colours of yellow blue and green might be
produced as green leaves with yellow and blue flowers

the rays from the rising and setting sun are refracted by our spherical
atmosphere hence the most refrangible rays as the violet indigo and
blue are reflected in greater quantities from the morning and evening
skies and the least refrangible ones as red and orange are last seen
about the setting sun hence mr beguelin observed that the shadow of
his finger on his pocketbook was much bluer in the morning and evening
when the shadow was about eight times as long as the body from which it
was projected mr melville observes that the blue rays being more
refrangible are bent down in the evenings by our atmosphere while the
red and orange being less refrangible continue to pass on and tinge the
morning and evening clouds with their colours see priestleys history
of light and colours p 440 but as the particles of air like those of
water are themselves blue a blue shadow may be seen at all times of
the day though much more beautifully in the mornings and evenings or
by means of a candle in the middle of the day for if a shadow on a
piece of white paper is produced by placing your finger between the
paper and a candle in the day light the shadow will appear very blue
the yellow light of the candle upon the other parts of the paper
apparently deepens the blue by its contrast these colours being
opposite to each other as explained in note ii
colours are produced from clouds or mists by refraction as well as by
reflection in riding in the night over an unequal country i observed a
very beautiful coloured halo round the moon whenever i was covered with
a few feet of mist as i ascended from the vallies which ceased to
appear when i rose above the mist this i suppose was owing to the
thinness of the stratum of mist in which i was immersed had it been
thicker the colours refracted by the small drops of which a fog
consists would not have passed through it down to my eye
there is a bright spot seen on the cornea of the eye when we face a
window which is much attended to by portrait painters this is the
light reflected from the spherical surface of the polished cornea and
brought to a focus if the observer is placed in this focus he sees the
image of the window if he is placed before or behind the focus he only
sees a luminous spot which is more luminous and of less extent the
nearer he approaches to the focus the luminous appearance of the eyes
of animals in the dusky corners of a room or in holes in the earth may
arise in some instances from the same principle viz the reflection of
the light from the spherical cornea which will be coloured red or blue
in some degree by the morning evening or meridian light or by the
objects from which that light is previously reflected in the cavern at
colebrook dale where the mineral tar exsudes the eyes of the horse
which was drawing a cart from within towards the mouth of it appeared
like two balls of phosphorus when he was above 100 yards off and for a
long time before any other part of the animal was visible in this case
i suspect the luminous appearance to have been owing to the light which
had entered the eye being reflected from the back surface of the
vitreous humour and thence emerging again in parallel rays from the
animals eye as it does from the back surface of the drops of the
rainbow and from the waterdrops which lie perhaps without contact on
cabbageleaves and have the brilliancy of quicksilver this accounts
for this luminous appearance being best seen in those animals which have
large apertures in their iris as in cats and horses and is the only
part visible in obscure places because this is a better reflecting
surface than any other part of the animal if any of these emergent rays
from the animals eye can be supposed to have been reflected from the
choroid coat through the semitransparent retina this would account for
the coloured glare of the eyes of dogs or cats and rabits in dark
corners

there have been many theories invented to account for the tails of
comets sir isaac newton thinks that they consist of rare vapours raised
from the nucleus of the comet and so rarefied by the suns heat as to
have their general gravitation diminished and that they in consequence
ascend opposite to the sun and from thence reflect the rays of light
dr halley compares the light of the tails of comets to the streams of
the aurora borealis and other electric effluvia philos trans no

dr hamilton observes that the light of small stars are seen
undiminished through both the light of the tails of comets and of the
aurora borealis and has further illustrated their electric analogy and
adds that the tails of comets consist of a lucid selfshining substance
which has not the power of refracting or reflecting the rays of light
essays
the tail of the comet of 1744 at one time appeared to extend above 16
degrees from its body and must have thence been above twenty three
millions of miles long and the comet of 1680 according to the
calculations of dr halley on november the 11th was not above one semi
diameter of the earth or less than 4000 miles to the northward of the
way of the earth at which time had the earth been in that part of its
orbit what might have been the consequence no one would probably have
survived to have registered the tremendous effects
the comet of 1531 1607 and 1682 having returned in the year 1759
according to dr halleys prediction in the philos trans for 1705
there seems no reason to doubt that all the other comets will return
after their proper periods astronomers have in general acquiesced in
the conjecture of dr halley that the comets of 1532 and 1661 are one
and the same comet from the similarity of the elements of their orbits
and were therefore induced to expect its return to its perihelium 1789
as this comet is liable to be disturbed in its ascent from the sun by
the planets jupiter and saturn dr maskelyne expected its return to its
perihelium in the beginning of the year 1789 or the latter end of the
year 1788 and certainly sometime before the 27th of april 1789 which
prediction has not been fulfilled phil trans vol lxxvi

the dispute among philosophers about phlogiston is not concerning the
existence of an inflammable principle but rather whether there be one
or more inflammable principles the disciples of stahl which till
lately included the whole chemical world believed in the identity of
phlogiston in all bodies which would flame or calcine the disciples of
lavoisier pay homage to a plurality of phlogistons under the various
names of charcoal sulphur metals c whatever will unite with pure
air and thence compose an acid is esteemed in this ingenious theory to
be a different kind of phlogistic or inflammable body at the same time
there remains a doubt whether these inflammable bodies as metals
sulphur charcoal c may not be compounded of the same phlogiston
along with some other material yet undiscovered and thus an unity of
phlogiston exist as in the theory of stahl though very differently
applied in the explication of chemical phenomena
some modern philosophers are of opinion that the sun is the great
fountain from which the earth and other planets derive all the
phlogiston which they possess and that this is formed by the
combination of the solar rays with all opake bodies but particularly
with the leaves of vegetables which they suppose to be organs adapted
to absorb them and that as animals receive their nourishment from
vegetables they also obtain in a secondary manner their phlogiston from
the sun and lastly as great masses of the mineral kingdom which have
been found in the thin crust of the earth which human labour has
penetrated have evidently been formed from the recrements of animal and
vegetable bodies these also are supposed thus to have derived their
phlogiston from the sun
another opinion concerning the suns rays is that they are not luminous
till they arrive at our atmosphere and that there uniting with some
part of the air they produce combustion and light is emitted and that
an etherial acid yet undiscovered is formed from this combustion
the more probable opinion is perhaps that the sun is a phlogistic mass
of matter whose surface is in a state of combustion which like other
burning bodies emits light with immense velocity in all directions that
these rays of light act upon all opake bodies and combining with them
either displace or produce their elementary heat and become chemically
combined with the phlogistic part of them for light is given out when
phlogistic bodies unite with the oxygenous principle of the air as in
combustion or in the reduction of metallic calxes thus in presenting
to the flame of a candle a letterwafer if it be coloured with red
lead at the time the redlead becomes a metallic drop a flash of
light is perceived dr alexander wilson very ingeniously endeavours to
prove that the sun is only in a state of combustion on its surface and
that the dark spots seen on the disk are excavations or caverns through
the luminous crust some of which are 4000 miles in diameter phil

m de mairan in a paper published in the histoire de lacademie de
sciences 1765 has endeavoured to shew that the earth receives but a
small part of the heat which it possesses from the suns rays but is
principally heated by fires within itself he thinks the sun is the
cause of the vicissitudes of our seasons of summer and winter by a very
small quantity of heat in addition to that already residing in the
earth which by emanations from the centre to the circumference renders
the surface habitable and without which though the sun was constantly
to illuminate two thirds of the globe at once with a heat equal to that
at the equator it would soon become a mass of solid ice his reasonings
and calculations on this subject are too long and too intricate to be
inserted here but are equally curious and ingenious and carry much
conviction along with them
the opinion that the center of the earth consists of a large mass of
burning lava has been espoused by boyle boerhave and many other
philosophers some of whom considering its supposed effects on
vegetation and the formation of minerals have called it a second sun
there are many arguments in support of this opinion 1 because the
power of the sun does not extend much beyond ten feet deep into the
earth all below being in winter and summer always of the same degree of
heat viz 48 which being much warmer than the mildest frost is
supposed to be sustained by some internal distant fire add to this
however that from experiments made some years ago by dr franklin the
springwater at philadelphia appeared to be of 52 of heat which seems
further to confirm this opinion since the climates in north america are
supposed to be colder than those of europe under similar degrees of
latitude 2 mr de luc in going 1359 feet perpendicular into the mines
of hartz on july the 5th 1778 on a very fine day found the air at the
bottom a little warmer than at the top of the shaft phil trans vol
lxix p 488 in the mines in hungary which are 500 cubits deep the
heat becomes very troublesome when the miners get below 480 feet depth
morinus de locis subter p 131 but as some other deep mines as
mentioned by mr kirwan are said to possess but the common heat of the
earth and as the crust of the globe thus penetrated by human labour is
so thin compared with the whole no certain deduction can be made from
these facts on either side of the question 3 the warmsprings in many
parts of the earth at great distance from any volcanos seem to originate
from the condensation of vapours arising from water which is boiled by
subterraneous fires and cooled again in their passage through a certain
length of the colder soil for the theory of chemical solution will not
explain the equality of their heat at all seasons and through so many
centuries see note on fucus in vol ii see a letter on this subject in
mr pilkintons view of derbyshire from dr darwin 4 from the
situations of volcanos which are always found upon the summit of the
highest mountains for as these mountains have been lifted up and lose
several of their uppermost strata as they rise the lowest strata of the
earth yet known appear at the tops of the highest hills and the beds of
the volcanos upon these hills must in consequence belong to the lowest
strata of the earth consisting perhaps of granite or basaltes which
were produced before the existance of animal or vegetable bodies and
might constitute the original nucleus of the earth which i have
supposed to have been projected from the sun hence the volcanos
themselves appear to be spiracula or chimneys belonging to great central
fires it is probably owing to the escape of the elastic vapours from
these spiracula that the modern earthquakes are of such small extent
compared with those of remote antiquity of which the vestiges remain
all over the globe 5 the great size and height of the continents and
the great size and depth of the southsea atlantic and other oceans
evince that the first earthquakes which produced these immense changes
in the globe must have been occasioned by central fires 6 the very
distant and expeditious communication of the shocks of some great
earthquakes the earthquake at lisbon in 1755 was perceived in scotland
in the peak of derbyshire and in many other distant parts of europe
the percussions of it travelled with about the velocity of sound viz
about thirteen miles in a minute the earthquake in 1693 extended 2600
leagues goldsmiths history these phenomena are easily explained if
the central parts of the earth consist of a fluid lava as a percussion
on one part of such a fluid mass would be felt on other parts of its
confining vault like a stroke on a fluid contained in a bladder which
however gentle on one side is perceptible to the hand placed on the
other and the velocity with which such a concussion would travel would
be that of sound or thirteen miles in a minute for further information
on this part of the subject the reader is referred to mr michells
excellent treatise on earthquakes in the philos trans vol li 7 that
there is a cavity at the center of the earth is made probable by the
late experiments on the attraction of mountains by mr maskerlyne who
supposed from other considerations that the density of the earth near
the surface should be five times less than its mean density phil
trans vol lxv p 498 but found from the attraction of the mountain
schehallien that it is probable the mean density of the earth is but
double that of the hill ibid p 532 hence if the first supposition be
well founded there would appear to be a cavity at the centre of
considerable magnitude from whence the immense beds and mountains of
lava toadstone basaltes granite c have been protruded 8 the
variation of the compass can only be accounted for by supposing the
central parts of the earth to consist of a fluid mass and that part of
this fluid is iron which requiring a greater degree of heat to bring it
into fusion than glass or other metals remains a solid and the vis
inertiae of this fluid mass with the iron in it occasions it to perform
fewer revolutions than the crust of solid earth over it and thus it is
gradually left behind and the place where the floating iron resides is
pointed to by the direct or retrograde motions of the magnetic needle
this seems to have been nearly the opinion of dr halley and mr euler

a certain quantity of heat seems to be combined with all bodies besides
the sensible quantity which gravitates like the electric fluid amongst
them this combined heat or latent heat of dr black when set at
liberty by fermentation inflammation crystallization freezing or
other chemical attractions producing new combinations passes as a
fluid element into the surrounding bodies and by thawing diffusion of
neutral salts in water melting and other chemical solutions a
portion of heat is attracted from the bodies in vicinity and enters into
or becomes combined with the new solutions
hence a combination of metals with acids of essential oils and acids
of alcohol and water of acids and water give out heat whilst a
solution of snow in water or in acids and of neutral salts in water
attract heat from the surrounding bodies so the acid of nitre mixed
with oil of cloves unites with it and produces a most violent flame the
same acid of nitre poured on snow instantly dissolves it and produces
the greatest degree of cold yet known by which at petersburgh
quicksilver was first frozen in 1760
water may be cooled below 32 without being frozen if it be placed on a
solid floor and secured from agitation but when thus cooled below the
freezing point the least agitation turns part of it suddenly into ice
and when this sudden freezing takes place a thermometer placed in it
instantly rises as some heat is given out in the act of congelation and
the ice is thus left with the same sensible degree of cold as the
water had possessed before it was agitated but is nevertheless now
combined with less latent heat
a cubic inch of water thus cooled down to 32 mixed with an equal
quantity of boiling water at 212 will cool it to the middle number
between these two or to 122 but a cubic inch of ice whose sensible
cold also is but 32 mixed with an equal quantity of boiling water will
cool it six times as much as the cubic inch of cold water
abovementioned as the ice not only gains its share of the sensible or
gravitating heat of the boiling water but attracts to itself also and
combines with the quantity of latent heat which it had lost at the time
of its congelation
so boiling water will acquire but 212 of heat under the common pressure
of the atmosphere but the steam raised from it by its expansion or by
its solution in the atmosphere combines with and carries away a
prodigious quantity of heat which it again parts with on its
condensation as is seen in common distillation where the large quantity
of water in the wormtub is so soon heated hence the evaporation of
ether on a thermometer soon sinks the mercury below freezing and hence
a warmth of the air in winter frequently succeeds a shower
when the matter of heat or calorique is set at liberty from its
combinations as by inflammation it passes into the surrounding bodies
which possess different capacities of acquiring their share of the loose
or sensible heat thus a pint measure of cold water at 48 mixed with a
pint of boiling water at 212 will cool it to the degree between these
two numbers or to 154 but it requires two pint measures of
quicksilver at 48 of heat to cool one pint of water as above these and
other curious experiments are adduced by dr black to evince the
existance of combined or latent heat in bodies as has been explained by
some of his pupils and well illustrated by dr crawford the world has
long been in expectation of an account of his discoveries on this
subject by the celebrated author himself
as this doctrine of elementary heat in its fluid and combined state is
not yet universally received i shall here add two arguments in support
of it drawn from different sources viz from the heat given out or
absorbed by the mechanical condensation or expansion of the air and
perhaps of other bodies and from the analogy of the various phenomena
of heat with those of electricity
i if a thermometer be placed in the receiver of an airpump and the
air hastily exhausted the thermometer will sink some degrees and the
glass become steamy the same occurs in hastily admitting a part of the
air again this i suppose to be produced by the expansion of part of the
air both during the exhaustion and readmission of it and that the air
so expanded becomes capable of attracting from the bodies in its
vicinity a part of their heat hence the vapours contained in it and the
glass receiver are for a time colder and the steam is precipitated that
the air thus parts with its moisture from the cold occasioned by its
rarefaction and not simply by the rarefaction itself is evident because
in a minute or two the same rarefied air will again take up the dew
deposited on the receiver and because water will evaporate sooner in
rare than in dense air
there is a curious phenomenon similar to this observed in the fountain
of hiero constructed on a large scale at the chemnicensian mines in
hungary in this machine the air in a large vessel is compressed by a
column of water 260 feet high a stopcock is then opened and as the
air issues out with great vehemence and thus becomes immediately
greatly expanded so much cold is produced that the moisture from this
stream of air is precipitated in the form of snow and ice is formed
adhering to the nosel of the cock this remarkable circumstance is
described at large with a plate of the machine in philos trans vol
lii for 1761
the following experiment is related by dr darwin in the philos trans
vol lxxviii having charged an airgun as forcibly as he well could the
aircell and syringe became exceedingly hot much more so than could be
ascribed to the friction in working it it was then left about half an
hour to cool down to the temperature of the air and a thermometer
having been previously fixed against a wall the air was discharged in a
continual stream on its bulb and it sunk many degrees from these three
experiments of the steam in the exhausted receiver being deposited and
reabsorbed when a part of the air is exhausted or readmitted and the
snow produced by the fountain of hiero and the extraordinary heat given
out in charging and the cold produced in discharging an airgun there
is reason to conclude that when air is mechanically compressed the
elementary fluid heat is pressed out of it and that when it is
mechanically expanded the same fluid heat is reabsorbed from the common
mass
it is probable all other bodies as well as air attract heat from their
neighbours when they are mechanically expanded and give it out when
they are mechanically condensed thus when a vibration of the particles
of hard bodies is excited by friction or by percussion these particles
mutually recede from and approach each other reciprocally at the times
of their recession from each other the body becomes enlarged in bulk
and is then in a condition to attract heat from those in its vicinity
with great and sudden power at the times of their approach to each
other this heat is again given out but the bodies in contact having in
the mean while received the heat they had thus lost from other bodies
behind them do not so suddenly or so forcibly reabsorb the heat again
from the body in vibration hence it remains on its surface like the
electric fluid on a rubbed glass globe and for the same reason because
there is no good conductor to take it up again hence at every vibration
more and more heat is acquired and stands loose upon the surface as in
filing metals or rubbing glass tubes and thus a smith with a few
strokes on a nail on his anvil can make it hot enough to light a
brimstonematch and hence in striking flint and steel together heat
enough is produced to vitrify the parts thus strucken off the quantity
of which heat is again probably increased by the new chemical
combination
ii the analogy between the phenomena of the electric fluid and of heat
furnishes another argument in support of the existence of heat as a
gravitating fluid 1 they are both accumulated by friction on the
excited body 2 they are propagated easily or with difficalty along the
same classes of bodies with ease by metals with less ease by water
and with difficulty by resins beeswax silk air and glass thus
glass canes or canes of sealingwax may be melted by a blowpipe or a
candle within a quarter of an inch of the fingers which hold them
without any inconvenient heat while a pin or other metallic substance
applyed to the flame of a candle so readily conducts the heat as
immediately to burn the fingers hence clothes of silk keep the body
warmer than clothes of linen of equal thickness by confining the heat
upon the body and hence plains are so much warmer than the summits of
mountains by the greater density of the air confining the acquired heat
upon them 3 they both give out light in their passage through air
perhaps not in their passage through a vacuum 4 they both of them fuse
or vitrify metals 5 bodies after being electrized if they are
mechanically extended will receive a greater quantity of electricity as
in dr franklins experiment of the chain in the tankard the same seems
true in respect to heat as explained above 6 both heat and electricity
contribute to suspend steam in the atmosphere by producing or increasing
the repulsion of its particles 7 they both gravitate when they have
been accumulated till they find their equilibrium
if we add to the above the many chemical experiments which receive an
easy and elegant explanation from the supposed matter of heat as
employed in the works of bergman and lavoisier i think we may
reasonably allow of its existence as an element occasionally combined
with other bodies and occasionally existing as a fluid like the
electric fluid gravitating amongst them and that hence it may be
propagated from the central fires of the earth to the whole mass and
contribute to preserve the mean heat of the earth which in this country
is about 48 degrees but variable from the greater or less effect of the
suns heat in different climates so well explained in mr kirwans

i saw made by the late dr powel who threw the focus of a large
reflector on one extremity of it were not conclusive either way as the
copper leaf of the balance approached in one experiment and receded in
another
there are however methods by which either a rotative or alternating
motion may be produced by very moderate degrees of heat if a straight
glass tube such as are used for barometers be suspended horizontally
before a fire like a roasting spit it will revolve by intervals for
as glass is a bad conductor of heat the side next the fire becomes
heated sooner than the opposite side and the tube becomes bent into a
bow with the external part of the curve towards the fire this curve
then falls down and produces a fourth part of a revolution of the glass
tube which thus revolves with intermediate pauses
another alternating motion i have seen produced by suspending a glass
tube about eight inches long with bulbs at each end on a centre like a
scale beam this curious machine is filled about one third part with
purest spirit of wine the other two thirds being a vacuum and is
called a pulseglass if it be placed in a box before the fire so that
either bulb as it rises may become shaded from the fire and exposed
to it when it descends an alternate libration of it is produced for
spirit of wine in vacuo emits steam by a very small degree of heat and
this steam forces the spirit beneath it up into the upper bulb which
therefore descends it is probable such a machine on a larger scale
might be of use to open the doors or windows of hothouses or mellon
frames when the air within them should become too much heated or might
be employed in more important mechanical purposes
on travelling through a hot summers day in a chaise with a box covered
with leather on the foreaxletree i observed as the sun shone upon
the black leather the box began to open its lid which at noon rose
above a foot and could not without great force be pressed down and
which gradually closed again as the sun declined in the evening this i
suppose might with still greater facility be applied to the purpose of
opening melonframes or the sashes of hothouses

there are eighteen species of lampyris or glowworm according to
linneus some of which are found in almost every part of the world in
many of the species the females have no wings and are supposed to be
discovered by the winged males by their shining in the night they
become much more lucid when they put themselves in motion which would
seem to indicate that their light is owing to their respiration in
which process it is probable phosphoric acid is produced by the
combination of vital air with some part of the blood and that light is
given out through their transparent bodies by this slow internal
combustion
there is a firefly of the beetlekind described in the dict raisonn
under the name of acudia which is said to be two inches long and
inhabits the westindies and south america the natives use them instead
of candles putting from one to three of them under a glass madam
merian says that at surinam the light of this fly is so great that she
saw sufficiently well by one of them to paint and finish one of the
figures of them in her work on insects the largest and oldest of them
are said to become four inches long and to shine like a shooting star
as they fly and are thence called lanternbearers the use of this
light to the insect itself seems to be that it may not fly against
objects in the night by which contrivance these insects are enabled to
procure their sustenance either by night or day as their wants may
require or their numerous enemies permit them whereas some of our
beetles have eyes adapted only to the night and if they happen to come
abroad too soon in the evening are so dazzled that they fly against
every thing in their way see note on phosphorus no x
in some seas as particularly about the coast of malabar as a ship
floats along it seems during the night to be surrounded with fire and
to leave a long tract of light behind it whenever the sea is gently
agitated it seems converted into little stars every drop as it breaks
emits light like bodies electrified in the dark mr bomare says that
when he was at the port of cettes in languedoc and bathing with a
companion in the sea after a very hot day they both appeared covered
with fire after every immersion and that laying his wet hand on the arm
of his companion who had not then dipped himself the exact mark of his
hand and fingers was seen in characters of fire as numerous microscopic
insects are found in this shining water its light has been generally
ascribed to them though it seems probable that fishslime in hot
countries may become in such a state of incipient putrefaction as to
give light especially when by agitation it is more exposed to the air
otherwise it is not easy to explain why agitation should be necessary to
produce this marine light see note on phosphorus no x

kunckel a native of hamburgh was the first who discovered to the world
the process for producing phosphorus though brandt and boyle were
likewise said to have previously had the art of making it it was
obtained from sal microcosmicum by evaporation in the form of an acid
but has since been found in other animal substances as in the ashes of
bones and even in some vegetables as in wheat flour keirs chemical
dict this phosphoric acid is like all other acids united with vital
air and requires to be treated with charcoal or phlogiston to deprive
it of this air it then becomes a kind of animal sulphur but of so
inflammable a nature that on the access of air it takes fire
spontaneously and as it burns becomes again united with vital air and
reassumes its form of phosphoric acid
as animal respiration seems to be a kind of slow combustion in which it
is probable that phosphoric acid is produced by the union of phosphorus
with the vital air so it is also probable that phosphoric acid is
produced in the excretory or respiratory vessels of luminous insects as
the glowworm and firefly and some marine insects from the same
principle i suppose the light from putrid fish as from the heads of
hadocks and from putrid veal and from rotten wood in a certain state
of their putrefaction is produced and phosphorus thus slowly combined
with air is changed into phosphoric acid the light from the bolognian
stone and from calcined shells and from white paper and linen after
having been exposed for a time to the suns light seem to produce
either the phosphoric or some other kind of acid from the sulphurous or
phlogistic matter which they contain see note on beccaris shells l
180
there is another process seems similar to this slow combustion and that
is bleaching by the warmth and light of the sun the water sprinkled
upon linen or cotton cloth seems to be decomposed if we credit the
theory of m lavoisier and a part of the vital air thus set at liberty
and uncombined and not being in its elastic form more easily dissolves
the colouring or phlogistic matter of the cloth and produces a new
acid which is itself colourless or is washed out of the cloth by
water the new process of bleaching confirms a part of this theory for
by uniting much vital air to marine acid by distilling it from
manganese on dipping the cloth to be bleached in water repleat with
this superaerated marine acid the colouring matter disappears
immediately sooner indeed in cotton than in linen see note xxxiv
there is another process which i suspect bears analogy to these above
mentioned and that is the rancidity of animal fat as of bacon if
bacon be hung up in a warm kitchen with much salt adhering on the
outside of it the fat part of it soon becomes yellow and rancid if it
be washed with much cold water after it has imbibed the salt and just
before it is hung up i am well informed that it will not become
rancid or in very slight degrees in the former case i imagine the salt
on the surface of the bacon attracts water during the cold of the night
which is evaporated during the day and that in this evaporation a part
of the water becomes decomposed as in bleaching and its vital air
uniting with greater facility in its unelastic state with the animal
fat produces an acid perhaps of the phosphoric kind which being of a
fixed nature lies upon the bacon giving it the yellow colour and rancid
taste it is remarkable that the superaerated marine acid does not
bleach living animal substances at least it did not whiten a part of my
hand which i for some minutes exposed to it

the expansive force of steam was known in some degree to the antients
hero of alexandria describes an application of it to produce a rotative
motion by the reaction of steam issuing from a sphere mounted upon an
axis through two small tubes bent into tangents and issuing from the
opposite sides of the equatorial diameter of the sphere the sphere was
supplied with steam by a pipe communicating with a pan of boiling water
and entering the sphere at one of its poles
a french writer about the year 1630 describes a method of raising water
to the upper part of a house by filling a chamber with steam and
suffering it to condense of itself but it seems to have been mere
theory as his method was scarcely practicable as he describes it in
1655 the marquis of worcester mentions a method of raising water by fire
in his century of inventions but he seems only to have availed himself
of the expansive force and not to have known the advantages arising from
condensing the steam by an injection of cold water this latter and most
important improvement seems to have been made by capt savery sometime
prior to 1698 for in that year his patent for the use of that invention
was confirmed by act of parliament this gentleman appears to have been
the first who reduced the machine to practice and exhibited it in an
useful form this method consisted only in expelling the air from a
vessel by steam and condensing the steam by an injection of cold water
which making a vacuum the pressure of the atmosphere forced the water
to ascend into the steamvessel through a pipe of 24 to 26 feet high
and by the admission of dense steam from the boiler forcing the water
in the steamvessel to ascend to the height desired this construction
was defective because it required very strong vessels to resist the
force of the steam and because an enormous quantity of steam was
condensed by coming in contact with the cold water in the steamvessel
about or soon after that time m papin attempted a steamengine on
similar principles but rather more defective in its construction
the next improvement was made very soon afterwards by messrs newcomen
and cawley of dartmouth it consisted in employing for the steamvessel
a hollow cylinder shut at bottom and open at top furnished with a
piston sliding easily up and down in it and made tight by oakum or
hemp and covered with water this piston is suspended by chains from
one end of a beam moveable upon an axis in the middle of its length to
the other end of this beam are suspended the pumprods
the danger of bursting the vessels was avoided in this machine as
however high the water was to be raised it was not necessary to increase
the density of the steam but only to enlarge the diameter of the
cylinder
another advantage was that the cylinder not being made so cold as in
savarys method much less steam was lost in filling it after each
condensation
the machine however still remained imperfect for the cold water thrown
into the cylinder acquired heat from the steam it condensed and being
in a vessel exhausted of air it produced steam itself which in part
resisted the action of the atmosphere on the piston were this remedied
by throwing in more cold water the destruction of steam in the next
filling of the cylinder would be proportionally increased it has
therefore in practice been found adviseable not to load these engines
with columns of water weighing more than seven pounds for each square
inch of the area of the piston the bulk of water when converted into
steam remained unknown until mr j watt then of glasgow in 1764
determined it to be about 1800 times more rare than water it soon
occurred to mr watt that a perfect engine would be that in which no
steam should be condensed in filling the cylinder and in which the
steam should be so perfectly cooled as to produce nearly a perfect
vacuum
mr watt having ascertained the degree of heat in which water boiled in
vacuo and under progressive degrees of pressure and instructed by dr
blacks discovery of latent heat having calculated the quantity of cold
water necessary to condense certain quantities of steam so far as to
produce the exhaustion required he made a communication from the
cylinder to a cold vessel previously exhausted of air and water into
which the steam rushed by its elasticity and became immediately
condensed he then adapted a cover to the cylinder and admitted steam
above the piston to press it down instead of air and instead of
applying water he used oil or grease to fill the pores of the oakum and
to lubricate the cylinder
he next applied a pump to extract the injection water the condensed
steam and the air from the condensing vessel every stroke of the
engine
to prevent the cooling of the cylinder by the contact of the external
air he surrounded it with a case containing steam which he again
protected by a covering of matters which conduct heat slowly
this construction presented an easy means of regulating the power of the
engine for the steam being the acting power as the pipe which admits
it from the boiler is more or less opened a greater or smaller quantity
can enter during the time of a stroke and consequently the engine can
act with exactly the necessary degree of energy
mr watt gained a patent for his engine in 1768 but the further
persecution of his designs were delayed by other avocations till 1775
when in conjunction with mr boulton of soho near birmingham numerous
experiments were made on a large scale by their united ingenuity and
great improvements added to the machinery and an act of parliament
obtained for the prolongation of their patent for twentyfive years
they have since that time drained many of the deep mines in cornwall
which but for the happy union of such genius must immediately have
ceased to work one of these engines works a pump of eighteen inches
diameter and upwards of 100 fathom or 600 feet high at the rate of ten
to twelve strokes of seven feet long each in a minute and that with
one fifth part of the coals which a common engine would have taken to do
the same work the power of this engine may be easier comprehended by
saying that it raised a weight equal to 81000 pounds 80 feet high in a
minute which is equal to the combined action of 200 good horses in
newcomens engine this would have required a cylinder of the enormous
diameter of 120 inches or ten feet but as in this engine of mr watt
and mr boulton the steam acts and a vacuum is made alternately above
and below the piston the power exerted is double to what the same
cylinder would otherways produce and is further augmented by an
inequality in the length of the two ends of the lever
these gentlemen have also by other contrivances applied their engines to
the turning of mills for almost every purpose of which that great pile
of machinery the albion mill is a well known instance forges slitting
mills and other great works are erected where nature has furnished no
running water and future times may boast that this grand and useful
engine was invented and perfected in our own country
since the above article went to the press the albion mill is no more it
is supposed to have been set on fire by interested or malicious
incendaries and is burnt to the ground whence london has lost the
credit and the advantage of possessing the most powerful machine in the

the cause of the expansion of water during its conversion into ice is
not yet well ascertained it was supposed to have been owing to the air
being set at liberty in the act of congelation which was before
dissolved in the water and the many air bubbles in ice were thought to
countenance this opinion but the great force with which ice expands
during its congelation so as to burst iron bombs and coehorns
according to the experiments of major williams at quebec invalidates
this idea of the cause of it and may sometime be brought into use as a
means of breaking rocks in mining or projecting cannonballs or for
other mechanical purposes if the means of producing congelation should
ever be discovered to be as easy as the means of producing combustion
mr de mairan attributes the increase of bulk of frozen water to the
different arrangement of the particles of it in crystallization as they
are constantly joined at an angle of 60 degrees and must by this
disposition he thinks occupy a greater volume than if they were
parallel he found the augmentation of the water during freezing to
amount to onefourteenth oneeighteenth onenineteenth and when the
water was previously purged of air to only onetwentysecond part he
adds that a piece of ice which was at first only onefourteenth part
specifically lighter than water on being exposed some days to the frost
became onetwelfth lighter than water hence he thinks ice by being
exposed to greater cold still increases in volume and to this
attributes the bursting of ice in ponds and on the glaciers see lewiss
commerce of arts p 257 and the note on muschus in the other volume of
this work
this expansion of ice well accounts for the greater mischief done by
vernal frosts attended with moisture as by hoarfrosts than by the
dry frosts called black frosts mr lawrence in a letter to mr bradley
complains that the dalemist attended with a frost on mayday had
destroyed all his tender fruits though there was a sharper frost the
night before without a mist that did him no injury and adds that a
garden not a stones throw from his own on a higher situation being
above the dalemist had received no damage bradley vol ii p 232
mr hunter by very curious experiments discovered that the living
principle in fish in vegetables and even in eggs and seeds possesses
a power of resisting congelation phil trans there can be no doubt but
that the exertions of animals to avoid the pain of cold may produce in
them a greater quantity of heat at least for a time but that
vegetables eggs or seeds should possess such a quality is truly
wonderful others have imagined that animals possess a power of
preventing themselves from becoming much warmer than 98 degrees of heat
when immersed in an atmosphere above that degree of heat it is true
that the increased exhalation from their bodies will in some measure
cool them as much heat is carried off by the evaporation of fluids but
this is a chemical not an animal process the experiments made by those
who continued many minutes in the air of a room heated so much above any
natural atmospheric heat do not seem conclusive as they remained in it
a less time than would have been necessary to have heated a mass of beef
of the same magnitude and the circulation of the blood in living
animals by perpetually bringing new supplies of fluid to the skin
would prevent the external surface from becoming hot much sooner than
the whole mass and thirdly there appears no power of animal bodies to
produce cold in diseases as in scarlet fever in which the increased
action of the vessels of the skin produces heat and contributes to
exhaust the animal power already too much weakened
it has been thought by many that frosts meliorate the ground and that
they are in general salubrious to mankind in respect to the former it
is now well known that ice or snow contain no nitrous particles and
though frost by enlarging the bulk of moist clay leaves it softer for a
time after the thaw yet as soon as the water exhales the clay becomes
as hard as before being pressed together by the incumbent atmosphere
and by its selfattraction called setting by the potters add to this
that on the coasts of africa where frost is unknown the fertility of
the soil is almost beyond our conceptions of it in respect to the
general salubrity of frosty seasons the bills of mortality are an
evidence in the negative as in long frosts many weakly and old people
perish from debility occasioned by the cold and many classes of birds
and other wild animals are benumbed by the cold or destroyed by the
consequent scarcity of food and many tender vegetables perish from the
degree of cold
i do not think it should be objected to this doctrine that there are
moist days attended with a brisk cold wind when no visible ice appears
and which are yet more disagreeable and destructive than frosty weather
for on these days the cold moisture which is deposited on the skin is
there evaporated and thus produces a degree of cold perhaps greater than
the milder frosts whence even in such days both the disagreeable
sensations and insalubrious effects belong to the cause abovementioned
viz the intensity of the cold add to this that in these cold moist
days as we pass along or as the wind blows upon us a new sheet of cold
water is as it were perpetually applied to us and hangs upon our bodies
now as water is 800 times denser than air and is a much better conductor
of heat we are starved with cold like those who go into a cold bath
both by the great number of particles in contact with the skin and their
greater facility of receiving our heat
it may nevertheless be true that snows of long duration in our winters
may be less injurious to vegetation than great rains and shorter frosts
for two reasons 1 because great rains carry down many thousand pounds
worth of the best part of the manure off the lands into the sea whereas
snow dissolves more gradually and thence carries away less from the
land any one may distinguish a snowflood from a rainflood by the
transparency of the water hence hills or fields with considerable
inclination of surface should be ploughed horizontally that the furrows
may stay the water from showers till it deposits its mud 2 snow
protects vegetables from the severity of the frost since it is always
in a state of thaw where it is in contact with the earth as the earths
heat is about 48 and the heat of thawing snow is 32 the vegetables
between them are kept in a degree of heat about 40 by which many of
them are preserved see note on muschus vol ii of this work

                            electric points
there was an idle dispute whether knobs or points were preferable on the
top of conductors for the defence of houses the design of these
conductors is to permit the electric matter accumulated in the clouds to
pass through them into the earth in a smaller continued stream as the
cloud approaches before it comes to what is termed striking distance
now as it is well known that accumulated electricity will pass to points
at a much greater distance than it will to knobs there can be no doubt
of their preference and it would seem that the finer the point and the
less liable to become rusty the better as it would take off the
lightening while it was still at a greater distance and by that means
preserve a greater extent of building the very extremity of the point
should be of pure silver or gold and might be branched into a kind of
brush since one small point can not be supposed to receive so great a
quantity as a thicker bar might conduct into the earth
if an insulated metallic ball is armed with a point like a needle
projecting from one part of it the electric fluid will be seen in the
dark to pass off from this point so long as the ball is kept supplied
with electricity the reason of this is not difficult to comprehend
every part of the electric atmosphere which surrounds the insulated ball
is attracted to that ball by a large surface of it whereas the electric
atmosphere which is near the extremity of the needle is attracted to it
by only a single point in consequence the particles of electric matter
near the surface of the ball approach towards it and push off by their
greater gravitation the particles of electric matter over the point of
the needle in a continued stream
something like this happens in respect to the diffusion of oil on water
from a pointed cork an experiment which was many years ago shewn me by
dr franklin he cut a piece of cork about the size of a letterwafer
and left on one edge of it a point about a sixth of an inch in length
projecting as a tangent to the circumference this was dipped in oil and
thrown on a pond of water and continued to revolve as the oil left the
point for a great many minutes the oil descends from the floating cork
upon the water being diffused upon it without friction and perhaps
without contact but its going off at the point so forcibly as to make
the cork revolve in a contrary direction seems analogous to the
departure of the electric fluid from points
can any thing similar to either of these happen in respect to the
earths atmosphere and give occasion to the breezes on the tops of
mountains which may be considered as points on the earths
circumference
                              fairyrings
there is a phenomenon supposed to be electric which is yet unaccounted
for i mean the fairyrings as they are called so often seen on the
grass the numerous flashes of lightning which occur every summer are i
believe generally discharged on the earth and but seldom if ever
from one cloud to another moist trees are the most frequent conductors
of these flashes of lightning and i am informed by purchasers of wood
that innumerable trees are thus cracked and injured at other times
larger parts or prominences of clouds gradually sinking as they move
along are discharged on the moisture parts of grassy plains now this
knob or corner of a cloud in being attracted by the earth will become
nearly cylindrical as loose wool would do when drawn out into a thread
and will strike the earth with a stream of electricity perhaps two or
ten yards in diameter now as a stream of electricity displaces the air
it passes through it is plain no part of the grass can be burnt by it
but just the external ring of this cylinder where the grass can have
access to the air since without air nothing can be calcined this earth
after having been so calcined becomes a richer soil and either funguses
or a bluer grass for many years mark the place that lightning displaces
the air in its passage is evinced by the loud crack that succeeds it
which is owing to the sides of the aerial vacuum clapping together when
the lightning is withdrawn that nothing will calcine without air is now
well understood from the acids produced in the burning of phlogistic
substances and may be agreeably seen by suspending a paper on an iron
prong and putting it into the centre of the blaze of an ironfurnace it
may be held there some seconds and may be again withdrawn without its
being burnt if it be passed quickly into the flame and out again
through the external part of it which is in contact with the air i know
some circles of many yards diameter of this kind near foremark in
derbyshire which annually produce large white funguses and stronger
grass and have done so i am informed above thirty years this
increased fertility of the ground by calcination or charring and its
continuing to operate so many years is well worth the attention of the
farmer and shews the use of paring and burning new turf in agriculture
which produces its effect not so much by the ashes of the vegetable
fibres as by charring the soil which adheres to them
these situations whether from eminence or from moisture which were
proper once to attract and discharge a thundercloud are more liable
again to experience the same hence many fairyrings are often seen near
each other either without intersecting each other as i saw this summer
in a garden in nottinghamshire or intersecting each other as described

a tree is properly speaking a family or swarm of buds each bud being an
individual plant for if one of these buds be torn or cut out and
planted in the earth with a glass cup inverted over it to prevent its
exhalation from being at first greater than its power of absorption it
will produce a tree similar to its parent each bud has a leaf which is
its lungs appropriated to it and the bark of the tree is a congeries
of the roots of these individual buds whence old hollow trees are often
seen to have some branches flourish with vigour after the internal wood
is almost intirely decayed and vanished according to this idea linneus
has observed that trees and shrubs are roots above ground for if a tree
be inverted leaves will grow from the rootpart and roots from the
trunkpart phil bot p 39 hence it appears that vegetables have two
methods of propagating themselves the oviparous as by seeds and the
viviparous as by their buds and bulbs and that the individual plants
whether from seeds or buds or bulbs are all annual productions like
many kinds of insects as the silkworm the parent perishing in the
autumn after having produced an embryon which lies in a torpid state
during the winter and is matured in the succeeding summer hence
linneus names buds and bulbs the wintercradles of the plant or
hybernacula and might have given the same term to seeds in warm
climates few plants produce buds as the vegetable life can be
compleated in one summer and hence the hybernacle is not wanted in
cold climates also some plants do not produce buds as philadelphus
frangula viburnum ivy heath woodnightshade rue geranium
the bulbs of plants are another kind of wintercradle or hybernacle
adhering to the descending trunk and are found in the perennial
herbaceous plants which are too tender to bear the cold of the winter
the production of these subterraneous winter lodges is not yet perhaps
clearly understood they have been distributed by linneus according to
their forms into scaly solid coated and jointed bulbs which however
does not elucidate their manner of production as the buds of trees may
be truly esteemed individual annual plants their roots constituting the
bark of the tree it follows that these roots viz of each individual
bud spread themselves over the last years bark making a new bark over
the old one and thence descending cover with a new bark the old roots
also in the same manner a similar circumstance i suppose to happen in
some herbaceous plants that is a new bark is annually produced over
the old root and thus for some years at least the old root or caudex
increases in size and puts up new stems as these roots increase in size
the central part i suppose changes like the internal wood of a tree and
does not possess any vegetable life and therefore gives out no fibres
or rootlets and hence appears bitten off as in valerian plantain and
devilsbit and this decay of the central part of the root i suppose
has given occasion to the belief of the rootfibres drawing down the
bulb so much insisted on by mr milne in his botanical dictionary art
bulb
from the observations and drawings of various kinds of bulbous roots at
different times of their growth sent me by a young lady of nice
observation it appears probable that all bulbous roots properly so
called perish annually in this climate bradley miller and the author
of spectacle de la nature observe that the tulip annually renews its
bulb for the stalk of the old flower is found under the old dry coat
but on the outside of the new bulb this large new bulb is the flowering
bulb but besides this there are other small new bulbs produced between
the coats of this large one but from the same caudex or circle from
which the rootfibres spring these small bulbs are leafbearing bulbs
and renew themselves annually with increasing size till they bear
flowers
miss  favoured me with the following curious experiment she took a
small tuliproot out of the earth when the green leaves were
sufficiently high to show the flower and placed it in a glass of water
the leaves and flower soon withered and the bulb became wrinkled and
soft but put out one small side bulb and three bulbs beneath descending
an inch into the water by long processes from the caudex the old bulb
in some weeks intirely decayed on dissecting this monster the middle
descending bulb was found by its process to adhere to the caudex and to
the old flowerstem and the side ones were separated from the flower
stem by a few shrivelled coats but adhered to the caudex whence she
concludes that these last were offsets or leafbulbs which should have
been seen between the coats of the new flowerbulb if it had been left
to grow in the earth and that the middle one would have been the new
flowerbulb in some years perhaps in wet seasons the florists are
said to lose many of their tuliproots by a similar process the new
leafbulbs being produced beneath the old ones by an elongation of the
caudex without any new flowerbulbs
by repeated dissections she observes that the leafbulbs or offsets of
tulip crocus gladiolus fritillary are renewed in the same manner as
the floweringbulbs contrary to the opinion of many writers this new
leafbulb is formed on the inside of the coats from whence the leaves
grow and is more or less advanced in size as the outer coats and leaves
are more or less shrivelled in examining tulip iris hyacinth hare
bell the new bulb was invariably found between the flowerstem and
the base of the innermost leaf of those roots which had flowered and
inclosed by the base of the innermost leaf in those roots which had
not flowered in both cases adhering to the caudex or fleshy circle from
which the rootfibres spring
hence it is probable that the bulbs of hyacinths are renewed annually
but that this is performed from the caudex within the old bulb the
outer coat of which does not so shrivel as in crocus and fritillary and
hence this change is not so apparent but i believe as soon as the
flower is advanced the new bulbs may be seen on dissection nor does the
annual increase of the size of the root of cyclamen and of aletris
capensis militate against this annual renewal of them since the leaf
bulbs or offsets as described above are increased in size as they are
annually renewed see note on orchis and on anthoxanthum in vol ii

dr alexander wilson professor of astronomy at glasgow published a
paper in the philosophical transactions for 1774 demonstrating that the
spots in the suns disk are real cavities excavations through the
luminous material which covers the other parts of the suns surface
one of these cavities he found to be about 4000 miles deep and many
times as wide some objections were made to this doctrine by m de la
laude in the memoirs of the french academy for the year 1776 which
however have been ably answered by professor wilson in reply in the
philos trans for 1783 keil observes in his astronomical lectures p
44 we frequently see spots in the sun which are larger and broader not
only than europe or africa but which even equal if they do not exceed
the surface of the whole terraqueous globe now that these cavities are
made in the suns body by a process of nature similar to our earthquakes
does not seem improbable on several accounts 1 because from this
discovery of dr wilson it appears that the internal parts of the sun
are not in a state of inflammation or of ejecting light like the
external part or luminous ocean which covers it and hence that a
greater degree of heat or inflammation and consequent expansion or
explosion may occasionally be produced in its internal or dark nucleus
2 because the solar spots or cavities are frequently increased or
diminished in size 3 new ones are often produced 4 and old ones
vanish 5 because there are brighter or more luminous parts of the
suns disk called faculae by scheiner and hevelius which would seem to
be volcanos in the sun or as dr wilson calls them eructations of
matter more luminous than that which covers the suns surface 6 to
which may be added that all the planets added together with their
satellites do not amount to more than one six hundred and fiftieth part
of the mass of the sun according to sir isaac newton
now if it could be supposed that the planets were originally thrown out
of the sun by larger sunquakes than those frequent ones which occasion
these spots or excavations abovementioned what would happen 1
according to the observations and opinion of mr herschel the sun itself
and all its planets are moving forwards round some other centre with an
unknown velocity which may be of opake matter corresponding with the
very antient and general idea of a chaos whence if a ponderous planet
as saturn could be supposed to be projected from the sun by an
explosion the motion of the sun itself might be at the same time
disturbed in such a manner as to prevent the planet from falling again
into it 2 as the sun revolves round its own axis its form must be that
of an oblate spheroid like the earth and therefore a body projected
from its surface perpendicularly upwards from that surface would not
rise perpendicularly from the suns centre unless it happened to be
projected exactly from either of its poles or from its equator whence
it may not be necessary that a planet if thus projected from the sun by
explosion should again fall into the sun 3 they would part from the
suns surface with the velocity with which that surface was moving and
with the velocity acquired by the explosion and would therefore move
round the sun in the same direction in which the sun rotates on its
axis and perform eliptic orbits 4 all the planets would move the same
way round the sun from this first motion acquired at leaving its
surface but their orbits would be inclined to each other according to
the distance of the part where they were thrown out from the suns
equator hence those which were ejected near the suns equator would
have orbits but little inclined to each other as the primary planets
the plain of all whose orbits are inclined but seven degrees and a half
from each other others which were ejected near the suns poles would
have much more eccentric orbits as they would partake so much less of
the suns rotatory motion at the time they parted from his surface and
would therefore be carried further from the sun by the velocity they had
gained by the explosion which ejected them and become comets 5 they
would all obey the same laws of motion in their revolutions round the
sun this has been determined by astronomers who have demonstrated that
they move through equal areas in equal times 6 as their annual periods
would depend on the height they rose by the explosion these would
differ in them all 7 as their diurnal revolutions would depend on one
side of the exploded matter adhering more than the other at the time it
was torn off by the explosion these would also differ in the different
planets and not bear any proportion to their annual periods now as all
these circumstances coincide with the known laws of the planetary
system they serve to strengthen this conjecture
this coincidence of such a variety of circumstances induced m de buffon
to suppose that the planets were all struck off from the suns surface
by the impact of a large comet such as approached so near the suns
disk and with such amazing velocity in the year 1680 and is expected
to return in 2255 but mr buffon did not recollect that these comets
themselves are only planets with more eccentric orbits and that
therefore it must be asked what had previously struck off these comets
from the suns body 2 that if all these planets were struck off from
the sun at the same time they must have been so near as to have
attracted each other and have formed one mass 3 that we shall want new
causes for separating the secondary planets from the primary ones and
must therefore look out for some other agent as it does not appear how
the impulse of a comet could have made one planet roll round another at
the time they both of them were driven off from the surface of the sun
if it should be asked why new planets are not frequently ejected from
the sun it may be answered that after many large earthquakes many
vents are left for the elastic vapours to escape and hence by the
present appearance of the surface of our earth earthquakes prodigiously
larger than any recorded in history have existed the same circumstances
may have affected the sun on whose surface there are appearances of
volcanos as described above add to this that some of the comets and
even the georgium sidus may for ought we know to the contrary have
been emitted from the sun in more modern days and have been diverted
from their course and thus prevented from returning into the sun by
their approach to some of the older planets which is somewhat
countenanced by the opinion several philosophers have maintained that
the quantity of matter of the sun has decreased dr halley observed
that by comparing the proportion which the periodical time of the moon
bore to that of the sun in former times with the proportion between
them at present that the moon is found to be somewhat accelerated in
respect to the sun pembertons view of sir isaac newton p 247 and so
large is the body of this mighty luminary that all the planets thus
thrown out of it would make scarcely any perceptible diminution of it
as mentioned above the cavity mentioned above as measured by dr
wilson of 4000 miles in depth not penetrating an hundredth part of the
suns semidiameter and yet as its width was many times greater than
its depth was large enough to contain a greater body than our
terrestrial world
i do not mean to conceal that from the laws of gravity unfolded by sir
isaac newton supposing the sun to be a sphere and to have no
progressive motion and not liable itself to be disturbed by the
supposed projection of the planets from it that such planets must
return into the sun the late rev william ludlam of leicester whose
genius never met with reward equal to its merits in a letter to me
dated january 1787 after having shewn as mentioned above that
planets so projected from the sun would return to it adds that a body
as large as the moon so projected would disturb the motion of the earth
in its orbit is certain but the calculation of such disturbing forces
is difficult the body in some circumstances might become a satellite
and both move round their common centre of gravity and that centre be
carried in an annual orbit round the sun
there are other circumstances which might have concurred at the time of
such supposed explosions which would render this idea not impossible
1 the planets might be thrown out of the sun at the time the sun itself
was rising from chaos and be attracted by other suns in their vicinity
rising at the same time out of chaos which would prevent them from
returning into the sun 2 the new planet in its course or ascent from
the sun might explode and eject a satellite or perhaps more than one
and thus by its course being affected might not return into the sun 3
if more planets were ejected at the same time from the sun they might
attract and disturb each others course at the time they left the body of
the sun or very soon afterwards when they would be so much nearer each
other

from having observed that many of the highest mountains of the world
consist of limestone replete with shells and that these mountains bear
the marks of having been lifted up by subterraneous fires from the
interior parts of the globe and as limestone replete with shells is
found at the bottom of many of our deepest mines some philosophers have
concluded that the nucleus of the earth was for many ages covered with
water which was peopled with its adapted animals that the shells and
bones of these animals in a long series of time produced solid strata in
the ocean surrounding the original nucleus
these strata consist of the accumulated exuviae of shellfish the
animals perished age after age but their shells remained and in
progression of time produced the amazing quantities of limestone which
almost cover the earth other marine animals called coralloids raised
walls and even mountains by the congeries of their calcareous
habitations these perpendicular corralline rocks make some parts of the
southern ocean highly dangerous as appears in the journals of capt
cook from contemplating the immense strata of limestone both in
respect to their extent and thickness formed from these shells of
animals philosophers have been led to conclude that much of the water
of the sea has been converted into calcareous earth by passing through
their organs of digestion the formation of calcareous earth seems more
particularly to be an animal process as the formation of clay belongs to
the vegetable economy thus the shells of crabs and other testaceous
fish are annually reproduced from the mucous membrane beneath them the
shells of eggs are first a mucous membrane and the calculi of the
kidneys and those found in all other parts of our system which sometimes
contain calcareous earth seem to originate from inflamed membranes the
bones themselves consist of calcareous earth united with the phosphoric
or animal acid which may be separated by dissolving the ashes of
calcined bones in the nitrous acid the various secretions of animals
as their saliva and urine abound likewise with calcareous earth as
appears by the incrustations about the teeth and the sediments of urine
it is probable that animal mucus is a previous process towards the
formation of calcareous earth and that all the calcareous earth in the
world which is seen in limestones marbles spars alabasters marls
which make up the greatest part of the earths crust as far as it has
yet been penetrated have been formed originally by animal and
vegetable bodies from the mass of water and that by these means the
solid part of the terraqueous globe has perpetually been in an
increasing state and the water perpetually in a decreasing one
after the mountains of shells and other recrements of aquatic animals
were elevated above the water the upper heaps of them were gradually
dissolved by rains and dews and oozing through were either perfectly
crystallized in smaller cavities and formed calcareous spar or were
imperfectly crystallized on the roofs of larger cavities and produced
stalactes or mixing with other undissolved shells beneath them formed
marbles which were more or less crystallized and more or less pure or
lastly after being dissolved the water was exhaled from them in such a
manner that the external parts became solid and forming an arch
prevented the internal parts from approaching each other so near as to
become solid and thus chalk was produced i have specimens of chalk
formed at the root of several stalactites and in their central parts
and of other stalactites which are hollow like quills from a similar
cause viz from the external part of the stalactite hardening first by
its evaporation and thus either attracting the internal dissolved
particles to the crust or preventing them from approaching each other
so as to form a solid body of these i saw many hanging from the arched
roof of a cellar under the high street in edinburgh
if this dissolved limestone met with vitriolic acid it was converted
into alabaster parting at the same time with its fixable air if it met
with the fluor acid it became fluor if with the siliceous acid flint
and when mixed with clay and sand or either of them acquires the name
of marl and under one or other of these forms composes a great part of
the solid globe of the earth
another mode in which limestone appears is in the form of round
granulated particles but slightly cohering together of this kind a bed
extends over lincoln heath perhaps twenty miles long by ten wide the
form of this calcareous sand its angles having been rubbed off and the
flatness of its bed evinces that that part of the country was so formed
under water the particles of sand having thus been rounded like all
other rounded pebbles this round form of calcareous sand and of other
larger pebbles is produced under water partly by their being more or
less soluble in water and hence the angular parts become dissolved
first by their exposing a larger surface to the action of the
menstruum and secondly from their attrition against each other by the
streams or tides for a great length of time successively as they were
collected and perhaps when some of them had not acquired their hardest
state
this calcareous sand has generally been called kettonstone and believed
to resemble the spawn of fish it has acquired a form so much rounder
than siliceous sand from its being of so much softer a texture and also
much more soluble in water there are other soft calcareous stones
called tupha which are deposited from water on mosses as at matlock
from which moss it is probable the water may receive something which
induces it the readier to part with its earth
in some limestones the living animals seem to have been buried as well
as their shells during some great convulsion of nature these shells
contain a black coaly substance within them in others some phlogiston
or volatile alcali from the bodies of the dead animals remains mixed
with the stone which is then called liverstone as it emits a
sulphurous smell on being struck and there is a stratum about six
inches thick extends a considerable way over the iron ore at wingerworth
near chesterfield in derbyshire which seems evidently to have been
formed from the shells of freshwater muscles
there is however another source of calcareous earth besides the aquatic
one above described and that is from the recrements of land animals and
vegetables as found in marls which consist of various mixtures of
calcareous earth sand and clay all of them perhaps principally from
vegetable origin
dr hutton is of opinion that the rocks of marble have been softened by
fire into a fluid mass which he thinks under immense pressure might be
done without the escape of their carbonic acid or fixed air edinb
transact vol i if this ingenious idea be allowed it might account for
the purity of some white marbles as during their fluid state there
might be time for their partial impurities whether from the bodies of
the animals which produced the shells or from other extraneous matter
either to sublime to the uppermost part of the stratum or to subside to
the lowermost part of it as a confirmation of this theory of dr
huttons it may be added that some calcareous stones are found mixed
with lime and have thence lost a part of their fixed air or carbonic
gas as the bathstone and on that account hardens on being exposed to
the air and mixed with sulphur produces calcareous liver of sulphur

where woods have repeatedly grown and perished morasses are in process
of time produced and by their long roots fill up the interstices till
the whole becomes for many yards deep a mass of vegetation this fact is
curiously verified by an account given many years ago by the earl of
cromartie of which the following is a short abstract
in the year 1651 the earl of cromartie being then nineteen years of age
saw a plain in the parish of lockburn covered over with a firm standing
wood which was so old that not only the trees had no green leaves upon
them but the bark was totally thrown off which he was there informed by
the old countrymen was the universal manner in which firwoods
terminated and that in twenty or thirty years the trees would cast
themselves up by the roots about fifteen years after he had occasion to
travel the same way and observed that there was not a tree nor the
appearance of a root of any of them but in their place the whole plain
where the wood stood was covered with a flat green moss or morass and
on asking the country people what was become of the wood he was informed
that no one had been at the trouble to carry it away but that it had
all been overturned by the wind that the trees lay thick over each
other and that the moss or bog had overgrown the whole timber which
they added was occasioned by the moisture which came down from the high
hills above it and stagnated upon the plain and that nobody could yet
pass over it which however his lordship was so incautious as to attempt
and slipt up to the armpits before the year 1699 that whole piece of
ground was become a solid moss wherein the peasants then dug turf or
peat which however was not yet of the best sort philos trans no

morasses in great length of time undergo variety of changes first by
elutriation and afterwards by fermentation and the consequent heat 1
by water perpetually oozing through them the most soluble parts are
first washed away as the essential salts these together with the salts
from animal recrements are carried down the rivers into the sea where
all of them seem to decompose each other except the marine salt hence
the ashes of peat contain little or no vegetable alcali and are not used
in the countries where peat constitutes the fuel of the lower people
for the purpose of washing linen the second thing which is always seen
oozing from morasses is iron in solution which produces chalybeate
springs from whence depositions of ochre and variety of iron ores the
third elutriation seems to consist of vegetable acid which by means
unknown appears to be converted into all other acids 1 into marine and
nitrous acids as mentioned above 2 into vitriolic acid which is found
in some morasses so plentifully as to preserve the bodies of animals
from putrefaction which have been buried in them and this acid carried
away by rain and dews and meeting with calcareous earth produces gypsum
or alabaster with clay it produces alum and deprived of its vital air
produces sulphur 3 fluor acid which being washed away and meeting with
calcareous earth produces fluor or cubic spar 4 the siliceous acid
which seems to have been disseminated in great quantity either by
solution in water or by solution in air and appears to have produced
the sand in the sea uniting with calcareous earth previously dissolved
in that element from which were afterwards formed some of the grit
stone rocks by means of a siliceous or calcareous cement by its union
with the calcareous earth of the morass other strata of siliceous sand
have been produced and by the mixture of this with clay and lime arose
the beds of marl
in other circumstances probably where less moisture has prevailed
morasses seem to have undergone a fermentation as other vegetable
matter new hay for instance is liable to do from the great quantity of
sugar it contains from the great heat thus produced in the lower parts
of immense beds of morass the phlogistic part or oil or asphaltum
becomes distilled and rising into higher strata becomes again condensed
forming coalbeds of greater or less purity according to their greater
or less quantity of inflammable matter at the same time the clay beds
become purer or less so as the phlogistic part is more or less
completely exhaled from them though coal and clay are frequently
produced in this manner yet i have no doubt but that they are likewise
often produced by elutriation in situations on declivities the clay is
washed away down into the valleys and the phlogistic part or coal left
behind this circumstance is seen in many valleys near the beds of
rivers which are covered recently by a whitish impure clay called
waterclay see note xix xx and xxiii
lord cromartie has furnished another curious observation on morasses in
the paper above referred to in a moss near the town of eglin in murray
though there is no river or water which communicates with the moss yet
for three or four feet of depth in the moss there are little shellfish
resembling oysters with living fish in them in great quantities though
no such fish are found in the adjacent rivers nor even in the water
pits in the moss but only in the solid substance of the moss this
curious fact not only accounts for the shells sometimes found on the
surface of coals and in the clay above them but also for a thin
stratum of shells which sometimes exists over ironore

as iron is formed near the surface of the earth it becomes exposed to
streams of water and of air more than most other metallic bodies and
thence becomes combined with oxygene or vital air and appears very
frequently in its calciform state as in variety of ochres manganese
and zinc and sometimes lead are also found near the surface of the
earth and on that account become combined with vital air and are
exhibited in their calciform state
the avidity with which iron unites with oxygene or vital air in which
process much heat is given out from the combining materials is shewn by
a curious experiment of m ingenhouz a fine iron wire twisted spirally
is fixed to a cork on the point of the spire is fixed a match made of
agaric dipped in solution of nitre the match is then ignited and the
wire with the cork put immediately into a bottle full of vital air the
match first burns vividly and the iron soon takes fire and consumes
with brilliant sparks till it is reduced to small brittle globules
gaining an addition of about one third of its weight by its union with
vital air annales de chymie trait de chimie per lavoisier c iii
                                 steel
it is probably owing to a total deprivation of vital air which it holds
with so great avidity that iron on being kept many hours or days in
ignited charcoal becomes converted into steel and thence acquires the
faculty of being welded when red hot long before it melts and also the
power of becoming hard when immersed in cold water both which i suppose
depend on the same cause that is on its being a worse conductor of
heat than other metals and hence the surface both acquires heat much
sooner and loses it much sooner than the internal parts of it in this
circumstance resembling glass
when steel is made very hot and suddenly immerged in very cold water
and moved about in it the surface of the steel becomes cooled first
and thus producing a kind of case or arch over the internal part
prevents that internal part from contracting quite so much as it
otherwise would do whence it becomes brittler and harder like the
glassdrops called prince ruperts drops which are made by dropping
melted glass into cold water this idea is countenanced by the
circumstance that hardened steel is specifically lighter than steel
which is more gradually cooled nicholsons chemistry p 313 why the
brittleness and hardness of steel or glass should keep pace or be
companions to each other may be difficult to conceive
when a steel spring is forcibly bent till it break it requires less
power to bend it through the first inch than the second and less
through the second than the third the same i suppose to happen if a
wire be distended till it break by hanging weights to it this shews
that the particles may be forced from each other to a small distance by
less power than is necessary to make them recede to a greater distance
in this circumstance perhaps the attraction of cohesion differs from
that of gravitation which exerts its power inversely as the squares of
the distance hence it appears that if the innermost particles of a
steel bar by cooling the external surface first are kept from
approaching each other so nearly as they otherwise would do that they
become in the situation of the particles on the convex side of a bent
spring and can not be forced further from each other except by a
greater power than would have been necessary to have made them recede
thus far and secondly that if they be forced a little further from
each other they separate this may be exemplified by laying two magnetic
needles parallel to each other the contrary poles together then
drawing them longitudinally from each other they will slide with small
force till they begin to separate and will then require a stronger
force to really separate them hence it appears that hardness and
brittleness depend on the same circumstance that the particles are
removed to a greater distance from each other and thus resist any power
more forcibly which is applied to displace them further this
constitutes hardness and secondly if they are displaced by such
applied force they immediately separate and this constitutes
brittleness
steel may be thus rendered too brittle for many purposes on which
account artists have means of softening it again by exposing it to
certain degrees of heat for the construction of different kinds of
tools which is called tempering it some artists plunge large tools in
very cold water as soon as they are compleatly ignited and moving it
about take it out as soon as it ceases to be luminous beneath the
water it is then rubbed quickly with a file or on sand to clean the
surface the heat which the metal still retains soon begins to produce a
succession of colours if a hard temper be required the piece is dipped
again and stirred about in cold water as soon as the yellow tinge
appears if it be cooled when the purple tinge appears it becomes fit
for gravers tools used in working upon metals if cooled while blue it
is proper for springs nicholsons chemistry p 313 keirs chemical

                       modern production of iron
the recent production of iron is evinced from the chalybeate waters
which flow from morasses which lie upon gravelbeds and which must
therefore have produced iron after those gravelbeds were raised out of
the sea on the south side of the road between cheadle and okeymoor in
staffordshire yellow stains of iron are seen to penetrate the gravel
from a thin morass on its surface there is a fissure eight or ten feet
wide in a gravelbed on the eastern side of the hollow road ascending
the hill about a mile from trentham in staffordshire leading toward
drayton in shropshire which fissure is filled up with nodules of iron
ore a bank of sods is now raised against this fissure to prevent the
loose iron nodules from falling into the turnpike road and thus this
natural curiosity is at present concealed from travellers a similar
fissure in a bed of marl and filled up with iron nodules and with some
large pieces of flint is seen on the eastern side of the hollow road
ascending the hill from the turnpike house about a mile from derby in
the road towards burton and another such fissure filled with iron
nodes appears about half a mile from newtonsolney in derbyshire in
the road to burton near the summit of the hill these collections of
iron and of flint must have been produced posterior to the elevation of
all those hills and were thence evidently of vegetable or animal
origin to which should be added that iron is found in general in beds
either near the surface of the earth or stratified with clay coals or
argillaceous grit which are themselves productions of the modern world
that is from the recrements of vegetables and airbreathing animals
not only iron but manganese calamy and even copper and lead appear in
some instances to have been of recent production iron and manganese are
detected in all vegetable productions and it is probable other metallic
bodies might be found to exist in vegetable or animal matters if we had
tests to detect them in very minute quantities manganese and calamy are
found in beds like iron near the surface of the earth and in a
calciform state which countenances their modern production the recent
production of calamy one of the ores of zinc appears from its
frequently incrusting calcareous spar in its descent from the surface of
the earth into the uppermost fissures of the limestone mountains of
derbyshire that the calamy has been carried by its solution or
diffusion in water into these cavities and not by its ascent from below
in form of steam is evinced from its not only forming a crust over the
dogtooth spar but by its afterwards dissolving or destroying the sparry
crystal i have specimens of calamy in the form of dogtooth spar two
inches high which are hollow and stand half an inch above the
diminished sparry crystal on which they were formed like a sheath a
great deal too big for it this seems to shew that this process was
carried on in water otherwise after the calamy had incrusted its spar
and dissolved its surface so as to form a hollow cavern over it it
could not act further upon it except by the interposition of some
medium as these spars and calamy are formed in the fissures of
mountains they must both have been formed after the elevation of those
mountains
in respect to the recent production of copper it was before observed in
note on canto ii l 394 that the summit of the gritstone mountain at
hawkstone in shropshire is tinged with copper which from the
appearance of the blue stains seems to have descended to the parts of
the rock beneath i have a calciform ore of copper consisting of the
hollow crusts of cubic cells which has evidently been formed on
crystals of fluor which it has eroded in the same manner as the calamy
erodes the calcareous crystals from whence may be deduced in the same
manner the aqueous solution or diffusion as well as the recent
production of this calciform ore of copper
lead in small quantities is sometimes found in the fissures of coal
beds which fissures are previously covered with spar and sometimes in
nodules of ironore of the former i have a specimen from near caulk in
derbyshire and of the latter from colebrook dale in shropshire though
all these facts shew that some metallic bodies are formed from vegetable
or animal recrements as iron and perhaps manganese and calamy all
which are found near the surface of the earth yet as the other metals
are found only in fissures of rocks which penetrate to unknown depths
they may be wholly or in part produced by ascending steams from
subterraneous fires as mentioned in note on canto ii l 398
                        septaria of ironstone
over some lime works at walsall in staffordshire i observed some years
ago a stratum of iron earth about six inches thick full of very large
cavities these cavities were evidently produced when the material
passed from a semifluid state into a solid one as the frit of the
potters or a mixture of clay and water is liable to crack in drying
which is owing to the further contraction of the internal part after
the crust is become hard these hollows are liable to receive extraneous
matter as i believe gypsum and sometimes spar and even lead a
curious specimen of the last was presented to me by mr darby of
colebrook dale which contains in its cavity some ounces of leadore
but there are other septaria of ironstone which seem to have had a very
different origin their cavities having been formed in cooling or
congealing from an ignited state as is ingeniously deduced by dr
hutton from their internal structure edinb transact vol i p 246
the volcanic origin of these curious septaria appears to me to be
further evinced from their form and the places where they are found
they consist of oblate spheroids and are found in many parts of the
earth totally detached from the beds in which they lie as at east
lothian in scotland two of these which now lie before me were found
with many others immersed in argillaceous shale or shiver surrounded by
broken limestone mountains at bradbourn near ashbourn in derbyshire and
were presented to me by mr buxton a gentleman of that town one of
these is about fifteen inches in its equatorial diameter and about six
inches in its polar one and contains beautiful starlike septaria
incrusted and in part filled with calcareous spar the other is about
eight inches in its equatorial diameter and about four inches in its
polar diameter and is quite solid but shews on its internal surface
marks of different colours as if a beginning separation had taken
place now as these septaria contain fifty per cent of iron according
to dr hutton they would soften or melt into a semifluid globule by
subterraneous fire by less heat than the limestone in their vicinity
and if they were ejected through a hole or fissure would gain a circular
motion along with their progressive one by their greater friction or
adhesion to one side of the hole this whirling motion would produce the
oblate spheroidical form which they possess and which as far as i know
can not in any other way be accounted for they would then harden in the
air as they rose into the colder parts of the atmosphere and as they
descended into so soft a material as shale or shiver their forms would
not be injured in their fall and their presence in materials so
different from themselves becomes accounted for
about the tropics of the large septarium above mentioned are circular
eminent lines such as might have been left if it had been coarsely
turned in a lathe these lines seem to consist of a fluid matter which
seems to have exsuded in circular zones as their edges appear blunted
or retracted and the septarium seems to have split easier in such
sections parallel to its equator now as the crust would first begin to
cool and harden after its ejection in a semifluid state and the
equatorial diameter would become gradually enlarged as it rose in the
air the internal parts being softer would slide beneath the polar
crust which might crack and permit part of the semifluid to exsude and
it is probable the adhesion would thus become less in sections parallel
to the equator which further confirms this idea of the production of
these curious septaria a newcast cannon ball redhot with its crust
only solid if it were shot into the air would probably burst in its
passage as it would consist of a more fluid material than these
septaria and thus by discharging a shower of liquid iron would produce
more dreadful combustion if used in war than could be effected by a
ball which had been cooled and was heated again since in the latter
case the ball could not have its internal parts made hotter than the
crust of it without first loosing its form

                          1 siliceous rocks
the great masses of siliceous sand which lie in rocks upon the beds of
limestone or which are stratified with clay coal and ironore are
evidently produced in the decomposition of vegetable or animal matters
as explained in the note on morasses hence the impressions of vegetable
roots and even whole trees are often found in sandstone as well as in
coals and ironore in these sandrocks both the siliceous acid and the
calcareous base seem to be produced from the materials of the morass
for though the presence of a siliceous acid and of a calcareous base
have not yet been separately exhibited from flints yet from the analogy
of flint to fluor and gypsum and marble and from the conversion of
the latter into flint there can be little doubt of their existence
these siliceous sandrocks are either held together by a siliceous
cement or have a greater or less portion of clay in them which in some
acts as a cement to the siliceous crystals but in others is in such
great abundance that in burning them they become an imperfect porcelain
and are then used to repair the roads as at chesterfield in derbyshire
these are called argillaceous grit by mr kirwan in other places a
calcareous matter cements the crystals together and in other places the
siliceous crystals lie in loose strata under the marl in the form of
white sand as at normington about a mile from derby
the lowest beds of siliceous sandstone produced from morasses seem to
obtain their acid from the morass and their calcareous base from the
limestone on which it rests these beds possess a siliceous cement and
from their greater purity and hardness are used for course grinding
stones and scyth stones and are situated on the edges of limestone
countries having lost the other strata of coals or clay or iron
which were originally produced above them such are the sandrocks
incumbent on limestone near matlock in derbyshire as these siliceous
sandrocks contain no marine productions scattered amongst them they
appear to have been elevated torn to pieces and many fragments of them
scattered over the adjacent country by explosions from fires within the
morass from which they have been formed and which dissipated every
thing inflammable above and beneath them except some stains of iron
with which they are in some places spotted if these sandrocks had been
accumulated beneath the sea and elevated along with the beds of
limestone on which they rest some vestiges of marine shells either in
their siliceous or calcareous state must have been discerned amongst
them
                          2 siliceous trees
in many of these sandrocks are found the impressions of vegetable
roots which seem to have been the most unchangeable parts of the plant
as shells and sharks teeth are found in chalkbeds from their being the
most unchangeable parts of the animal in other instances the wood
itself is penetrated and whole trees converted into flint specimens of
which i have by me from near coventry and from a gravelpit in
shropshire near childs archal in the road to drayton other polished
specimens of vegetable flints abound in the cabinets of the curious
which evidently shew the concentric circles of woody fibres and their
interstices filled with whiter siliceous matter with the branching off
of the knots when cut horizontally and the parallel lines of wood when
cut longitudinally with uncommon beauty and variety of these i possess
some beautiful specimens which were presented to me by the earl of
uxbridge
the colours of these siliceous vegetables are generally brown from the
iron i suppose or manganese which induced them to crystallize or to
fuse more easily some of the cracks of the wood in drying are filled
with white flint or calcedony and others of them remain hollow lined
with innumerable small crystals tinged with iron which i suppose had a
share in converting their calcareous matter into siliceous crystals
because the crystals called peakdiamonds are always found bedded in an
ochreous earth and those called bristolstones are situated on
limestone coloured with iron mr f french presented me with a
congeries of siliceous crystals which he gathered on the crater as he
supposes of an extinguished volcano at cromach water in cumberland the
crystals are about an inch high in the shape of dogtooth or calcareous
spar covered with a dark ferruginous matter the bed on which they rest
is about an inch in thickness and is stained with iron on its
undersurface this curious fossil shews the transmutation of calcareous
earth into siliceous as much as the siliceous shells which abound in
the cabinets of the curious there may sometime be discovered in this
age of science a method of thus impregnating wood with liquid flint
which would produce pillars for the support and tiles for the covering
of houses which would be uninflammable and endure as long as the earth
beneath them
that some siliceous productions have been in a fluid state without much
heat at the time of their formation appears from the vegetable flints
above described not having quite lost their organized appearance from
shells and coralloids and entrochi being converted into flint without
loosing their form from the bason of calcedony round giesar in iceland
and from the experiment of mr bergman who obtained thirteen regular
formed crystals by suffering the powder of quartz to remain in a vessel
with fluor acid for two years these crystals were about the size of
small peas and were not so hard as quartz opusc de terr silice p
33 mr achard procured both calcareous and siliceous crystals one from
calcareous earth and the other from the earth of alum both dissolved
in water impregnated with fixed air the water filtrating very slowly
through a porous bottom of baked clay see journal de physique for
january 1778
                   3 agates onyxes scotspebbles
in small cavities of these sandrocks i am informed the beautiful
siliceous nodules are found which are called scotspebbles and which
on being cut in different directions take the names of agates onyxes
sardonyxes c according to the colours of the lines or strata which
they exhibit some of the nodules are hollow and filled with crystals
others have a nucleus of less compact siliceous matter which is
generally white surrounded with many concentric strata coloured with
iron and other alternate strata of white agate or calcedony sometimes
to the number of thirty
i think these nodules bear evident marks of their having been in perfect
fusion by either heat alone or by water and heat under great pressure
according to the ingenious theory of dr hutton but i do not imagine
that they were injected into cavities from materials from without but
that some vegetables or parts of vegetables containing more iron or
manganese than others facilitated the compleat fusion thus destroying
the vestiges of vegetable organization which were conspicuous in the
siliceous trees above mentioned some of these nodules being hollow and
lined with crystals and others containing a nucleus of white siliceous
matter of a looser texture shew they were composed of the materials
then existing in the cavity which consisting before of loose sand must
take up less space when fused into a solid mass
these siliceous nodules resemble the nodules of ironstone mentioned in
note on canto ii l 183 in respect to their possessing a great number
of concentric spheres coloured generally with iron but they differ in
this circumstance that the concentric spheres generally obey the form
of the external crust and in their not possessing a chalybeate nucleus
the stalactites formed on the roofs of caverns are often coloured in
concentric strata by their coats being spread over each other at
different times and some of them as the cupreous ones possess great
beauty from this formation but as these are necessarily more or less of
a cylindrical or conic form the nodules or globular flints above
described cannot have been constructed in this manner to what law of
nature then is to be referred the production of such numerous concentric
spheres i suspect to the law of congelation
when salt and water are exposed to severe frosty air the salt is said
to be precipitated as the water freezes that is as the heat in which
it was dissolved is withdrawn where the experiment is tried in a bowl
or bason this may be true as the surface freezes first and the salt
is found at the bottom but in a fluid exposed in a thin phial i found
by experiment that the extraneous matter previously dissolved by the
heat in the mixture was not simply set at liberty to subside but was
detruded or pushed backward as the ice was produced the experiment was
this about two ounces of a solution of blue vitriol were accidentally
frozen in a thin phial the glass was cracked and fallen to pieces the
ice was dissolved and i found a pillar of blue vitriol standing erect
on the bottom of the broken bottle nor is this power of congelation
more extraordinary than that by its powerful and sudden expansion it
should burst iron shells and coehorns or throw out the plugs with which
the water was secured in them above one hundred and thirty yards
according to the experiments at quebec by major williams edinb
transact vol ii p 23
in some siliceous nodules which now lie before me the external crust
for about the tenth of an inch consists of white agate in others it is
much thinner and in some much thicker corresponding with this crust
there are from twenty to thirty superincumbent strata of alternately
darker and lighter colour whence it appears that the external crust as
it cooled or froze propelled from it the iron or manganese which was
dissolved in it this receded till it had formed an arch or vault strong
enough to resist its further protrusion then the next inner sphere or
stratum as it cooled or froze propelled forwards its colouring matter
in the same manner till another arch or sphere produced sufficient
resistance to this frigoriscent expulsion some of them have detruded
their colouring matter quite to the centre the rings continuing to
become darker as they are nearer it in others the chalybeate arch seems
to have stopped half an inch from the centre and become thicker by
having attracted to itself the irony matter from the white nucleus
owing probably to its cooling less precipitately in the central parts
than at the surface of the pebble
a similar detrusion of a marly matter in circular arches or vaults
obtains in the salt mines in cheshire from whence dr hutton very
ingeniously concludes that the salt must have been liquified by heat
which would seem to be much confirmed by the above theory edinb
transact vol i p 244
i cannot conclude this account of scotspebbles without observing that
some of them on being sawed longitudinally asunder seem still to
possess some vestiges of the cylindrical organization of vegetables
others possess a nucleus of white agate much resembling some bulbous
roots with their concentric coats or the knots in elmroots or crab
trees some of these i suppose were formed in the manner above
explained during the congelation of masses of melted flint and iron
others may have been formed from a vegetable nucleus and retain some
vestiges of the organization of the plant
                          4 sand of the sea
the great abundance of siliceous sand at the bottom of the ocean may in
part be washed down from the siliceous rocks above described but in
general i suppose it derives its acid only from the vegetable and animal
matter of morasses which is carried down by floods or by the
atmosphere and becomes united in the sea with its calcareous base from
shells and coralloids and thus assumes its crystalline form at the
bottom of the ocean and is there intermixed with gravel or other
matters washed from the mountains in its vicinity
                        5 chert or petrosilex
the rocks of marble are often alternately intermixed with strata of
chert or coarse flint and this in beds from one to three feet thick
as at ham and matlock or of less than the tenth of an inch in
thickness as a mile or two from bakewell in the road to buxton it is
difficult to conceive in what manner ten or twenty strata of either
limestone or flint of different shades of white and black could be
laid quite regularly over each other from sediments or precipitations
from the sea it appears to me much easier to comprehend by supposing
with dr hutton that both the solid rocks of marble and the flint had
been fused by great heat or by heat and water under immense
pressure by its cooling or congealing the colouring matter might be
detruded and form parallel or curvilinean strata as above explained
the colouring matter both of limestone and flint was probably owing to
the flesh of peculiar animals as well as the siliceous acid which
converted some of the limestone into flint or to some strata of shell
fish having been overwhelmed when alive with new materials while others
dying in their natural situations would lose their fleshy parts either
by its putrid solution in the water or by its being eaten by other sea
insects i have some calcareous fossil shells which contain a black
coaly matter in them which was evidently the body of the animal and
others of the same kind filled with spar instead of it the labradore
stone has i suppose its colours from the nacre or motherpearl shells
from which it was probably produced and there is a stratum of
calcareous matter about six or eight inches thick at wingerworth in
derbyshire over the ironbeds which is replete with shells of fresh
water muscles and evidently obtains its dark colour from them as
mentioned in note xvi many nodules of flint resemble in colour as well
as in form the shell of the echinus or seaurchin others resemble some
coralloids both in form and colour and m arduini found in the monte de
pancrasio red flints branching like corals from whence they seem to
have obtained both their form and their colour ferbers travels in
italy p 42
                   6 nodules of flint in chalkbeds
as the nodules of flint found in chalkbeds possess no marks of having
been rounded by attrition or solution i conclude that they have gained
their form as well as their dark colour from the flesh of the shellfish
from which they had their origin but which have been so compleatly
fused by heat or heat and water as to obliterate all vestiges of the
shell in the same manner as the nodules of agate and onyx were produced
from parts of vegetables but which had been so completely fused as to
obliterate all marks of their organization or as many ironnodules have
obtained their form and origin from peculiar vegetables
some nodules in chalkbeds consist of shells of echini filled up with
chalk the animal having been dissolved away by putrescence in water or
eaten by other seainsects other shells of echini in which i suppose
the animals body remained are converted into flint but still retain
the form of the shell others i suppose as above being more completely
fused have become flint coloured by the animal flesh but without the
exact form either of the flesh or shell of the animal many of these are
hollow within and lined with crystals like the scotspebbles above
described but as the colouring matter of animal bodies differs but
little from each other compared with those of vegetables these flints
vary less in their colours than those above mentioned at the same time
as they cooled in concentric spheres like the scotspebbles they often
possess faint rings of colours and always break in conchoide forms
like them
this idea of the production of nodules of flint in chalkbeds is
countenanced from the iron which generally appears as these flints
become decomposed by the air which by uniting with the iron in their
composition reduces it from a vitrescent state to that of calx and thus
renders it visible and secondly by there being no appearance in chalk
beds of a string or pipe of siliceous matter connecting one nodule with
another which must have happened if the siliceous matter or its acid
had been injected from without according to the idea of dr hutton and
thirdly because many of them have very large cavities at their centres
which should not have happened had they been formed by the injection of
a material from without
when shells or chalk are thus converted from calcareous to siliceous
matter by the flesh of the animal the new flint being heavier than the
shell or chalk occupies less space than the materials it was produced
from this is the cause of frequent cavities within them where the
whole mass has not been completely fused and pressed together in
derbyshire there are masses of coralloid and other shells which have
become siliceous and are thus left with large vacuities sometimes
within and sometimes on the outside of the remaining form of the shell
like the french millstones and i suppose might serve the same purpose
the gravel of the derwent is full of specimens of this kind
since writing the above i have received a very ingenious account of
chalkbeds from dr menish of chelmsford he distinguishes chalkbeds
into three kinds such as have been raised from the sea with little
disturbance of their strata as the cliffs of dover and margate which
he terms intire chalk another state of chalk is where it has suffered
much derangement as the banks of the thames at gravesend and dartford
and a third state where fragments of chalk have been rounded by water
which he terms alluvial chalk in the first of these situations of
chalk he observes that the flint lies in strata horizontally generally
in distinct nodules but that he has observed two instances of solid
plates or strata of flint from an inch to two inches in thickness
interposed between the chalkbeds one of these is in a chalkbank by
the road side at berkhamstead the other in a bank on the road from
chatham leading to canterbury dr menish has further observed that
many of the echini are crushed in their form and yet filled with flint
which has taken the form of the crushed shell and that though many
flint nodules are hollow yet that in some echini the siliceum seems to
have enlarged as it passed from a fluid to a solid state as it swells
out in a protuberance at the mouth and anus of the shell and that
though these shells are so filled with flint yet that in many places the
shell itself remains calcareous these strata of nodules and plates of
flint seem to countenance their origin from the flesh of a stratum of
animals which perished by some natural violence and were buried in
their shells
                      7 angles of siliceous sand
in many rocks of siliceous sand the particles retain their angular form
and in some beds of loose sand of which there is one of considerable
purity a few yards beneath the marl at normington about a mile south of
derby other siliceous sands have had their angles rounded off like the
pebbles in gravelbeds these seem to owe their globular form to two
causes one to their attrition against each other when they may for
centuries have lain at the bottom of the sea or of rivers where they
may have been progressively accumulated and thus progressively at the
same time rubbed upon each other by the dashing of the water and where
they would be more easily rolled over each other by their gravity being
so much less than in air this is evidently now going on in the river
derwent for though there are no limestone rocks for ten or fifteen
miles above derby yet a great part of the rivergravel at derby
consists of limestone nodules whose angles are quite worn off in their
descent down the stream
there is however another cause which must have contributed to round the
angles both of calcareous and siliceous fragments and that is their
solubility in water calcareous earth is perpetually found suspended in
the waters which pass over it and the earth of flints was observed by
bergman to be contained in water in the proportion of one grain to a
gallon kirwans mineralogy p 107 in boiling water however it is
soluble in much greater proportion as appears from the siliceous earth
sublimed in the distillation of fluor acid in glass vessels and from
the basons of calcedony which surrounded the jets of hot water near
mount heccla in iceland troil on iceland it is probable most siliceous
sands or pebbles have at some ages of the world been long exposed to
aqueous steams raised by subterranean fires and if fragments of stone
were long immersed in a fluid menstrum their angular parts would be
first dissolved on account of their greater surface
many beds of siliceous gravel are cemented together by a siliceous
cement and are called breccia as the plumbpudding stones of
hartfordshire and the walls of a subterraneous temple excavated by mr
curzon at hagley near rugely in staffordfshire these may have been
exposed to great heat as they were immersed in water which water under
great pressure of superincumbent materials may have been rendered red
hot as in papins digester and have thus possessed powers of solution
with which we are unacquainted
                       8 basaltes and granites
another source of siliceous stones is from the granite or basaltes or
porphyries which are of different hardnesses according to the materials
of their composition or to the fire they have undergone such are the
stones of arthurshill near edinburgh of the giants causway in
ireland and of charnwood forest in leicestershire the uppermost
stratum of which last seems to have been cracked either by its
elevation or by its hastily cooling after ignition by the contact of
dews or snows and thus breaks into angular fragments such as the
streets of london are paved with or have had their angles rounded by
attrition or by partial solution and have thus formed the common paving
stones or bowlers as well as the gravel which is often rolled into
strata amid the siliceous sandbeds which are either formed or
collected in the sea
in what manner such a mass of crystallized matter as the giants causway
and similar columns of basaltes could have been raised without other
volcanic appearances may be a matter not easy to comprehend but there
is another power in nature besides that of expansile vapour which may
have raised some materials which have previously been in igneous or
aqueous solution and that is the act of congelation when the water in
the experiments above related of major williams had by congelation
thrown out the plugs from the bombshells a column of ice rose from the
hole of the bomb six or eight inches high other bodies i suspect
increase in bulk which crystallize in cooling as iron and typemetal i
remember pouring eight or ten pounds of melted brimstone into a pot to
cool and was surprized to see after a little time a part of the fluid
beneath break a hole in the congealed crust above it and gradually rise
into a promontory several inches high the basaltes has many marks of
fusion and of crystallization and may thence as well as many other
kinds of rocks as of spar marble petrosilex jasper c have been
raised by the power of congelation a power whose quantity has not yet
been ascertained and perhaps greater and more universal than that of
vapours expanded by heat these basaltic columns rise sometimes out of
mountains of granite itself as mentioned by dr beddoes phil
transact vol lxxx and as they seem to consist of similar materials
more completely fused there is still greater reason to believe them to
have been elevated in the cooling or crystallization of the mass see

the philosophers who have attended to the formation of the earth have
acknowledged two great agents in producing the various changes which the
terraqueous globe has undergone and these are water and fire some of
them have perhaps ascribed too much to one of these great agents of
nature and some to the other they have generally agreed that the
stratification of materials could only be produced from sediments or
precipitations which were previously mixed or dissolved in the sea and
that whatever effects were produced by fire were performed afterwards
there is however great difficulty in accounting for the universal
stratification of the solid globe of the earth in this manner since
many of the materials which appear in strata could not have been
suspended in water as the nodules of flint in chalkbeds the extensive
beds of shells and lastly the strata of coal clay sand and ironore
which in most coalcountries lie from five to seven times alternately
stratified over each other and none of them are soluble in water add
to this if a solution of them or a mixture of them in water could be
supposed the cause of that solution must cease before a precipitation
could commence
1 the great masses of lava under the various names of granite
porphyry toadstone moorstone rag and slate which constitute the
old world may have acquired the stratification which some of them
appear to possess by their having been formed by successive eruptions
of a fluid mass which at different periods of antient time arose from
volcanic shafts and covered each other the surface of the interior mass
of lava would cool and become solid before the superincumbent stratum
was poured over it to the same cause may be ascribed their different
compositions and textures which are scarcely the same in any two parts
of the world
2 the stratifications of the great masses of limestone which were
produced from seashells seem to have been formed by the different
times at which the innumerable shells were produced and deposited a
colony of echini or madrepores or cornua ammonis lived and perished
in one period of time in another a new colony of either similar or
different shells lived and died over the former ones producing a
stratum of more recent shell over a stratum of others which had began to
petrify or to become marble and thus from unknown depths to what are
now the summits of mountains the limestone is disposed in strata of
varying solidity and colour these have afterwards undergone variety of
changes by their solution and deposition from the water in which they
were immersed or from having been exposed to great heat under great
pressure according to the ingenious theory of dr hutton edinb
transact vol i see note xvi
3 in most of the coalcountries of this island there are from five to
seven beds of coal stratified with an equal number of beds though of
much greater thickness of clay and sandstone and occasionally of iron
ores in what manner to account for the stratification of these
materials seems to be a problem of greater difficulty philosophers have
generally supposed that they have been arranged by the currents of the
sea but considering their insolubility in water and their almost
similar specific gravity an accumulation of them in such distinct beds
from this cause is altogether inconceiveable though some coalcountries
bear marks of having been at some time immersed beneath the waves and
raised again by subterranean fires
the higher and lower parts of morasses were necessarily produced at
different periods of time see note xvii and would thus originally be
formed in strata of different ages for when an old wood perished and
produced a morass many centuries would elapse before another wood could
grow and perish again upon the same ground which would thus produce a
new stratum of morass over the other differing indeed principally in
its age and perhaps as the timber might be different in the
proportions of its component parts
now if we suppose the lowermost stratum of a morass become ignited like
fermenting hay after whatever could be carried away by solution in
water was gone what would happen certainly the inflammable part the
oil sulphur or bitumen would burn away and be evaporated in air and
the fixed parts would be left as clay lime and iron while some of
the calcareous earth would join with the siliceous acid and produce
sand or with the argillaceous earth and produce marl thence after
many centuries another bed would take fire but with less degree of
ignition and with a greater body of morass over it what then would
happen the bitumen and sulphur would rise and might become condensed
under an impervious stratum which might not be ignited and there form
coal of different purities according to its degree of fluidity which
would permit some of the clay to subside through it into the place from
which it was sublimed
some centuries afterwards another similar process might take place and
either thicken the coalbed or produce a new claybed or marl or
sand or deposit iron upon it according to the concomitant
circumstances above mentioned
i do not mean to contend that a few masses of some materials may not
have been rolled together by currents when the mountains were much more
elevated than at present and in consequence the rivers broader and more
rapid and the storms of rain and wind greater both in quantity and
force some gravelbeds may have been thus washed from the mountains
and some white clay washed from morasses into valleys beneath them and
some ochres of iron dissolved and again deposited by water and some
calcareous depositions from water as the bank for instance on which
stand the houses at matlockbath but these are of small extent or
consequence compared to the primitive rocks of granite or porpyhry which
form the nucleus of the earth or to the immense strata of limestone
which crust over the greatest part of this granite or porphyry or
lastly to the very extensive beds of clay marl sandstone coal and
iron which were probably for many millions of years the only parts of
our continents and islands which were then elevated above the level of
the sea and which on that account became covered with vegetation and
thence acquired their later or superincumbent strata which constitute
what some have termed the new world
there is another source of clay and that of the finest kind from
decomposed granite this is of a snowy white and mixed with mining
particles of mica of this kind is an earth from the country of
cherokees other kinds are from less pure lavas mr ferber asserts that
the sulphurous steams from mount vesuvius convert the lava into clay
the lavas of the antient solfatara volcano have been undoubtedly of a
vitreous nature and these appear at present argillaceous some
fragments of this lava are but half or at one side changed into clay
which either is viscid or ductile or hard and stoney clays by fire are
deprived of their coherent quality which cannot be restored to them by
pulverization nor by humectation but the sulphureous solfatara steams
restore it as may be easily observed on the broken pots wherein they
gather the sal ammoniac though very well baked and burnt at naples they
are mollified again by the acid steams into a viscid clay which keeps

the fine bright purples or rose colours which we see on china cups are

gives a purple but of a very different kind
in europe the application of gold to these purposes appears to be of
modern invention cassiuss discovery of the precipitate of gold by tin
and the use of that precipitate for colouring glass and enamels are now
generally known but though the precipitate with tin be more successful
in producing the ruby glass or the colourless glass which becomes red
by subsequent ignition the tin probably contributing to prevent the
gold from separating which it is very liable to do during the fusion
yet for enamels the precipitates made by alcaline salts answer equally
well and give a finer red the colour produced by the tin precipitate
being a bluish purple but with the others a rose red i am informed
that some of our best artists prefer aurum fulminans mixing it before
it has become dry with the white composition or enamel flux when once
it is divided by the other matter it is ground with great safety and
without the least danger of explosion whether moist or dry the colour
is remarkably improved and brought forth by long grinding which
accordingly makes an essential circumstance in the process
the precipitates of gold and the colcothar or other red preparations of
iron are called tender colours the heat must be no greater than is
just sufficient to make the enamel run upon the piece for if greater
the colours will be destroyed or changed to a different kind when the
vitreous matter has just become fluid it seems as if the coloured
metallic calx remained barely intermixed with it like a coloured
powder of exquisite tenuity suspended in water but by stronger fire the
calx is dissolved and metallic colours are altered by solution in
glass as well as in acids or alcalies
the saxon mines have till very lately almost exclusively supplied the
rest of europe with cobalt or rather with its preparations zaffre and
smalt for the exportation of the ore itself is there a capital crime
hungary spain sweden and some other parts of the continent are now
said to afford cobalts equal to the saxon and specimens have been
discovered in our own island both in cornwall and in scotland but
hitherto in no great quantity
calces of cobalt and of copper differ very materially from those above
mentioned in their application for colouring enamels in those the calx
has previously acquired the intended colour a colour which bears a red
heat without injury and all that remains is to fix it on the piece by a
vitreous flux but the blue colour of cobalt and the green or bluish
green of copper are produced by vitrification that is by solution
in the glass and a strong fire is necessary for their perfection these
calces therefore when mixed with the enamel flux are melted in
crucibles once or oftener and the deep coloured opake glass thence
resulting is ground into unpalpable powder and used for enamel one
part of either of these calces is put to ten sixteen or twenty parts
of the flux according to the depth of colour required the heat of the
enamel kiln is only a full red such as is marked on mr wedgwoods
thermometer 6 degrees it is therefore necessary that the flux be so
adjusted as to melt in that low heat the usual materials are flint or
flintglass with a due proportion of redled or borax or both and
sometimes a little tin calx to give opacity
kaolin is the name given by the chinese to their porcelain clay and
petuntse to the other ingredient in their china ware specimens of
both these have been brought into england and found to agree in quality
with some of our own materials kaolin is the very same with the clay
called in cornwall transcribers note word missing and the petuntse
is a granite similar to the cornish moorstone there are differences
both in the chinese petuntses and the english moorstones all of them
contain micaceous and quartzy particles in greater or less quantity
along with feltspat which last is the essential ingredient for the
porcelain manufactory the only injurious material commonly found in
them is iron which discolours the ware in proportion to its quantity
and which our moorstones are perhaps more frequently tainted with than
the chinese very fine porcelain has been made from english materials
but the nature of the manufacture renders the process precarious and the
profit hazardous for the semivitrification which constitutes
porcelain is necessarily accompanied with a degree of softness or
semifusion so that the vessels are liable to have their forms altered
in the kiln or to run together with any accidental augmentations of the
fire

the celebrated funereal vase long in possession of the barberini
family and lately purchased by the duke of portland for a thousand
guineas is about ten inches high and six in diameter in the broadest
part the figures are of most exquisite workmanship in bas relief of
white opake glass raised on a ground of deep blue glass which appears
black except when held against the light mr wedgwood is of opinion
from many circumstances that the figures have been made by cutting away
the external crust of white opake glass in the manner the finest
cameos have been produced and that it must thence have been the labour
of a great many years some antiquarians have placed the time of its
production many centuries before the christian aera as sculpture was
said to have been declining in respect to its excellence in the time of
alexander the great see an account of the barberini or portland vase by
m dhancarville and by mr wedgwood
many opinions and conjectures have been published concerning the figures
on this celebrated vase having carefully examined one of mr wedgwoods
beautiful copies of this wonderful production of art i shall add one
more conjecture to the number
mr wedgwood has well observed that it does not seem probable that the
portland vase was purposely made for the ashes of any particular person
deceased because many years must have been necessary for its
production hence it may be concluded that the subject of its
embellishments is not private history but of a general nature this
subject appears to me to be well chosen and the story to be finely
told and that it represents what in antient times engaged the attention
of philosophers poets and heroes i mean a part of the eleusinian
mysteries
these mysteries were invented in aegypt and afterwards transferred to
greece and flourished more particularly at athens which was at the
same time the seat of the fine arts they consisted of scenical
exhibitions representing and inculcating the expectation of a future
life after death and on this account were encouraged by the government
insomuch that the athenian laws punished a discovery of their secrets
with death dr warburton has with great learning and ingenuity shewn
that the descent of aeneas into hell described in the sixth book of
virgil is a poetical account of the representations of the future state
in the eleusinian mysteries divine legation vol i p 210
and though some writers have differed in opinion from dr warburton on
this subject because virgil has introduced some of his own heroes into
the elysian fields as deiphobus palinurus and dido in the same
manner as homer had done before him yet it is agreed that the received
notions about a future state were exhibited in these mysteries and as
these poets described those received notions they may be said as far
as these religious doctrines were concerned to have described the
mysteries
now as these were emblematic exhibitions they must have been as well
adapted to the purposes of sculpture as of poetry which indeed does not
seem to have been uncommon since one compartment of figures in the
sheild of aeneas represented the regions of tartarus aen lib x the
procession of torches which according to m de st croix was exhibited
in these mysteries is still to be seen in basso relievo discovered by
spon and wheler memoires sur le mysteres par de st croix 1784 and it
is very probable that the beautiful gem representing the marriage of
cupid and psyche as described by apuleus was originally descriptive of
another part of the exhibitions in these mysteries though afterwards it
became a common subject of antient art see divine legat vol i p
323 what subject could have been imagined so sublime for the ornaments
of a funereal urn as the mortality of all things and their
resuscitation where could the designer be supplied with emblems for
this purpose before the christian era but from the eleusinian
mysteries
1 the exhibitions of the mysteries were of two kinds those which the
people were permitted to see and those which were only shewn to the
initiated concerning the latter aristides calls them the most
shocking and most ravishing representations and stoboeus asserts that
the initiation into the grand mysteries exactly resembles death divine
legat vol i p 280 and p 272 and virgil in his entrance to the
shades below amongst other things of terrible form mentions death
aen vi this part of the exhibition seems to be represented in one of
the compartments of the portland vase
three figures of exquisite workmanship are placed by the side of a
ruined column whose capital is fallen off and lies at their feet with
other disjointed stones they sit on loose piles of stone beneath a
tree which has not the leaves of any evergreen of this climate but may
be supposed to be an elm which virgil places near the entrance of the
infernal regions and adds that a dream was believed to dwell under
every leaf of it aen vi l 281 in the midst of this group reclines a
female figure in a dying attitude in which extreme languor is
beautifully represented in her hand is an inverted torch an antient
emblem of extinguished life the elbow of the same arm resting on a
stone supports her as she sinks while the other hand is raised and
thrown over her drooping head in some measure sustaining it and gives
with great art the idea of fainting lassitude on the right of her sits
a man and on the left a woman both supporting themselves on their
arms as people are liable to do when they are thinking intensely they
have their backs towards the dying figure yet with their faces turned
towards her as if seriously contemplating her situation but without
stretching out their hands to assist her
this central figure then appears to me to be an hieroglyphic or
eleusinian emblem of mortal life that is the lethum or death
mentioned by virgil amongst the terrible things exhibited at the
beginning of the mysteries the inverted torch shews the figure to be
emblematic if it had been designed to represent a real person in the
act of dying there had been no necessity for the expiring torch as the
dying figure alone would have been sufficiently intelligibleit would
have been as absurd as to have put an inverted torch into the hand of a
real person at the time of his expiring besides if this figure had
represented a real dying person would not the other figures or one of
them at least have stretched out a hand to support her to have eased
her fall among loose stones or to have smoothed her pillow these
circumstances evince that the figure is an emblem and therefore could
not be a representation of the private history of any particular family
or event
the man and woman on each side of the dying figure must be considered as
emblems both from their similarity of situation and dress to the middle
figure and their being grouped along with it these i think are
hieroglyphic or eleusinian emblems of humankind with their backs toward
the dying figure of mortal life unwilling to associate with her yet
turning back their serious and attentive countenances curious indeed to
behold yet sorry to contemplate their latter end these figures bring
strongly to ones mind the adam and eve of sacred writ whom some have
supposed to have been allegorical or hieroglyphic persons of aegyptian
origin but of more antient date amongst whom i think is dr warburton
according to this opinion adam and eve were the names of two
hieroglyphic figures representing the early state of mankind abel was
the name of an hieroglyphic figure representing the age of pasturage
and cain the name of another hieroglyphic symbol representing the age of
agriculture at which time the uses of iron were discovered and as the
people who cultivated the earth and built houses would increase in
numbers much faster by their greater production of food they would
readily conquer or destroy the people who were sustained by pasturage
which was typified by cain slaying abel
2 on the other compartment of this celebrated vase is exhibited an
emblem of immortality the representation of which was well known to
constitute a very principal part of the shews at the eleusinian
mysteries as dr warburton has proved by variety of authority the
habitation of spirits or ghosts after death was supposed by the antients
to be placed beneath the earth where pluto reigned and dispensed
rewards or punishments hence the first figure in this group is of the
manes or ghost who having passed through an open portal is descending
into a dusky region pointing his toe with timid and unsteady step
feeling as it were his way in the gloom this portal aeneas enters
which is described by virgilpatet atri janua ditis aen vi l 126
as well as the easy descentfacilis descensus averni ib the darkness
at the entrance to the shades is humorously described by lucian div
legat vol i p 241 and the horror of the gates of hell was in the
time of homer become a proverb achilles says to ulysses i hate a liar
worse than the gates of hell the same expression is used in isaiah
ch xxxviii v 10 the manes or ghost appears lingering and fearful
and wishes to drag after him a part of his mortal garment which however
adheres to the side of the portal through which he has passed the
beauty of this allegory would have been expressed by mr pope by we
feel the ruling passion strong in death
a little lower down in the group the manes or ghost is received by a
beautiful female a symbol of immortal life this is evinced by her
fondling between her knees a large and playful serpent which from its
annually renewing its external skin has from great antiquity even as
early as the fable of prometheus been esteemed an emblem of renovated
youth the story of the serpent acquiring immortal life from the ass of
prometheus who carried it on his back is told in bacons works vol
v p 462 quarto edit lond 1778 for a similar purpose a serpent was
wrapped round the large hieroglyphic egg in the temple of dioscuri as
an emblem of the renewal of life from a state of death bryants
mythology vol ii p 359 sec edit on this account also the serpent
was an attendant on aesculapius which seems to have been the name of
the hieroglyphic figure of medicine this serpent shews this figure to
be an emblem as the torch shewed the central figure of the other
compartment to be an emblem hence they agreeably correspond and
explain each other one representing mortal life and the other immortal
life
this emblematic figure of immortal life sits down with her feet towards
the figure of pluto but turning back her face towards the timid ghost
she stretches forth her hand and taking hold of his elbow supports his
tottering steps as well as encourages him to advance both which
circumstances are thus with wonderful ingenuity brought to the eye at
the same time the spirit loosely lays his hand upon her arm as one
walking in the dark would naturally do for the greater certainty of
following his conductress while the general part of the symbol of
immortal life being turned toward the figure of pluto shews that she
is leading the phantom to his realms
in the pamphili gardens at rome perseus in assisting andromeda to
descend from the rock takes hold of her elbow to steady or support her
step and she lays her hand loosely on his arm as in this figure admir
roman antiq
the figure of pluto can not be mistaken as is agreed by most of the
writers who have mentioned this vase his grisley beard and his having
one foot buried in the earth denotes the infernal monarch he is placed
at the lowest part of the group and resting his chin on his hand and
his arm upon his knee receives the strangerspirit with inquisitive
attention it was before observed that when people think attentively
they naturally rest their bodies in some easy attitude that more animal
power may be employed on the thinking faculty in this group of figures
there is great art shewn in giving an idea of a descending plain viz
from earth to elysium and yet all the figures are in reality on an
horizontal one this wonderful deception is produced first by the
descending step of the manes or ghost secondly by the arm of the
sitting figure of immortal life being raised up to receive him as he
descends and lastly by pluto having one foot sunk into the earth
there is yet another figure which is concerned in conducing the manes or
ghost to the realms of pluto and this is love he precedes the
descending spirit on expanded wings lights him with his torch and
turning back his beautiful countenance beckons him to advance the
antient god of love was of much higher dignity than the modern cupid he
was the first that came out of the great egg of night hesiod theog
v cxx bryants mythol vol ii p 348 and is said to possess the
keys of the sky sea and earth as he therefore led the way into this
life he seems to constitute proper emblem for leading the way to a
future life see bacons works vol i p 568 and vol iii p 582
quarto edit
the introduction of love into this part of the mysteries requires a
little further explanation the psyche of the aegyptians was one of
their most favourite emblems and represented the soul or a future
life it was originally no other than the aurelia or butterfly but in
after times was represented by a lovely female child with the beautiful
wings of that insect the aurelia after its first stage as an eruca or
caterpillar lies for a season in a manner dead and is inclosed in a
sort of coffin in this state of darkness it remains all the winter but
at the return of spring it bursts its bonds and comes out with new life
and in the most beautiful attire the aegyptians thought this a very
proper picture of the soul of man and of the immortality to which it
aspired but as this was all owing to divine love of which eros was an
emblem we find this person frequently introduced as a concomitant of
the soul in general or psyche bryants mythol vol ii p 386 eros
or divine love is for the same reason a proper attendant on the manes
or soul after death and much contributes to tell the story that is to
shew that a soul or manes is designed by the descending figure from
this figure of love m dhancarville imagines that orpheus and eurydice
are typified under the figure of the manes and immortal life as above
described it may be sufficient to answer first that orpheus is always
represented with a lyre of which there are prints of four different
gems in spences polymetis and virgil so describes him aen vi
cythar fretus and secondly that it is absurd to suppose that eurydice
was fondling and playing with a serpent that had slain her add to this
that love seems to have been an inhabitant of the infernal regions as
exhibited in the mysteries for claudian who treats more openly of the
eleusinian mysteries when they were held in less veneration invokes
the deities to disclose to him their secrets and amongst other things
by what torch love softens pluto

in this compartment there are two trees whose branches spread over the
figures one of them has smoother leaves like some evergreens and might
thence be supposed to have some allusion to immortality but they may
perhaps have been designed only as ornaments or to relieve the figures
or because it was in groves where these mysteries were originally
celebrated  thus homer speaks of the woods of proserpine and mentions
many trees in tartarus as presenting their fruits to tantalus virgil
speaks of the pleasant groves of elysium and in spences polymetis
there are prints of two antient gems one of orpheus charming cerberus
with his lyre and the other of hercules binding him in a cord each of
them standing by a tree polymet p 284 as however these trees have
all different foliage so clearly marked by the artist they may have had
specific meanings in the exhibitions of the mysteries which have not
reached posterity of this kind seem to have been the tree of knowledge
of good and evil and the tree of life in sacred writ both which must
have been emblematic or allegorical the masks hanging to the handles
of the vase seem to indicate that there is a concealed meaning in the
figures besides their general appearance and the priestess at the
bottom which i come now to describe seems to shew this concealed
meaning to be of the sacred or eleusinian kind
3 the figure on the bottom of the vase is on a larger scale than the
others and less finely finished and less elevated and as this bottom
part was afterwards cemented to the upper part it might be executed by
another artist for the sake of expedition but there seems no reason to
suppose that it was not originally designed for the upper part of it as
some have conjectured as the mysteries of ceres were celebrated by
female priests for porphyrius says the antients called the priestesses
of ceres melissai or bees which were emblems of chastity div leg
vol i p 235 and as in his satire against the sex juvenal says
that few women are worthy to be priestesses of ceres sat vi the
figure at the bottom of the vase would seem to represent a priestess or
hierophant whose office it was to introduce the initiated and point
out to them and explain the exhibitions in the mysteries and to
exclude the uninitiated calling out to them far far retire ye
profane and to guard the secrets of the temple thus the introductory
hymn sung by the hierophant according to eusebius begins i will
declare a secret to the initiated but let the doors be shut against the
profane div leg vol i p 177 the priestess or hierophant appears
in this figure with a close hood and dressed in linen which fits close
about her except a light cloak which flutters in the wind wool as
taken from slaughtered animals was esteemed profane by the priests of
aegypt who were always dressed in linen apuleus p 64 div leg vol
i p 318 thus eli made for samuel a linen ephod samuel i 3
secrecy was the foundation on which all mysteries rested when publicly
known they ceased to be mysteries hence a discovery of them was not
only punished with death by the athenian law but in other countries a
disgrace attended the breach of a solemn oath the priestess in the
figure before us has her finger pointing to her lips as an emblem of
silence there is a figure of harpocrates who was of aegyptian origin
the same as orus with the lotus on his head and with his finger
pointing to his lips not pressed upon them in bryants mythol vol ii
p 398 and another female figure standing on a lotus as if just risen
from the nile with her finger in the same attitude these seem to have
been representations or emblems of male and female priests of the secret
mysteries as these sort of emblems were frequently changed by artists
for their more elegant exhibition it is possible the foliage over the
head of this figure may bear some analogy to the lotus above mentioned
this figure of secrecy seems to be here placed with great ingenuity as
a caution to the initiated who might understand the meaning of the
emblems round the vase not to divulge it and this circumstance seems
to account for there being no written explanation extant and no
tradition concerning these beautiful figures handed down to us along
with them
another explanation of this figure at the bottom of the vase would seem
to confirm the idea that the basso relievos round its sides are
representations of a part of the mysteries i mean that it is the head
of atis lucian says that atis was a young man of phrygia of uncommon
beauty that he dedicated a temple in syria to rhea or cybele and
first taught her mysteries to the lydians phrygians and samothracians
which mysteries he brought from india he was afterwards made an eunuch
by rhea and lived like a woman and assumed a feminine habit and in
that garb went over the world teaching her ceremonies and mysteries
dict par m danet art atis as this figure is covered with clothes
while those on the sides of the vase are naked and has a phrygian cap
on the head and as the form and features are so soft that it is
difficult to say whether it be a male or female figure there is reason
to conclude 1 that it has reference to some particular person of some
particular country 2 that this person is atis the first great
hierophant or teacher of mysteries to whom m de la chausse says the
figure itself bears a resemblance museo capitol tom iv p 402
in the museum etruscum vol i plate 96 there is the head of atis with
feminine features clothed with a phrygian cap and rising from very
broad foliage placed on a kind of term supported by the paw of a lion
goreus in his explanation of the figure says that it is placed on a
lions foot because that animal was sacred to cybele and that it rises
from very broad leaves because after he became an eunuch he determined
to dwell in the groves thus the foliage as well as the cap and
feminine features confirm the idea of this figure at the bottom of the
vase representing the head of atis the first great hierophant and that
the figures on the sides of the vase are emblems from the antient
mysteries
i beg leave to add that it does not appear to have been uncommon amongst
the antients to put allegorical figures on funeral vases in the
pamphili palace at rome there is an elaborate representation of life and
of death on an antient sarcophagus in the first prometheus is
represented making man and minerva is placing a butterfly or the soul
upon his head in the other compartment love extinguishes his torch in
the bosom of the dying figure and is receiving the butterfly or
psyche from him with a great number of complicated emblematic figures

to elucidate the formation of coalbeds i shall here describe a fountain
of fossil tar or petroleum discovered lately near colebrook dale in
shropshire the particulars of which were sent me by dr robert darwin
of shrewsbury
about a mile and a half below the celebrated ironbridge constructed by
the late mr darby near colebrook dale on the east side of the river
severn as the workmen in october 1786 were making a subterranean canal
into the mountain for the more easy acquisition and conveyance of the
coals which lie under it they found an oozing of liquid bitumen or
petroleum and as they proceeded further cut through small cavities of
different sizes from which the bitumen issued from ten to fifteen
barrels of this fossil tar each barrel containing thirtytwo gallons
were at first collected in a day which has since however gradually
diminished in quantity so that at present the product is about seven
barrels in fourteen days
the mountain into which this canal enters consists of siliceous sand
in which however a few marine productions apparently in their recent
state have been found and are now in the possession of mr william
reynolds of ketly bank about three hundred yards from the entrance into
the mountain and about twentyeight yards below the surface of it the
tar is found oozing from the sandrock above into the top and sides of
the canal
beneath the level of this canal a shaft has been sunk through a grey
argillaceous substance called in this country clunch which is said to
be a pretty certain indication of coal beneath this lies a stratum of
coal about two or three inches thick of an inferior kind yielding
little flame in burning and leaving much ashes below this is a rock of
a harder texture and beneath this are found coals of an excellent
quality for the purpose of procuring which with greater facility the
canal or horizontal aperture is now making into the mountain july
1788
beneath these coals in some places is found salt water in other parts
of the adjacent country there are beds of ironstone which also contain
some bitumen in a less fluid state and which are about on a level with
the new canal into which the fossil tar oozes as above described
there are many interesting circumstances attending the situation and
accompaniments of this fountain of fossil tar tending to develop the
manner of its production 1 as the canal passing into the mountain runs
over the beds of coals and under the reservoir of petroleum it appears
that a natural distillation of this fossil in the bowels of the earth
must have taken place at some early period of the world similar to the
artificial distillation of coal which has many years been carried on in
this place on a smaller scale above ground when this reservoir of
petroleum was cut into the slowness of its exsudation into the canal
was not only owing to its viscidity but to the pressure of the
atmosphere or to the necessity there was that air should at the same
time insinuate itself into the small cavities from which the petroleum
descended the existence of such a distillation at some antient time is
confirmed by the thin stratum of coal beneath the canal which covers
the hard rock having been deprived of its fossil oil so as to burn
without flame and thus to have become a natural coak or fossil
charcoal while the petroleum distilled from it is found in the cavities
of the rock above it
there are appearances in other places which favour this idea of the
natural distillation of petroleum thus at matlock in derbyshire a hard
bitumen is found adhering to the spar in the clefts of the limerocks in
the form of round drops about the size of peas which could perhaps only
be deposited there in that form by sublimation
2 the second deduction which offers itself is that these beds of
coal have been exposed to a considerable degree of heat since the
petroleum above could not be separated as far as we know by any other
means and that the good quality of the coals beneath the hard rock was
owing to the impermeability of this rock to the bituminous vapour and
to its pressure being too great to permit its being removed by the
elasticity of that vapour thus from the degree of heat the degree of
pressure and the permeability of the superincumbent strata many of the
phenomena attending coalbeds receive an easy explanation which much
accords with the ingenious theory of the earth by dr hutton trans of
edinb vol i
in some coal works the fusion of the strata of coal has been so slight
that there remains the appearance of ligneus fibres and the impression
of leaves as at bovey near exeter and even seeds of vegetables of
which i have had specimens from the collieries near polesworth in
warwickshire in some where the heat was not very intense and the
incumbent stratum not permeable to vapour the fossil oil has only risen
to the upper part of the coalbed and has rendered that much more
inflammable than the lower parts of it as in the collieries near
beaudesert the seat of the earl of uxbridge in staffordshire where the
upper stratum is a perfect cannel or candlecoal and the lower one of
an inferior quality over the coalbeds near sir h harpurs house in
derbyshire a thin lamina of asphaltum is found in some places near the
surface of the earth which would seem to be from a distillation of
petroleum from the coals below the more fluid part of which had in
process of time exhaled or been consolidated by its absorption of air
in other coalworks the upper part of the stratum is of a worse kind
than the lower one as at alfreton and denbigh in derbyshire owing to
the supercumbent stratum having permitted the exhalation of a great part
of the petroleum whilst at widdrington in northumberland there is first
a seam of coal about six inches thick of no value which lies under
about four fathom of clay beneath this is a white freestone then a
hard stone which the workmen there call a whin then two fathoms of
clay then another white stone and under that a vein of coals three
feet nine inches thick of a similar nature to the newcastle coal phil
trans abridg vol vi plate ii p 192 the similitude between the
circumstances of this colliery and of the coal beneath the fountain of
tar above described renders it highly probable that this upper thin
seam of coal has suffered a similar distillation and that the
inflammable part of it had either been received into the clay above in
the form of sulphur which when burnt in the open air would produce
alum or had been dissipated for want of a receiver where it could be
condensed the former opinion is perhaps in this case more probable as
in some other coalbeds of which i have procured accounts the surface
of the coal beneath clunch or clay is of an inferior quality as at west
hallum in nottinghamshire the clunch probably from hence acquires its
inflammable part which on calcination becomes vitriolic acid i
gathered pieces of clunch converted partially into alum at a colliery
near bilston where the ground was still on fire a few years ago
the heat which has thus pervaded the beds of morass seems to have been
the effect of the fermentation of their vegetable materials as new hay
sometimes takes fire even in such very small masses from the sugar it
contains and seems hence not to have been attended with any expulsion
of lava like the deeper craters of volcanos situated in beds of
granite
3 the marine shells found in the loose sandrock above this reservoir
of petroleum and the coalbeds beneath it together with the existence
of seasalt beneath these coals prove that these coal beds have been
at the bottom of the sea during some remote period of time and were
afterwards raised into their present situation by subterraneous
expansions of vapour this doctrine is further supported by the marks of
violence which some coalbeds received at the time they were raised out
of the sea as in the collieries at mendip in somersetshire in these
there are seven strata of coals equitant upon each other with beds of
clay and stone intervening amongst which clay are found shells and fern
branches in one part of this hill the strata are disjoined and a
quantity of heterogeneous substances fill up the chasm which disjoins
them on one side of this chasm the seven strata of coal are seen
corresponding in respect to their reciprocal thickness and goodness with
the seven strata on the other side of the cavity except that they have
been elevated several yards higher phil trans no 360 abridg vol
v p 237
the cracks in the coalbed near ticknall in derbyshire and in the sand
stone rock over it in both of which specimens of leadore and spar are
found confirm this opinion of their having been forcibly raised up by
subterraneous fires over the colliery at brownhills near lichfield
there is a stratum of gravel on the surface of the ground which may be
adduced as another proof to shew that those coals had some time been
beneath the sea or the bed of a river nevertheless these arguments
only apply to the collieries above mentioned which are few compared
with those which bear no marks of having been immersed in the sea
on the other hand the production of coals from morasses as described in
note xx is evinced from the vegetable matters frequently found in them
and in the strata over them as fernleaves in nodules of ironore and
from the bogshells or fresh water muscles sometimes found over them of
both which i have what i believe to be specimens and is further proved
from some parts of these beds being only in part transformed to coal
and the other part still retaining not only the form but some of the
properties of wood specimens of which are not unfrequent in the
cabinets of the curious procured from loch neigh in ireland from bovey
near exeter and other places and from a famous cavern called the
temple of the devil near the town of altorf in franconia at the foot
of a mountain covered with pine and savine in which are found large
coals resembling trees of ebony which are so far mineralized as to be

whence it would appear that though most collieries with their attendant
strata of clay sandstone and iron were formed on the places where
the vegetables grew from which they had their origin yet that other
collections of vegetable matter were washed down from eminences by
currents of waters into the beds of rivers or the neighbouring seas
and were there accumulated at different periods of time and underwent a
great degree of heat from their fermentation in the same manner as
those beds of morass which had continued on the plains where they were
produced and that by this fermentation many of them had been raised
from the ocean with sand and seashells over them and others from the
beds of rivers with accumulations of gravel upon them

more distinctly to the eye of the reader i shall here subjoin two or

as these strata generally lie inclined i suppose parallel with the
limestone on which they rest the upper edges of them all come out to
day which is termed bassetting when the whole mass was ignited by its
fermentation it is probable that the inflammable part of some strata
might thus more easily escape than of others in the form of vapour as
dews are known to slide between such strata in the production of
springs which accounts for some coalbeds being so much worse than
others see note xx
from this account of the production of coals from morasses it would
appear that coalbeds are not to be expected beneath masses of lime
stone nevertheless i have been lately informed by my friend mr michell
of thornhill who i hope will soon favour the public with his geological
investigations that the beds of chalk are the uppermost of all the
limestones and that they rest on the granulated limestone called
kettonstone which i suppose is similar to that which covers the whole
country from leadenham to sleaford and from sleaford to lincoln and
that thirdly coaldelphs are frequently found beneath these two
uppermost beds of limestone
now as the beds of chalk and of granulated limestone may have been
formed by alluviation on or beneath the shores of the sea or in
vallies of the land it would seem that some coal countries which in
the great commotions of the earth had been sunk beneath the water were
thus covered with alluvial limestone as well as others with alluvial
basaltes or common gravelbeds very extensive plains which now consist
of alluvial materials were in the early times covered with water which
has since diminished as the solid parts of the earth have increased for
the solid parts of the earth consisting chiefly of animal and vegetable
recrements must have originally been formed or produced from the water
by animal and vegetable processes and as the solid parts of the earth
may be supposed to be thrice as heavy as water it follows that thrice
the quantity of water must have vanished compared with the quantity of
earth thus produced this may account for many immense beds of alluvial
materials as gravel rounded sand granulated limestone and chalk
covering such extensive plains as lincolnheath having become dry
without the supposition of their having been again elevated from the
ocean at the same time we acquire the knowledge of one of the uses or
final causes of the organized world not indeed very flattering to our
vanity that it converts water into earth forming islands and
continents by its recrements or exuviae

the lowest stratum of the earth which human labour has arrived to is
granite and of this likewise consists the highest mountains of the
world it is known under variety of names according to some difference
in its appearance or composition but is now generally considered by
philosophers as a species of lava if it contains quartz feltspat and
mica in distinct crystals it is called granite which is found in
cornwall in rocks and in loose stones in the gravel near drayton in
shropshire in the road towards newcastle if these parts of the
composition be less distinct or if only two of them be visible to the
eye it is termed porphyry trap whinstone moorstone slate and if it
appears in a regular angular form it is called basaltes the affinity
of these bodies has lately been further well established by dr beddoes
in the phil trans vol lxxx
these are all esteemed to have been volcanic productions that have
undergone different degrees of heat it is well known that in papins
digester water may be made red hot by confinement and will then
dissolve many bodies which otherwise are little or not at all acted upon
by it from hence it may be conceived that under immense pressure of
superincumbent materials and by great heat these masses of lava may
have undergone a kind of aqueous solution without any tendency to
vitrification and might thence have a power of crystallization whence
all the varieties above mentioned from the different proportion of the
materials or the different degrees of heat they may have undergone in
this aqueous solution and that the uniformity of the mixture of the
original earths as of lime argil silex magnesia and barytes which
they contain was owing to their boiling together a longer or shorter
time before their elevation into mountains see note xix art 8
the seat of volcanos seems to be principally if not entirely in these
strata of granite as many of them are situated on granite mountains
and throw up from time to time sheets of lava which run down over the
proceeding strata from the same origin and in this they seem to differ
from the heat which has separated the clay coal and sand in morasses
which would appear to have risen from a kind of fermentation and thus
to have pervaded the whole mass without any expuition of lava

all the lavas from vesuvius contain one fourth part of iron kirwans
min and all the five primitive earths viz calcareous argillaceous
siliceous barytic and magnesian earths which are also evidently
produced now daily from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies
what is to be thence concluded has the granite stratum in very antient
times been produced like the present calcareous and siliceous masses
according to the ingenious theory of dr hutton who says new continents
are now forming at the bottom of the sea to rise in their turn and that
thus the terraqueous globe has been and will be eternal or shall we
suppose that this internal heated mass of granite which forms the
nucleus of the earth was a part of the body of the sun before it was
separated by an explosion or was the sun originally a planet inhabited
like ours and a satellite to some other greater sun which has long
been extinguished by diffusion of its light and around which the
present sun continues to revolve according to a conjecture of the
celebrated mr herschell and which conveys to the mind a most sublime
idea of the progressive and increasing excellence of the works of the
creator of all things
for the more easy comprehension of the facts and conjectures concerning
the situation and production of the various strata of the earth i shall
here subjoin a supposed section of the globe but without any attempt to
give the proportions of the parts or the number of them but only their
respective situation over each other and a geological recapitulation
                       geological recapitulation
1 the earth was projected along with the other primary planets from the
sun which is supposed to be on fire only on its surface emitting light
without much internal heat like a ball of burning camphor
2 the rotation of the earth round its axis was occasioned by its
greater friction or adhesion to one side of the cavity from which it was
ejected and from this rotation it acquired its spheroidical form as it
cooled in its ascent from the sun its nucleus became harder and its
attendant vapours were condensed forming the ocean
3 the masses or mountains of granite porphery basalt and stones of
similar structure were a part of the original nucleus of the earth or
consist of volcanic productions since formed
4 on this nucleus of granite and basaltes thus covered by the ocean
were formed the calcareous beds of limestone marble chalk spar from
the exuviae of marine animals with the flints or chertz which
accompany them and were stratified by their having been formed at
different and very distant periods of time
5 the whole terraqueous globe was burst by central fires islands and
continents were raised consisting of granite or lava in some parts and
of limestone in others and great vallies were sunk into which the
ocean retired
6 during these central earthquakes the moon was ejected from the earth
causing new tides and the earths axis suffered some change in its
inclination and its rotatory motion was retarded
7 on some parts of these islands and continents of granite or limestone
were gradually produced extensive morasses from the recrements of
vegetables and of land animals and from these morasses heated by
fermentation were produced clay marle sandstone coal iron with
the bases of variety of acids all which were stratified by their
having been formed at different and very distant periods of time
8 in the elevation of the mountains very numerous and deep fissures
necessarily were produced in these fissures many of the metals are
formed partly from descending materials and partly from ascending ones
raised in vapour by subterraneous fires in the fissures of granite or
porphery quartz is formed in the fissures of limestone calcareous spar
is produced
9 during these first great volcanic fires it is probable the atmosphere
was either produced or much increased a process which is perhaps now
going on in the moon mr herschell having discovered a volcanic crater
three miles broad burning on her disk
10 the summits of the new mountains were cracked into innumerable
lozenges by the cold dews or snows falling upon them when red hot from
these summits which were then twice as high as at present cubes and
lozenges of granite and basalt and quartz in some countries and of
marble and flints in others descended gradually into the valleys and
were rolled together in the beds of rivers which were then so large as
to occupy the whole valleys which they now only intersect and
produced the great beds of gravel of which many valleys consist
11 in several parts of the earths surface subsequent earthquakes from
the fermentation of morasses have at different periods of time deranged
the position of the matters above described hence the gravel which was
before in the beds of rivers has in some places been raised into
mountains along with clay and coal strata which were formed from
morasses and washed down from eminences into the beds of rivers or the
neighbouring seas and in part raised again with gravel or marine shells
over them but this has only obtained in few places compared with the
general distribution of such materials hence there seem to have existed
two sources of earthquakes which have occurred at great distance of
time from each other one from the granite beds in the central parts of
the earth and the other from the morasses on its surface all the
subsequent earthquakes and volcanos of modern days compared with these
are of small extent and insignificant effect
12 besides the argillaceous sandstone produced from morasses which is
stratified with clay and coal and iron other great beds of siliceous
sand have been formed in the sea by the combination of an unknown acid
from morasses and the calcareous matters of the ocean
13 the warm waters which are found in many countries are owing to
steam arising from great depths through the fissures of limestone or
lava elevated by subterranean fires and condensed between the strata
of the hills over them and not from any decomposition of pyrites or
manganese near the surface of the earth
14 the columns of basaltes have been raised by the congelation or
expansion of granite beds in the act of cooling from their semivitreous
fusion

i the atmosphere will dissolve a certain quantity of moisture as a
chemical menstruum even when it is much below the freezing point as
appears from the diminution of ice suspended in frosty air but a much
greater quantity of water is evaporated and suspended in the air by
means of heat which is perhaps the universal cause of fluidity for
water is known to boil with less heat in vacuo which is a proof that it
will evaporate faster in vacuo and that the air therefore rather
hinders than promotes its evaporation in higher degrees of heat the
quick evaporation occasioned in vacuo by a small degree of heat is
agreeably seen in what is termed a pulseglass which consists of an
exhausted tube of glass with a bulb at each end of it and with about two
thirds of the cavity filled with alcohol in which the spirit is
instantly seen to boil by the heat of the fingerend applied on a bubble
of steam in the lower bulb and is condensed again in the upper bulb by
the least conceivable comparative coldness
2 another circumstance evincing that heat is the principal cause of
evaporation is that at the time of water being converted into steam a
great quantity of heat is taken away from the neighbouring bodies if a
thermometer be repeatedly dipped in ether or in rectified spirit of
wine and exposed to a blast of air to expedite the evaporation by
perpetually removing the saturated air from it the thermometer will
presently sink below freezing this warmth taken from the ambient
bodies at the time of evaporation by the steam is again given out when
the steam is condensed into water hence the water in a wormtub during
distillation so soon becomes hot and hence the warmth accompanying the
descent of rain in cold weather
3 the third circumstance shewing that heat is the principal cause of
evaporation is that some of the steam becomes again condensed when any
part of the heat is withdrawn thus when warmer southwest winds replete
with moisture succeed the colder northeast winds all bodies that are
dense and substantial as stone walls brick floors c absorb some of
the heat from the passing air and its moisture becomes precipitated on
them while the northeast winds become warmer on their arrival in this
latitude and are thence disposed to take up more moisture and are
termed drying winds
4 heat seems to be the principal cause of the solution of many other
bodies as common salt or blue vitriol dissolved in water which when
exposed to severe cold are precipitated or carried to the part of the
water last frozen this i observed in a phial filled with a solution of
blue vitriol which was frozen the phial was burst the ice thawed and
a blue column of cupreous vitriol was left standing upright on the
bottom of the broken glass as described in note xix
ii hence water may either be dissolved in air and may then be called
an aerial solution of water or it may be dissolved in the fluid matter
of heat according to the theory of m lavoisier and may then be called
steam in the former case it is probable there are many other vapours
which may precipitate it as marine acid gas or fluor acid gas so
alcaline gas and acid gas dissolved in air precipitate each other
nitrous gas precipitates vital air from its azote and inflammable gas
mixed with vital air ignited by an electric spark either produces or
precipitates the water in both of them are there any subtle exhalations
occasionally diffused in the atmosphere which may thus cause rain
1 but as water is perhaps many hundred times more soluble in the fluid
matter of heat than in air i suppose the eduction of this heat by
whatever means it is occasioned is the principal cause of devaporation
thus if a region of air is brought from a warmer climate as the sw
winds it becomes cooled by its contact with the earth in this latitude
and parts with so much of its moisture as was dissolved in the quantity
of calorique or heat which it now looses but retains that part which
was suspended by its attraction to the particles of air or by aerial
solution even in the most severe frosts
2 a second immediate cause of rain is a stream of ne wind descending
from a superior current of air and mixing with the warmer sw wind
below or the reverse of this viz a superior current of sw wind
mixing with an inferior one of ne wind in both these cases the whole
heaven becomes instantly clouded and the moisture contained in the sw
current is precipitated this cause of devaporation has been ingeniously
explained by dr hutton in the transact of edinburgh vol i and seems
to arise from this circumstance the particles of air of the ne wind
educe part of the heat from the sw wind and therefore the water which
was dissolved by that quantity of heat is precipitated all the other
part of the water which was suspended by its attraction to the
particles of air or dissolved in the remainder of the heat continues
unprecipitated
3 a third method by which a region of air becomes cooled and in
consequence deposits much of its moisture is from the mechanical
expansion of air when part of the pressure is taken off in this case
the expanded air becomes capable of receiving or attracting more of the
matter of heat into its interstices and the vapour which was
previously dissolved in this heat is deposited as is seen in the
receiver of an airpump which becomes dewy as the air within becomes
expanded by the eduction of part of it see note vii hence when the
mercury in the barometer sinks without a change of the wind the air
generally becomes colder see note vii on elementary heat and it is
probably from the varying pressure of the incumbent air that in summer
days small black clouds are often thus suddenly produced and again soon
vanish see a paper in philos trans vol lxxviii intitled frigorific
experiments on the mechanical expansion of air
4 another portion of atmospheric water may possibly be held in solution
by the electric fluid since in thunder storms a precipitation of the
water seems to be either the cause or the consequence of the eduction of
the electricity but it appears more probable that the water is
condensed into clouds by the eduction of its heat and that then the
surplus of electricity prevents their coalescence into larger drops
which immediately succeeds the departure of the lightning
5 the immediate cause why the barometer sinks before rain is first
because a region of warm air brought to us in the place of the cold air
which it had displaced must weigh lighter both specifically and
absolutely if the height of the warm atmosphere be supposed to be equal
to that of the preceeding cold one and secondly after the drops of
rain begin to fall in any column of air that column becomes lighter
the falling drops only adding to the pressure of the air in proportion
to the resistance which they meet with in passing through that fluid
if we could suppose water to be dissolved in air without heat or in
very low degrees of heat i suppose the air would become heavier as
happens in many chemical solutions but if water dissolved in the matter
of heat or calorique be mixed with an aerial solution of water there
can be no doubt but an atmosphere consisting of such a mixture must
become lighter in proportion to the quantity of calorique on the same
circumstance depends the visible vapour produced from the breath of
animals in cold weather or from a boiling kettle the particles of cold
air with which it is mixed steal a part of its heat and become
themselves raised in temperature whence part of the water is
precipitated in visible vapour which if in great quantity sinks to the
ground if in small quantity and the surrounding air is not previously
saturated it spreads itself till it becomes again dissolved

the surface of the earth consists of strata many of which were formed
originally beneath the sea the mountains were afterwards forced up by
subterraneous fires as appears from the fissures in the rocks of which
they consist the quantity of volcanic productions all over the world
and the numerous remains of craters of volcanos in mountainous
countries hence the strata which compose the sides of mountains lie
slanting downwards and one or two or more of the external strata not
reaching to the summit when the mountain was raised up the second or
third stratum or a more inferior one is there exposed to day this may
be well represented by forceably thrusting a blunt instrument through
several sheets of paper a bur will stand up with the lowermost sheet
standing highest in the center of it on this uppermost stratum which
is colder as it is more elevated the dews are condensed in large
quantities and sliding down pass under the first or second or third
stratum which compose the sides of the hill and either form a morass
below or a weeping rock by oozing out in numerous places or many of
these less currents meeting together burst out in a more copious rill
the summits of mountains are much colder than the plains in their
vicinity owing to several causes 1 their being in a manner insulated
or cut off from the common heat of the earth which is always of 48
degrees and perpetually counteracts the effects of external cold
beneath that degree 2 from their surfaces being larger in proportion
to their solid contents and hence their heat more expeditiously carried
away by the evermoving atmosphere 3 the increasing rarity of the air
as the mountain rises all those bodies which conduct electricity well
or ill conduct the matter of heat likewise well or ill see note vii
atmospheric air is a bad conductor of electricity and thence confines it
on the body where it is accumulated but when it is made very rare as
in the exhausted receiver the electric aura passes away immediately to
any distance the same circumstance probably happens in respect to heat
which is thus kept by the denser air on the plains from escaping but is
dissipated on the hills where the air is thinner 4 as the currents of
air rise up the sides of mountains they become mechanically rarefied
the pressure of the incumbent column lessening as they ascend hence the
expanding air absorbs heat from the mountain as it ascends as explained
in note vii 5 there is another and perhaps more powerful cause i
suspect which may occasion the great cold on mountains and in the
higher parts of the atmosphere and which has not yet been attended to
i mean that the fluid matter of heat may probably gravitate round the
earth and form an atmosphere on its surface mixed with the aerial
atmosphere which may diminish or become rarer as it recedes from the
earths surface in a greater proportion than the air diminishes
6 the great condensation of moisture on the summits of hills has
another cause which is the dashing of moving clouds against them in
misty days this is often seen to have great effect on plains where an
eminent tree by obstructing the mist as it moves along shall have a much
greater quantity of moisture drop from its leaves than falls at the same
time on the ground in its vicinity mr white in his history of
selborne gives an account of a large tree so situated from which a
stream flowed during a moving mist so as to fill the cartruts in a lane
otherwise not very moist and ingeniously adds that trees planted about
ponds of stagnant water contribute much by these means to supply the
reservoir the spherules which constitute a mist or cloud are kept from
uniting by so small a power that a little agitation against the leaves
of a tree or the greater attraction of a flat moist surface condenses
or precipitates them
if a leaf has its surface moistened and particles of water separate from
each other as in a mist be brought near the moistened surface of a leaf
each particle will be attracted more by that plain surface of water on
the leaf than it can be by the surrounding particles of the mist
because globules only attract each other in one point whereas a plain
attracts a globule by a greater extent of its surface
the common cold springs are thus formed on elevated grounds by the
condensed vapours and hence are stronger when the nights are cold after
hot days in spring than even in the wet days of winter for the warm
atmosphere during the day has dissolved much more water than it can
support in solution during the cold of the night which is thus
deposited in large quantities on the hills and yet so gradually as to
soak in between the strata of them rather than to slide off over their
surfaces like showers of rain the common heat of the internal parts of
the earth is ascertained by springs which arise from strata of earth too
deep to be affected by the heat of summer or the frosts of winter those
in this country are of 48 degrees of heat those about philidelphia were
said by dr franklin to be 52 whether this variation is to be accounted
for by the difference of the suns heat on that country according to
the ingenious theory of mr kirwan or to the vicinity of subterranean
fires is not yet i think decided there are however subterraneous
streams of water not exactly produced in this manner as streams issuing
from fissures in the earth communicating with the craters of old
volcanoes in the peak of derbyshire are many hollows called swallows
where the land floods sink into the earth and come out at some miles
distant as at ilam near ashborne see note on fica vol ii
other streams of cold water arise from beneath the snow on the alps and
andes and other high mountains which is perpetualy thawing at its
under surface by the common heat of the earth and gives rise to large
rivers for the origin of warm springs see note on fucus vol ii

with the pinna when they want food the pinna opens its shell and sends
its faithful ally to forage but if the cancer sees the polypus he
returns suddenly to the arms of his blind hostess who by closing the
shell avoids the fury of her enemy otherwise when it has procured a
booty it brings it to the opening of the shell where it is admitted
and they divide the prey this was observed by haslequist in his voyage
to palestine

fine or less beautiful than the silk as it is spun by the silkworm

stockings and gloves manufactured from it are of exquisite fineness

there is reason to believe that when oil is poured upon water the two
surfaces do not touch each other but that the oil is suspended over the
water by their mutual repulsion this seems to be rendered probable by
the following experiment if one drop of oil be droped on a bason of
water it will immediately diffuse itself over the whole for there
being no friction between the two surfaces there is nothing to prevent
its spreading itself by the gravity of the upper part of it except its
own tenacity into a pellicle of the greatest tenuity but if a second
drop of oil be put upon the former it does not spread itself but
remains in the form of a drop as the other already occupied the whole
surface of the bason and there is friction in oil passing over oil
though none in oil passing over water
hence when oil is diffused on the surface of water gentle breezes have
no influence in raising waves upon it for a small quantity of oil will
cover a very great surface of water i suppose a spoonful will diffuse
itself over some acres and the wind blowing upon this carries it
gradually forwards and there being no friction between the two surfaces
the water is not affected on which account oil has no effect in
stilling the agitation of the water after the wind ceases as was found
by the experiments of dr franklin
this circumstance lately brought into notice by dr franklin had been
mentioned by pliny and is said to be in use by the divers for pearls
who in windy weather take down with them a little oil in their mouths
which they occasionally give out when the inequality of the supernatant
waves prevents them from seeing sufficiently distinctly for their
purpose
the wonderful tenuity with which oil can be spread upon water is evinced
by a few drops projected from a bridge where the eye is properly placed
over it passing through all the prismatic colours as it diffuses
itself and also from another curious experiment of dr franklins he
cut a piece of cork to about the size of a letterwafer leaving a point
standing off like a tangent at one edge of the circle this piece of
cork was then dipped in oil and thrown into a large pond of water and
as the oil flowed off at the point the corkwafer continued to revolve
in a contrary direction for several minutes the oil flowing off all
that time at the pointed tangent in coloured streams in a small pond of
water this experiment does not so well succeed as the circulation of
the cork stops as soon as the water becomes covered with the pellicle of
oil see additional note no xiii and note on fucus vol ii
the ease with which oil and water slide over each other is agreeably
seen if a phial be about half filled with equal parts of oil and water
and made to oscillate suspended by a string the upper surface of the
oil and the lower one of the water will always keep smooth but the
agitation of the surfaces where the oil and water meet is curious for
their specific gravities being not very different and their friction on
each other nothing the highest side of the water as the phial descends
in its oscillation having acquired a greater momentum than the lowest
side from its having descended further would rise the highest on the
ascending side of the oscillation and thence pushes the then uppermost
part of the water amongst the oil

                                            canto iii l 93
on the coast of norway there is an extensive vortex or eddy which lies
between the islands of moskoe and moskenas and is called moskoestrom
or maelstrom it occupies some leagues in circumference and is said to
be very dangerous and often destructive to vessels navigating these
seas it is not easy to understand the existence of a constant
descending stream without supposing it must pass through a subterranean
cavity to some other part of the earth or ocean which may lie beneath
its level as the mediterranean seems to lie beneath the level of the
atlantic ocean which therefore constantly flows into it through the
straits and the waters of the gulph of mexico lie much above the level
of the sea about the floridas and further northward which gives rise to
the gulphstream as described in note on cassia in vol ii
the maelstrom is said to be still twice in about twentyfour hours when
the tide is up and most violent at the opposite times of the day this
is not difficult to account for since when so much water is brought
over the subterraneous passage if such exists as compleatly to fill it
and stand many feet above it less disturbance must appear on the
surface the maelstrom is described in the memoires of the swedish
academy of sciences and pontoppidens hist of norway and in universal
museum for 1763 p 131
the reason why eddies of water become hollow in the middle is because
the water immediately over the centre of the well or cavity falls
faster having less friction to oppose its descent than the water over
the circumference or edges of the well the circular motion or gyration
of eddies depends on the obliquity of the course of the stream or to
the friction or opposition to it being greater on one side of the well
than the other i have observed in water passing through a hole in the
bottom of a trough which was always kept full the gyration of the
stream might be turned either way by increasing the opposition of one
side of the eddy with ones finger or by turning the spout through
which the water was introduced a little more obliquely to the hole on
one side or on the other lighter bodies are liable to be retained long
in eddies of water while those rather heavier than water are soon
thrown out beyond the circumference by their acquired momentum becoming
greater than that of the water thus if equal portions of oil and water
be put into a phial and by means of a string be whirled in a circle
round the hand the water will always keep at the greater distance from
the centre whence in the eddies formed in rivers during a flood a
person who endeavours to keep above water or to swim is liable to be
detained in them but on suffering himself to sink or dive he is said
readily to escape this circulation of water in descending through a
hole in a vessel dr franklin has ingeniously applied to the explanation
of hurricanes or eddies of air

the common heat of the interior parts of the earth being always 48
degrees both in winter and summer the snow which lies in contact with
it is always in a thawing state hence in icehouses the external parts
of the collection of ice is perpetually thawing and thus preserves the
internal part of it so that it is necessary to lay up many tons for the
preservation of one ton hence in italy considerable rivers have their
source from beneath the eternal glaciers or mountains of snow and ice
in our country when the air in the course of a frost continues a day or
two at very near 32 degrees the common heat of the earth thaws the ice
on its surface while the thermometer remains at the freezing point
this circumstance is often observable in the rimy mornings of spring
the thermometer shall continue at the freezing point yet all the rime
will vanish except that which happens to lie on a bridge a board or
on a cake of cowdung which being thus as it were insulated or cut off
from so free a communication with the common heat of the earth by means
of the air under the bridge or wood or dung which are bad conductors
of heat continues some time longer unthawed hence when the ground is
covered thick with snow though the frost continues and the sun does
not shine yet the snow is observed to decrease very sensibly for the
common heat of the earth melts the under surface of it and the upper
one evaporates by its solution in the air the great evaporation of ice
was observed by mr boyle which experiment i repeated some time ago
having suspended a piece of ice by a wire and weighed it with care
without touching it with my hand i hung it out the whole of a clear
frosty night and found in the morning it had lost nearly a fifth of its
weight mr n wallerius has since observed that ice at the time of its
congelation evaporates faster than water in its fluid form which may be
accounted for from the heat given out at the instant of freezing
saussures essais sur hygromet p 249 but this effect is only
momentary
thus the vegetables that are covered with snow are seldom injured
since as they lie between the thawing snow which has 32 degrees of
heat and the covered earth which has 48 they are preserved in a degree
of heat between these viz in 40 degrees of heat whence the moss on
which the reindeer feed in the northern latitudes vegetates beneath the
snow see note on muschus vol ii and hence many lapland and alpine
plants perished through cold in the botanic garden at upsal for in
their native situations though the cold is much more intense yet at
its very commencement they are covered deep with snow which remains
till late in the spring for this fact see amaenit academ vol i no

the theory of the winds is yet very imperfect in part perhaps owing to
the want of observations sufficiently numerous of the exact times and
places where they begin and cease to blow but chiefly to our yet
imperfect knowledge of the means by which great regions of air are
either suddenly produced or suddenly destroyed
the air is perpetually subject to increase or diminution from its
combination with other bodies or its evolution from them the vital
part of the air called oxygene is continually produced in this climate
from the perspiration of vegetables in the sunshine and probably from
the action of light on clouds or on water in the tropical climates
where the sun has greater power and may exert some yet unknown laws of
luminous combination another part of the atmosphere which is called
azote is perpetually set at liberty from animal and vegetable bodies by
putrefaction or combustion from many springs of water from volatile
alcali and probably from fixed alcali of which there is an exhaustless
source in the water of the ocean both these component parts of the air
are perpetually again diminished by their contact with the soil which
covers the surface of the earth producing nitre the oxygene is
diminished in the production of all acids of which the carbonic and
muriatic exist in great abundance the azote is diminished in the growth
of animal bodies of which it constitutes an important part and in its
combinations with many other natural productions
they are both probably diminished in immense quantities by uniting with
the inflammable air which arises from the mud of rivers and lakes at
some seasons when the atmosphere is light the oxygene of the air
producing water and the azote producing volatile alcali by their
combinations with this inflammable air at other seasons of the year
these principles may again change their combinations and the
atmospheric air be reproduced
mr lavoisier found that one pound of charcoal in burning consumed two
pounds nine ounces of vital air or oxygene the consumption of vital
air in the process of making red lead may readily be reduced to
calculation a small barrel contains about twelve hundred weight of this
commodity 1200 pounds of lead by calcination absorb about 144 pounds of
vital air now as a cubic foot of water weighs 1000 averdupois ounces
and as vital air is above 800 times lighter than water it follows that
every barrel of red lead contains nearly 2000 cubic feet of vital air
if this can be performed in miniature in a small oven what may not be
done in the immense elaboratories of nature
these great elaboratories of nature include almost all her fossil as
well as her animal and vegetable productions dr priestley obtained air
of greater or less purity both vital and azotic from almost all the
fossil substances he subjected to experiment four ounceweight of lava

in this account the fixed air was previously extracted from the
limestones by acids and the heat applied was much less than was
necessary to extract all the air from the bodies employed add to this
the known quantities of air which are combined with the calciform ores
as the ochres of iron manganese calamy grey ore of lead and some
idea may be formed of the great production of air in volcanic eruptions
as mentioned in note on chunda vol ii and of the perpetual
absorptions and evolutions of whole oceans of air from every part of the
earth
but there would seem to be an officina aeris a shop where air is both
manufactured and destroyed in the greatest abundance within the polar
circles as will hereafter be spoken of can this be effected by some
yet unknown law of the congelation of aqueous or saline fluids which
may set at liberty their combined heat and convert a part both of the
acid and alcali of seawater into their component airs or on the
contrary can the electricity of the northern lights convert inflammable
air and oxygene into water whilst the great degree of cold at the poles
unites the azote with some other base another officina aeris or
manufacture of air would seem to exist within the tropics or at the
line though in a much less quantity than at the poles owing perhaps to
the action of the suns light on the moisture suspended in the air as
will also be spoken of hereafter but in all other parts of the earth
these absorptions and evolutions of air in a greater or less degree are
perpetually going on in inconceivable abundance increased probably and
diminished at different seasons of the year by the approach or
retrocession of the suns light future discoveries must elucidate this
part of the subject to this should be added that as heat and
electricity and perhaps magnetism are known to displace air that it
is not impossible but that the increased or diminished quantities of
these fluids diffused in the atmosphere may increase its weight a well
as its bulk since their specific attractions or affinities to matter
are very strong they probably also possess general gravitation to the
earth a subject which wants further investigation see note xxvi
                           southwest winds
the velocity of the surface of the earth in moving round its axis
diminishes from the equator to the poles whence if a region of air in
this country should be suddenly removed a few degrees towards the north
it must constitute a western wind because from the velocity it had
previously acquired in this climate by its friction with the earth it
would for a time move quicker than the surface of the country it was
removed to the contrary must ensue when a region of air is transported
from this country a few degrees southward because the velocity it had
acquired in this climate would be less than that of the earths surface
where it was removed to whence it would appear to constitute a wind
from the east while in reality the eminent parts of the earth would be
carried against the too slow air but if this transportation of air from
south to north be performed gradually the motion of the wind will blow
in the diagonal between south and west and on the contrary if a region
of air be gradually removed from north to south it would also blow
diagonally between the north and east from whence we may safely
conclude that all our winds in this country which blow from the north or
east or any point between them consist of regions of air brought from
the north and that all our winds blowing from the south or west or
from any point between them are regions of air brought from the south
it frequently happens during the vernal months that after a northeast
wind has passed over us for several weeks during which time the
barometer has flood at above 3012 inches it becomes suddenly succeeded
by a southwest wind which also continues several weeks and the
barometer sinks to nearly 2812 inches now as two inches of the mercury
in the barometer balance onefifteenth part of the whole atmosphere an
important question here presents itself what is become of all this
air
1 this great quantity of air can not be carried in a superior current
towards the line while the inferior current slows towards the poles
because then it would equally affect the barometer which should not
therefore subside from 3012 inches to 2812 for six weeks together
2 it cannot be owing to the air having lost all the moisture which was
previously dissolved in it because these warm southwest winds are
replete with moisture and the cold northeast winds which weigh up the
mercury in the barometer to 31 inches consist of dry air
3 it can not be carried over the polar regions and be accumulated on
the meridian opposite to us in its passage towards the line as such an
accumulation would equal onefifteenth of the whole atmosphere and can
not be supposed to remain in that situation for six weeks together
4 it can not depend on the existence of tides in the atmosphere since
it must then correspond to lunar periods nor to accumulations of air
from the specific levity of the upper regions of the atmosphere since
its degree of fluidity must correspond with its tenuity and
consequently such great mountains of air can not be supposed to exist
for so many weeks together as the south west winds sometimes continue
5 it remains therefore that there must be at this time a great and
sudden absorption of air in the polar circle by some unknown operation
of nature and that the south wind runs in to supply the deficiency now
as this south wind consists of air brought from a part of the earths
surface which moves faster than it does in this climate it must have at
the same time a direction from the west by retaining part of the
velocity it had previously acquired these southwest winds coming from
a warmer country and becoming colder by their contact with the earth of
this climate and by their expansion so great a part of the
superincumbent atmosphere having vanished precipitate their moisture
and as they continue for several weeks to be absorbed in the polar
circle would seem to receive a perpetual supply from the tropical
regions especially over the line as will hereafter be spoken of
it may sometimes happen that a northeast wind having passed over us may
be bent down and driven back before it has acquired any heat from the
climate and may thus for a few hours or a day have a southwest
direction and from its descending from a higher region of the
atmosphere may possess a greater degree of cold than an inferior north
east current of air
the extreme cold of jan 13 1709 at paris came on with a gentle south
wind and was diminished when the wind changed to the north which is
accounted for by mr homberg from a reflux of air which had been flowing
for some time from the north chemical essays by r watson vol v p
182
it may happen that a northeast current may for a day or two pass over
us and produce incessant rain by mixing with the inferior southwest
current but this as well as the former is of short duration as its
friction will soon carry the inferior current along with it and dry or
frosty weather will then succeed
                           northeast winds
the northeast winds of this country consist of regions of air from the
north travelling sometimes at the rate of about a mile in two minutes
during the vernal months for several weeks together from the polar
regions toward the south the mercury in the barometer standing above
30 these winds consist of air greatly cooled by the evaporation of the
ice and snow over which it passes and as they become warmer by their
contact with the earth of this climate are capable of dissolving more
moisture as they pass along and are thence attended with frosts in
winter and with dry hot weather in summer
1 this great quantity of air can not be supplied by superior currents
passing in a contrary direction from south to north because such
currents must as they arise into the atmosphere a mile or two high
become exposed to so great cold as to occasion them to deposit their
moisture which would fall through the inferior current upon the earth
in some part of their passage
2 the whole atmosphere must have increased in quantity because it
appears by the barometer that there exists onefifteenth part more air
over us for many weeks together which could not be thus accumulated by
difference of temperature in respect to heat or by any aerostatic laws
at present known or by any lunar influence
from whence it would appear that immense masses of air were set at
liberty from their combinations with solid bodies along with a
sufficient quantity of combined heat within the polar circle or in
some region to the north of us and that they thus perpetually increase
the quantity of the atmosphere and that this is again at certain times
reabsorbed or enters into new combinations at the line or tropical
regions by which wonderful contrivance the atmosphere is perpetually
renewed and rendered fit for the support of animal and vegetable life
                           southeast winds
the southeast winds of this country consist of air from the north which
had passed by us or over us and before it had obtained the velocity of
the earths surface in this climate had been driven back owing to a
deficiency of air now commencing at the polar regions hence these are
generally dry or freezing winds and if they succeed northeast winds
should prognosticate a change of wind from northeast to southwest the
barometer is generally about 30 they are sometimes attended with cloudy
weather or rain owing to their having acquired an increased degree of
warmth and moisture before they became retrograde or to their being
mixed with air from the south
2 sometimes these southeast winds consist of a vertical eddy of north
east air without any mixture of southwest air in that case the
barometer continues above 30 and the weather is dry or frosty for four
or five days together
it should here be observed that air being an elastic fluid must be more
liable to eddies than water and that these eddies must extend into
cylinders or vortexes of greater diameter and that if a vertical eddy
of northeast air be of small diameter or has passed but a little way to
the south of us before its return it will not have gained the velocity
of the earths surface to the south of us and will in consequence
become a southeast windbut if the vertical eddy be of large
diameter or has passed much to the south of us it will have acquired
velocity from its friction with the earths surface to the south of us
and will in consequence on its return become a southwest wind
producing great cold
                           northwest winds
there seem to be three sources of the northwest winds of this
hemisphere of the earth 1 when a portion of southern air which was
passing over us is driven back by accumulation of new air in the polar
regions in this case i suppose they are generally moist or rainy winds
with the barometer under 30 and if the wind had previously been in the
southwest it would seem to prognosticate a change to the northeast
2 if a current of north wind is passing over us but a few miles high
without any easterly direction and is bent down upon us it must
immediately possess a westerly direction because it will now move
faster than the surface of the earth where it arrives and thus becomes
changed from a northeast to a northwest wind this descent of a north
east current of air producing a northwest wind may continue some days
with clear or freezing weather as it may be simply owing to a vertical
eddy of northeast air as will be spoken of below it may otherwise be
forced down by a current of southwest wind passing over it and in this
case it will be attended with rain for a few days by the mixture of the
two airs of different degrees of heat and will prognosticate a change
of wind from northeast to southwest if the wind was previously in the
northeast quarter
3 on the eastern coast of north america the northwest winds bring
frost as the northeast winds do in this country as appears from
variety of testimony this seems to happen from a vertical spiral eddy
made in the atmosphere between the shore and the ridge of mountains
which form the spine or backbone of that continent if a current of
water runs along the hypothenuse of a triangle an eddy will be made in
the included angle which will turn round like a waterwheel as the
stream passes in contact with one edge of it the same must happen when
a sheet of air flowing along from the northeast rises from the shore in
a straight line to the summit of the apalachian mountains a part of the
stream of northeast air will flow over the mountains another part will
revert and circulate spirally between the summit of the country and the
eastern shore continuing to move toward the south and thus be changed
from a northeast to a northwest wind
this vertical spiral eddy having been in contact with the cold summits
of these mountains and descending from higher parts of the atmosphere
will lose part of its heat and thus constitute one cause of the greater
coldness of the eastern sides of north america than of the european
shores opposite to them which is said to be equal to twelve degrees of
north latitude which is a wonderful fact not otherwise easy to be
explained since the heat of the springs at philadelphia is said to be
50 which is greater than the medium heat of the earth in this country
the existence of vertical eddies or great cylinders of air rolling on
the surface of the earth is agreeable to the observations of the
constructors of windmills who on this idea place the area of the sails
leaning backwards inclined to the horizon and believe that then they
have greater power than when they are placed quite perpendicularly the
same kind of rolling cylinders of water obtain in rivers owing to the
friction of the water against the earth at their bottoms as is known by
bodies having been observed to float upon their surfaces quicker than
when immersed to a certain depth these vertical eddies of air probably
exist all over the earths surface but particularly at the bottom or
sides of mountains and more so probably in the course of the southwest
than of the northeast winds because the former fall from an eminence
as it were on a part of the earth where there is a deficiency of the
quantity of air as is shewn by the sinking of the barometer whereas
the latter are pushed or squeezed forward by an addition to the
atmosphere behind them as appears by the rising of the barometer
                              tradewinds
a column of heated air becomes lighter than before and will therefore
ascend by the pressure of the cold air which surrounds it like a cork
in water or like heated smoke in a chimney
now as the sun passes twice over the equator for once over either
tropic the equator has not time to become cool and on this account it
is in general hotter at the line than at the tropics and therefore the
air over the line except in some few instances hereafter to be
mentioned continues to ascend at all seasons of the year pressed
upwards by regions of air brought from the tropics
this air thus brought from the tropics to the equator would constitute
a north wind on one side of the equator and a south wind on the other
but as the surface of the earth at the equator moves quicker than the
surface of the earth at the tropics it is evident that a region of air
brought from either tropic to the equator and which had previously only
acquired the velocity of the earths surface at the tropics will now
move too slow for the earths surface at the equator and will thence
appear to move in a direction contrary to the motion of the earth hence
the tradewinds though they consist of regions of air brought from the
north on one side of the line and from the south on the other will
appear to have the diagonal direction of northeast and southwest
winds
now it is commonly believed that there are superior currents of air
passing over these northeast and southwest currents in a contrary
direction and which descending near the tropics produce vertical
whirlpools of air an important question here again presents itself
what becomes of the moisture which this heated air ought to deposit as
it cools in the upper regions of the atmosphere in its journey to the
tropics it has been shewn by dr priestley and mr ingenhouz that the
green matter at the bottom of cisterns and the fresh leaves of plants
immersed in water give out considerable quantities of vital air in the
sunshine that is the perspirable matter of plants which is water
much divided in its egress from their minute pores becomes decomposed
by the suns light and converted into two kinds of air the vital and
inflammable airs the moisture contained or dissolved in the ascending
heated air at the line must exist in great tenuity and by being exposed
to the great light of the sun in that climate the water may be
decomposed and the new airs spread on the atmosphere from the line to
the poles
1 from there being no constant deposition of rains in the usual course
of the tradewinds it would appear that the water rising at the line is
decomposed in its ascent
2 from the observations of m bougner on the mountain pinchinca one of
the cordelieres immediately under the line there appears to be no
condensible vapour above three or four miles high now though the
atmosphere at that height may be cold to a very considerable degree yet
its total deprivation of condensible vapour would seem to shew that its
water was decomposed as there are no experiments to evince that any
degree of cold hitherto known has been able to deprive air of its
moisture and great abundance of snow is deposited from the air that
flows to the polar regions though it is exposed to no greater degrees
of cold in its journey thither than probably exists at four miles height
in the atmosphere at the line
3 the hygrometer of mr sauffure also pointed to dryness as he ascended
into rarer air the single hair of which it was constructed contracting
from deficiency of moisture essais sur lhygromet p 143
from these observations it appears either that rare and cold air
requires more moisture to saturate it than dense air or that the
moisture becomes decomposed and converted into air as it ascends into
these cold and rare regions of the atmosphere
4 there seems some analogy between the circumstance of air being
produced or generated in the cold parts of the atmosphere both at the
line and at the poles
                        monsoons and tornadoes
1 in the arabian and indian seas are winds which blow six months one
way and six months the other and are called monsoons by the
accidental dispositions of land and sea it happens that in some places
the air near the tropic is supposed to become warmer when the sun is
vertical over it than at the line  the air in these places
consequently ascends pressed upon one side by the northeast regions of
air and on the other side by the southwest regions of air for as the
air brought from the south has previously obtained the velocity of the
earths surface at the line it moves faster than the earths surface
near the tropic where it now arrives and becomes a southwest wind
while the air from the north becomes a northeast wind as before
explained these two winds do not so quietly join and ascend as the
northeast and southeast winds which meet at the line with equal
warmth and velocity and form the tradewinds but as they meet in
contrary directions before they ascend and cannot be supposed
accurately to balance each other a rotatory motion will be produced as
they ascend like water falling through a hole and an horizontal or
spiral eddy is the consequence these eddies are more or less rapid and
are called tornadoes in their most violent state raising water from the
ocean in the west or sand from the deserts of the east in less violent
degrees they only mix together the two currents of northeast and south
west air and produce by this means incessant rains as the air of the
northeast acquires some of the heat from the southwest wind as
explained in note xxv this circumstance of the eddies produced by the
monsoonwinds was seen by mr bruce in abyssinia he relates that for
many successive mornings at the commencement of the rainy monsoon he
observed a cloud of apparently small dimensions whirling round with
great rapidity and in few minutes the heavens became covered with dark
clouds with consequent great rains see note on canto iii l 129
2 but it is not only at the place where the air ascends at the northern
extremity of the rainy monsoon and where it forms tornadoes as
observed above by mr bruce but over a great tract of country several
degrees in length in certain parts as in the arabian sea a perpetual
rain for several months descends similar to what happens for weeks
together in our own climate in a less degree during the southwest
winds another important question presents itself here if the climate
to which this southwest wind arrives it not colder than that it comes
from why should it deposit its moisture during its whole journey if it
be a colder climate why does it come thither the tornadoes of air
above described can extend but a little way and it is not easy to
conceive that a superior cold current of air can mix with an inferior
one and thus produce showers over ten degrees of country since at
about three miles high there is perpetual frost and what can induce
these narrow and shallow currents to flow over each other so many
hundred miles
though the earth at the northren extremity of this monsoon may be more
heated by certain circumstances of situation than at the line yet it
seems probable that the intermediate country between that and the line
may continue colder than the line as in other parts of the earth and
hence that the air coming from the line to supply this ascent or
destruction of air at the northern extremity of the monsoon will be
cooled all the way in its approach and in consequence deposit its
water it seems probable that at the northern extremity of this monsoon
where the tornadoes or hurricanes exist that the air not only ascends
but is in part converted into water or otherwise diminished in
quantity as no account is given of the existence of any superior
currents of it
as the southwest winds are always attended with a light atmosphere an
incipient vacancy or a great diminution of air must have taken place to
the northward of them in all parts of the earth wherever they exist and
a deposition of their moisture succeeds their being cooled by the
climate they arrive at and not by a contrary current of cold air over
them since in that case the barometer would not sink they may thus in
our own country be termed monsoons without very regular periods
3 another cause of tornadoes independent of the monsoons is ingeniously
explained by dr franklin when in the tropical countries a stratum of
inferior air becomes so heated by its contact with the warm earth that
its expansion is increased more than is equivalent to the pressure of
the stratum of air over it or when the superior stratum becomes more
condensed by cold than the inferior one by pressure the upper region
will descend and the lower one ascend in this situation if one part of
the atmosphere be hotter from some fortuitous circumstances or has
less pressure over it the lower stratum will begin to ascend at this
part and resemble water falling through a hole as mentioned above if
the lower region of air was going forwards with considerable velocity
it will gain an eddy by riling up this hole in the incumbent heavy air
so that the whirlpool or tornado has not only its progressive velocity
but its circular one also which thus lifts up or overturns every thing
within its spiral whirl by the weaker whirlwinds in this country the
trees are sometimes thrown down in a line of only twenty or forty yards
in breadth making a kind of avenue through a country in the west
indies the sea rises like a cone in the whirl and is met by black
clouds produced by the cold upper air and the warm lower air being
rapidly mixed whence are produced the great and sudden rains called
waterspouts while the upper and lower airs exchange their plus or
minus electricity in perpetual lightenings
                         land and seabreezes
the sea being a transparent mass is less heated at its surface by the
suns rays than the land and its continual change of surface
contributes to preserve a greater uniformity in the heat of the air
which hangs over it hence the surface of the tropical islands is more
heated during the day than the sea that surrounds them and cools more
in the night by its greater elevation whence in the afternoon when the
lands of the tropical islands have been much heated by the sun the air
over them ascends pressed upwards by the cooler air of the incircling
ocean in the morning again the land becoming cooled more than the sea
the air over it descends by its increased gravity and blows over the
ocean near its shores
                              conclusion
1 there are various irregular winds besides those above described
which consist of horizontal or vertical eddies of air owing to the
inequality of the earths surface or the juxtaposition of the sea
other irregular winds have their origin from increased evaporation of
water or its sudden devaporation and descent in showers others from
the partial expansion and condensation of air by heat and cold by the
accumulation or defect of electric fluid or to the airs new production
or absorption occasioned by local causes not yet discovered see notes
vii and xxv
2 there seem to exist only two original winds one consisting of air
brought from the north and the other of air brought from the south the
former of these winds has also generally an apparent direction from the
east and the latter from the west arising from the different
velocities of the earths surface all the other winds above described
are deflections or retrogressions of some parts of these currents of air
from the north or south
3 one fifteenth part of the atmosphere is occasionally destroyed and
occasionally reproduced by unknown causes these causes are brought into
immediate activity over a great part of the surface of the earth at
nearly the same time but always act more powerful to the northward than
to the southward of any given place and would hence seem to have their
principal effect in the polar circles existing nevertheless though with
less power toward the tropics or at the line
for when the northeast wind blows the barometer rises sometimes from
2812 inches to 3012 which shews a great new generation of air in the
north and when the southwest wind blows the barometer sinks as much
which shews a great destruction of air in the north but as the north
east winds sometimes continue for five or six weeks the newlygenerated
air must be destroyed at those times in the warmer climates to the south
of us or circulate in superior currents which has been shewn to be
improbable from its not depositing its water and as the southwest
winds sometimes continue for some weeks there must be a generation of
air to the south at those times or superior currents which last has
been shewn to be improbable
4 the northeast winds being generated about the poles are pushed
forwards towards the tropics or line by the pressure from behind and
hence they become warmer as explained in note vii as well as by their
coming into contact with a warmer part of the earth which contributes to
make these winds greedily absorb moisture in their passage on the
contrary the southwest winds as the atmosphere is suddenly diminished
in the polar regions are drawn as it were into an incipient vacancy
and become therefore expanded in their passage and thus generate cold
as explained in note vii and are thus induced to part with their
moisture as well as by their contact with a colder part of the earths
surface add to this that the difference in the sound of the northeast
and southwest winds may depend on the former being pushed forwards by a
pressure behind and the latter falling as it were into a partial or
incipient vacancy before whence the former becomes more condensed and
the latter more rarefied as it passes there is a whistle termed a
larkcall which consists of a hollow cylinder of tinplate closed at
each end about half an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch high
with opposite holes about the size of a goosequill through the centre
of each end if this larkwhistle be held between the lips the sound of
it is manifestly different when the breath is forceably blown through it
from within outwards and when it is sucked from without inwards
perhaps this might be worthy the attention of organbuilders
5 a stop is put to this new generation of air when about a fifteenth
of the whole is produced by its increasing pressure and a similar
boundary is fixed to its absorption or destruction by the decrease of
atmospheric pressure as water requires more heat to convert it into
vapour under a heavy atmosphere than under a light one so in letting
off the water from muddy fishponds great quantities of airbubbles are
seen to ascend from the bottom which were previously confined there by
the pressure of the water similar bubbles of inflammable air are seen
to arise from lakes in many seasons of the year when the atmosphere
suddenly becomes light
6 the increased absorptions and evolutions of air must like its simple
expansions depend much on the presence or absence of heat and light
and will hence in respect to the times and places of its production and
destruction be governed by the approach or retrocession of the sun and
on the temperature in regard to heat of various latitudes and parts
of the same latitude so well explained by mr kirwan
7 though the immediate cause of the destruction or reproduction of
great masses of air at certain times when the wind changes from north
to south or from south to north can not yet be ascertained yet as
there appears greater difficulty in accounting for this change of wind
for any other known causes we may still suspect that there exists in
the arctic and antarctic circles a bear or dragon yet unknown to
philosophers which at times suddenly drinks up and as suddenly at
other times vomits out onefifteenth part of the atmosphere and hope
that this or some future age will learn how to govern and domesticate a
monster which might be rendered of such important service to mankind
                              instruments
if along with the usual registers of the weather observations were made
on the winds in many parts of the earth with the three following
instruments which might be constructed at no great expence some useful
information might be acquired
1 to mark the hour when the wind changes from northeast to southwest
and the contrary this might be managed by making a communication from
the vane of a weathercock to a clock in such a manner that if the vane
mould revolve quite round a tooth on its revolving axis should stop the
clock or put back a small bolt on the edge of a wheel revolving once in
twentyfour hours
2 to discover whether in a year more air passed from north to south or
the contrary this might be effected by placing a windmillsail of
copper about nine inches diameter in a hollow cylinder about six inches
long open at both ends and fixed on an eminent situation exactly north
and south thence only a part of the northeast and southwest currents
would affect the sail so as to turn it and if its revolutions were
counted by an adapted machinery as the sail would turn one way with the
north currents of air and the contrary one with the south currents the
advance of the counting finger either way would shew which wind had
prevailed most at the end of the year
3 to discover the rolling cylinders of air the vane of a weathercock
might be so suspended as to dip or rise vertically as well as to have
its horizontal rotation
                            recapitulation
northeast winds consist of air flowing from the north where it seems
to be occasionally produced has an apparent direction from the east
owing to its not having acquired in its journey the increasing velocity
of the earths surface these winds are analogous to the tradewinds
between the tropics and frequently continue in the vernal months for
four and six weeks together with a high barometer and fair or frosty
weather 2 they sometimes consist of southwest air which had passed
by us or over us driven back by a new accumulation of air in the north
these continue but a day or two and are attended with rain see note
xxv
southwest wind consists of air flowing from the south and seems
occasionally absorbed at its arrival to the more northern latitudes it
has a real direction from the west owing to its not having lost in its
journey the greater velocity it had acquired from the earths surface
from whence it came these winds are analogous to the monsoons between
the tropics and frequently continue for four or six weeks together
with a low barometer and rainy weather 2 they sometimes consist of
northeast air which had passed by us or over us which becomes
retrograde by a commencing deficiency of air in the north these winds
continue but a day or two attended with severer frost with a sinking
barometer their cold being increased by their expansion as they
return into an incipient vacancy
northwest winds consist first of southwest winds which have passed
over us bent down and driven back towards the south by newly generated
northern air they continue but a day or two and are attended with rain
or clouds 2 they consist of northeast winds bent down from the higher
parts of the atmosphere and having there acquired a greater velocity
than the earths surface are frosty or fair 3 they consist of north
east winds formed into a vertical spiral eddy as on the eastern coasts
of north america and bring severe frost
southeast winds consist first of northeast winds become retrograde
continue for a day or two frosty or fair sinking barometer 2 they
consist of northeast winds formed into a vertical eddy not a spiral
one frost or fair
north winds consist first of air flowing slowly from the north so
that they acquire the velocity of the earths surface as they approach
are fair or frosty seldom occur 2 they consist of retrograde south
winds these continue but a day or two are preceded by southwest
winds and are generally succeeded by northeast winds cloudy or rainy
barometer rising
south winds consist first of air flowing slowly from the south
loosing their previous western velocity by the friction of the earths
surface as they approach moist seldom occur 2 they consist of
retrograde north winds these continue but a day or two are preceded by
northeast winds and generally succeeded by southwest winds colder
barometer sinking
east winds consist of air brought hastily from the north and not
impelled farther southward owing to a sudden beginning absorption of
air in the northern regions very cold barometer high generally
succeeded by southwest wind
west winds consist of air brought hastily from the south and checked
from proceeding further to the north by a beginning production of air in
the northern regions warm and moist generally succeeded by northeast
wind 2 they consist of air bent down from the higher regions of the
atmosphere if this air be from the south and brought hastily it
becomes a wind of great velocity moving perhaps 60 miles an hour is
warm and rainy if it consists of northern air bent down it is of less
velocity and colder
         application of the preceding theory to some extracts
                    from a journal of the weather
dec 1 1790 the barometer sunk suddenly and the wind which had
been some days northeast with frost changed to southeast with an
incessant though moderate fall of snow a part of the northern air
which had passed by us i suppose now became retrograde before it had
acquired the velocity of the earths surface to the south of us and
being attended by some of the southern air in its journey the moisture
of the latter became condensed and frozen by its mixture mith the
former
dec 2 3 the wind changed to northwest and thawed the snow a part
of the southern air which had passed by us or over us with the
retrograde northern air above described was now in its turn driven
back before it had lost the velocity of the surface of the earth to the
south of us and consequently became a northwest wind and not having
lost the warmth it brought from the south produced a thaw
dec 4 5 wind changed to northeast with frost and a rising
barometer the air from the north continuing to blow after it had
driven back the southern air as above described became a northeast
wind having less velocity than the surface of the earth in this
climate and produced frost from its coldness
dec 6 7 wind now changed to the southwest with incessant rain and
a sinking barometer from unknown causes i suppose the quantity of air
to be diminished in the polar regions and the southern air cooled by
the earths surface which was previously frozen deposits its moisture
for a day or two afterwards the wind continued southwest without rain
as the surface of the earth became warmer
march 18 1785 there has been a long frost a few days ago the
barometer sunk to 2912 and the frost became more severe because the air
being expanded by a part of the pressure being taken off became colder
this day the mercury rose to 30 and the frost ceased the wind
continuing as before between north and east march 19 mercury above
30 weather still milder no frost wind northeast march 20 the
same for the mercury rising shews that the air becomes more compressed
by the weight above and in consequence gives out warmth
april 4 5 frost wind northeast the wind changed in the middle of
the day to the northwest without rain and has done so for three or
four days becoming again northeast at night for the sun now giving
greater degrees of heat the air ascends as the sun passes the zenith
and is supplied below by the air on the western side as well as on the
eastern side of the zenith during the hot part of the day whence for a
few hours on the approach of the hot part of the day the air acquires
a westerly direction in this longitude if the northwest wind had been
caused by a retrograde motion of some southern air which had passed
over us it would have been attended with rain or clouds
april 10 it rained all day yesterday the wind northwest this
morning there was a sharp frost the evaporation of the moisture which
fell yesterday occasioned by the continuance of the wind produced so
much cold as to freeze the dew
may 12 frequent showers with a current of colder wind preceding every
shower the sinking of the rain or cloud pressed away the air from
beneath it in its descent which having been for a time shaded from the
sun by the floating cloud became cooled in some degree
june 20 the barometer sunk the wind became southwest and the whole
heaven was instantly covered with clouds a part of the incumbent
atmosphere having vanished as appeared by the sinking of the barometer
the remainder became expanded by its elasticity and thence attracted
some of the matter of heat from the vapour intermixed with it and thus
in a few minutes a total devaporation took place as in exhausting the
receiver of an airpump see note xxv at the place where the air is
destroyed currents both from the north and south flow in to supply the
deficiency for it has been shewn that there are no other proper winds
but these two and the mixture of these winds produces so sudden
condensation of the moisture both by the coldness of the northern air
and the expansion of both of them that lightning is given out and an
incipient tornado takes place whence thunder is said frequently to
approach against the wind
august 28 1732 barometer was at 31 and dec 30 in the same year
it was at 28 2tenths medical essays edinburgh vol ii p 7 it
appears from these journals that the mercury at edinburgh varies
sometimes nearly three inches or one tenth of the whole atmosphere
from the journals kept by the royal society at london it appears seldom
to vary more than two inches or onefifteenth of the whole atmosphere
the quantity of the variation is said still to decrease nearer the line
and to increase in the more northern latitudes which much confirms the
idea that there exists at certain times a great destruction or
production of air within the polar circle
july 2 1732 the westerly winds in the journal in the medical essays
vol ii above referred to are frequently marked with the number three
to shew their greater velocity whereas the easterly winds seldom
approach to the number two the greater velocity of the westerly winds
than the easterly ones is well known i believe in every climate of the
world which may be thus explained from the theory above delivered 1
when the air is still the higher parts of the atmosphere move quicker
than those parts which touch the earth because they are at a greater
distance from the axis of motion 2 the part of the atmosphere where
the north or south wind comes from is higher than the part of it where
it comes to hence the more elevated parts of the atmosphere continue to
descend towards the earth as either of those winds approach 3 when
southern air is brought to us it possesses a westerly direction also
owing to the velocity it had previously acquired from the earths
surface and if it consists of air from the higher parts of the
atmosphere descending nearer the earth this westerly velocity becomes
increased but when northern air is brought to us it possesses an
apparent easterly direction also owing to the velocity which it had
previously acquired from the earths surface being less than that of the
earths surface in this latitude now if the northeast wind consists of
air descending from higher parts of the atmosphere this deficiency of
velocity will be less in consequence of the same cause viz the higher
parts of the atmosphere descending as the wind approaches increases
the real velocity of the western winds and decreases the apparent
velocity of the eastern ones
october 22 wind changed from southeast to southwest there is a
popular prognostication that if the wind changes from the north towards
the south passing through the east it is more likely to continue in the
south than if it passes through the west which may be thus accounted
for if the northeast wind changes to a northwest wind it shews
either that a part of the northern air descends upon us in a spiral
eddy or that a superior current of southern air is driven back but if
a northeast wind be changed into a southeast wind it shews that the
northern air is become retrograde and that in a day or two as soon as
that part of it has passed which has not gained the velocity of the
earths surface in this latitude it will become a south wind for a few
hours and then a southwest wind
the writer of this imperfect sketch of anemology wishes it may incite
some person of greater leizure and ability to attend to this subject
and by comparing the various meteorological journals and observations
already published to construct a more accurate and methodical treatise
on this interesting branch of philosophy
                  note xxxivvegetable perspiration
    and wed the enamoured oxygene to light
                                            canto iv l 34
when points or hairs are put into springwater as in the experiments of
sir b thompson philos trans vol lxxvii and exposed to the light
of the sun much air which loosely adhered to the water rises in
bubbles as explained in note on fucus vol ii a still greater
quantity of air and of a purer kind is emitted by dr priestleys
green matter and by vegetable leaves growing in water in the sunshine
according to mr ingenhouzes experiments both which i suspect to be
owing to a decomposition of the water perspired by the plant for the
edge of a capillary tube of great tenuity may be considered as a circle
of points and as the oxygene or principle of vital air may be
expanded into a gas by the suns light the hydrogene or inflammable air
may be detained in the pores of the vegetable
hence plants growing in the shade are white and become green by being
exposed to the suns light for their natural colour being blue the
addition of hydrogene adds yellow to this blue and tans them green i
suppose a similar circumstance takes place in animal bodies their
perspirable matter as it escapes in the sunshine becomes decomposed by
the edges of their pores as in vegetables though in less quantity as
their perspiration is less and by the hydrogene being retained the skin
becomes tanned yellow in proof of this it must be observed that both
vegetable and animal substances become bleached white by the sunbeams
when they are dead as cabbagestalks bones ivory tallow beeswax
linen and cotton cloth and hence i suppose the coppercoloured natives
of sunny countries might become etiolated or blanched by being kept from
their infancy in the dark or removed for a few generations to more
northerly climates
it is probable that on a sunny morning much pure air becomes separated
from the dew by means of the points of vegetables on which it adheres
and much inflammable air imbibed by the vegetable or combined with it
and by the suns light thus decomposing water the effects of it in
bleaching linen seems to depend as described in note x the water is
decomposed by the light at the ends or points of the cotton or thread
and the vital air unites with the phlogistic or colouring matters of the
cloth and produces a new acid which is either itself colourless or
washes out at the same time the inflammable part of the water escapes
hence there seems a reason why cotton bleaches so much sooner than
linen viz because its fibres are three or four times shorter and
therefore protrude so many more points which seem to facilitate the
liberation of the vital air from the inflammable part of the water
bees wax becomes bleached by exposure to the sun and dews in a similar
manner as metals become calcined or rusty viz by the water on their
surface being decomposed and hence the inflammable material which
caused the colour becomes united with vital air forming a new acid and
is washed away
oil close stopped in a phial not full and exposed long to the suns
light becomes bleached as i suppose by the decomposition of the water
it contains the inflammable air rising above the surface and the vital
air uniting with the colouring matter of the oil for it is remarkable
that by shutting up a phial of bleached oil in a dark drawer it in a
little time becomes coloured again
the following experiment shews the power of light in separating vital
air from another basis viz from azote mr scheel inverted a glass
vessel filled with colourless nitrous acid into another glass containing
the same acid and on exposing them to the suns light the inverted
glass became partly filled with pure air and the acid at the same time
became coloured scheel in crells annal 1786 but if the vessel of
colourless nitrous acid be quite full and stopped so that no space is
left for the air produced to expand itself into no change of colour
takes place priestleys exp vi p 344 see keirs very excellent
chemical dictionary p 99 new edition
a sunflower three feet and half high according to the experiment of dr
hales perspired two pints in one day vegetable statics which is many
times as much in proportion to its surface as is perspired from the
surface and lungs of animal bodies it follows that the vital air
liberated from the surfaces of plants by the sunshine must much exceed
the quantity of it absorbed by their respiration and that hence they
improve the air in which they live during the light part of the day and
thus blanched vegetables will sooner become tanned into green by the
suns light than etiolated animal bodies will become tanned yellow by
the same means
it is hence evident that the curious discovery of dr priestley that
his green vegetable matter and other aquatic plants gave out vital air
when the sun shone upon them and the leaves of other plants did the
same when immersed in water as observed by mr ingenhouze refer to the
perspiration of vegetables not to their respiration because dr
priestley observed the pure air to come from both sides of the leaves
and even from the stalks of a waterflag whereas one side of the leaf
only serves the office of lungs and certainly not the stalks exper on
air vol iii and thus in respect to the circumstance in which plants
and animals seemed the furtherest removed from each other i mean in
their supposed mode of respiration by which one was believed to purify
the air which the other had injured they seem to differ only in degree
and the analogy between them remains unbroken
plants are said by many writers to grow much faster in the night than in
the day as is particularly observable in seedlings at their rising out
of the ground this probably is a consequence of their sleep rather than
of the absence of light and in this i suppose they also resemble animal
bodies
                  note xxxvvegetable placentation
     while in bright veins the silvery sap ascends
                                            canto iv l 419
as buds are the viviparous offspring of vegetables it becomes necessary
that they should be furnished with placental vessels for their
nourishment till they acquire lungs or leaves for the purpose of
elaborating the common juices of the earth into nutriment these vessels
exist in bulbs and in seeds and supply the young plant with a sweet
juice till it acquires leaves as is seen in converting barley into
malt and appears from the sweet taste of onions and potatoes when they
begin to grow
the placental vessels belonging to the buds of trees are placed about
the roots of most as the vine so many roots are furnished with sweet
or mealy matter as fernroot bryony carrot turnip potatoe or in the
alburnum or sapwood as in those trees which produce manna which is
deposited about the month of august or in the joints of sugar cane and
grasses early in the spring the absorbent mouths of these vessels drink
up moisture from the earth with a saccharine matter lodged for that
purpose during the preceding autumn and push this nutritive fluid up
the vessels of the alburnum to every individual bud as is evinced by
the experiments of dr hales and of mr walker in the edinburgh
philosophical transact the former observed that the sap from the stump
of a vine which he had cut off in the beginning of april arose twenty
one feet high in tubes affixed to it for that purpose but in a few
weeks it ceased to bleed at all and dr walker marked the progress of
the ascending sap and found likewise that as soon as the leaves became
expanded the sap ceased to rise the ascending juice of some trees is so
copious and so sweet during the sapseason that it is used to make wine
as the birch betula and sycamore acer pseudoplatinus and
particularly the palm
during this ascent of the sapjuice each individual leafbud expands its
new leaves and shoots down new roots covering by their intertexture
the old bark with a new one and as soon as these new roots or bark
are capable of absorbing sufficient juices from the earth for the
support of each bud and the new leaves are capable of performing their
office of exposing these juices to the influence of the air the
placental vessels cease to act coalesce and are transformed from sap
wood or alburnum into inert wood serving only for the support of the
new tree which grows over them
thus from the pith of the new bud of the horsechesnut five vessels pass
out through the circle of the placental vessels above described and
carry with them a minuter circle of those vessels these five bundles of
vessels unite after their exit and form the footstalk or petiole of the
new fivefingered leaf to be spoken of hereafter this structure is
well seen by cutting off a leaf of the horsechesnut aesculus
hippocastanum in september before it falls as the buds of this tree
are so large that the flower may be seen in them with the naked eye
after a time perhaps about midsummer another bundle of vessels passes
from the pith through the alburnum or sapvessels in the bosom of each
leaf and unites by the new bark with the leaf which becomes either a
flowerbud or a leafbud to be expanded in the ensuing spring for which
purpose an apparatus of placental vessels are produced with proper
nutriment during the progress of the summer and autumn and thus the
vegetable becomes annually increased ten thousand buds often existing
on one tree according to the estimate of linneus phil bot
the vascular connection of vegetable buds with the leaves in whose
bosoms they are formed is confirmed by the following experiment oct
20 1781 on the extremity of a young bud of the mimosa sensitive
plant a small drop of acid of vitriol was put by means of a pen and
after a few seconds the leaf in whose axilla it dwelt closed and opened
no more though the drop of vitriolic acid was so small as apparently
only to injure the summit of the bud does not this seem to shew that
the leaf and its bud have connecting vessels though they arise at
different times and from different parts of the medulla or pith and as
it exists previously to it that the leaf is the parent of the bud
this placentation of vegetable buds is clearly evinced from the
sweetness of the rising sap and from its ceasing to rise as soon as the
leaves are expanded and thus compleats the analogy between buds and
bulbs nor need we wonder at the length of the umbilical cords of buds
since that must correspond with their situation on the tree in the same
manner as their lymphatics and arteries are proportionally elongated
it does not appear probable that any umbilical artery attends these
placental absorbents since as there seems to be no system of veins in
vegetables to bring back the blood from the extremities of their
arteries except their pulmonary veins there could not be any
vegetable fluids to be returned to their placenta which in vegetables
seems to be simply an organ for nutrition whereas the placenta of the
animal foetus seems likewise to serve as a respiratory organ like the
gills of fishes

the individuality of vegetable buds was spoken of before and is
confirmed by the method of raising all kinds of trees by mr barnes
method of propagating fruit trees 1759 lond baldwin he cut a
branch into as many pieces as there were buds or leaves upon it and
wiping the two wounded ends dry he quickly applied to each a cement
previously warmed a little which consisted principally of pitch and
planted them in the earth the use of this cement i suppose to consist
in its preventing the bud from bleeding to death though the author
ascribes it to its antisceptic quality
these buds of plants which are thus each an individual vegetable in
many circumstances resemble individual animals but as animal bodies are
detached from the earth and move from place to place in search of food
and take that food at considerable intervals of time and prepare it for
their nourishiment within their own bodies after it is taken it is
evident they must require many organs and powers which are not necessary
to a stationary bud as vegetables are immoveably fixed to the soil from
whence they draw their nourishment ready prepared and this uniformly
not at returning intervals it follows that in examining their anatome
we are not to look for muscles of locomotion as arms and legs nor for
organs to receive and prepare their nourishment as a stomach and
bowels nor for a reservoir for it after it is prepared as a general
system of veins which in locomotive animals contains and returns the
superfluous blood which is left after the various organs of secretion
have been supplied by which contrivance they are enabled to live a long
time without new supplies of food
the parts which we may expert to find in the anatome of vegetables
correspondent to those in the animal economy are 1 a system of
absorbent vessels to imbibe the moisture of the earth similar to the
lacteal vessels as in the roots of plants and another system of
absorbents similar to the lymphatics of animal bodies opening its
mouths on the internal cells and external surfaces of vegetables and a
third system of absorbent vessels correspondent with those of the
placentation of the animal foetus 2 a pulmonary system correspondent
to the lungs or gills of quadrupeds and fish by which the fluid
absorbed by the lacteals and lymphatics may be exposed to the influence
of the air this is done by the green leaves of plants those in the air
resembling lungs and those in the water resembling gills and by the
petals of flowers 3 arterial systems to convey the fluid thus
elaborated to the various glands of the vegetable for the purposes of
its growth nutrition and various secretions 4 the various glands
which separate from the vegetable blood the honey wax gum resin
starch sugar essential oil c 5 the organs adapted for their
propagation or reproduction 6 muscles to perform several motions of
their parts
i the existence of that branch of the absorbent vessels of vegetables
which resembles the lacteals of animal bodies and imbibes their
nutriment from the moist earth is evinced by their growth so long as
moisture is applied to their roots and their quickly withering when it
is withdrawn
besides these absorbents in the roots of plants there are others which
open their mouths on the external surfaces of the bark and leaves and
on the internal surfaces of all the cells and between the bark and the
alburnum or sapwood the existence of these is shewn because a leaf
plucked off and laid with its under side on water will not wither so
soon as if left in the dry airthe same if the bark alone of a branch
which is separated from a tree be kept moist with waterand lastly by
moistening the alburnum or sapwood alone of a branch detached from a
tree it will not so soon wither as if left in the dry air by the
following experiment these vessels were agreeably visible by a common
magnifying glass i placed in the summer of 1781 the footstalks of some
large figleaves about an inch deep in a decoction of madder rubia
tinctorum and others in a decoction of logwood haematoxylum
campechense along with some sprigs cut off from a plant of picris
these plants were chosen because their blood is white after some hours
and on the next day on taking out either of these and cutting off from
its bottom about a quarter of an inch of the stalk an internal circle of
red points appeared which were the ends of absorbent vessels coloured
red with the decoction while an external ring of arteries was seen to
bleed out hastily a milky juice and at once evinced both the absorbent
and arterial system these absorbent vessels have been called by grew
and malphigi and some other philosophers bronchi and erroneously
supposed to be airvessels it is probable that these vessels when cut
through may effuse their fluids and receive air their sides being too
stiff to collapse since dry wood emits airbubles in the exhausted
receiver in the same manner as moist wood
the structure of these vegetable absorbents consists of a spiral line
and not of a vessel interrupted with valves like the animal lymphatics
since on breaking almost any tender leaf and drawing out some of the
fibres which adhere longest this spiral structure becomes visible even
to the naked eye and distinctly so by the use of a common lens see
grew plate 51
in such a structure it is easy to conceive how a vermicular or
peristaltic motion of the vessel beginning at the lowest part of it
each spiral ring successively contracting itself till it fills up the
tube must forcibly push forwards its contents as from the roots of
vines in the bleeding season and if this vermicular motion should begin
at the upper end of the vessel it is as easy to see how it must carry
its contained fluid in a contrary direction the retrograde motion of
the vegetable absorbent vessels is shewn by cutting a forked branch from
a tree and immersing a part of one of the forks in water which will
for many days prevent the other from withering or it is shewn by
planting a willow branch with the wrong end upwards this structure in
some degree obtains in the esophagus or throat of cows who by similar
means convey their food first downwards and afterward upwards by a
retrograde motion of the annular muscles or cartilages for the purpose
of a second mastication of it
ii the fluids thus drank up by the vegetable absorbent vessels from the
earth or from the atmosphere or from their own cells and interfaces
are carried to the footstalk of every leaf where the absorbents
belonging to each leaf unite into branches forming so many pulmonary
arteries and are thence dispersed to the extremities of the leaf as
may be seen in cutting away slice after slice the footstalk of a horse
chesnut in september before the leaf falls there is then a compleat
circulation in the leaf a pulmonary vein receiving the blood from the
extremities of each artery on the upper side of the leaf and joining
again in the footstalk of the leaf these veins produce so many arteries
or aortas which disperse the new blood over the new bark elongating
its vessels or producing its secretions but as a reservoir of blood
could not be wanted by a vegetable bud which takes in its nutriment at
all times i imagine there is no venous system no veins properly so
called which receive the blood which was to spare and return it into
the pulmonary or arterial system
the want of a system of veins was countenanced by the following
experiment i cut off several stems of tall spurge euphorbia
helioscopia in autumn about the centre of the plant and observed
tenfold the quantity of milky juice ooze from the upper than from the
lower extremity which could hardly have happened if there had been a
venous system of vessels to return the blood from the roots to the
leaves
thus the vegetable circulation complete in the lungs but probably in
the other part of the system deficient in respect to a system of
returning veins is carried forwards without a heart like the
circulation through the livers of animals where the blood brought from
the intestines and mesentery by one vein is dispersed through the liver
by the vena portarum which assumes the office of an artery see note
xxxvii
at the same time so minute are the vessels in the intertexture of the
barks of plants which belong to each individual bud that a general
circulation may possibly exist though we have not yet been able to
discover the venous part of it
there is however another part of the circulation of vegetable juices
visible to the naked eye and that is in the corol or petals of flowers
in which a part of the blood of the plant is exposed to the influence of
the air and light in the same manner as in the foliage as will be
mentioned more at large in notes xxxvii and xxxix
these circulations of their respective fluids seem to be carried on in
the vessels of plants precisely as in animal bodies by their
irritability to the stimulus of their adapted fluids and not by any
mechanical or chemical attraction for their absorbent vessels propel
the juice upwards which they drink up from the earth with great
violence i suppose with much greater than is exerted by the lacteals of
animals probably owing to the greater minuteness of these vessels in
vegetables and the greater rigidity of their coats dr hales in the
spring season cut off a vine near the ground and by fixing tubes on the
remaining stump of it found the sap to rise twentyone feet in the tube
by the propulsive power of these absorbents of the roots of it veget
stat p 102 such a power can not be produced by capillary attraction
as that could only raise a fluid nearly to the upper edge of the
attracting cylinder but not enable it to flow over that edge and much
less to rise 21 feet above it what then can this power be owing to
doubtless to the living activity of the absorbent vessels and to their
increased vivacity from the influence of the warmth of the spring
succeeding the winters cold and their thence greater susceptibility to
irritation from the juices which they absorb resembling in all
circumstances the action of the living vessels of animals

i  there have been various opinions concerning the use of the leaves of
plants in the vegetable oeconomy some have contended that they are
perspiratory organs this does not seem probable from an experiment of
dr hales veg stat p 30 he found by cutting off branches of trees
with apples on them and taking off the leaves that an apple exhaled
about as much as two leaves the surfaces of which were nearly equal to
the apple whence it would appear that apples have as good a claim to be
termed perspiratory organs as leaves others have believed them
excretory organs of excrementious juices but as the vapour exhaled from
vegetables has no taste this idea is no more probable than the other
add to this that in moist weather they do not appear to perspire or
exhale at all
the internal surface of the lungs or airvessels in men are said to be
equal to the external surface of the whole body or about fifteen square
feet on this surface the blood is exposed to the influence of the
respired air through the medium however of a thin pellicle by this
exposure to the air it has its colour changed from deep red to bright
scarlet and acquires something so necessary to the existence of life
that we can live scarcely a minute without this wonderful process
the analogy between the leaves of plants and the lungs or gills of
animals seems to embrace so many circumstances that we can scarcely
withhold our assent to their performing similar offices
i the great surface of the leaves compared to that of the trunk and
branches of trees is such that it would seem to be an organ well
adapted for the purpose of exposing the vegetable juices to the
influence of the air this however we shall see afterwards is probably
performed only by their upper surfaces yet even in this case the
surface of the leaves in general bear a greater proportion to the
surface of the tree than the lungs of animals to their external
surfaces
2 in the lungs of animal the blood after having been exposed to the
air in the extremities of pulmonary artery is changed in colour from
deep red to bright scarlet and certainly in some of its essential
properties it is then collected by the pulmonary vein and returned to
the heart to shew a similarity of circumstance in the leaves of plants
the following experiment was made june 24 1781 a stalk with leaves
and seedvessels of large spurge euphorbia helioscopia had been
several days placed in a decoction of madder rubia tinctorum so that
the lower part of the stem and two of the undermost leaves were
immersed in it after having washed the immersed leaves in clear water
i could readily discern the colour of the madder passing along the
middle rib of each leaf this red artery was beautifully visible both on
the under and upper surface of the leaf but on the upper side many red
branches were seen going from it to the extremities of the leaf which
on the other side were not visible except by looking through it against
the light on this under side a system of branching vessels carrying a
pale milky fluid were seen coming from the extremities of the leaf and
covering the whole underside of it and joining into two large veins
one on each side of the red artery in the middle rib of the leaf and
along with it descending to the footstalk or petiole on slitting one of
these leaves with scissars and having a common magnifying lens ready
the milky blood was seen oozing out of the returning veins on each side
of the red artery in the middle rib but none of the red fluid from the
artery
all these appearances were more easily seen in a leaf of picris treated
in the same manner for in this milky plant the stems and middle rib of
the leaves are sometimes naturally coloured reddish and hence the
colour of the madder seemed to pass further into the ramifications of
their leafarteries and was there beautifully visible with the
returning branches of milky veins on each side
3 from these experiments the upper surface of the leaf appeared to be
the immediate organ of respiration because the coloured fluid was
carried to the extremities of the leaf by vessels most conspicuous on
the upper surface and there changed into a milky fluid which is the
blood of the plant and then returned by concomitant veins on the under
surface which were seen to ooze when divided with scissars and which
in picris particularly render the under surface of the leaves greatly
whiter than the upper one
4 as the upper surface of leaves constitutes the organ of respiration
on which the sap is exposed in the terminations of arteries beneath a
thin pellicle to the action of the atmosphere these surfaces in many
plants strongly repel moisture as cabbageleaves whence the particles
of rain lying over their surfaces without touching them as observed by
mr melville essays literary and philosop edinburgh have the
appearance of globules of quicksilver and hence leaves laid with the
upper surfaces on water wither as soon as in the dry air but continue
green many days if placed with the under surfaces on water as appears
in the experiments of mons bonnet usage des fevilles hence some
aquatic plants as the waterlily nymphoea have the lower sides of
their leaves floating on the water while the upper surfaces remain dry
in the air
5 as those insects which have many spiracula or breathing apertures
as wasps and flies are immediately  suffocated by pouring oil upon
them i carefully covered with oil the surfaces of several leaves of
phlomis of portugal laurel and balsams and though it would not
regularly adhere i found them all die in a day or two
of aquatic leaves see note on trapa and on fucus in vol ii to which
must be added that many leaves are furnished with muscles about their
footstalks to turn their upper surfaces to the air or light as mimosa
and hedysarum gyrans from all these analogies i think there can be no
doubt but that leaves of trees are their lungs giving out a phlogistic
material to the atmosphere and absorbing oxygene or vital air
6 the great use of light to vegetation would appear from this theory to
be by disengaging vital air from the water which they perspire and
thence to facilitate its union with their blood exposed beneath the thin
surface of their leaves since when pure air is thus applied it is
probable that it can be more readily absorbed hence in the curious
experiments of dr priestley and mr ingenhouze some plants purified
air less than others that is they perspired less in the sunshine and
mr scheele found that by putting peas into water which about half
covered them that they converted the vital air into fixed air or
carbonic acid gas in the same manner as in animal respiration see note
xxxiv
7 the circulation in the lungs or leaves of plants is very similar to
that of fish in fish the blood after having passed through their gills
does not return to the heart as from the lungs of airbreathing animals
but the pulmonary vein taking the structure of an artery after having
received the blood from the gills which there gains a more florrid
colour distributes it to the other parts of their bodies the same
structure occurs in the livers of fish whence we see in those animals
two circulations independent of the power of the heart viz that
beginning at the termination of the veins of the gills and branching
through the muscles and that which passes through the liver both which
are carried on by the action of those respective arteries and veins
monros physiology of fish p 19
the course of the fluids in the roots leaves and buds of vegetables
seems to be performed in a manner similar to both these first the
absorbent vessels of the roots and surfaces unite at the footstalk of
the leaf and then like the vena portarum an artery commences without
the intervention of a heart and spreads the sap in its numerous
ramifications on the upper surface of the leaf here it changes its
colour and properties and becomes vegetable blood and is again
collected by a pulmonary vein on the under surface of the leaf this
vein like that which receives the blood from the gills of fish assumes
the office and name of an artery and branching again disperses the
blood upward to the bud from the footstalk of the leaf and downward to
the roots where it is all expended in the various secretions the
nourishment and growth of the plant as fast as it is prepared
ii the organ of respiration already spoken of belongs particularly to
the shoots or buds but there is another pulmonary system perhaps
totally independent of the green foliage which belongs to the
fructification only i mean the corol or petals in this there is an
artery belonging to each petal which conveys the vegetable blood to its
extremities exposing it to the light and air under a delicate membrane
covering the internal surface of the petal where it often changes its
colour as is beautifully seen in some partycoloured poppies though it
is probable some of the iridescent colours of flowers may be owing to
the different degrees of tenuity of the exterior membrane of the leaf
refracting the light like soapbubbles the vegetable blood is then
returned by correspondent vegetable veins exactly as in the green
foliage for the purposes of the important secretions of honey wax the
finer essential oil and the prolific dust of the anthers
1 the vascular structure of the corol as above described and which is
visible to the naked eye and its exposing the vegetable juices to the
air and light during the day evinces that it is a pulmonary organ
2 as the glands which produce the prolific dust of the anthers the
honey wax and frequently some odoriferous essential oil are generally
attached to the corol and always fall off and perish with it it is
evident that the blood is elaborated or oxygenated in this pulmonary
system for the purpose of these important secretions
3 many flowers as the colchicum and hamamelis arise naked in autumn
no green leaves appearing till the ensuing spring and many others put
forth their flowers and complete their impregnation early in the spring
before the green foliage appears as mezereon cherries pears which
shews that these corols are the lungs belonging to the fructification
4 this organ does not seem to have been necessary for the defence of
the stamens and pistils since the calyx of many flowers as tragopogon
performs this office and in many flowers these petals themselves are so
tender as to require being shut up in the calyx during the night for
what other use then can such an apparatus of vessels be designed
5 in the helleborusniger christmasrose after the seeds are grown to
a certain size the nectaries and stamens drop off and the beautiful
large white petals change their colour to a deep green and gradually
thus become a calyx inclosing and defending the ripening seeds hence it
would seem that the white vessels of the corol served the office of
exposing the blood to the action of the air for the purposes of
separating or producing the honey wax and prolific dust and when
these were no longer wanted that these vessels coalesced like the
placental vessels of animals after their birth and thus ceased to
perform that office and lost at the same time their white colour why
should they loose their white colour unless they at the same time lost
some other property besides that of defending the seedvessel which
they still continue to defend
6 from these observations i am led to doubt whether green leaves be
absolutely necessary to the progress of the fruitbud after the last
years leaves are fallen off the green leaves serve as lungs to the
shoots and foster the new buds in their bosoms whether these buds be
leafbuds or fruitbuds but in the early spring the fruitbuds expand
their corols which are their lungs and seem no longer to require green
leaves hence the vine bears fruit at one joint without leaves and puts
out a leafbud at another joint without fruit and i suppose the green
leaves which rise out of the earth in the spring from the colchicum are
for the purpose of producing the new bulb and its placenta and not for
the giving maturity to the seed when currant or goosberry trees lose
their leaves by the depredation of insects the fruit continues to be
formed though less sweet and less in size
7 from these facts it appears that the flowerbud after the corol falls
off which is its lungs and the stamens and nectary along with it
becomes simply an uterus for the purpose of supplying the growing
embryon with nourishment together with a system of absorbent vessels
which bring the juices of the earth to the footstalk of the fruit and
which there changes into an artery for the purpose of distributing the
sap for the secretion of the saccharine or farinaceous or acescent
materials for the use of the embryon at the same time as all the
vessels of the different buds of trees inosculate or communicate with
each other the fruit becomes sweeter and larger when the green leaves
continue on the tree but the mature flowers themselves the succeeding
fruit not considered perhaps suffer little injury from the green leaves
being taken off as some florists have observed
8 that the vessels of different vegetable buds inosculate in various
parts of their circulation is rendered probable by the increased growth
of one bud when others in its vicinity are cut away as it thus seems
to receive the nourishment which was before divided amongst many

from the accurate experiments and observations of spallanzani it appears
that in the spartium junceum rushbroom the very minute seeds were
discerned in the pod at least twenty days before the flower is in full
bloom that is twenty days before fecundation at this time also the
powder of the anthers was visible but glued fast to their summits the
seeds however at this time and for ten days after the blossom had
fallen off appeared to consist of a gelatinous substance on the
eleventh day after the falling of the blossom the seeds became heart
shape with the basis attached by an appendage to the pod and a white
point at the apex this white point was on pressure found to be a cavity
including a drop of liquor
on the 25th day the cavity which at first appeared at the apex was much
enlarged and still full of liquor it also contained a very small semi
transparent body of a yellowish colour gelatinous and fixed by its
two opposite ends to the sides of the cavity
in a month the seed was much enlarged and its shape changed from a heart
to a kidney the little body contained in the cavity was increased in
bulk and was less transparent and gelatinous but there yet appeared no
organization
on the 40th day the cavity now grown larger was quite filled with the
body which was covered with a thin membrane after this membrane was
removed the body appeared of a bright green and was easily divided by
the point of a needle into two portions which manifestly formed the two
lobes and within these attached to the lower part the exceedingly small
plantule was easily perceived
the foregoing observations evince 1 that the seeds exist in the
ovarium many days before fecundation 2 that they remain for some time
solid and then a cavity containing a liquid is formed in them 3 that
after fecundation a body begins to appear within the cavity fixed by two
points to the sides which in process of time proves to be two lobes
containing a plantule 4 that the ripe seed consists of two lobes
adhering to a plantule and surrounded by a thin membrane which is
itself covered with a husk or cuticle spalanzanis dissertations vol

the analogy between seeds and eggs has long been observed and is
confirmed by the mode of their production the egg is known to be formed
within the hen long before its impregnation cf wolf asserts that the
yolk of the egg is nourished by the vessels of the mother and that it
has from those its arterial and venous branches but that after
impregnation these vessels gradually become impervious and obliterated
and that new ones are produced from the fetus and dispersed into the
yolk hallers physiolog tom viii p 94 the young seed after
fecundation i suppose is nourished in a similar manner from the
gelatinous liquor which is previously deposited for that purpose the
uterus of the plant producing or secreting it into a reservoir or amnios
in which the embryon is lodged and that the young embryon is furnished
with vessels to absorb a part of it as in the very early embryon in the
animal uterus
the spawn of frogs and of fish is delivered from the female before its
impregnation m bonnet says that the male salamander darts his semen
into the water where it forms a little whitish cloud which is
afterwards received by the swoln anus of the female and she is
fecundatedhe adds that marine plants approach near to these animals
as the male does not project a fine powder but a liquor which in like
manner forms a little cloud in the waterand further adds who knows
but the powder of the stamina of certain plants may not make some
impression on certain germs belonging to the animal kingdom letter
xliii to spalanzani oevres philos
spalanzani found that the seminal fluid of frogs and dogs even when
diluted with much water retained its prolific quality whether this
quality be simply a stimulus exciting the egg into animal action which
may be called a vivifying principle or whether part of it be actually
conjoined with the egg is not yet determined though the latter seems
more probable from the frequent resemblance of the fetus to the male
parent a conjunction however of both the male and female influence
seems necessary for the purpose of reproduction throughout all organized
nature as well in hermaphrodite insects microscopic animals and
polypi and exists as well in the formation of the buds of vegetables as
in the production of their seeds which is ingeniously conceived and
explained by linneus after having compared the flower to the larva of a
butterfly confining of petals instead of wings calyxes instead of
wingsheaths with the organs of reproduction and having shewn the use
of the farina in fecundating the egg or seed he proceeds to explain the
production of the bud the calyx of a flower he says is an expansion
of the outer bark the petals proceed from the inner bark or rind the
stamens from the alburnum or woody circle and the style from the pith
in the production and impregnation of the seed a commixture of the
secretions of the stamens and style are necessary and for the
production of a bud he thinks the medulla or pith bursts its integuments
and mixes with the woody part or alburnum and these forcing their
passage through the rind and bark constitute the bud or viviparous
progeny of the vegetable system of vegetables translated from linneus
p 8
it has been supposed that the embryon vegetable after fecundation by
its living activity or stimulus exerted on the vessels of the parent
plant may produce the fruit or seedlobes as the animal fetus produces
its placenta and as vegetable buds may be supposed to produce their
umbilical vessels or roots down the bark of the tree this in respect to
the production of the fruit surrounding the seeds of trees has been
assimilated to the gallnuts on oakleaves and to the bedeguar on
briars but there is a powerful objection to this doctrine viz that
the fruit of figs all which are female in this country grow nearly as
large without fecundation and therefore the embryon has in them no
selfliving principle

the glands of vegetables which separate from their blood the mucilage
starch or sugar for the placentation or support of their seeds bulbs
and buds or those which deposit their bitter acrid or narcotic juices
for their defence from depredations of insects or larger animals or
those which secrete resins or wax for their protection from moisture or
frosts consist of vessels too fine for the injection or absorption of
coloured fluids and have not therefore yet been exhibited to the
inspection even of our glasses and can therefore only be known by their
effects but one of the most curious and important of all vegetable
secretions that of honey is apparent to our naked eyes though before
the discoveries of linneus the nectary or honeygland had not even
acquired a name
the odoriferous essential oils of several flowers seem to have been
designed for their defence against the depredations of insects while
their beautiful colours were a necessary consequence of the size of the
particles of their blood or of the tenuity of the exterior membrane of
the petal the use of the prolific dust is now well ascertained the wax
which covers the anthers prevents this dust from receiving moisture
which would make it burst prematurely and thence prevent its application
to the stigma as sometimes happens in moist years and is the cause of
deficient fecundation both of our fields and orchards
the universality of the production of honey in the vegetable world and
the very complicated apparatus which nature has constructed in many
flowers as well as the acrid or deleterious juices she has furnished
those flowers with as in the aconite to protect this honey from rain
and from the depredations of insects seem to imply that this fluid is
of very great importance in the vegetable economy and also that it was
necessary to expose it to the open air previous to its reabsorption into
the vegetable vessels
in the animal system the lachrymal gland separates its fluid into the
open air for the purpose of moistening the eye of this fluid the part
which does not exhale it absorbed by the puncta lachrymalia and carried
into the nostrils but as this is not a nutritive fluid the analogy goes
no further than its secretion into the open air and its reabsorption
into the system every other secreted fluid in the animal body is in
part absorbed again into the system even those which are esteemed
excrementitious as the urine and perspirable matter of which the
latter is secreted like the honey into the external air that the
honey is a nutritious fluid perhaps the most so of any vegetable
production appears from its great similarity to sugar and from its
affording sustenance to such numbers of insects which live upon it
solely during summer and lay it up for their winter provision these
proofs of its nutritive nature evince the necessity of its reabsorption
into the vegetable system for some useful purpose
this purpose however has as yet escaped the researches of philosophical
botanists m pontedera believes it designed to lubricate the vegetable
uterus and compares the hornlike nectaries of some flowers to the
appendicle of the caecum intestinum of animals antholog p 49
others have supposed that the honey when reabsorbed might serve the
purpose of the liquor amnii or white of the egg as a nutriment for the
young embryon or fecundated seed in its early state of existence but as
the nectary is found equally general in male flowers as in female ones
and as the young embryon or seed grows before the petals and nectary are
expanded and after they fall off and thirdly as the nectary so soon
falls off after the fecundation of the pistillum these seem to be
insurmountable objections to both the abovementioned opinions
in this state of uncertainty conjectures may be of use so far as they
lead to further experiment and investigation in many tribes of insects
as the silkworm and perhaps in all the moths and butterflies the male
and female parents die as soon as the eggs are impregnated and excluded
the eggs remaining to be perfected and hatched at some future time the
same thing happens in regard to the male and female parts of flowers
the anthers and filaments which constitute the male parts of the
flower and the stigma and style which constitute the female part of
the flower fall off and die as soon as the seeds are impregnated and
along with these the petals and nectary now the moths and butterflies
abovementioned as soon as they acquire the passion and the apparatus
for the reproduction of their species loose the power of feeding upon
leaves as they did before and become nourished by whatby honey alone
hence we acquire a strong analogy for the use of the nectary or
secretion of honey in the vegetable economy which is that the male
parts of flowers and the female parts as soon as they leave their
fetusstate expanding their petals which constitute their lungs
become sensible to the passion and gain the apparatus for the
reproduction of their species and are fed and nourished with honey like
the insects above described and that hence the nectary begins its
office of producing honey and dies or ceases to produce honey at the
same time with the birth and death of the stamens and the pistils
which whether existing in the same or in different flowers are
separate and distinct animated beings
previous to this time the anthers with their filaments and the stigmas
with their styles are in their fetusstate sustained by their placental
vessels like the unexpanded leafbud with the seeds existing in the
vegetable womb yet unimpregnated and the dust yet unripe in the cells
of the anthers after this period they expand their petals which have
been shewn above to constitute the lungs of the flower the placental
vessels which before nourished the anthers and the stigmas coalesce or
cease to nourish them and they now acquire blood more oxygenated by the
air obtain the passion and power of reproduction are sensible to heat
and cold and moisture and to mechanic stimulus and become in reality
insects fed with honey similar in every respect except their being
attached to the tree on which they were produced
some experiments i have made this summer by cutting out the nectaries of
several flowers of the aconites before the petals were open or had
become much coloured some of these flowers near the summit of the
plants produced no seeds others lower down produced seeds but they
were not sufficiently guarded from the farina of the flowers in their
vicinity nor have i had opportunity to try if these seeds would
vegetate
i am acquainted with a philosopher who contemplating this subject
thinks it not impossible that the first insects were the anthers or
stigmas of flowers which had by some means loosed themselves from their
parent plant like the male flowers of vallisneria and that many other
insects have gradually in long process of time been formed from these
some acquiring wings others fins and others claws from their
ceaseless efforts to procure their food or to secure themselves from
injury he contends that none of these changes are more
incomprehensible than the transformation of tadpoles into frogs and
caterpillars into butterflies
there are parts of animal bodies which do not require oxygenated blood
for the purpose of their secretions as the liver which for the
production of bile takes its blood from the mesenteric veins after it
must have lost the whole or a great part of its oxygenation which it
had acquired in its passage through the lungs in like manner the
pericarpium or womb of the flower continues to secrete its proper
juices for the present nourishment of the newly animated embryonseed
and the saccharine acescent or starchy matter of the fruit or seed
lobes for its future growth in the same manner as these things went on
before fecundation that is without any circulation of juices in the
petals or production of honey in the nectary these having perished and
fallen off with the male and female apparatus for impregnation
it is probable that the depredations of insects on this nutritious fluid
must be injurious to the products of vegetation and would be much more
so but that the plants have either acquired means to defend their honey
in part or have learned to make more than is absolutely necessary for
their own economy in the same manner the honeydew on trees is very
injurious to them in which disease the nutritive fluid the vegetable
sapjuice seems to be exsuded by a retrograde motion of the cutaneous
lymphatics as in the sweating sickness of the last century to prevent
the depredation of insects on honey a wealthy man in italy is said to
have poisoned his neighbours bees perhaps by mixing arsnic with honey
against which there is a most flowery declamation in quintilian no
xiii as the use of the wax is to preserve the dust of the anthers from
moisture which would prematurely burst them the bees which collect
this for the construction of the combs or cells must on this account
also injure the vegetation of a country where they too much abound
it is not easy to conjecture why it was necessary that this secretion of
honey should be exposed to the open air in the nectary or honeycup for
which purpose so great an apparatus for its defence from insects and
from showers became necessary this difficulty increases when we
recollect that the sugar in the joints of grass in the sugarcane and
in the roots of beets and in ripe fruits is produced without the
exposure to the air on supposition of its serving for nutriment to the
anthers and stigmas it may thus acquire greater oxygenation for the
purpose of producing greater powers of sensibility according to a
doctrine lately advanced by a french philosopher who has endeavoured to
shew that the oxygene or base of vital air is the constituent
principle of our power of sensibility
from this provision of honey for the male and female parts of flowers
and from the provision of sugar starch oil and mucilage in the
fruits seedcotyledons roots and buds of plants laid up for the
nutriment of the expanding fetus not only a very numerous class of
insects but a great part of the larger animals procure their food and
thus enjoy life and pleasure without producing pain to others for these
seeds or eggs with the nutriment laid up in them are not yet endued with
sensitive life
the secretions from various vegetable glands hardened in the air produce
gums resins and various kinds of saccharine saponaceous and waxlike
substances as the gum of cherry or plumbtrees gum tragacanth from the
astragalus tragacantha camphor from the laurus camphora elemi from
amyris elemifera aneme from hymenoea courbaril turpentine from
pistacia terebinthus balsam of mecca from the buds of amyris
opobalsamum branches of which are placed in the temples of the east on
account of their fragrance the wood is called xylobalsamum and the
fruit carpobalsamum aloe from a plant of the same name myrrh from a
plant not yet described the remarkably elastic resin is brought into
europe principally in the form of flasks which look like black leather
and are wonderfully elastic and not penetrable by water rectified
ether dissolves it its flexibility is encreased by warmth and destroyed
by cold the tree which yields this juice is the jatropha elastica it
grows in guaiana and the neighbouring tracts of america its juice is
said to resemble wax in becoming soft by heat but that it acquires no
elasticity till that property is communicated to it by a secret art
after which it is poured into moulds and well dried and can no longer be
rendered fluid by heat mr de la borde physician at cayenne has given
this account manna is obtained at naples from the fraxinus ornus or
mannaash it partly issues spontaneously which is preferred and
partly exsudes from wounds made purposely in the month of august many
other plants yield manna more sparingly sugar is properly made from the
saccharum officinale or sugarcane but is found in the roots of beet
and many other plants american wax is obtained from the myrica
cerifera candleberry myrtle the berries are boiled in water and a
green wax separates with lukewarm water the wax is yellow the seed of
croton sebiferum are lodged in tallow there are many other vegetable
exsudations used in the various arts of dyeing varnishing tanning
lacquering and which supply the shop of the druggist with medicines and
with poisons
there is another analogy which would seem to associate plants with
animals and which perhaps belongs to this note on glandulation i mean
the similarity of their digestive powers in the roots of growing
vegetables as in the process of making malt the farinaceous part of
the seed is converted into sugar by the vegetable power of digestion in
the same manner as the farinaceous matter of seeds are converted into
sweet chyle by the animal digestion the sapjuice which rises in the
vernal months from the roots of trees through the alburnum or sapwood
owes its sweetness i suppose to a similar digestive power of the
absorbent system of the young buds this exists in many vegetables in
great abundance as in vines sycamore birch and most abundantly in the
palmtree iserts voyage to guinea and seems to be a similar fluid
in all plants as chyle is similar in all animals
hence as the digested food of vegetables consists principally of sugar
and from that is produced again their mucilage starch and oil and
since animals are sustained by these vegetable productions it would
seem that the sugarmaking process carried on in vegetable vessels was
the great source of life to all organized beings and that if our
improved chemistry should ever discover the art of making sugar from
fossile or aerial matter without the assistance of vegetation food for
animals would then become as plentiful as water and mankind might live
upon the earth as thick as blades of grass with no restraint to their
numbers but the want of local room
it would seem that roots fixed in the earth and leaves innumerable
waving in the air were necessary for the decomposition of water and the
conversion of it into saccharine matter which would have been not only
cumberous but totally incompatible with the locomotion of animal bodies
for how could a man or quadruped have carried on his head or back a
forest of leaves or have had long branching lacteal or absorbent
vessels terminating in the earth animals therefore subsist on
vegetables that is they take the matter so far prepared and have
organs to prepare it further for the purposes of higher animation and
greater sensibility in the same manner the apparatus of green leaves
and long roots were found inconvenient for the more animated and
sensitive parts of vegetableflowers i mean the anthers and stigmas
which are therefore separate beings endued with the passion and power
of reproduction with lungs of their own and fed with honey a food
ready prepared by the long roots and green leaves of the plant and
presented to their absorbent mouths
from this outline a philosopher may catch a glimpse of the general
economy of nature and like the mariner cast upon an unknown shore who
rejoiced when he saw the print of a human foot upon the sand he may cry
out with rapture a god dwells here
