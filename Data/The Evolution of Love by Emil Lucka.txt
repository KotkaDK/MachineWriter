preface
the object of this book which is addressed to all cultured men and
women is to set forth the primitive manifestations of love and to throw
light on those strange emotional climaxes which i have called
metaphysical eroticism i have taken no account of historical detail
except where it served the purpose of proving explaining and
illustrating my subject nor have i hesitated to intermingle
psychological motives and motives arising from the growth and spread of
civilisation the inevitable result of a onesided glimpse at historical
facts would have been a history of love an undertaking for which i lack
both ability and inclination on the other hand had i written a merely
psychological treatise disregarding the succession of periods i should
have laid myself open to the just reproach of giving rein to my
imagination instead of dealing with reality
i have availed myself of historical facts to demonstrate that what
psychology has shown to be the necessary phases of the evolution of
love have actually existed in historical time and characterised a whole
period of civilisation the history of civilisation is an end in itself
only in the chapter entitled the birth of europe
my work is intended to be first and foremost a monograph on the
emotional life of the human race i am prepared to meet rather with
rejection than with approval neither the historian nor the psychologist
will be pleased moreover i am well aware that my standpoint is
hopelessly oldfashioned today nearly all the world is content to
look upon the sexual impulse as the source of all erotic emotion and to
regard love as nothing more nor less than its most exquisite radiation
my book on the contrary endeavours to establish its complete
independence of sexuality
my contention that so powerful an emotion as love should have come into
existence in historical not very remote times will seem very strange
for all outward profession of faith in evolution notwithstanding men
are still inclined to take the unchangeableness of human nature for
granted
the facts on which i have based my arguments are well known but my
deductions are new it is not for me to decide whether they are right or
wrong in the first introductory part i have made use of works already
in existence in addition to plato and the poets but the second and
third parts are founded almost entirely on original research

translators introduction
since the triumphant days of the mechanists some twentyfive years ago
the wedge of pragmatisma useful tool to be used and discardedhas
been driven between materialism and idealism and it appears that the
whole tendency of philosophy is now in the latter direction even in
england the influence of bergson has led modern thought away from the
pure materialism of the monists and it seems probable that benedetto
croces philosophy of the spirit will carry the movement a step nearer
towards the idealistic concept of reality and among the latest signs of
the new tendency must be counted the brilliant work of emil lucka the
young austrian poetphilosopher whose conception of the development
of love must rank with the most daring speculations in recent
psychology
in the great reaction of the last century love that most cogent motive
of human thought and action fell from its high estate and came to be
regarded as an instinct not differing in any essential from hunger and
thirst and existing like them from the beginning eternal and
immutable manifesting itself with equal force in the heart of man and
woman and impelling them towards each other but emil lucka in his
remarkable new book the three stages of love which was recently
published in berlin and has already created a sensation in literary
circles abroad leads us on to speculative heights from which we may
look back upon the whole theory of evolution not as a bar but as a
bridge my book is intended as a monograph of the emotional life of the
human race he says in the preface and i am prepared to meet with
rejection rather than with approval there has been abundance of
criticism and controversy but lucka has stated his case and drawn his
conclusions with such admirable precision and logic that his work has
aroused admiration and appreciation even in the ranks of his opponents
love is a theme which at all times and in all countries has been of
primary interest to men and women and therefore this book which throws
an illuminating ray of light in many a dark place still wrapped in
mystery and silence not only impresses the psychologist but also
fascinates the general reader with its wealth of interesting detail and
charm of expression
the three vitally important points which the author develops are as
follows
love is not a primary instinct but has been gradually evolved in
historical time
ernst haeckels biogenetic law is expanded in a psychogenetic law
only mans emotions have undergone evolution and therefore have a
history while those of woman have experienced no change
luckas book will probably not please the advanced feminists but the
delicate although perhaps involuntary homage to her sex which is
implied in his theories ought to rouse a feeling of gratification in the
heart of every rightfeeling woman the very limitations and
restrictions which he lays upon her raise and glorify her for while man
has been the odysseus wandering through heaven and hell passing from
the bestial to the divine to return again and become human woman has
always been the same unchangeable and without problems that which he
has set up today as his highest erotic ideal the blending of sexual
and spiritual love has been her natural endowment from the beginning
never perfect he falls into error and sin where she cannot err for her
instinct is nature herself and she knows not the meaning of sin
schopenhauers instinct of philoprogenitiveness has today become an
article of faith with the learned and the unlearned this subconscious
instinct for the service of the species which in love is supposed to
rise to consciousness and whose purpose is the will to produce the best
possible offspring is conceded by scientists who reject not only
schopenhauers metaphysic but metaphysic in general even nietzsche
that archindividualist has proved by many of his pronouncements and
most strikingly by his wellknown definition of marriage that he has
not escaped its fascinations schopenhauer ignores all phenomena which
are not in support of his myth says lucka who denies this instinct of
philoprogenitiveness and would substitute for it a pairinginstinct
the experience of others he argues not our own instinct has taught
us that children may not necessarily must be the result of the
union of the sexes into the mediaeval ideal which reached its climax in
metaphysical love the idea of propagation did not enter moreover the
desire for children is frequently unaccompanied by any sexual desire
and therefore to manufacture an instinct of philoprogenitiveness is
fantastic metaphysic and is entirely opposed to intellectual reality
this was well understood in the long period of antiquity which strictly
separated the sexual impulse and the desire for children
lucka distinguishes three great stages in the evolution of love in
vivid and fascinating pictures he unfolds the erotic life of our
primitive ancestors basing his statements on accepted authorities the
sexual impulse in those remote days unconscious of its nature and
farreaching consequences was entirely undifferentiated from any other
powerful instinct every woman of the tribe belonged to every male who
happened to desire her as is still the case with the aborigines of
central and northern australia the phenomena of pregnancy and
childbirth were attributed to witchcraft1 the concept of father had
not yet been formed the family congregated round the mother and saw in
her its natural chief gynecocracy was the prevailing form of
government in early historical and preclassical times promiscuity was
systematised by religion in india and the countries round the
mediterranean and survived in the temple prostitution and the mysteries
man as yet felt himself only as a part of nature and aspired to no more
than a life in harmony with her laws the worship of fertility and the
endless renewal of life was the object of the orgiastic cults of adonis
and astarte in the east and dionysus and aphrodite in greece unbridled
licentiousness and blind gratification of the senses their sacrament
with the growth of civilisation and the development of personality there
slowly crept into the minds of men a distaste for this irregular
sexuality and a desire for a less chaotic state of things this longing
and the wish for legitimate heirs gradually overcame promiscuity and in
greece led to the establishment of the monogamous system it must not
be assumed however that the greek ideal of marriage bore any
resemblance to our modern conception true the wife occupied an
honoured position as the guardian of hearth and children and was treated
by her husband with affection and respect but she was not free nor was
her husband expected to be faithful to her marriage in no way
restricted his liberty but left him free to seek intellectual
stimulation in the society of the hetaerae and gratification of the
senses in the company of his slaves love in our sense was unknown to
the ancients and although there is a modern note in the legends of the
faithful penelope and the love which united orpheus and eurydice yet
so lucka tells us these instances should be regarded rather as poetic
divinations of a future stage of feeling than actual facts then within
the scope of probability even plato in whom all wisdom and
antechristian culture culminated was still in this respect a citizen
of the old world for he too knew as yet nothing of the spiritual love
of a man for a woman to him the love of an individual was but a
beginning the road to the love of perfect beauty and the eternal ideas
on the threshold of the second stage of the erotic life stands
christianity which in sharp contrast to antiquity and to the classical
period sought the centre and climax of life in the soul the founder of
the religion of love discovered the individual and by so doing laid
the foundation for that metaphysical love which found its most striking
expression in the deification of woman and the cult of the virgin mary
how this change of mental attitude was brought about is worked out in a
brilliant chapter entitled the birth of europe the revivifying
influence of christs preaching and personality was stifled after the
first centuries by the rigid dogma and formalism which had altered his
doctrine almost past recognition the church was building up its
political structure and tolerated no rival art literature music all
the enthusiasm and profound thought of which the human mind is capable
were pressed into her service independent thought was heresy and the
death of every heretic became a new fetter which bound the intellect of
man but about the year 1100 when the mighty edifice was complete and
the pope and his bishops looked down upon kings and emperors and counted
them their vassals when the barbaric peoples which made up the
population of europe had been sufficiently schooled and educated in the
new direction a longing for something new a yearning for art for
poetry for beauty began to stir the hearts of men and women it found
expression in the ideal of chivalry the holy sepulchre and the holy
grail and suddenly love bursting out in a brilliant flame shed its
radiance on the sordid relationship which had hitherto existed between
the sexes and transfigured it woman the despised to whom at the
council of macon a soul had been denied all at once became a queen a
goddess the drudge the patiently suffering wife were things of the
past a new ideal had been set up and men worshipped it with bended
knees
     she shines on us as god shines on his angels
sang guinicelli
it was in a small country in the south of france in provence that the
new spirit was born the troubadours wandering from castle to castle
sang the praise of love genuine love the earlier ones without
admixture either of speculation or metaphysic the dogma that pure love
was its own reward inasmuch as it made men perfect was framed later on
     i cannot sin when i am in her mind
wrote guirot riquier and dante in the vita nuova calls his beloved
mistress the destroyer of all evil and the queen of all virtues the
monk matfre ermengau who wrote a textbook on love says
     love makes good men better
     and the worst man good
the later troubadours drew a much sharper distinction between spiritual
and sensual love the latter was regarded as degrading and base at
least in principle and woe to the man who held or rather avowed
another opinion his reward was the contempt of every man and woman of
culture i ask no more of my mistress than that she should suffer me to
serve her protested bernart de ventadour
it goes without saying that in spite of this high ideal sensuality
flourished undiminished and a troubadour who loudly sang the praise of
chastity and blatantly professed his entire disinterestedness in the
service of his mistress did not see the least inconsequence in carrying
on a dozen intrigues at the same time with other women sordello one of
the best known poets of this period was charged by a contemporary with
having changed his mistress over a hundred times and he himself
impudently bragging proclaims that
     none can resist me all the frowning husbands
     shall not prevent me to embrace their wives
     if i so wish
another poet count rambaut iii of orange recommended to his
fellowmen as the surest way of winning a womans favour to break her
nose with a blow of the fist i myself he continued treat all
women with tenderness and courtesy but theni am considered a fool
as may be expected sublimated metaphysical love was not without its
caricatures and eccentricities one of the most grotesque figures of the
period of the troubadours was ulrich von lichtenstein a german knight
as a page we are told he drank the water in which his mistress had
washed her hands later on he had his upper lip amputated because it
displeased his ladylove and on another occasion he cut off one of his
fingers had it set in gold and used as a clasp on a volume of his poems
which he sent as a present to his inamorata
at the famous courts of love the most extraordinary questions were
seriously discussed and decided a favourite subject for debate was the
relationship between love and marriage and some of the decisions which
have been preserved for us prove without a doubt that those two great
factors in the emotional life were considered irreconcilable at the
court of the viscountess ermengarde of narbonne the question whether
the love between lovers was greater than the love between husband and
wife was settled as follows nature and custom have erected an
insuperable barrier between conjugal affection and the love which
unites two lovers it would be absurd to draw comparisons between two
things which have neither resemblance nor connection
the contrast between the new spiritualised love and the older sexual
instinct created that dualism so characteristic of the whole mediaeval
period sexuality and love were felt as two inimical forces the fusion
of which was beyond the range of possibility while on the one hand
woman was worshipped as a divine being before whom all desire must be
silenced she was on the other hand stigmatised as the devils tool a
power which turned men away from his higher mission and jeopardised the
salvation of his soul wagner portrayed this dualism perfectly in
tannhauser a man of the middle ages says lucka would have
recognised in this magnificent work the tragedy of his soul
it was but a small step from the worship of a beloved mistress to the
cult of the virgin mary the church hostile at first finally
acquiesced and through her official acknowledgment of a female deity
open enmity between the religion of the church and the religion of woman
was avoided a woman that is to say the virgin mary had stepped
between god and humanity as mediator intercessor and saviour
both dante the inspired womanworshipper of the middle ages and the
more modern goethe saw in metaphysical love the triumph over all things
earthly and far above either of these intellectual heroes looms the
aweinspiring figure of michelangelo the scoffer to whom love came
late in life in his ecstatic adoration of vittoria colonna the
enthusiasm of plato and the passion of dante are blended in a more
transcendent flame
sexual mystics and the brides of christ present the darker aspect of
metaphysical love all the latter including even catherine of siena a
clever politician who kept up a correspondence with the leading
statesmen of her time marie of oignies and st teresa are
stigmatised as victims of hysteria and consigned to the domain of
pathology
while the first stage was characterised by the reign of unbridled sexual
instinct the second by the conflict between spiritual and sensual love
the third stage represents our modern conception the blending of
spiritual and sensual love which is not the differentiated sexual
instinct but a force embracing the psychophysical entity of the
beloved being without any consciousness of sexual desire it shares
with the purely metaphysical love the lovers longing to raise his
mistress above him and glorify her without any ulterior object and
desire in this stage there is no tyranny of man over woman as in the
sexual stage no subjection of man to woman as in the womanworship of
the middle ages but complete equality of the sexes a mutual give and
take if sexuality is infinite as matter spiritual love eternal as the
metaphysical ideal then the synthesis is human and personal the
apotheosis of this perfect love lucka finds in the liebestod the
death of the lovers in the ecstasy of love in wagners tristan und
isolde
an interesting chapter on erotic aberrations the demoniacal and the
obscene completes the third part of the book
there may be much in luckas theories which will rouse the scepticism of
the monists some of his deductions may appear to his readers a little
strained but no thinking man or woman can read his brilliant
conclusion without denying him the tribute of sincere admiration in
this last chapter he applies haeckels biogenetic law to the domain of
the spirit as the human embryo passes through the principal stages of
the development of the individual from lower forms of life so the
growing male must pass through the stages of psychical development
through which the race has passed the gynecocratic government of
prehistoric time is revived in the nursery where the mother rules
supreme and the sisters dominate the normal healthy schoolboy
preferring the company of his schoolfellows to all others shunning his
mother and sisters ashamed of his female relatives is the modern
individual representative of those early leagues and unions of young men
who opposed matriarchy and finally brought about its overthrow and the
establishment of male government the promiscuous sexuality
characteristic of adolescence reproduces the first merely sexual stage
of the erotic life of the race in the life of the individual as a rule
this phase is followed by a period of womanworship love has conquered
the sexual instinct and the latter is felt as base and degrading
atavism is not so much the persistence of the earlier as the absence of
the later stages of psychical development
i need not emphasise the fact that the three stages are often
intermingled and not traceable with equal clearness in the life of every
individual many men never advance beyond the first stage and others are
fragmentary and undeveloped but certain phases are more or less
distinguishable in every wellendowed male individual lucka finds a
perfect illustration of his theory in the life and works of richard
wagner whose operas the fairies based on shakespeares measure for
measure tannhauser and tristan und isolde successively
illustrate the three stages through which the great poetcomposer and
impassioned lover passed and reflect the principal haltingplaces in
the erotic evolution of the race in parsifal wagners last and
maturest work he conjectures a potential fourth stage divined by the
genius of the great musician and thinker a sublimation of our modern
ideal a stage when love will be freed from all sexual feeling a
conception not unlike otto weiningers but to which we have not yet
attained and which we are even unable fully to grasp
i have not been able to do more than touch upon the principal features
of this book the fame of whose brilliant author has long spread beyond
the boundaries of his own native country emil lucka was born in vienna
in 1877 and has already achieved a number of remarkably fine books
most of which have been translated into russian french and other
foreign languages he is as yet unknown in england this being the first
of his works to appear in english

1 cf hartlands primitive paternity and frazers golden bough
the evolution of love
the first stage the sexual instinct
to the generations slowly rising from the dark abyss of time to the
twilight of the middle ages the satisfaction of the sexual instinct
offered fewer difficulties than the gratification of any other need or
desire with every unpremeditated and cursory indulgence the craving
disappeared from consciousness and left the individual free to give his
mind to the acquisition of the necessities of life which were far more
difficult to obtain primitive prehistoric man lived in the moment
when there was plenty of food he gorged to repletion heedless of the
starvation which might be his fate tomorrow or the day after his
thought had neither breadth nor continuity it never occurred to him
that there might be a connection between an abrupt and quickly forgotten
embrace and the birth of a child by a woman of the tribe after what
appeared to be an immeasurable lapse of time he suspected witchcraft in
the phenomena of pregnancy and childbirth to this day the aborigines of
central and northern australia do not realise the connection between
generation and birth as a rule it was remembered that a certain woman
had given birth to a certain child by the fact of her having carried it
about and fed it at her breast occasionally it was forgotten to which
mother a child belonged perhaps the mother had died perhaps the child
had strayed beyond the boundaries of the community and the mother had
failed to recognise it on its return but it was clear beyond all doubt
that every child had a mother the conception of father had not yet
been formed experience had taught our primitive ancestors two
undeniable facts namely that women gave birth to children and that
every child had a mother
we must assume that sexual intercourse was irregular and haphazard up to
the dawn of history every womanwithin the limits of her own tribe
probablybelonged to every man whether this assumption is universally
applicable or not must remain doubtful later ethnologists more
particularly von westermarck deny it because it does not apply to
every savage tribe of the present day herodotus tells us that
promiscuity existed in historical times in countries as far removed from
each other as ethiopia and the borders of the caspian sea there can be
no reasonable doubt that sexual intercourse took the form of
groupmarriage the exchange or lending of wives and other similar
arrangements
the relationship between mother and child having been established by
nature herself the first human family congregated round the mother
acknowledging her as its natural chief this continued even after the
causal connection between generation and birth had ceased to be a
mystery in all countries on the mediterranean more especially in
lycia crete and egypt the predominance of the female element in state
and family is well attested it is reflected in the natural religions of
the eastern racesboth semitic and aryanand we find innumerable
traces of it in greek mythology the merit of discovering this important
stage in the relationship of the sexes is due to bachofen based on
lifegiving motherhood he says gynecocracy was completely dominated
by the natural principles and phenomena which rule its inner and outer
life it vividly realised the unity of nature the harmony of the
universe which it had not yet outgrown in every respect obedient to
the laws of physical existence its gaze was fixed upon the earth it
worshipped the chthonian powers rather than the gods of light the
children of men who had sprung from their mother as the flowers spring
from the soil raised altars to gaea demeter and isis the deities of
inexhaustible fertility and abundance these early races of men realised
themselves only as a part of nature they had not yet conceived the idea
of rising above their condition and setting their intelligence to battle
with its blind laws incapable of realising their individuality they
bowed in passive submission to natures undisputed sway they were
members of a tribe and the fragmentary existence of the single
individual was of no importance when it clashed with the welfare of the
clan the familycentred round the motherand the tribe were the real
individuals in the same way as the swarm of bees and not the
individual bee makes the whole they lived in complete harmony with
nature they had no spiritual life no history for civilisation and the
creation of intellectual values which are the foundation of history
depend on the rise of a community above primitive conditions
differentiation had hardly begun to exert its modifying influence all
men not unlike the eastern asiatics of our day resembled each other in
looks character and habits
in the countries on the mediterranean as well as in india and
babylonia the first stage of sexual intercourse irresponsible and
promiscuous was systematised by religion the annual springfestivals
in honour of adonis dionysus mylitta astarte and aphrodite
celebrated unbridled licentiousness the whole community greeted the
reawakening vitality of the earth by an unrestrained abandonment to
passion man aspired to be no more than the flower which scatters its
seed to the winds the incomprehensible lords of cupidity and rank
vegetation did not suffer the individualisation of desire the complete
union of the male and female qualities as manifested both in nature and
man was solemnised in the orgies and not by any means the relationship
of an individual man to an individual woman or sexuality connected with
individuals and dominated by them nor was this unfettering of instinct
a symbolical act for it to be so man must have stood over against
nature as an intellectual being mirroring and transforming her acts by
his own deeds he was as yet far from this his ambition did not reach
beyond the desire to fulfil nature in himself before the majesty of
sexworshipped in the vague shadowy mothers of mankind rhea demeter
cybele and their human offspring the phallic dionysus and the
hundredbreasted goddess of ephesusthe individual with his piteous
limitations shrank into insignificance sex was immortal sex and
primary matter the greek ul contrasted by aristotle with the
greek eisos the form the female principle is the mother of the
body but the mother of the spirit is the male the substance of those
ancient cults was birth and death meaningless purposeless apparently
without rhyme or reason their sacrament the perpetual union of the
sexes between the succeeding generations there was but one bond the
natural bond of motherhood it was the first tie realised by mankind a
tie not felt as a concrete relationship between two individuals but as
a general maternal natural force the presiding divinities were the
mothers the eternal incorporeal deities enthroned outside time and
space and therefore immortal givers of life and preservers of mankind
before their silent greatness the desire of man to know his whence and
whither to win shape and individuality became blasphemy they had
given immortality to sex but upon the individual they had laid the
curse of death
thus we have first a stage of fatherless natural conception
corresponding with the philosophical theories which maintained that all
created things had sprung from the elements later ages discovered a
spiritual principle a becoming or an eternal being and finally a
conflict between spirit and matter
but the general attitude towards sexual intercourse underwent a change
as soon as here and there individuals appeared who were conscious of
their individuality natural selection could not come into play in a
community the members of which resembled one another so closely that all
personal characteristics were obliterated in a general monotony one
woman was as good as another although in all probability a healthy
youthful and strong individual would be preferred to a sickly puny
specimen but apart from this the wish to choose a partner instead of
being content with the first comer must have coincided historically
with the outward and later on with the inward differentiation of the
race i cannot prove my theory by quoting chapter and verse from ancient
writers but obviously a feeling of preference could not have arisen
until individuals had begun to show very noticeable traces of
difference therefore with growing differentiation a new factormodest
at first and operating within narrow limitsthe factor of choice had
come into the sexual life the slow development of personality gave
birth to the feeling which rebelled against universal sexual intercourse
and gynecocracy in general the men desired to shape their own world
they had no share in the immortality of maternal life as relatively
speaking single individuals they stood over against the material bond
of the generations living in the chain of the mothers demigods the
sons of the gods of light and mortal mothers were credited with the
salvation of men from a confused chaotic existence and the
introduction of new conditions of life no longer based on the dictates
of nature but on the moulding genius of man hercules theseus and
perseus overthrew the ancient powers of darkness they laid the
foundations of mans great achievement civilisation and were the
first to worship the gods of light they delivered humanity from the
gross materialism in which it had hitherto been steeped they were the
awakeners of spiritual life which is a higher life than the life of the
senses they were as incorruptible as the sun from whence they came the
heroes of a new civilisation distinguished by gentleness a higher
endeavour and a new dispensation bachofen
heinrich schurtz has proved though not in connection with matriarchy
that side by side with the family unions of unmarried men existed in
many countries at a very early time the object of these unions which
had nothing of the rigidity of bloodrelationship was fellowship as
soon as the boys had outgrown the care of their mother they were
compelled to combine for the purpose of playing games and later on for
war and hunting these mens unions therefore were the outcome of the
necessary conditions of life it is obvious that innovations and
inventions of all sorts originated in these unions rather than with the
temperamentally conservative women and that we have to look upon them
as the hotbed of all spiritual and social evolution these
confederations and leagues not based on a natural or bloodrelationship
but on a feeling of brotherhood and friendliness might well have been
an attack upon the natural ties of the family an expression of a
feeling of hostility to and contempt for women and probably stood in
close relationship to a striking characteristic of the past a widely
spread homosexuality
whether schurtz gives us a correct picture of these mens unions or not
there can be no doubt that the struggle against matriarchy originated in
them this struggle led eventually to the victory of the male principle
the acknowledgment of the authority of the father the institution of
male government which deprived women of all legal rights and the
dominion of the spiritual the victory of the gods of light over the
dark lords of fertility this revolution of principles was perhaps the
completest revolution humanity has ever known
a long road marked by numerous compromises and limitations led from
casual intercourse to the final establishment of the monogamous system
free intercourse had been sanctioned by the gods who suffered no
restrictions and modifications and sacrifices in the shape of a
temporary universal unfettering of instinct were required to pacify
their anger and reconcile them to the new system the first and most
important of these compromises was the templeprostitution practised by
many nations in asia minor the greek archipelago india and babylonia
many a girl gained in this way the marriage portion which enabled her
later on to find a husband to whom she invariably remained strictly
loyal thus all religious requirements were satisfied at first this was
an annually recurring rite but gradually it became an isolated ceremony
in the life of every female individual in the place of the annual
surrender says priester we now have a single act the hetaerism of
the matrons is succeeded by the hetaerism of the maids instead of being
practised during marriage it is practised in spinsterhood the blind
surrender has given way to a yielding to certain individuals
with the growth of civilisation a few girls the hierodules were set
apart for the purpose of pacifying the offended deities and their act
ransomed the rest of the female citizens
it was not on erotic grounds but for political and social reasons that
the greek introduced monogamy the reason which weighed in the scales
more heavily than all others was the necessity for legitimate offspring
it was natural that a man of property should desire a legitimate heir
who would inherit it on his death the right of succession from father
to son incorporated later on in the roman right originated during this
period but this was not the only advantage connected with the
possession of a son religion taught that after death the body required
sacrificial food which could only be provided by the legitimate male
descendants of the deceased the same belief was held by the indians
and eastern asiatics in several greek states marriage was compulsory
and bachelors were fined at the same time the contraction of a marriage
did not interfere with the personal freedom of the man he was at
liberty to go to the hetaerae for intellectual stimulation unless he
happened to prefer the friends of his own sex and to his slaves for the
pleasures of the senses his wife although she was not free was
respected by him as the guardian of his hearth and children there was
but one legal reason for divorce sterility which frustrated the object
of matrimony conjugal love as we understand it did not exist it is a
feeling which was entirely unknown to the ancients
with the exception of the gradually weakening hold of religion on the
imagination of the people towards the decline of the roman empire no
perceptible change occurred in the social life of the old world until
the dawn of the middle ages to quote otto seeck a wife had no other
task than to produce legitimate offspring and yet she gave herself airs
and graces embittered her husbands life with her jealousy and bad
temper or worse even set all tongues wagging with her evil conduct is
it to be wondered at that marriage was merely regarded as a duty to the
state and that a great number of men were not sufficiently patriotic to
take such a burden upon their shoulders
thus the victory of the male spiritual principle over universal sexual
intercourse ushered in the second stage which checked the sexual impulse
and directed it upon certain individuals a distinction however which
bears no relation to love
monogamy had conquered in principle at least and as an ideal
the profoundly mystical core of the most powerful greek tragedy which
has come down to our time the orestes of aeschylus represents the
victory of the new gods of light over the old maternal powers orestes
has sinned against the old law for in order to avenge his fathers
death he has slain his mother the sungod apollo and the sinister
erinnys the upholders of the old maternal right are waging war over
the justifiableness of the deed to the erinnys matricide is the
foulest of all crimes for man is more nearly related to the mother than
to the father but apollo had commanded the deed so that the fathers
murder should not remain unavenged
     not to the mother is the child indebted
     for life she tends and guards the kindling spark
     the father lighted she but holds his pledge
he explains and the answer is the lament of the erinnys
     thus thou destroyst the gods of ancient times
athene the virgin goddess the motherless daughter of zeus appearing
as mediator between the opponents decides in favour of the new
dispensation which places the fathers claim above the mothers orestes
is free of guilt his deed was justifiable according to the canons of
the new law the tragedy is the symbolical commemoration of the victory
of the male principle in greece but athene is the embodiment of the new
hermaphroditic ideal of the greek which stood in close connexion to
their homosexuality and with which i propose to deal later on
there is a psychical law ordaining that nothing which has ever quickened
the soul of man shall be entirely lost were it not so the storehouses
of the soul would stand empty new values are created but the old
verities endure as a rule they are relegated to a lower sphere to
inferior social layers but they persist and frequently merge into the
new this law applies without exception to the relationship between the
sexes we shall come upon it again and again during the second stage
characterised by the spiritual love foreign to the ancients the purely
sexual impulse continued as an unimpaired force but it had lost its
prestige and was not only regarded as ignoble and base but also
stigmatised as sinful and demoniacal the hearts of men were stirred by
new ideals
a similar attitude perhaps not quite so uncompromising because the
contrast was less pronounced existed in classical greece the more
highly developed selfconscious hellenic genius shrinking from
promiscuous intercourse had systematised the instinct and set up a new
ideal in platonic love but below the surface raged the unbridled
natural force and in perfect harmony with the greek spiritit was not
hysterically hidden but assigned a place in the new system wrapped in
the obscurity of the mysteries concealed from the gaze of the new gods
of light it attempted to assuage its inextinguishable thirst the
mysteries were the annual tribute paid as a ransom by apolloworshipping
hellas to chaotic asia so that she might be free to pursue her higher
psychospiritual aims the brilliant civilisation of athens was based on
the dark cult of the mysteries on the festivals of the hermaphroditic
dionysus and demeter which are identical with the cults of adonis and
mylitta the impersonal generative elements were worshipped thus
below the surface of the greek state founded on masculine values and
attempting to restrict intercourse for the benefit of a more
systematised progeniture flourished the orgiastic cult of the ancient
eastern deities who had vouchsafed to mortals a glimpse of the great
secret of life in the ardour of procreation and conception the women
upheld the religion of passion as an end in itself bacchantes men in
female attire emasculated priests sacrificed to the blindly bountiful
gods we are told that dionysus conquered even the amazons and converted
them to his worship euripides described in the bacchantesthe
subject of which is the war between the uncontrolled sexual impulse and
the new order of thingshow dionysus traversed all asia and finally
arrived in hellas accompanied by a crowd of abandoned women but his
religion was more than a cult of wine and sensual pleasure it embraced
a gentle worship of nature throwing down the barrier between man and
beastimpassable by the spirit of civilisationand lovingly including
every living creature we read in the bacchantes that the women who
had fled from the town to follow the irresistible stranger dionysus
dwelled in the mountains binding their hair with tame adders carrying
in their arms the cubs of wolves and the young deer and feeding them
with the milk of their breasts that milk and wine welled up when they
struck the earth with the thyrsus and so on dionysus implores
pentheus the representative of the hellenic masculine system not to
venture undisguised among the maenads theyll murder you if they
divine your sex and knowing the secret of the male and female temper
                        first let
     his mind be clouded by a slight disorder
     for conscious of his manhood he will never
     wear womens garb insane hes sure to wear it
pentheus recognising in dionysus the foe of a more spiritual conception
of the law the effeminate stranger who had driven the women to
madness is torn to pieces by the frenzied bacchantes who fall upon him
led by agave his mother and sacrificed to the bullgod dionysus at
the conclusion of this strange and profound epos agave recovers her
senses and curses the acts which she has committed in her madness 
women submit to the new spiritual dispensation we realise now why hera
the tutelary goddess of the newly introduced monogamous system hated
dionysus and attempted to kill him before he was born
the subject treated in the beautiful myth of orpheus is the
relationship between the primitive sexual impulse and its
individualisation on a single personality for seven months orpheus
bewails the death of eurydice and regards all other living creatures
with indifference this loyalty offends and infuriates the women of
thracia who divine in it a spirit inimical to a life in harmony with
nature one night during the celebration of the dionysian rites they
attack the poetthe representative of the higher hellenic poetical
idealsand rend him limb from limb but as the head of the murdered
singer floats down the river the pale lips still frame the beloved
name eurydice it is certain that in those remote legendary days such
love did not exist but the prophetic greek spirit contrasted
promiscuous intercourse with love for a single woman
so far we have encountered only a general not an individualised sexual
instinct and in a limited measure at least a struggling tendency
towards individualisation but even so it was merely a question of
instinct and did not bear the least resemblance to love as we
understand it today love did not exist in the old world i admit
that in the legend of orpheus we are face to face with a sentiment which
is not unlike modern love but as far as i am aware this is an
isolated case in greek history and may be regarded as a divination of
something new just as we find unmistakable anticipations of
christianity in platos writings such phenomenathe occasional
occurrence of which i do not altogether deny although i regard them as
on the whole improbable as far as the sphere of my research is
concernedare not infrequently met with in history but their effect
upon civilisation was nil they were presentiments incomprehensible in
their day and for this very reason probably preserved as curiosities
in spite of the fact however that in those faroff days spiritual love
of a man for a woman was unknown we find plato contrasting a base and
degraded eros with a divine eros pausanias says in the symposium
the man who loves with his senses only loves women and boys equally
well he loves the body more than the soul his only striving is to
obtain the object of his desire and he cares not whether it be worthy
or unworthy the eros he worships is the ally of that younger goddess in
whom male and female attributes are blended but the other eros is the
companion of aphrodite urania the divine unbegotten by a father
unconceived by a mother she is the offspring of the male element the
elder one unstained by passion the sensualist who loves the body
more than the soul is base his love passes away like the object of his
passion but the companion of the olympic goddess is the eros who fills
the hearts of the lovers with the longing for virtue the other eros is
the confederate of the debased aphrodite and aristophanes another of
the participators in the feast says the yearning does not seem to be
a desire for the pleasures of the senses the one taking delight in his
intercourse with the other far from it it is obvious that each soul is
craving for something which it cannot express in words but can only
divine and conjecture and the mysterious diotima revealed to socrates
an entirely novel principle in erotic life the principle which guides
man beyond the pleasures of the senses andthrough loveleads him to
the divine the slave of his senses runs after women but he who loves
with his soul and strives to win immortality through virtue and wisdom
seeks a great and beautiful soul that he may surrender himself to it
completely but in the opinion of the classical ages a beautiful soul
was only to be found in the body of a man woman belonged to the lower
animal spheres she was destined for the pleasure of the senses and the
propagation of the race platos theory of ideas is the philosophical
victory of the malespiritual principle over nature matter and their
warden woman perhaps it is even the revenge of the greek genius for
mans original enslavement love between men continues the seer
forms a stronger tie a closer friendship than love between parents
and children it has a mutual share in children which are immortal and
far more beautiful than the children of men she teaches socrates that
this noble love is at the root of all the magnificent creations of the
spirit as carnal love is the origin of human life until he becomes
aware that the beauty of all bodies is closely related a man must love
an individual with all his heart if a man will follow after beauty he
is foolish not to conceive the beauty of all bodies as one and the same
as soon as he has learned this he will become a lover of all beautiful
forms his fervent passion for one will diminish he will scorn the
individual and hold it cheap
with the hellenic homosexuality an element foreign and even hostile to
the original and natural bisexual sensuality crept into the erotic life
of the human race it found its classical representation in the platonic
dialogues symposium and phaedros in conscious opposition to all
sexuality platonic love what is usually called platonic love is based
on an obstinate misunderstanding turns to the purely spiritual that is
to say the conceptions of truth beauty and goodness it is a yearning
for the supernatural and it knows itself as the path to it in the
mutual love of all noble souls lies the germ of all higher things it is
the way to the gods of light which in this connection are conceived
philosophically as ideas though in the true hellenic spirit as
objective ideas the prototypes and culminations of everything human to
grasp the meaning of platonic love it is essential to realise
thatunlike the spiritual womanworship peculiar to the middle
agesit is not a personal feeling of one individual for another
platonically speaking the love for an individual is only a first stage
the path which leads to the love of beauty and the eternal ideas the
characteristic of this metaphysical love which plato was the first to
conceive was therefore love for the universal and not love for an
individual the latter as we shall find later on is the characteristic
of the true or more modestly speaking specifically european conception
of love platonic love finally was the perception of perfection the
socratic knowledge its alpha and omega was not as the mystic and true
erotic would have it its ardour and passion the fulness of its own
being it had an alien purpose the knowledge of things divine by a
later period christianised and understood as the divine mysteries to
plato the essence and climax of antique antechristian culture every
individual even the beloved mistress was but a preliminary a
fingerpost pointing the way to the perception of perfect beauty true
virtue is the outcome of profound knowledge it transforms men into
gods the purely spiritual womanworship of the middle ages was only
another aspect of this yearning to attain to virtue and perfection
through the love of an individual we must not lose sight of the fact
that it was already strongly emphasised and upheld in the platonic ideal
of love
in the dark excesses of the mysteries the beauty of the human form
counted for nothing voluptuousness and intoxication ruled in the
asiatic cult of the sexes there was no room for beauty no time for
selection the greeks were the discoverers of the beauty of the human
form beauty kindled the flame of love in their souls beauty was the
gauge which determined their erotic values their ideal was a
kalokagathos a youth beautiful in body and soul
in phaedros plato contrasts with far greater force than in the
symposium him who craves for sensual pleasure like the beasts in the
fields with him who strives after beauty and perfection to the
latter the face of the beloved is the reflection of the sublimely
beautiful he would like to sacrifice to her as to the immortal gods
all beautiful bodies represent to him in an increasing measure the idea
of the beauty of form which again is subordinate to the beauty of the
soul it points the way to metaphysical beauty the eternal and
imperishable idea of mankind socrates could scorn the beauty of the
individual because he saw in it merely an imperfect reflection of
perfect beauty in its truest sense platonic love is therefore
impersonal it is not spiritual love for a human being but a peculiar
characteristic of the greek cult of beauty we shall again meet this
principle of beautyworship in metaphysical love the adoration of
woman thanks to plato it has for all time become the inalienable
property of the human mind the striving to rise above all individualism
was another ideal which a later period revived but the pivot round
which the emotions revolved was the love for a beloved individual the
modern european fundamental motive as opposed to the antique platonic
cult of ideas thus plato too was a citizen of the old world at whose
threshold stood universal sexual intercourse tolerating nothing
personal knowing of no individuals acknowledging only unchecked
uncontrollable instinct and whose decline was again characterised by
the extreme impersonality of ideas it had traversed the path of human
existence in a huge cycle starting from an unconscious existence in
complete harmony with nature it had passed through individualised man
to the loftiest spiritual conceptions in the impersonal world of ideas
the hellenic ideal of beauty was almost invariably realised in the male
form the greeks of the classical period disdained woman she was for
them inseparably connected with base sensuality but their contempt had
its source partly in a feeling of horror the days when matriarchy was
the form of government were not very remote it survived in a great
number of myths and also subconsciously perhaps in the soul of man to
the greek mind woman was the embodiment of the dark side of love and it
was merely the logical conclusion of this conception when at a later
period she was regarded as the devils tool it is certain that the
origin of the idea must be sought in platos time
in intercourse with women man dimly felt the vague elementary condition
from which he had struggled hard to emerge and fled to the more
familiar companions of his own sex would not love between man and man
deliver him from the basely sensual strengthen his spirituality and
lead him to the gods in this connection zeus is called in phaedros
greek philios the maker of friendships plato in propounding this
doctrine drew thereby the most radical conclusion of the new
apparently male but at heart hermaphroditic ideal of civilisation
conceived in the heroic epoch and elaborated and brought to perfection
by the greek of classical times this ideal was the victory of the
spiritual principle over promiscuous sexuality and irresponsible
propagation and quite in the true hellenic spirit it was again
interpreted materially
because individualised love was an unknown quantity to the ancients
they ornamented their sarcophagi with symbols of ecstatic life with
dancing and embracing fauns and maenads generations passed away but
new ones arose embracing and begetting lifefor life was eternal
death was vanquished in the ecstasy of the nameless millions for the
true meaning of life lay in the preservation of the species the death
of the individual did not have a deep and poignant meaning until the
soul had become the centre and climax of life an individual had passed
away for evernothing could recall him death had become the final
issue the terror because it destroyed the greatest of all things
selfconscious man but love too had changed it was no longer sexual
impulse depending on the body and perishing with it but a craving of
the soul conscious of itself and stretching out feelers far beyond the
earth a new pang had come into the world but also a new
reconciliation
the second stage love
chapter i
the birth of europe
the memory of the figure and preaching of christ had so powerfully
influenced the centuries that it had gradually permeated and transformed
not only the platonic doctrine of ideasthat maturest fruit of greek
wisdombut also the semitic mediaeval monotheism something new had
sprung into being something which expressed a hitherto unknown feeling
for life and for humanity vague and uncertain in the beginning but
growing in clearness and uniformity on the throne of the roman emperors
sat a bishop whose power was increasing with the development of the new
civilisation and whom the final victory of the new transcendental
worldprinciple had made master of the world the building up of this
new civilisation had absorbed the intellectual force of a thousand
years it had monopolised thought and every form of energy the reward
was great for the first time in the annals of the world the
questionings of brooding intelligence were fully answered the anguish
of the tortured soul was stilled the purpose of the universe the
destiny of man were comprehended and interpreted good and evil being
finally known at the close of the first christian millenary all moral
and intellectual values were grouped round and dominated by one supreme
ideal the loftiest value in this world and the next side by side with
the greatest secular power were in the hands of the church together
with the imperium she had succeeded to the spiritual and ethical
inheritance of the dead civilisations without her uncouth barbarism
reigned and it was her task while elaborating the system of the
universe for which she stood to teach and convert the new nations to
spread a uniform christian civilisation
on the mere face of it it must seem strange that a religion which had
grown on foreign soil out of foreign spiritual assumptions should have
been accepted so readily and quickly by nations to whom it must have
been alien and unintelligible the love of war and valour of the
teutonic tribes and christian asceticism were diametrically opposed
ideals and very often their relationship was one of direct hostility i
need only remind the reader of the contempt expressed for the chaplain
by hagen in the song of the niebelungen on the other hand the
ancient celtic and teutonic races shared one profound characteristic
with the christian world the consequences of which were sufficiently
farreaching to raise the religion of christ to the religion of europe
the characteristic common to the still uncultivated european spirit and
christianity and meaningless alike to the asiatic barbarians the jews
of the old testament and the greeks was the importance which both
attached to the individual soul through the christian religion this new
intuition which saw in the soul of man the highest of values became the
centre and pivot of life and faitha position to which even plato to
whom the objective metaphysical idea was the essential never attained
it had been the most personal experience of christ and centuries after
his death the nations rediscovered it as their highest value it
entitled christianity to become the natural religion of europe and the
soul of its new system of civilisation it formed the most complete
contrast to all asiatic cults brahminism and buddhism a fact which
since schopenhauer one is inclined to overlook to the indian the soul
of man is not an entity his consciousness is a republic as it were
composed of diverse spiritual principles and metaphysical forces which
are not centralised into an icentre but exist impersonally side by
side this may be a great conception but it is foreign to the feeling
of the citizen of europe to the latter the i the soul the
personality is the pivot round which life turns the evolution of the
european worldfeeling is in the direction of the independent
development of all psychical forces and their fusion into a unity of
everincreasing intimacy new values will be created but the fusing
power of the soul will strive with growing intensity to coordinate and
unify the internal and external life personality will recreate the
world in conformity with its own purposes that is to say it will found
the system of objective civilisation the incapacity of the indian to
produce a civilisation perfect in every direction is explained by his
onesided morallyspeculative thought the world is to him nothing but
a moral phenomenon he admits no other explanation he seeks its true
meaning and the possibility of its salvation in the realisation of the
vanity of life not in the liberating deed and not in the inward
change
the kernel of matured and spiritualised christianity which reached its
apex in the german mystics lies in the soul of man eager to shed
everything which is subjective and accidental and become spirit
profound divine reality eckhart the great perfecter of this european
religion deliberately and in direct contradiction to the dogma of his
time placed man above the highest angels whom he considered subject
to limitations man he argues thanks to his freedom is able to
reach a goal to which no angel could aspire for he is always new
infinitely exalted above the limitations of the angels and all finite
reason of the relationship between the soul and god he says the soul
of the righteous man shall be with god his equal and compeer no more
and no less the upanishads on the other hand maintain that the core
of the world is not to be found in the soul of the individual but in
brahma the universal soul outside whom there is no reality the
individual soul is but a phantasm of the universal soul as the
reflection of the sun in the water is but a phantasm of the sun the
sole purpose of the world is the extinction of individual consciousness
its absorption in brahma the end of all suffering when feeling has
ceased pain must cease too and the world be delivered the indian
lacks the central conception of love for which he substitutes
knowledge primitive christianity conceived the connection between body
and soul the encumbering of the soul by the body as it were as a
temptation or a punishment according to the vedas it is merely a
delusion to which the sage is not subject before his keen vision the
deception falls to the ground and by this very fact he is delivered to
the feeling of europe and christianity however life and the universe
are genuine deep realities the touchstone of the soul love is the
souls greatest treasure and the only true path to god knowledge can
never take its place the divine stream of love flowing through the
soul says eckhart carries the soul along with it to its origin to
the bourne of all knowledge to god
the very general identification of the christian and indian mysticsa
fact which is accounted for by their common metaphysical tendencyis
based on an error indian mysticism and christian mysticism originated
in different concepts here the centre of all being is laid in love and
in the soul of man there it is contained in knowledge and in brahma
but ultimately at the termination of the worldprocess they will meet
although coming from different directions while the soul worships a
god realises a god and knows of a god says eckhart it is separated
from god this is gods purpose to annihilate himself in the soul so
that the soul too shall lose itself for god has been called god by
the creatures the words the soul creates god from within is
connected with the divine and becomes divine itself are highly
significant to the vedantist the soul of man is an emanation from the
worldsoul although god differs from the individual soul the
individual soul does not differ from god at this point it is no longer
an easy matter to distinguish the feeling of the christian mystic from
the feeling of the brahmin though their valuations of man life and the
world differ nay are even opposed to each other they finally meet in
god we read in the vedanta the force which created and maintains the
universe the eternal principle of all being dwells entirely and
undividedly in every one of us our self is identical with the supreme
deity and only apparently differentiated from it whosoever has mastered
this truth has become at one with all creation whosoever has not
mastered it is a stranger and a foe to all creatures
i do not intend to depreciate indian wisdom i merely desire to point
out its inherent dissimilarity to western thought my task of laying
hold of the spirit of europe in its crises and watching its growth is
bound to be advanced by this division
the religious experience of christ based on the realisation of the
divine nature of the soul and the road of the soul to god has
established the fundamental western principle a worldsystem was built
up which emanated from the innermost depth of the individual soul and
very consistently related all existing things heaven and earth the
creation and the destruction of the world salvation and perdition to
the soul of man this was achieved with the aid of a nave metaphysic
created by the greek genius and externalised by the crude intellect of
barbarians this metaphysic drew its whole content from a unique
revelation and the essential was frequently hidden by dialectic and
speculation one may safely say that the first millenary strove if not
exactly to set aside the original principle of christianity yet to bind
it by dogma in such a way that it often became completely obscured a
long training was necessary before the immature nations of barbarians
were fit to become citizens of the spiritual world before they could
fully assimilate the new traditions and grasp their innermost meaning
which by this very fact became altered and modified this process of
education came to a temporary conclusion about the year 1100 at last
the european nations had outgrown the guardianship of the church with
its antiquated methods a new a creative epoch was dawning the
civilisation of europe opposed to all barbarism and orientalism rose
like a brilliant star on the horizon of the world spontaneous feeling
for the race for nature and for the divine verities had again become
possible
i shall have to exceed the limits of my subject in this chapter for i
propose showing the seeds from which in the time of the crusades the
new soul of the european throwing off the lethargy of the first
christian millenary began to grow with extraordinary vigour and
rapidity that new soul which experienced a wider if not deeper
unfolding in the period of the renascence and to this day pervades and
fertilises our spiritual life i might have been less digressive but i
hope that two reasons will justify my prolixity the first is the great
importance of the subject from the point of view of a history of
civilisation and the second and more particular one is its close inner
relationship to my principal theme for in complete contrast with the
sexuality on which heretofore the relationship between husband and wife
had been based a new feeling that of spiritual love had come into
existence and quickly reached its climax projected not only on the
other sex but also on god and on nature it permeated the age and
explains its great and unprecedented manifestations the spiritual love
between man and woman which deteriorated later on into the deification
of woman the new religion of the german mystics the awakening
appreciation of the beauty of nature the sudden outburst of german
poetryno sooner born than it reached perfectionthe specifically
european gothic architecture so completely independent of the old art
all these new creations had their origin in the strange craving of the
period for something novel and romantic something hitherto unknown
this longing begot the ideal of chivalry and a wealth of half human
half preterhuman conceptions such as the holy sepulchre and the holy
grail and all at once something unprecedented something of which the
race had as yet no experience had come to pass love which had nothing
in common with sensuality which was even deliberately hostile to it
love which welled up in one soul and flowed into the otherpresupposing
personalitylove was there if therefore i have gone into detail i
hope that it has served to elucidate the principal theme of this part of
my book namely the spiritual part of man for woman aspiring to the
metaphysical which is so alien to our modern feeling
it is necessary to begin by sketching a background which shall set off
the new phenomenon the spiritual achievement of the first millenary was
the construction of the christian system of the universe the church had
complete knowledge of all things in heaven and earthsymbols merely of
the eternal verities her wisdom almost equalled divine wisdom for the
secrets of life and death had been revealed and surrendered to her st
chrysostoms words uttered in the fourth century the church is god
had become a fact the profoundest wisdom the greatest power were
hers the loftiest ideal had been realised as it has never been realised
before or since as the wisdom of the church had been a direct gift of
god so her power too had divine origin and reached beyond this
earthly life the church alone held the key to eternal bliss her curse
meant everlasting damnation to be excommunicated was to be bereaved of
temporal and eternal happiness a man who had been excommunicated was
worse off than a wild beast he was surrendered to the devils in hell
and he knew it there was but one road to salvation to do penance and
humbly submit to the church this has been symbolised for all times by
the memorable submission of the romangerman emperor who stood for
three days barefooted and fasting in the snow in the courtyard of
canossa before he was received back into the kingdom of god the
kingdom of god was synonymous with the church jews and pagans were the
natural children of the devil but the dissenter the heretic who dared
to question a single proposition of the divine system or was bold
enough to think on original linesin other words in contradiction to
traditionvoluntarily turned his back on god and with seeing eyes went
into the kingdom of the devil he was wholly evil and no earthly
punishment fitted his crime the emperor theodosius as far back as ad
380 had called such heretics insane and demented and the burning of
their bodies at the stake which prevented their souls from falling into
the hands of the devil was looked upon as a great and undeserved mercy
but not only during their lifetime but after their death too the hand
of the church fell heavily on all those who had strayed beyond her pale
their bodies were dragged from their graves and thrown into the
carrionpit a man whom the church had excommunicated was buried in the
cemetery of a german convent the archbishop of mayence ordered the
exhumation of the body threatening to interdict divine service in the
convent if his command were disobeyed but the abbess hildegarde of
bingen 10981179 a woman of great mental power and an inspired seer
opposed him having received a direct message from god she wrote to the
bishop as follows conforming to my custom i looked up to the true
light and god commanded me to withhold my consent to the exhumation of
the body because he himself took the dead man from the pale of the
church so that he might lead him to the beatitude of the blessed it
were better for me to fall into the hands of man than to disobey the
command of my lord the saint had interpreted the will of god and the
archbishop sanctioning a sudden rumour that the deceased had received
absolution at the eleventh hour yielded but the bishops yielding by
no means countenanced the belief that god might for once tolerate the
body of an excommunicate in sacred ground far from itthe vision of
the abbess hildegarde had merely served to correct an error
all those who dared to oppose the clergy by word or deed were doomed to
everlasting perditionthis was a fact which it were futile to doubt at
the most a man shrugged his shoulders at certain damnation for the sake
of mundane pleasuresa rich legacy in the hour of death might save him
not infrequently the fear of the devil was transformed into
indifference and sometimes even into demonolatry a single ungodly
thought might involve eternal death and as many a man more
particularly many a priest realised his inability to live continuously
in the presence of god he surrendered his soul to the antigod not
from a longing for the pleasures of the senses but from despair the
worship of the devil far from being an invention of fanatical monks
actually existed and was often the last consolation of those who held
themselves forsaken by god the hierarchy did not hesitate a moment to
make the utmost use or the power conferred upon them by the mental
attitude of the people the government of kings and princes in addition
to the ecclesiastical government could only be a transient sinful
condition the time was bound to come when the pope would be king of the
earth and the great lords of the world his vassals appointed by him to
keep the wicked world in check and deposed by him if he found them
incapable worshippers of the devil or disobedient to the church the
whole world was a hierarchy whose apex reached heaven and bore as the
representative of its invisible summit the pope he stood to quote
innocent iii in the middle between god and humanity the same great
pope has left us a document entitled on the contempt of the world
which treats of the absolute futility of all things mundane there is no
reason to look upon the union of this unquenchable thirst for power and
complete otherworldiness as a contradiction the kingdom of god
augustines civitas dei must of necessity be established that the
destiny of the world may be fulfilled every pope must account to god
for his share in the advancement of the only work which mattered and
the greater the power the ruler of this world had acquired over the
souls of men the more he trembled before god weighed down by the
burden of his enormous responsibility the renunciation of the world in
the service of the worldruling church the mastery of the world in the
service of renunciation this was the problem and ideal of the middle
ages harnack but not only the pope every priest as a direct member
of the kingdom of god was superior to the secular rulers this was
taught emphatically by the great st bernard of clairvaux for instance
and gregory vii the wildest fanatic of the kingdom of god said in
writing to a german bishop who then who possesses even small knowledge
and reasoning power could hesitate to place the priests above the
kings even the emperor constantine though he was still largely under
the sway of the imperial idea distinctly acknowledged the bishops as
his masters according to the legend he handed to the bishop of rome
the insignia of his power sceptre crown and cloak and humbly held the
bridle of the prelates horse
the theoretic backbone of this mental attitude was the doctrine of the
fathers of the church and the older scholasticism pronouncing the
illimitable power of human perception the worlds profoundest depths
had been fathomed its riddle finally solved there was consequently no
room for philosophy the endless meditation on the meaning of the world
and the destiny of man science had but one task to bring logical proof
of the revealed religious verities the greatest champion of this view
was anselm of canterbury 10331109 who in his treatise cur deus
homo proved that god was compelled to become man in order to complete
the work of salvation ablard preached a similar doctrine but carried
away by the fervour of thought arrived at conclusions which he was
forced to recant ignominiously for at the end of his chain of evidence
he did not always find the foregone conclusion which should have been
there this system of a final and infallible knowledge of the world is
the very foundation of ecclesiastical government the priest alone has
all knowledge for he has the doctrine of salvation had it occurred to
any man to defend his own opinions in contradiction to the system of the
church that man would speedily have come to the conclusion that the
devil had tempted him to false observations or false deductions and
his submission to the church would have been the outward sign of his
victory over the evil which had blinded his spiritual vision a man had
to choose between the worship of god and the worship of the devil there
was no alternative nobody knew the limits of human knowledge
everybody the learned ecclesiastic as well as the unlearned plain man
believed others to be in possession of the key to profound secrets and
unlimited power one thing only was needful to possess ones self of
the philosophers stone therefore the belief in witchcraft and the
fear of certain men supposed to be endowed with supernatural powerthe
priestswere but the obvious results of a worldsystem founded on a
revealed and exact religion
the latin poets whose study would probably have counteracted the
universal barbarism were regarded as dangerous the gods of antiquity
being identified with the demons of the scriptures this view was
responsible for the loss of many a valuable manuscript the favourite
haunts of the demons were the convents originally designed as
battlefields on which the struggles with the demons were to be fought
out but frequently perishing in superstition and ignorance every monk
had visions of devils miracles occurred continually the torturing
problem was as to whether they were worked by god or the devil nature
was merely a collection of mystic symbols divineor perhaps
diabolicalallegories whose meaning could be discovered by a correct
interpretation of the bible everything which could possibly happen was
recorded in the scriptures they contained the true explanation of all
things it was only a matter of selecting the right word and
interpreting it correctly for every word was ambiguous and allegorical
every natural occurrencean eclipse of the sun a comet or even a
firestood for something else it was the symbol of a spiritual event
concealed behind a phenomenon the allegorical interpretation of the
bible was carried to the point of abstruseness because every word was
considered of necessity to have an unfathomably profound meaning the
following amazing interpretation is by the highlygifted german poet and
mystic suso among the great number of solomons wives was a black
woman whom the king loved above all others now what does the holy ghost
mean by this the charming black woman in whom god delights more than in
any other is a man patiently bearing the trials which god sends him
ablards interpretation of the black woman is even worse he maintained
that though she was black outside her bones that is her character
were white a really remarkable deed of bad taste was committed by the
monk matfre ermengau the author of the breviari damor at a time
when civilisation had already made considerable strides he sent his
sister a christmas present consisting of a honeycake mead and a
roast capon accompanied by the following letter the mead is the blood
of christ the honeycake and the capon are his body which for our
salvation was baked and pierced at the cross the holy ghost baked the
cake in the virgins womb in which the sugar of his divinity
amalgamated with the dough of our humanity in the virgins womb the
holy ghost also spiced the mead and prepared it from wine the spice is
divine virtue the wine is human blood in addition he caused the holy
capon to issue from the egg the yolk of the egg is the deity the white
is humanity the shell is the womb of the virgin mary  etc
the religion of christ was lost man had become a stranger to his own
soulcelestial warnings signs of the judgment day daemonic
temptations surrounded him as far as he paid heed to anything
supersensuous on all sides the french chronicler radulf glaber about
ad 1000 might have been writing a satire on antiquity when he warned
his contemporaries of the demons lurking everywhere but more especially
dwelling in trees and fountains of a learned man who was studying the
classic poets he said this man confused by the magic of evil
spirits had the impudence to propound doctrines contradictory to our
holy faith in his opinion everything the ancient poets had maintained
was true peter the bishop of the town condemned him as a heretic at
that time there were many men in italy believing this false doctrine
they perished by the sword or at the stake we have a letter written
at the same time by gerbert who later on became pope sylvester ii to
a friend beseeching him to obtain for him manuscripts of the latin
philosophers and poets he wrote textbooks of astronomy geometry and
medicine and introduced the arabic numbers and the decimal system into
europe in consequence he too was accused of magic and intercourse
with arabian pagans a chronicler relates that he sold his soul to the
devil and became pope through the devils agency and that when he was
on the point of death he ordered his body to be cut to pieces so that
the devil should not carry it away
today we find it difficult to realise such a state of mind every man
of our period who takes the smallest interest in things spiritualbe he
the most orthodox ecclesiasticat least knows that there are capable
people in the world whose opinions differ from his who seek fresh
knowledge he knows it even though he may pretend that they are people
who have gone astray and have been abandoned by god no one can be
entirely blind to the new values created by human intellect but the men
of the middle ages were swayed by a monstrous dualism and despite their
belief in the illimitable power of human cognition they unquestioningly
accepted the sacred tradition and rejected the nave evidence of the
senses and intellect whenever it seemed to contradict the dogma thus
mediaeval science did not represent what it represented in antiquity
and what it represents now the study of the true relationship of
things but rather the application of truths revealed once and for all
there was nothing more to be discovered and therefore scientists took a
delight in logical and dialectical speculations which to a man of our
day seem senseless and childish far into the renascence natural
history was a medley of ancient traditions oriental fables and
superficial observations the strangest qualities were attributed to
animals with which we come almost daily into contact the following
quotations are culled from a provenal book on zoology the cricket is
so pleased with its song that it forgets to feed and dies singing
when a snake catches sight of a nude man it is so filled with fear
that it does not dare to look at him but if the man is dressed the
snake looks upon him as a weakling and springs upon him the adder
guards the balsam if a man desires to steal the balsam he must first
send the adder to sleep by playing on a musical instrument but if the
adder discovers that it is being duped it closes one of its ears with
its tail and rubs the other one against the ground until it is filled
with earth then it cannot hear the music and remains awake of all
animals there is none so dangerous as the unicorn it attacks everybody
with the horn which grows on the top of its head but it takes such
delight in virgins that the hunters place a maiden on its trail as soon
as the unicorn sees the maiden it lays its head into her lap and falls
asleep when it may easily be caught of the magnet we learn among
other things that it restores peace between husband and wife softens
the heart of all men and cures dropsy if a magnet is made into a
powder and burnt on charcoal in the four corners of the house the
inhabitants imagine that they cannot keep on their legs and run away
sorely affrighted thieves frequently profit by this fact if a magnet
is placed under the pillow of a sleeping woman she is compelled if she
is virtuous to embrace her husband in her sleep if she has betrayed
him she will fall out of her bed with fear
all this information was the common property of the period richard of
berbezilh for instance an aesthetic troubadour tells us thatlike
a stillborn lions cub which was only brought to life by the roaring of
its damhe was awakened to life by his mistress he does not say
whether it was by her roaring conrad of wrzburg compares the holy
virgin to a lioness who brings her dead cubs ie mankind to life
with loud roaring bartolom zorgi another troubadour of the same
period likens his lady to a snake forhe explainsshe flees from
the nude poet and her courage only returns with his clothes during the
whole mediaeval period the unicorn was a wellknown symbol of virginity
more especially of the virginity of mary the golden smithy of the
german minnesinger afterwards monk conrad of wrzburg contains a
rather abstruse poem which begins
     the hunt began
     the heavenly unicorn
     was chased into the thicket
     of this alien world
     and sought imperial maid
     within thine arms a sanctuary etc
natural history was in a parlous state and geographical knowledge was
equally spurious the church was averse to natural research for the
only problem in the world was the salvation of man from everlasting
damnation not only tertullian but several fathers of the church
regarded physical research as superfluous and absurd and even as
godless what happiness shall be mine if i know where the nile has its
source or what the physicists fable of heaven asked lactantius and
should we not be regarded as insane if we pretended to have knowledge
of matters of which we can know nothing how much more then are they
to be regarded as raving madmen who imagine that they know the secrets
of nature which will never be revealed to human inquisitiveness here
one is reminded of a remark made in phdros by the wisest of all
greeks who refused to leave town because what could socrates learn
from trees and grass and julius csar wrote an account of his wars to
while away the time when he was crossing the alps
very likely the system of the church would have been less rigid had it
not largely been occupied in dealing with ignorant barbarians in the
case of celts and teutons a complete and unassailable form of dogmatics
with its corollary of hieratical intolerance was the only possible
system the traditions of these peoples were far too foreign to
christianity to allow christian germs to flourish in their soil and the
new nations accepting what rome offered to them were completely
unproductive in their adolescence the achievement of this fatal first
millenary might be formulated as follows the civilised world of
western europe was united under the government of the church of rome on
all nations it had been impressed in the same combination of words and
similes that they were living in a sinful world they knew when this
world had been created and when its saviour had appeared they knew that
its end would come together with the bodily resurrection of the dead and
the terrible day of the last judgment they knew that demons were
lurking everywhere seeking to destroy mans soul and that the church
alone could save him all these facts were as unalterable as the return
of the seasons
the fundamental sources of antiquity had been sensuality and asceticism
the elements of the middle ages abstract thought and historical faith
now emotion was to become the principal factor it welled up in the soul
and soon dominated all life the fountain which had been dried up since
the dawn of the christian era began to flow again in a small country in
the south of france the civilising centre had again shifted westwards
as in the past it had shifted from asia to greece and from greece to
rome in the course of the first thousand years greece and asia minor
had separated themselves from europe and founded a distinct culture
the byzantine which exerted no influence on the development of europe
but not even italy the scene of the older civilisation was destined to
give birth to the new maybe the memory of the antique antechristian
period was too powerful here its cradle stood on virgin ground in
provence a country wrested from celts and teutons by the roman eagles
ploughed by the roman spirit preserving in some of its coast towns
notably in marsilia the rich remains of greek settlements something of
moorish influence in race and language and fusing all these
heterogeneous elements into a splendid whole but why this important
spiritual centre should have been formed just here it is difficult to
say
for the first time the system of ecclesiastical values was confronted by
something novel which was notlike the old teutonic ideal of the
perfect warriortainted by barbarism but may be described as the
system of mundane court values this new ideal was not founded on an
authority which had to be accepted in good faith it had its direct
origin in the passionate yearning of the human soul man had
rediscovered himself and become conscious of his personal creative
force a very great thing had been accomplished the seed which slowly
gathering strength had lain in the soil for a thousand years had at
last burst its husk and was rapidly growing into the magnificent tree
of the european civilisation in silent opposition to the system of the
accepted ecclesiastical values the new ideal of pretz e valor e
beutatz worth and value and beauty of cavalaria and cortezia
chivalry and courtesy was upheld in provence four worldly virtues
wisdom courtly manners honesty and selfrestraint were contrasted
with the ecclesiastical cardinal virtues the courts of the princes
became centres of new life and art the new spiritualaesthetic concept
of feasting and enjoyment transformed the former orgies of eating and
drinking woman who had heretofore been excluded from male society was
all at once transferred to the very centre of being for her sake men
controlled their brutal tempers and exerted themselves to please by
good manners taste and art she whom the church had done everything to
depreciate who had been denied a soul at the council of macon in the
sixth century had become the very vessel of the soul man looked up to
her and bent his knee before the newlycreated goddess
the cultivation of the new courtly manner coincided with the nascent art
of the troubadours there was no gradual growth and development in the
latter at the very outset it had reached perfection the first
troubadour whose name has come down to us was guillem of poitiers duke
of aquitania about 1100 great lords and barons gloried in the
exercise of this new art every court boasted its poets hospitably
received and loaded with presents the great ones of the earth were
beginning to exercise that patronage of art and letters which in the
renascence reached such extravagant proportions every distinguished
poet employed salaried musicians the joglars jongleurs who wandered
from court to court singing their masters new songs others again the
comtaires related romances of love and adventure gathering round them
a rapt throng of lords and ladies courtly manners and lofty principles
quickly became the recognised ideal the man who was satisfied with the
pleasures of the senses was held in contempt the greatest reproach was
vilania in the yvain of the french epic poet chrestien de troyes
this universal feeling is thus expressed
     a courtier counts though he be dead
     more than a rustic stout and red
dante and his circle as well as the best of the troubadours
substituted for the cortois of the superficial chrestien the cor
gentil the noble heart which they accounted more precious than rank
and wealth and power wherever there is virtue there is nobility says
dante but where there is nobility there need not necessarily be
virtue a time had come when personal distinction was in every mans
grasp no matter whether he was learned or unlearned a nobleman or a
commoner certainly the commoner was never on an equality with the
aristocrat partly because he was dependent on the largess of the great
even dante was compelled to seek princely patronage and not until the
renascence do we hear of writers whose sarcastic tongues were so dreaded
that they became independent of charity
in opposition to the monkish ideal of a contemplative life which had
hitherto obtained a new ideal the ideal of the courtiers life was
upheld ecclesiastical saintliness was contrasted with knightly honour
beauty which at the dawn of the christian era had fallen into ill
repute and had become associated with unholy and even diabolical
practices had again come into its kingdom above everything it was the
beauty of woman which was rediscoveredor rather in its new
spiritual sense newly discoveredand claimed the enthusiasm and love
of the best men of the period after a thousand years of gloom and
brutality joy and culture shed their radiance on a renewed world the
ideal of chivalry bore very little resemblance to the old teutonic ideal
of the hero the older ideal had been based entirely on the appreciation
of physical strength but chivalry was the disseminator of culture
leaving ecclesiastical culture which hitherto had been synonymous with
civilisation a very long way behind mezura masze the greek
mphstos of the platonic greeks was the new criterion as compared
with the barbarians want of restraint
i do not propose to give a description of the life at the courts of
provence the news of it travelled north and everywhere roused a desire
to imitate it the need of a renewed life was powerfully stirring all
hearts men yearned for beauty and spontaneity for passionate life
unprecedented and romantic this was especially the case in the north
in france and in germany and above all in wales the country of the
imaginative and highlygifted celts here life was harder poorer more
barbaric the cultured mind suffered more from its brutal surroundings
than it did in the favoured south it was here that the great legends of
the middle ages so clearly expressive of the yearning of the period
were first collected the early middle ages had produced epic poems
treating scriptural subjects such as the harmony of the gospels of the
monk otfrit written in the ninth century and celebrating the exploits
of popular heroes as for instance the german song of hildebrand and
the french chansons de geste which contain episodes from the lives of
charlemagne and his nephew roland the true epic arising from the rich
and poetical celtic tradition came into existence in the eleventh
century in the north of france and immediately burst into extraordinary
luxuriance the legends of the heroes of the dreamy celtic raceking
arthur and his knights merlin the magician the knights of the holy
grailtravelling across france became the common property of the
civilised european nations and filled all hearts with longing and
fantastic dreams chrestien de troyes in his romances extolled
knightly exploits and the service of woman thus producing by the
combination of the older and the newer ideals the novel of adventure
which has fascinated the world for centuries it is a mistake to believe
that don quixote has struck at the root of it to this day the masses
wax enthusiastic in reading of the doughty deeds of knights the beauty
of ladies and their unswerving undying love
in addition to the great and heroic subjects there were lesser more
intimate and frequently sentimental romances especially enjoyed and
widely circulated by the ladies the baron riding forth left his young
wife at home shut up in her bower and surrounded by spies sometimes
even physically branded as his property a prisoner behind bars her
imagination went outnot to the unloved husband who had married her for
the sake of her broad acres and could send her back to her parents as
soon as he found a wealthier bride he had but to maintain that she was
related to him in the fifth degree and the church was ready to annul the
marriage not to him her lord and master but to the unknown knight
the passionate lover who would gladly give his life to win her a
jongleur arrived with stories of the courts where love was the only
ruler where the knights willingly suffered grief and want if by so
doing they could serve their lady where the lover in the shape of a
beautiful blue bird nightly slipped through the barred windows into the
arms of his mistress but the jealous husband had drawn barbed wire
across the window and the lover flying away at dawn bled to death
before the eyes of his griefstricken lady the jongleur would tell of
the knight who had fallen passionately in love with a beautiful damsel
of whom he had but caught a passing glimpse month after month he worked
at digging an underground passage every night brought him a little
nearer to her bowershe could distinctly hear the dull sounds of his
burrowinguntil at last he rose through the ground and took her into
his arms these and similar tales doubtless all of them of celtic
originpreserved for us in the charming lais of marie de
francebrought tears to the eyes of many a lonely wife and gave shape
to her vague longing there was no reason why a man and a lover to
boot should not transform himself nightly into a blue bird those
simple stories in verse fulfilled every desire of the heart imagination
supplied in the north what the south offered in abundant reality but
marie de france the first woman novelist of europe about the end of
the twelfth century deserves to be remembered for another reason she
was the first poet voicing womans longing for love and
romancewomans adventure the charming lai du chevrefoile the
story of the honeysuckle relates an episode from the loves of tristan
and isolde the famous lovers legendary even at that time tristan and
isolde lancelot and guinevere fleur and blanchefleurthese were the
admired and mythical lovers of whom the poets sang and dreamed all the
world knew their adventures all the world repeated them again and
again reverently preserving the identical words and yet unconsciously
remoulding them at the recital of their loves hand clasped hand on
that day we read no more confessed dantes illfated lovers
the longing so characteristic of the north of europe to see the world
and meet with adventures was in provence and italy less pronounced
these favoured climes possessed so many of the things dreamed of and
desired by other countries events strange as fiction actually
occurred count raimond of roussillon for instance imprisoned his wife
in a tower because the troubadour guillem of cabestann was in love
with and beloved by her he waylaid the lover killed him cut his heart
out of his breast and sent it roasted to his countess when she had
partaken of it he showed her guillems head and asked her how she had
enjoyed the dish so much that no other food shall ever pass my lips
she replied casting herself out of the window when the story spread
abroad the great nobles rose up in arms against raimond and even the
king of aragon made war on him he was caught and imprisoned for life
and his estates were confiscated guillem and the countess were buried
in the church and for a long time after men and women travelled long
distances to kneel at their grave the charming poems of melusine and
the beautiful magelone which to this day delight the reader were
composed during the same period
before the eleventh century poetry in the true sense of the word did not
exist there were only latin church hymns and legends perverted
reminiscences of antiquity and in the vulgar tongue legends of the
saints and simple dancingsongs for the amusement of the lower classes
thanks to the relentless war which the clergy waged against them a few
only have been preserved there can be no doubt that provence was the
birthplace of european poetry the sweet language of provence was the
first to reach perfection and perfect maturity it drove the language of
the german conquerors eastwards and prepared the ground for the french
tongue
the beginning of the twelfth century saw the birth of the poetry of the
troubadours which possessed from the first in great perfection
everything that distinguishes modern lyric poetry from the antique
instead of the syllablemeasuring quantity we now have the emphasising
accent the rhyme one of the most important lyrical contrivancesand
in its near approach to music the most striking characteristic of modern
lyrical poetry as compared with the antiquereaches perfection together
with the complete evenlyrecurring verse which is still today peculiar
to lyrical art the poems of many of the troubadours pulsate with
passionate life and bear no trace of the traditional or the
conventional the martial songs of bertrand de born stride along with a
rhythm reminiscent of the clanking of iron i quote the first verse of
one of these
     le coms ma mandat e mogut
     per narramon luc desparro
     queu fassa per lui tal chanso
     on sian trenchat mil escut
     elm e ausberc e alcoto
     e perponh faussat e romput
     the count he sent to me one day
     sir arramon luc desparro
     a song i was to make himso
     that thousand shields with ring and stay
     and mail and armour of the foe
     to fragments shivered in dismay
the poetry of the provenal troubadours had already passed its prime
when in the other european countries lyric art was still in its
infancy the crusade against the albigenses 1209 undertaken by
gregory vii with the object of killing the new spirit and the new
secular civilisation drove many troubadours to italy among others the
famous sordello who is mentioned in dantes divine comedy others
went to sicily to the court of the artloving emperor frederick ii
where a distinct but not very original poetic art arose in italy the
perfection of mediaeval poetry was reached in the sweet new style
immortalised by dante but not only the great italians the trouveres
from the north of france also andto some extentthe german
minnesingers were influenced by the art and above all the ideals
which had originated in provence the poetry of the earliest rhenish and
austrian minnesingers closely follows german folklore and the songs of
dietmar of aist and others are still quite innocent of any trace of
neolatin characteristics but very soon the technical perfection of the
provenal poetry and the provenal ideal of courtesy and love famous
all over europe strongly influenced the german mind
the new poetry and the ideal of chivalry and the service of woman were
the first independent developments able to hold their own by the side of
ecclesiastical culture the rigid latin was superseded the soul of man
sang in its own language of the return of spring the beauty of woman
knighthood and adventure poetry became the most important source of
secular education and as each nation sang in its own tongue national
characteristics shone out through the individuality of the singer
provenals frenchmen germans and italians realised that they belonged
to different races this was particularly the case during the crusades
when under the auspices of the church the nations of europe had
apparently undertaken a common task
in provence in france and germany every poem was set to music and
thus simultaneously with the lyrical art secular music was evolved
jb beck the greatest authority on the music of the troubadoursthe
music of the minnesingers has been studied very littlesays the
poetry of the troubadours and trouveres represents in its totality a
collection of songs which in their frequently amazing navet and
melodiousness their spontaneity and sound music intimate congruity of
melody and text and extraordinary originality have been unparalleled to
this day all these songs are distinguished by graceful simplicity but
the ear of the nonmusician can hardly perceive the originality on which
beck lays such stress in any case the music is inferior to the
frequently perfect text this same period saw the inception of our
present system of musical notation
the new poetry created a desire for literature thus giving impetus to
the already existent art of illuminated manuscripts every prince kept a
salaried army of copyists and illuminators producing the manuscripts
today preserved and studied in our museums studios where this work was
carried on existed at various art centres especiallyas far as we are
able to tell todayat the papal courts at avignonthat meetingground
of french and italian artistsin paris and at rheims these workshops
were the birthplace of miniature painting which reached perfection in
the famous burgundian livres dheures
today the science of aesthetics is attempting to trace the influence
which emanated from the french and even from the earlier english
workshops and spread over the whole continent it is very probable that
the french art of miniature painting of the first half of the thirteenth
century was mother of the later northeuropean art of painting it was
in northern europe that independently of hellenic and byzantine
influence a new art originated of which max dvorak says it would
hardly be possible to find an external cause for the quick and complete
disappearance of the elements of the neolatin art the past was simply
done with and an absolutely new period was beginning thus the new art
was almost without any tradition dvorak calls this complete change the
most important in the history of painting since antiquity george count
vitzthum has proved that the famous cologne school of painting modelled
itself on northernfrench belgian and a quite independent english
school of illuminators it is even suggested that the english style of
miniature painting influenced europe as far as the upper rhine it is
also very significant that the dutch art of the brothers van eyck whose
sudden appearance seemed so inexplicable is now proved to have had its
source in the north of france on the other hand we have drawings of
three ecstatic nuns showing decided originality hildegarde of bingen
already mentioned on a previous occasion has herself ornamented her
book scivias with miniatures which according to haseloff in spite
of their primitive style reveal a bizarre plastic talent and are
therefore closely related to her intuitions alfred peltzer speaks of
fantastic figures surrounded by flames the two other nuns were
elizabeth of schnau and herrad of landsberg these two were entirely
under the influence of the dawning mysticism
i will here quote a few more passages from dvorak who in dealing with
the individual arts does not lose sight of the whole simultaneously
with a new literature he says we have a new art of illustration new
miniatures no longer drawing inspiration from antiquity we meet the
new style in its full perfection wherever it is a matter of a new
technique in the art of staining glass for instance or of
illustrating profane literature he speaks of a new decoration of
manuscripts invented in paris in the first half of the thirteenth
century thus the close and causal connection between the new poetry
and the illumination of books is clearly apparent and it may be said
without exaggeration that the provenal lyric poetry and the
northfrench and celtic cycles of romance led up to the new european
style of painting which did not come to perfection until two centuries
later nothing positive can be said about the influence of france on
italian art the monumental character and the art of cimabue giotto and
the sienese does not however suggest that they were much influenced by
the art of miniature painting but rather hints that they drew
inspiration from antique frescoes
i must add a few words on the subject of those miniatures which are not
easily accessible to the layman but reproductions of which are
frequently met with in books on the history of art in addition to
religious subjects the whole courtly company which lives and breathes
in the legends of the round table kings and knights poets minstrels
and fair damsels hawking jousting banqueting and playing chess
everything which stirred the poets imagination is depicted the spirit
of the romances which in modern times enchanted the english
preraphaelites six centuries ago provided food and stimulus to the
industrious illuminators whose names have long been forgotten
if the art of miniature painting never roseexcepting in its wider
consequencesto universal significance mediaeval architecture stands
before our eyes magnificent as on the first day until the middle of the
twelfth century the monumental structures of europe were directly
influenced by the later hellenic civilisation the byzantine basilica
was slowly transformed into the neolatin house and thus in this
important domain also europe drew her inspirations from antiquity but
only the groundplan of the gothic cathedral that is to say the idea
of a nave with sideaisles was traditional and borrowed from neolatin
models from this invisible groundplan rose something absolutely
original and autochthonic this new specifically centraleuropean style
of architecture was developed on soil where there were no antique
buildings to stem the new life with their overwhelming domination and
to bar the way of artistic inspiration with their ominous i am
perfection in every branch of art antiquity had proved itself a foe
until at last the renascence was sufficiently mature to assimilate and
overcome the antique inheritance so completely that it became an
excellent fertiliser for the new art the essence of the gothic style is
the dissolution of all that is heavy and materialthe victory of spirit
over matter walls were broken up into pillars and soaring arcades
monotonous facework was tolerated less and less and every available
inch was moulded into a living semblance the result may be studied in
the incomparable faades of many of the cathedrals in the north of
france and in towerpieces almost vibrating with life and passion such
as that of st stephens in vienna the conflict between matter and pure
form is settledfor the first and only timein gothic architecture
the greek temple with its correct proportions possessed no more than
perfection of form without spiritual admixture it was perfect as marble
statues which are an end in themselves and do not point the way to
spiritual truths gothic architecture is probably unique in its blending
of sthetic perfection of form and infinite spiritual wealth in the
fusion of these two elements in a higher intuition it is the balance of
the two characteristics of genius inexhaustible wealth and the striving
for harmonious expression it marked the first powerful working of the
teutonic spirit on the world its metaphysical yearning together with a
genuine love of nature found in this art its own peculiar traditionless
expression just as it found expression in the newlyevolved mysticism
which no longer reechoed aristotle and his commentators but drew
inspiration from its own intuition for this reason gothic architecture
never became acclimatised in italy the soaring tower more especially
never appealed to the italian architect
ornamentation and capitals previously a combination of geometrical
figures which may have been architecturally great and imposing but was
always more or less formal and rigid disappeared the new masters
whose names have been forgotten looked round them and drew inspiration
from nature the forest trees of central europe became pillars grouped
together apparently haphazard they reflected a mystical nature pulsing
with mysterious life spreading and ramifying growing together in an
impenetrable network of foliage they bore buds leaves and fruits
every pinnacle became a sprig even the pendant icicles reappeared in
the gableboards but the assimilation of natural objects did not cease

gothic cathedral not the traditional greek acanthus leaf but the
foliage of the northeuropean oak grows under the hands of the sculptor
even the cross is twisted into a flower the sacrosanct symbol of the
christian religion is newly conceived newly interpreted and moulded so
that it may have a place the gothic cathedral with its soaring arches
free from all heaviness is the perfect expression of that cosmic feeling
that inspired eckhart and reached its artistic perfection in dante
but the soul of the mystic in stone contains the same elements as the
soul of eckhart who was also a schoolman the confused and complex
scholastic world of ideas which corresponded so well with the mediaeval
temper and together with the new art had emanated from paris is
closely akin to gothic architecture for the gothic style and
scholastic thought share the characteristics of the infinitely
constructive and infinitely cleft the infinitely subtle and
ornamentalperhaps the last trace of the spirit of the north as
compared with the simplicity of the south
as if from fertile soil a world of sculptured men and beasts sprang
from the faades of the new cathedrals the figures on the cathedrals of

desire for adventure a longing which no soul could resist nothing

best suited to its temper be the native country never so poor the long
darkness and cold of the winter never so hard to bear far away in the
east or in camelot the kingdom of king arthur life was full of beauty
and sunshine the legends of king arthur powerfully affected the
imagination they were read secretly and surreptitiously in all
convents on a sultry summer afternoon during the learned discussion of
their preceptor one after another of the pupils would fall asleep the
preceptor suddenly interrupting himself would continue after a short
pause and now i will tell you of king arthur and all eyes would
sparkle as the pupils listened with rapt attention francis of assisi
called one of his disciples a knight of his round table and three
hundred years later don quixote lost his reason over the study of those
legends some of the finest works of art of the present time wagners
lohengrin tristan and isolde and parsifal take their subject
from the inexhaustible treasure of the celtic epic cycle the longing
for experience and adventure had laid hold of the imagination to an
extraordinary degree the recital of wondrous adventures no longer
satisfied the listener he yearned to participate in them the young
knight trained in athletics and courtesy and possessing a little
knowledge of biblical history left his fathers castle to face the
unknown world there was a sanctuary mysterious almost supernal
carefully guarded in the dense forest of an inaccessible mountain a
knight whose heart was pure and who had dedicated himself to the
lifelong service of the divine could find it but he would have to
wander for many years through forests and glens and strange countries
alone and solitary before his eyes would behold the most sacred relic
in the world the holy grail
the time was ripe for a great event a universal and overwhelming
enterprise which could absorb the passionate longing maybe that the
wisdom of the great popeshalf unconsciously certainly and under the
pressure of the age but yet led by an unerring instinctguided this
stream into the bed of the church the vague craving found a definite
object the crusades were organised the holy sepulchre the most sacred
spot on earth was in the hands of the heathens it was despised and
defiledwhat greater thing could a man do than hasten to its rescue
and wrest it from the grasp of pagans giants and sorcerers in the
fantastic imagination of the men of that period the lords sepulchre was
nothing but the earthly realisation of their yearning for the holy
grail
as far back as ad 1000 gerbert had sent messengers to all nations
exhorting them to hoist their banners and march with him to the holy
land it had been prophesied that he should be the first to read mass in
jerusalem a few ships were actually equipped at pisathe first attempt
at a crusade but at that time europe was not yet quite prepared for the
extraordinary almost incomprehensible enterprisethe conquest of a
country which hardly anybody had ever seen and in which nobody had any
practical interest before such an enterprise could be carried out all
hearts must be filled by that uncontrollable and yet vague longing so
characteristic of the great period of fantasy the suggestion that the
wealth of the east exciting the greed of the western nations led to
the crusades is an absolutely indefensible idea doubtless rumours of
the fabulous treasure of the orient had stirred the imagination of
europe appealing far less however to the cupidity of the individual
than to his desire for something strange new and incredible it was
impossible to foresee the result of the first crusade the crusader went
to a strange land in order to fightthe return was in gods hand there
have been at all times men coveting wealth but to make such men the
instigators and organisers of the crusades is a deliberate attempt to
represent a characteristic and unique event in the history of the world
in the light of a commonplace and everyday occurrence in the first
enchanted wood a man might chance upon a beautiful princess sitting
beside a fountain nude and weeping but it was equally possible that a
giant would rush upon the christian knight break his shield and exact
heavy penalties it was possible to win the kingdom of a sultan or
emirit could be achieved by bravery and in a dueland become a great
king for a king in those days was no more than a large landed
proprietor such dreams were actually fulfilled in the most
extraordinary way gottfried of bouillon a poor alsatian knight might
have become king of jerusalem had he not refused to wear a crown of
gold in a land where his saviour had worn a crown of thorns and
contented himself with the title of protector of the holy land
the embattled citadel of jerusalem like the holy grail was pictured as
being situated outside the world there the longing which had become
so vast that it had outgrown the earth would be stilled a direct way
must lead from jerusalem the centre of the earthit still takes this
position in dantes divine comedyto paradise was it not the spot
where the cross of the saviour had been raised had not once before
heaven opened above the city to receive his risen body was it not the
scene of countless miracles in the past why should it be different now
men knew practically nothing of palestine they had in their minds a
fantastic picture tallying in every respect with biblical accounts
doubtless the footprints of the redeemer could easily be traced
everywhere the possession of the country promised the fulfilment of
transcendental dreams
the impulse and the strength necessary for the organisation of the
crusades were spiritual phenomena inherently foreign and even hostile to
the church but thanks to the mental superiority of the popes of that
period and the overpowering conception of a divine kingdom they became
the instruments of the greatest triumphs vouchsafed to the church of
rome the hosts driven across the sea by inner restlessness and
illdefined longing in reality fought for the aggrandisement of the
church the great hildebrand resolved to lead all christendom to
jerusalem to found on the site of the holy sepulchre the divine
kingdom preached by st augustine and investa risen christthe
emperor and all the kings of the earth with their kingdoms
the crusader and the knight in quest of the holy grail present together
a paradoxical combination of the christianecclesiastical and the
mundanechivalric spirit which is quite in harmony with the spirit of
the age these two worlds inward strangers formedin the order of the
knighttemplars for instancea union which while possessing all the
external symbols of chivalry attributed to it heterogeneous
ecclesiastical motives the glory of battle and victory the caprice of
a beautiful damsel were no longer to become the mainsprings of doughty
exploits henceforth the knight fought solely for the glory of god and
the victory of christianity in addition to king arthurs knights the
classical middle ages worshipped the ideal of these priestly warriors
who waded through streams of blood to kneel humbly at the grave of the
saviour of those seekers of the holy grail who dedicated themselves to
a metaphysical task king arthurs round table served the actual orders
of knighthood as a model not only the franciscans of italy but also
slow german mystics such as suso and the profound johannes tauler
delighted in borrowing their similes and metaphors from knighthood
tauler speaks of the scarlet knightly robes which christ received for
his knightly devotion and by his chivalric exploits he won those
knightly weapons which he wears before the father and the angelic
knighthood therefore christ exults when his knights elect also to put
on such knightly garments  etc
not infrequently the saracens behaved far more generously than the
christian armies a german chronicler albert von stade tells us that
ad 1221 the sultan of egypt of his own free will restored the lords
cross permitted the christians to leave egypt with all their
belongings and commanded all prisoners to be set free so that at that
time 30000 captives were released he also commanded his subjects to
sell food to the rich and give alms to the poor and the sick
occasionally the pope entered into an alliance with the enemies of
christendom against the emperor if the latter proved troublesome ad
1246 the sultan of egypt malek as saleh ejul taught innocent iv the
speaker of all christendom the judge of the christian peoples the
following lesson it is not befitting to us he wrote to him that we
should make a treaty with the christians without the counsel and consent
of the emperor and we have written to our ambassador at the court of
the emperor informing him of what has been proposed to us by the popes
nuncio including your message and suggestions
the most pathetic symptom of the restlessness of the age was the
childrens crusade in 1212 which even at its actual occurrence caused
helpless amazement the reports of two german chroniclers are
sufficiently interesting to be quoted verbally in the same year
happened a very strange thing a thing which was all the more strange
because it was unheard of since the creation of the world at easter and
whitsuntide many thousands of boys from franconia and teutonia from six
years upwards took the cross without any external inducement or
preaching and against the wish of their parents and relations who
sought to restrain them some left the plough which they had been
guiding others abandoned their flocks or any other task which they had
been set to do banded together and with hoisted banner began to march
to jerusalem in batches of twenty fifty and a hundred many people
enquired of them at whose counsel and admonishment they were undertaking
this journey for it was not many years ago that many kings a great
number of princes and countless people had travelled to the holy land
strongly armed and had returned home without having accomplished their
desire telling them that in their tender years they had not yet
sufficient strength to achieve anything and that therefore this thing
was foolish and undertaken without due consideration the children
answered briefly that they were obeying gods will and would willingly
and gladly suffer all the trials he would send them and they went their
way some turning back at mayence others at piacenza and others at
rome a small number arrived at marseilles but whether they crossed the
sea or not and what happened to them no one knows only that much is
certain that of all the thousands who went forth only very few
returned another chronicler wrote and at this time boys without a
leader or guide left the towns and villages of all countries eagerly
journeying to the lands across the sea and when asked whither they were
wending they replied to jerusalem to the holy land many of them
were kept by their parents behind locked doors but they burst open the
doors broke through the walls and escaped when the pope heard of these
things he sighed heavily and said these children shame us for they
hasten to the recovery of the holy land while we sleep no one knows
how far they went and what became of them but many returned and when
they were asked the reason of their expedition they said they knew not
at the same time nude women were seen hurrying through towns and
villages speaking no word
if it had not been for the crusades something else must have happened
to relieve the unbearable tension the world was longing for a great
deed a deed overstepping the borderline of metaphysics and its
enthusiasm was sufficient guarantee of achievement in the case of the
individual vanity and boastfulness played no mean part thus the
austrian minnesinger ulrich of lichtenstein proposed taking the cross
not to serve god but to please his mistress it is quite probable
though not historically proved that this veritable don quixote dreamed
of decorating the holy sepulchre with his ladys handkerchief but in
the end he remained at home a journey to foreign lands to return after
years of yearning for the beloved her loyalty or her treachery
supplied the romantic imagination of the age with endless material the
story of the count von gleichen and his two wives is famous to this day
a charming provenal song tells of a maid who day after day sat by a
fountain weeping for her lover at this spot they had bidden farewell to
each other and here she was awaiting his return one day a pilgrim
arrived and she at once asked for news of her knight the pilgrim knew
him and had a message for her after a short conversation he threw back
his cowl and drew the delighted maiden into his arms for it was he
himself her lover who after many years of absence had returned and was
first visiting the spot where years ago he had said goodbye to her
but there was another motive a religious one which joined to the
universal lust of adventure dominated the whole mediaeval period to an
extraordinary degree that motive was the idea of doing penance
andafter all the failures of lifereturning to god the crusades
offered an opportunity for combining ones hearts desire with this
spiritual need of all good works there were none more pleasing to god
and every participator was promised forgiveness of his sins in the
troubadours songs of the crusaders there is a strong yearning for
penance and sanctification quite independent of the idea of the
delivery of the holy sepulchre from the rule of the infidels
     all i held dear i now abhor
     my pride my knightly rank and fame
     and seek the spot which all adore
     the pilgrims goaljerusalem
sang guillem of poitiers one of the gayest of the troubadours
only very few of the more thoughtful minds realised that divine thoughts
have their source in the soul of man and that these crusades were
obviously a senseless undertaking not to mention the fact that god does
not need human assistance it is a greater thing to worship god always
in humility and poverty said the abbot peter of cluny than to
journey to jerusalem in great pomp and circumstance if therefore it
is a good thing to visit jerusalem and stand on the soil which our
lords feet have trod it is a far better thing still to strive after
heaven where our lord can be seen face to face both the great
scholastic anselm of canterbury and bernard of clairvaux were of the
same opinion they shall aspire not to the earthly but to the heavenly
jerusalem and travel there not with their feet but with the desire of
their hearts and they seek god in external objects neglecting to
look into their hearts in whose innermost depths dwells the divine
and yet those same men who even then seemed to have outgrown biblical
religiosity were under the spell of the allabsorbing idea of the age
bernard solved the contradiction in the following way it is not
because his power has grown less that the lord calls us feeble worms to
protect his own his word is deed and he could send more than twelve
legions of angels to do his bidding but because it is the will of the
lord your god to save you from perdition he gives you an opportunity to
serve him in these words a significant change of the fundamental idea
can already be traced peter of cluny worked for the crusades and
bernard one of the most influential and venerable personalities of the
middle ages a man before whose word the popes bowed down journeyed
through the whole of france inciting all hearts to fanatical
enthusiasm whoever heard him preach forsook his worldly possessions and
took the cross clamouring for peter himself to lead all christendom
countless numbers flocked to his banner towns and castles stood
forsaken and there was hardly one man to seven women the wives were
made widows during the lifetime of their husbands thus bernard wrote
to the pope travelling through germany healing the sick by his mere
presence and preaching to the people in a tongue no one could
understand but the personality of this physically delicate man whose
body was only kept alive by his spirit touched all hearts the prudent
emperor conrad resisted for a long time and would have nothing to do
with such an aimless enterprise but bernards first sermon in the
cathedral at speyer on christmas day moved him to tears bernard left
the pulpit and pinned the cross on the shoulder of the kneeling emperor
by this symbolical act the metaphysical spirit of the time of which the
church had obtained control for her own purposes visibly became master
of political commonsense
the crusades were one of the great movements matured by the
newlyawakened metaphysical yearning the same spirit in another
profounder way manifested itself in the efforts of religious reform
which were being made here and there the appearance and spread of
heresy has always been the gauge by which the religious life of the
individual must be measured says bttner very pertinently in his
preface to his edition of eckhart for the first time since the days of
christ true religious feeling was again quickening the hearts of men
the ecclesiastical dogma which until then had represented absolute
truth no longer satisfied their need soon opposition timidly at
first made itself felt laymen ventured to interfere in the domain of
religion all knowledgeand consequently all tradition and
religionhad been for a thousand years the exclusive possession of the
clergy those laymen who had any culture at all knew a little latin and
a few scholastic propositions all this was changing despite reiterated
ecclesiastical prohibitions parts of the bible were translated into
the vulgar tongue and eagerly studied by ignorant folk everywhere men
appeared to whom religion was a matter of vital importance men who
strove to find god in their own souls instead of blindly accepting the
god of foreign doctrine
the more obvious cause of the growing dislike to ecclesiastical
authority was the immorality of the priests the contrast between the
professions of humility and the greed vice and tyranny of the clergy
was too pronounced the ecclesiastical offices were publicly sold
divine forgiveness was cheaper than a new garment every priest was
allowed to keep a mistress if he paid a tax to the bishop two poems of
the troubadour guillem figueiras express the state of affairs very
bluntly our shepherds have become thievish wolves plundering and
despoiling the fold under the guise of messengers of peace they gently
console their sheep night and day but once they have them in their
power these false shepherds let their flock perish and die in the
other poem he says of the priest
     he lies in a womans arms all night
     and wakesdefiledin the morning light
     to proffer the sacred host
worse invectives even no less forcible than those of later reformers
he hurled against rome in the flames and torments of hell is thy
place thou hast the appearance of an innocent lamb but inwardly
thou art a raging wolf a crowned snake begotten by a viper the friend
of the devil even the goodnatured german minnesinger walter von der
vogelweide found bitter words against rome they point our way to god
and go to hell themselves bernard of clairvaux the supporter of the
church sharply criticised the abuses of pope and clergy in his book
de consideratione the property of the poor is sown before the door
of the rich the gold glitters in the gutter the people come hurrying
up from all sides but not to the neediest is it given but to the
strongest and to him who is first on the spot he accused the pope of
extravagance and luxury was peter clothed in robes of silk covered
with gold and precious stones was he carried in a litter surrounded by
soldiers and vassals and he uttered a word which to this day is a
historical truth in all thy splendour thou art the successor of
constantine rather than the successor of peter
dissatisfaction with the life of the clergy and the tyranny of rome was
the more external reason which although it vexed even those who were
indifferent to religion did not question the sacred tradition the
other reason was more a matter of principle it was rooted in the desire
for a religious revival and openly attacked perverted truths the
dreaded hated and cruelly persecuted heretics were fearless men
sturdily fighting for their convictions the fundamental ideal of these
reformers was the suppression of the outward pomp of the church and the
return to the simplicity of the gospels their fates varied the gentle
st francis of assisi was canonised the illumined eckhart on the other
hand was tortured most of them like the ardent arnold of brescia
were burnt at the stake this conduct of the hierarchy towards the truly
religious men is easily explained the church was faced by a problem on
the one hand the genuine and profound piety of these men was
unmistakable but on the other the contrast of their teaching with
church tradition was too obvious and by many of them too strongly
emphasised to be silently ignored
the provenal heretic peter of bruis seems to have been the first
reformer who preached against iconolatry and even objected to the images
of the crucified he ordered churches to be razed to the ground because
he acknowledged only the invisible community of the saints he was burnt
at st giles by an infuriated mob more powerful and far more
numerous than his followers the peterbrusians were the cathari and
the waldenses founded by peter valdez ad 1177 who soon spread to
northern italy and amalgamated with the sect of the lombards the
cathari advocated a simple and ascetic life in accordance with the
teaching of primitive christianity refrained from all ecclesiastical
ceremonies and despised the sacraments particularly baptism more
radical than later reformers they rejected the doctrine of
transubstantiation and saw in the eucharist only a symbol of the union
of god and the soul this made their name synonymous with heresy but by
far the most famous of heretical sects was the sect of the waldenses or
albigenses it numbered amongst its adherentsif not publicly at any
rate secretlymany of the great provenal lords and there can be no
doubt that this community was permeated by the spirit of a renewed
christianity the christianity of st francis and the german mystics
the albigenses believed that not christ but his semblance only had
been crucified they rejected the god of the old testament and their
doctrine of the two creatorsthe devil who created the objective
world and the true god who created the spiritual worldis reminiscent
of the loftiest parseeism and the profoundest gnosticism they regarded
man as placed between good and evil the choice lay in his own hand an
extraordinary poem by peire cardinalnot by any means a
hereticbreathes this spirit he confronts god not with the customary
humility but as one power confronts the other i will write a new
poem and on the day of the last judgment i will read it to him who has
created me from nothing if he should condemn me to everlasting
damnation i will say to him lord have mercy on me for i have always
striven against the wicked world the troubadour here alludes to his
many polemic poems and save me from the torments of hell the heavenly
host will marvel at my speech and i shall say to god that he sins
against his creatures if he delivers them into the hands of the devil
rather let him drive away the devils for then he will win more souls
and all the world will be blessed i will not despair of thee and
therefore thou must forgive my sins and save my soul and my heart if i
had not been born i should not have sinned it would be a great wrong
and a sin if thou didst condemn me to burn in hell everlastingly for
truly i may accuse thee of having sent me a thousand evils for one
blessing
most terrible was the punishment inflicted upon provence by innocent
iii that highly intellectual pope realised that he was faced by a
revival of the true religious instinct from which the authority of the
church had far more to fear than from all sultans and emirs put
together the system of absolute immutable values was threatened with
destruction in the year 1208 the spanish nobleman dominicus guzman
founded the order of the dominicans and the inquisition which invaded
provence together with the papal army supported by france for political
reasons half a million men were butchered in order to crush the spirit
understood by a few hundreds at most one stake was kindled by the
other in the memory of man no greater sacrifice to tradition and dogma
had ever been made simon de montfort the head of the expedition sent
the following laconic report to the pope we spared neither sex nor age
nor name but slew all with the edge of the sword
the troubadours bewailed the desolate country the beauty that was no
more montanhagol although greatly intimidated by the inquisition
wrote a long poem on the subject and the otherwise unknown bernard
sicard de marvajols laments
     oh toulouse and provence
     and thou land of agence
     carcassonne and beziers
     as once i beheld youas i behold you today
jacob of vitry a cultured french prelate took a different view he
inveighed against the foolish poems the lies of the poets the
singsong of the women the coarse innuendoes of the jesters such
vermin flourishes on the stream of temporal abundance it literally
crawls over all food for as a rule the meal is followed by a deluge
of idle talk a reconciliation of the two worlds was impossible
while the waldenses flourished in provence various heretical sects
arose in the west of germany and in the netherlands prominent among
them were the apostolics who took the gospels literally and introduced
communism and polygamy and the communities of the beghards and
beguines which roused little public attention and did not aim at
reform but advocated a life of contemplation they found supporters in
all ranks of the community and were connected with the later german
mystics an indictment preserved for us proves the religious originality
of one of those sects the brethren of the free spirit who upheld the
heretical view that it were better that one man should attain to
spiritual perfection than that a hundred monasteries should be founded
at the same time the inspired seer and hysterical nun hildegarde of
bingen wrote wild letters to the popes denouncing the vice existing in
the church and the degradation of religion but thou oh rome who art
wellnigh at the point of death thou wilt be shaken so that the
strength of thy feet shall forsake thee because thou hast not loved the
royal maiden righteousness with an ardent love but with the torpor of
sleep and thou hast become a stranger to her therefore she will desert
thee if thou do not call her back pope adrian iv replied almost
humbly we long to hear words of warning from you because men say that
you are endowed with the spirit of the divine miracles st bernard
craved hildegardes prayer two emperors popes bishops and abbots
corresponded with her requesting her prayer and advice and the
interpretation of difficult passages of the scriptures hildegarde
replied in an obscure apocalyptical language in the mysteries of the
true wisdom have i seen and heard this
prophets predicting the revival of the gospel of christ and the
regeneration of the world appeared in the north and south the italian
monk and fanatic joachim of floris about ad 1200 preached that
this regeneration was predestined to happen a precursor of hegel he
taught three eras the dominion of the father or the first era
characterised by fear and the severity of the law the dominion of the
son or the era of faith and compassion and the dominion of the holy
ghost or the era of love this last era was beginning to dawn and in
many places joachims words were regarded as the prophecies of a seer
thus the monk gerhard of borgo san domino claimed for the dawning
third era the preaching of a new gospel of the holy ghost an
unmistakable proof that the spirit of heresy was the outcome of
religious enthusiasm
the people despised the clergy and were favourably disposed to every
reformer at the same time they were entirely under the sway of a
superstitious awe of the administrators of mysterious magic which by
appropriate practices or by means of presents could be turned to
advantage the fetichism of relics flourished everywhere a sufficient
number of pieces of the cross of christ were sold and worshipped to
furnish trees for a big forestto say nothing of the bones of numerous
saints with which many monasteries more especially french monasteries
did a lucrative trade even at the time this traffic repelled the finer
intellects in ad 1200 guibert the abbot of novigentum preached
against the cult of the saints and the worship of relics adducing all
the wellknown arguments which to this day however have proved
insufficient to overcome the evil in guiberts words it was an
abominable nuisance that certain limbs should be detached from the body
thereby defying the law that all bodies must turn to dust how can the
bones of any man be worth framing in gold and silver he asked when
the body of the son of god was laid beneath a miserable stone he
exhorted the people to turn from the visible and obvious to the
invisible he maintained that the worship of relics was opposed to true
religion because not until the disciples were bereaved of the bodily
presence of christ could the holy ghost descend upon them he even
rejected the prevalent entirely materialistic view of a life after
death and dared to suggest that the torments of hell should be
interpreted spiritually the eternal contemplation of the lord is the
supreme bliss of the righteous who could dare to deny that the misery
of the damned consists in the eternal bereavement of the face of the
lord
religion had been lost what should have been a vital force had become
as far as the most learned were concerned a knowledge of historical
events many saw in a return to evangelical simplicity and love the only
remedy but it was the life not the preaching of a man which once
again was vouchsafed to the world as a great example nobody has shown
me what i should do but the most high himself has commanded me to live
according to the gospels francis of assisi accepted the accounts of
the life of christ with the utmost navet he neither searched for an
allegorical meaning as the theologians did nor did he subordinate the
man jesus to the divine principle of the logos in the manner of the
great mystics to him the imitation of christ meant a ministry of love
he did not conceive religion as dogma and the political power of a
hierarchy but as a state of the heart this is a characteristic which
he shares with eckhart the great recreator of european religion
although he was fundamentally alien to him st francis never uttered a
single hostile word against tradition or the clergy he never inveighed
against the corruption of morals and religious indifference as other
reformers did he exerted a reformatory influence solely by his life
for he possessed the secret of the great love during his whole life he
was averse to laying down rules for his followers although continually
urged to do so by popes and bishops his importance does not lie in the
foundation of an order with certain regulations and a specific object
but in the fact that he was a vital force he broke the norms of the
church whenever it seemed right to him to do so for he was absolutely
sure of himself without being ordained he preached to the people in his
own tongue probably the first man after the provenal peter valdez
who did so without possessing the slightest authority he consecrated
his friend clara as a nun innocent iii who made the suppression of
heresy the task of his life showed great intelligence and wisdom in
sanctioning st francis sermons to the people and acknowledging his
unecclesiastical brotherhood this probably transformed a dangerous
revolutionary into a faithful servant of the church maybe the church
was indebted to st francis for being saved from a great early
reformation signs of it were not wanting and another arnold of brescia
might have arisen and brought about her overthrow it is doubtful
whether the church would have come out of a franciscan crusade as
victoriously as she came out of her struggle with provence
st francis regarded science with indifference every demon he said
has more scientific knowledge than all men on earth put together but
there is something a demon is incapable of and in it lies the glory of
man a man can be faithful to god with those words he had inwardly
overcome tradition and theology and direct knowledge of the divine had
dawned in his soul he even forbade his brethren to own copies of the
scriptures god in the heartthat was the core of his doctrine with
all his wonderful intuition he was absolutely innocent of the pride of
ignorance he really felt himself smaller than the smallest of
menunlike the bishops and popes who called themselves the servants of
the servants of god without attaching the least meaning to it how
characteristic of his simple mind was his passionate insistence on the
respectful handling of the vessels used at holy mass because they were
destined to receive the body of the lord and yet he hardly knew
anything of the symbolic transmutation of bread and winehe accepted
the miracle without a thought like a child
in the year 1219 st francis took part in a crusade while the battle
of damietta was raging he went into the camp of the saracens and
preached before the sultan who received him with respect and sent him
back unharmed according to the legend he then went to bethlehem and
jerusalem where the sultan touched by his personality gave him access
to the sacred shrines to francis this pilgrimage to the holy land had a
profound meaning for to him christianity meant the imitation of christ
although he lived on bread himself and poverty was his chosen lady he
regarded the asceticism of the early middle ages as futile and rejected
it the fire of life burned in him so ardently that he gave no thought
to the morrow and literally followed the admonition of the gospels so
likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he
cannot be my disciple we read in the fioretti perhaps the oldest
popular collection of poems in existence that he expressly prohibited
asceticism as a principle an idea too foreign to the spirit of the age
to have been an invention he also disapproved of the secluded monastic
life then the universal ideal of the vita contemplativa and
insisted on his followers living in the world radiating love and
sustaining life by the charity of their fellowmen
there is an anecdote contained in the fioretti reflecting the great
superiority and lucidity of his mind on a cold winters day he and
brother leo were tramping through the deep snow brother leo said st
francis if we could restore sight to all blind men heal all cripples
expel evil spirits and recall the dead to lifeit would not be perfect
joy and after a while and if we knew all the secrets of science the
course of the stars the ways of the beastsit would not be perfect
joyand if by our preaching we could convert all infidels to the true
faitheven that would not be perfect joy tell me then father said
brother leo what would be perfect joy if we now knocked at the
convent gates cold and wet and faint with hunger and the porter sent
us away with harsh words so that we should have to stand in the snow
until the evening if we thus waited bearing all things patiently
without murmuringthat would be perfect joy the mercy of
selfcontrol
he met death singing says his biographer thomas of celano the
author of the magnificent dies irae dies illa on his deathbed st
francis composed and sang without interruption the hymn to the sun that
lofty song of praise in which the sum total of his noble life love for
all created thingsis comprised and transfigured it expresses a new
form of devotion composed of the ecstasy of love and perfect humility
he embraced in his heart his brother sun his sister moon the dear
stars his brother wind his sister and mother earth and on the day of
his death this brother seraphicus added to it a powerful and touching
song of praise of his brother death the legend has it that a flock of
singingbirds descended on the roof of the cottage in which he lay
dying the songs of his little sisters accompanied him to the world
beyond the grave
we are justified in comparing this death which was sustained by the
fundamental forces of that era soul and emotion to that other more
famous death of antiquity socrates died without in the least
succumbing to any personal feeling supported by the purely logical
consideration that it was expedient to obey the laws of the state his
death was the application of a universal proposition to an individual
case and because no one could accuse socrates of a dialectical error
the conclusion his death had to take place
francis and some of his successors realised in their lives the simple
religious fundamental emotion of love in a way which the people could
clearly understand gods minstrels was the name given to his
followers because they spoke and sang of the love of god without
ecclesiastical ceremony jacopone da todi 12361306 probably next to
dante and guinicelli the greatest poet which italy has produced praised
the transcendent love of god in ecstatic verses he was the religious
counterpart of the troubadours his passionate devotion to the child
jesus the madonna and the crucified eclipses their most ardent lyrics
these southerners could not forgo the visible emblems of their religion
the infinitely simple principle that only he who calls nothing his own
and desires no earthly goods is perfectly free and can never fall foul
of his neighbour was if not lived up to at any rate understood and
respected the grateful hearts of the people surrounded the name of st
francis with legends the study of his life inspired giotto the father
of the new art to the study of plant and animal life the story of st
francis is written on the walls of the cathedral at assisi the first
monumental work of italian art
st francis relived the terrestrial life of jesus in one direction he
excelled his model for though the love of christ embraced all mankind
the heart of st francis went out to all things beasts and plants and
stars he applied the words whatsoever ye do to the least of my
brethren ye have done unto me to brother bear and his sisters the
little birds he was one of the first men since the greek era who saw
nature in its true aspect and not as a hieroglyphic of the divine word
men had realised with a feeling of helplessness the dangers of the
elements without perceiving their magnificence they had speculated on
and attempted to decipher the secret language of the terrestrial and
celestial phenomena the discovery of the beauty of nature and with it
the revival of aesthetics was an essential part of the newborn
civilisation this fact was accomplishedin an almost sentimental
wayby the troubadours and minnesingers but the relationship of st
francis to nature was something very different the coordination of man
and beastin his sermon to the birds for instancecannot be called
anything but frankly pagan st francis said to his disciples tarry a
little while in the road while i go and preach to my little sisters the
birds and he went into the fields and began to preach to the birds
which sat on the ground and straightway all the others flew down from
the trees and flocked round him and did not fly away until he had
blessed them and when he touched them they did not move and these
were the words which he spoke to them my brothers and sisters little
birds praise god and thank him that he has given you wings with which
to fly and clothed you with a garment of feathers that he admitted your
kind into noahs ark so that your race should not disappear from the
earth be grateful to him that he has given you the air for your
kingdom you sow not neither do you reap but your heavenly father
gives you abundance of food he gave you the rivers and fountains he
gave you the mountains and valleys as a refuge and the high trees so
that you may build your nests in safety and because you can neither
spin nor cook god clothed you and your little ones behold the
greatness of the love of your creator beware of the sin of ingratitude
and diligently praise god all day and when he had thus spoken the
birds opened their beaks beat their wings and bowed to the ground
more than a hundred years later 13001365 a man was living in swabia
whose soul was kindred to the soul of st francis suso who is as a
rule classed with the mystics he had a profound typically german love
of meadow and forest and expressed it more exquisitely than the best
among the minnesingers look above you and around you and behold the
vastness of heaven and the speed of its revolutions the lord has
emblazoned it with seven planets each of whichnot only the sunis
far larger than the earth he has adorned it with myriads of radiant
stars see how serenely the glorious sun is riding in the cloudless sky
giving to the earth abundance of fruit behold the verdure of the
meadow the trees are bursting into leaf and the grass is springing up
behold the smiling flowers and listen to glen and dale reechoing with
the sweet song of the nightingales and little singing birds the beasts
which the bitter winter drove into nooks and crannies and into the dark
ground are emerging from their hidingplaces to rejoice in the sun and
seek a mate young and old are glad with an exceeding joy oh thou
gentle god how fair art thou in thy creatures oh fields and meadows
how surpassing is your beauty or my dear brethren what more shall i
say to you than that my eyes have seen many gladsome sights i walked
across the flowering meadows and listened to the heavenly harps of the
little birds praising their gentle and loving creator so that the woods
echoed with their songs and more compassionate even than st francis
i will say nothing of the children of man but the misery and sorrow
of all the beasts and little birds and all created things is wellnigh
breaking my heart and having no power to help them i sighed and
prayed to the most high most merciful lord that he would deliver
them his description of a paradisean meadow sounds like the
description of a picture by fra angelico now behold with your own eyes
the heavenly meadow lo what summer joy behold the kingdom of sweet
may the valley of all true joy glad eyes are gazing into glad eyes
hark to the harps and fiddles the singing and laughter young men and
maidens are leading the dance love without sorrow shall reign for
ever etc there is a picture drawn by this same suso representing
the journey of man through life his departure from god and his return
in this picture the path of humanity is renunciation and asceticism
death flourishes his scythe above the heads of a dancing couple and
underneath is written this is earthly love its end is sorrow to
such an extent was this sincere and sensitive man under the influence of
the traditional hatred of the world which eckhart his great master had
completely overcome
provenals and italians sang the delight of spring and the german
minnesingers greeted it as the deliverer from all the hardships of the
severe winter with the latter it was more a childish delight in the
openair life which had again become possible after the long
imprisonment of winter than pure joy in beauty but some of the german
epic poems tristan and isolde for instance contain genuine sincere
descriptions of sylvan beauty the student of art especially the german
art of the renascence cannot help being struck by the extraordinary
love with which quite insignificant objects of nature such as a bird
or a flower are treated the familiar things of everyday life were in
this way brought into connection with solemn biblicohistorical
subjects
there is no doubt that at all times a certain keen perception of the
beauty of nature has been inherent in some favoured individuals but the
universally accepted opinion that only the supernal was really
beautiful and that terrestrial beauty was merely its reflected glory
was too strong even for them thus we have seen suso translating the
beauty of the earthly spring to the kingdom of heaven
at the same time men were beginning to travel to distant countries for
the sole purpose of seeing new scenes and acquiring fresh knowledge the
famous venetian marco polo was the first european who in 1300
visited central asia crossed china and thibet and brought news to
europe of the fairyland of japan sightseeing as an end in itself was
discovered long seavoyages for commercial purposes were no novelty
but no human foot had ever trod the summits of the lower alps unless it
had been the foot of a peasant whose cattle had strayed petrarch was
the first man in 1336 to climb a barren mountain the mont ventoux in
provence voluntarily undergoing a certain amount of fatigue for sheer
delight in the beauty of nature this was a great an immortal deed
greater than all his sonnets and treatises put together in a long
letter which has been preserved to us he describes with much spirit and
erudition this extraordinary ascent before whose profound significance
all the alpine exploits of our time shrink into paltry gymnastic
exercises
the beauty of nature discovered and appreciated interest began to be
evinced in the relationship existing between the various phenomena and
there arose a desire to obtain ocular proof of what was written in the
venerable booksperhaps even make new discoveries the first man of any
importance in this direction was the german albrecht bollstdt albertus
magnus who although he contributed more than any other man to the
promulgation of aristotelian philosophy wrote a book on natural history
founded on personal observation his great english contemporary
however roger bacon is the true father of modern experimental science
it was he who coined the expression scientia experimentalis and
framed the principle that all research must be based on the study of
nature he maintained that experience was the mistress of all
sciences and said i respect aristotle and account him the prince of
philosophers but i do not always share his opinion aristotle and the
other philosophers have planted the tree of science but the latter has
not by any means put forth all its branches or matured all its fruit
this thought though it seems to us selfevident was of great moment in
the age of scholasticism bacon spent ten years in prison but in spite
of everything he was so much under the influence of scholasticism that
he considered it the task of philosophy to adduce evidence for the truth
of the christian dogma
here it is essential roughly to sketch the essence of the philosophical
thought of that period and point out the way which led from the
christianity of the fathers of the church and scholasticism to the
religion of unhistorical christianity the socalled mysticism
scholasticism had reached its climax in the thirteenth century
universities were founded in paris oxford and padua and he who aspired
to the full dignity of learning had to take his degrees there even
eckhart did not neglect to obtain his scholastic education in paris
scholasticism was an imposing and yet strangely grotesque system of the
world built upbefore a background of blazing stakesof scriptural
passages and ecclesiastical tradition lofty pure thought and
antiquemediaeval superstition its fundamental problem the
determination of the border line between faith and knowledge was purely
philosophical while the older scholasticism based on platonic
traditions endeavoured to bring these into harmony with christianity
that is to say prove the revelations by dialectics albertus magnus
and authoritatively his pupil thomas aquinas 12261274 strictly
distinguished by the use of aristotelian weapons the rational or
perceptive truths from the supernatural verities or the subjects of
faith this distinction made in order to safeguard dogma quickly
revealed its doubleface the handmaiden philosophy rebelled against her
mistress theology and asked her for her credentials according to the
classic and dogmatic doctrine of thomas the natural verities alone
could be grasped by human understanding the supernatural or revealed
truths the dogmas were beyond proof and scientific cognition to
submit them to research was not only an impossible task but thomas
stigmatised every effort in this direction as heresy fondly believing
that he had once and for all safeguarded the position of faith but more
resolute and profound thinkers although not in so many words attacking
the authority of the scriptures and leaving thomas borderline
unquestioned found the unfathomable truths not in ecclesiastical
tradition but in their own souls thus investing faith with a new
meaning unassailable by criticism
the idea of drawing a line between perceivable or rational truths and
imperceivable or divine truths is fraught with the burning question as
to the limits of human knowledge a question which to this day remains
unanswered in the course of time the limits were extended in favour of
imperfect knowledge but the character of the unknowable was
problematised and questioned while thomas was still convinced of the
possibility of proving the existence of a god by the power of the human
intellect duns scotus removed the problem of the existence of a god and
the immortality of the soul from the domain of science and made both
propositions a matter of faith william of occam more uncompromising
than duns scotus maintained the absolute impossibility of acquiring
knowledge of supernatural things and taughton this point too
anticipating kantthat objective knowledge acquired through the senses
should precede abstract knowledge the last conclusion of nominalism was
thus arrived at the existence of universal conceptions or universals
supposed to exist outside material thingsthe curse of the platonic
inheritancedeclared to be impossible and reality conceded to the
individual only roscellinus the founder of this doctrine had still
been content to deny the existence of the conception of deity leaving
the individual persons father son and holy ghost as real individuals
untouched
we see from the foregoing that the universally derided scholasticism
travelled along the whole line of modern thought from the realism of
thomas which leaves the universals as yet unassailed by doubt and
occupying the very heart of knowledge past the first and to our view
very modest doubts of the nominalists to the agnosticism of bacon duns
and occam
with the new position of decided nominalism the foundation was prepared
for the experimental sciences on the one hand and mysticism on the
other for the conclusion that things supernatural are a closed book to
us may have two results on the one hand the rejection of the
transcendental and the victory of science on the other the need to
descend into the profoundest depths of the universe and the soul and
grasp by intuition what common sense does not see
the time was ripe and the consummators came dante in the south eckhart
in the countries north of the alps with regard to dante i will say one
thing only he gathered together all the achievements of the new art and
transcended them in a work which has never been surpassed the
profoundly symbolical words the new life is beginning are written at
the commencement of his vita nuova and with his divine comedy the
art of europe had attained perfection
it is necessary to give a more detailed account of eckhart he had been
almost forgotten in favour of his pupils tauler and suso and the
unknown author of the theologica germanica to which luther wrote a
preface but today a faint idea of the great importance of this man is
beginning to dawn upon the world eckhart was the greatest creative
religious genius since jesus and i believe that in time his writings
will be considered equal to the gospel of st john he grasped the
spirit of religion with unparalleled depth everything produced by the
highly religious later mediaeval era pales before his illumination
compared to him st augustine st bernard and even st francis
dwindle into insignificance all the later reformers are small beside
the greatness of his soul every one of his sermons contains profound
passages such as god must become i and i must become god the soul
as a separate entity must be so completely annihilated that nothing
remains except god yea that it becomes more glorious than god as the
sun is more glorious than the moon the scriptures were written and
god created the world solely that he may be born in the soul and the
soul again in him the essence of all grain is wheat of all metal
gold and of all creatures man thus spoke a great man there is no
beast but it is in some way a semblance of man the least faculty of
my soul is more infinite than the boundless heavens again we
understand by the kingdom of god the soul for the soul and the deity
are one the soul is the universe and the kingdom of god god dwells
so much within the soul that all his divinity depends on it man shall
be free and master of all his deeds undestroyed and unsubdued
eckhart was the first man who thought consecutively in the german
vernacular and who made this philosophically still virginal language a
medium for expressing profound thought in addition he wrote latin
treatises which were discovered a short time ago i have not read them
but i have no doubt that his profoundest convictions were expressed in
the german tongue the latin language has at all times fettered the
spirit far more successfully than the still untainted and living german
the religious genius of a single individual had created christianity
but from the very beginning it was misunderstood the salvation of the
world was linked to the person of a man who had aspired to be an example
to the whole race the term son of god was understood in the sense
of the herocult of antiquity possibly the jewish faith in a messiah
the politiconational hope of the children of israel was a good deal to
blame for this a historical event was translated into metaphysic the
only truly religious man was made the centre of a new mythology and
navely worshipped it may sound like a paradox but it is a fact that
the whole of the first millenary was inwardly irreligious it concealed
its want of metaphysical intuition behind the falsification of
historical events the entire mediaeval and a large proportion of the
protestant theology laboured to obtain an intellectual grasp of the
doctrine of a unique historical salvation of humanity and frame it into
a dogma and thus occurred that unparalleled misunderstanding a
misunderstanding which never clouded the mind of india which based
religion the timeless metaphysical treasure of the soul on the
historical record of an event which had happened in asia minor and had
come down to us in a more or less garbledsome say entirely
falsifiedversion this was the great sin of christianity it regarded
a historical event revealing the very essence of religion and
consequently capable of being formulated as a divine intervention for
the purpose of bringing about the salvation of the world instead of
recognising in the sublime figure of the founder of the christian
religion a great perhaps even perfect incarnation of the eternally
new relationship between god and the soul it promulgated the strange
thought that only the one soul the soul of the founder was divine and
instead of teaching the divinity of humanity it taught the divinity of
this one man onlyjesus became a god who could no longer be looked upon
as the perfect specimen and prototype of the race but before whom it
behoved man to kneel and pray for salvation perhaps it was not possible
to understand the new doctrine in any other way before men can conceive
the idea of their divinity they must have become conscious of their
souls
this complete misunderstanding and externalising of religion which took
place in the first millenary and which can never now be retrieved is
fundamentally pagan antique the record of the salvation of the world
achieved by a hero once and for all time the historification of the
divine spark which is daily reborn in the soul entirely corresponds to
the greek myths of gods and demigods which before their new symbolical
interpretation were taken quite literally i am not now concerned with
the problem of how far the antique heroes and eastern mysteries directly
influenced the conception of the figure of christ i only wish to
emphasise the profound contrast between true religion which springs up
in the soul of the individual and historical tradition if there is
such a thing as religion it must exist equally for all men for those
who accidentally received a report of a certain historical event as
well as for those who remained in ignorance of the fact all heretical
demonstrations were rooted in a vague realisation of this contrast but
eckhart accomplished the unparalleled deed of once more building a
bridge between the soul and the deity of relegating to the background
all the ineradicable historical misrepresentations or if there was no
alternative of unhesitatingly proclaiming them as erroneous or
interpreting them symbolically st pauls words he says for
instance are nothing but the words of paul it is not true that he
spoke them in a state of grace he did not regard the scriptures as the
bourne of truth but as subsequent proof of the directly experienced
truth of the divine event with this conception christianity had reached
its highest stage henceforth the origin of all truths and values was no
longer sought in doctrine and authority but in the soul of man god was
neither to be found in the heavens nor in history but in the soul the
soul must become divine and creative it had found its task the
recreation of the world it was true st augustine had said non
christianised christi sumus but this saying had never been
understood and very probably st augustine had not meant it in its
literal sense at last the fundamental consciousness of christianity had
triumphed the principle of the sonofgodship inspired the soul of
the mystics in future religion must emanate from the soul and find its
goal in god written documents andin the case of the profoundest
thinkersexamples were no longer needed the heretical sects had been
content to reject postevangelical tradition in order to lay greater
stress on the words of christ they were genuine reformers but they
were as much constrained by the historical facts as the roman catholic
church and their standpoint has to this day remained the standpoint of
the protestant professions of faith
the fact of this new conception attaching no importance to the
historical jesus of nazareth had he never lived it would have made no
difference made of it a new religion by putting aside this external
and accidental moment it placed the metaphysical and purely spiritual
core of christianity the fundamental conviction of the divinity of the
soul and the will to eternal life within the centre of religious
consciousness and by so doing put itself beyond the reach of historical
criticism and scepticism eckhart more than any other teacher was
profoundly convinced of the freedom and eternal value of the soul i
as the son am the same as my heavenly father he taught that christ is
born in the soul that the divine spark is continuously rekindled in
the soul it is the quality of eternity that life and youth are one
and that man must become more and more divine more and more free from
all that is unessential and accidental until he no longer differs from
god it is only a logical conclusion to say that a perfect man
mystically speaking is god his being and his will are in nothing
differentiated from absolute universal divine willgerman mysticism
agrees in this with the upanishads kant would have said that the
principles of such a man would become cosmic laws sin would be the
estrangement from god the will to draw away from god
the profound and only mission of religion is the endowment of man in
this hurlyburly of life with the consciousness of eternity religion
places our transient life under the aspect of eternity and therefore it
must in its essence remain a stranger to things temporal only that
moment in the life of a man can be called religious which lifts him
beyond himself out of his petty narrow existence conditioned by and
subject to accidents into timeless universal life which gives him the
certainty that historical events can never be regarded as definite and
ultimatethat moment which has the power to set free to deliver to
save thus it is irreligious to regard an event which occurred on the
temporal planeand were it the greatest event which ever befell on
earthas the pivot of metaphysical value for all men to link the
salvation of the world to an occurrence which was relatively accidental
to base the consciousness of eternity on the knowledge of a fact this
would be a victory of time over eternity a victory of irreligion over
religion
i regard it as the greatest achievement of that great time that
spontaneous religion again became possible eckhart rediscovered the
divine nature of man never has the consciousness of timeless eternity
been expressed as he expressed it in his tract on solitude doubtless
there have been men before him who possessed direct religious
intuitions and now and then gave timid utterance to them but the
authority of tradition has always been too great and they never did
more than compromise between the historical events on which the
christian religion is based and the genuinely religious experience of
their own souls eckhart too was careful not to offend against the
letter and his pupils after suspicion had fallen on them made many a
concession in terms and perhaps even in thought st augustine already
had steered a middle course between the historical and the religious
conception in his phrase per christum hominem at christum deum and
suso in his booklet of eternal wisdom followed his lead thus
speaks the eternal wisdom if ye will behold me in my eternal divinity
ye must know and love me in my suffering humanity for this is the
quickest road to eternal salvation the brutality of the tenet which
maintains that all those are eternally lost who without their own
fault have no knowledge of the salvation of the world especially
therefore those who died before the event was a stumblingblock to
many thoughtful minds the patriarchs of the old testament were looked
upon as savedto some extentby the fact of their being the ancestors
or prophets of christ but pagans and greeks including aristotle were
condemned even by the great dante at the conclusion of his divine
comedy dante proved himself a truly inspired mystic for he gave to us
the profoundest vision of the divinity which has ever been vouchsafed to
man but his genius was directed and restricted by the dogmas of the
church his religious standpoint was the standpoint of the early middle
ages and dogmatic catholicism as poet and lover he was the inaugurator
of a new world here he represents the culmination and conclusion of the
condemned worldsystem he was the iron landmark of the ageseckhart
the creator of eternal values
the foremost of the precursors of eckhart was bernard of clairvaux
10911153 he was the exponent of the love of god which he placed
above knowledge in one of his letters he calls love the existence of
god himself basing his definition on the passage in the gospel of st
john god is love love is the eternal law which created and
preserves the universe the whole world is governed by love but
although love is the law to which all creation is subject it is not
itself without law but it is a law unto itself serfs and mercenaries
are ruled by laws which are not from god but which they made
themselves some because they do not love god others because they love
the things of this world better than god they made their own laws
and subordinated the universal and eternal laws to their own will but
those who live righteously are in the world as god is neither serfs
nor mercenaries but the children of god and like god himself they
live only by the law of love his greatest happiness is complete
absorption in the vision of the divine and forgetfulness of self all
love is an emanation of that one love it is the eternally creative and
governing law of the universe to be penetrated by such emotion is to
become deified as a drop of water in a cup of wine is completely
dissolved and takes the taste and colour of the wine so also in an
indescribable manner is the human will absorbed in the divine will and
transformed into the will of god for how could god become all in all if
anything human were left in man they are completely immersed the
martyrs in the infinite ocean of eternal light in radiant
eternity the entranced soul shall lose all knowledge of itself
and become completely absorbed in god it shall become unlike itself in
the measure as it has received the gift of becoming divine sensuous
metaphors from the song of songs and the psalms are again and again
intermingled with these lofty thoughts but in spite of his divine
emotion in spite of his anticipations of the german mystics bernard
took the standpoint of ecclesiastical orthodoxy whenever he was not in
the ecstatic state his contemplative mind was unable to grasp the
importance of independent thought a fact amply proved by his inglorious
quarrel with ablard the greatest thinker of his time this quarrel was
a typical illustration of the difference between the believer and the
thinker bernard forgot all about love and did not hesitate to stir up
unpleasantness whenever he could do so so he wrote to pope innocent
ii peter ablard is striving to destroy the christian faith and
imagines that his human intellect can penetrate the depths of the divine
mind nothing is hidden from him neither in the earth below nor in
the heavens above his intellectual pride exceeds all limits he attacks
the doctrines of faith and ponders problems far above his intellectual
capacity he is an inventor of heresies  etc thanks to his
machinations ablard was compelled to recant at the council of sens
and was condemned by the pope to eternal silence berengar of poitier
took ablards part and in a satirical treatise ventured to criticise
st bernards conduct thus philosophise the old women at the looms of
course when bernard tells us that we must love god he speaks a true
and venerable word but he need not have opened his lips to do so for
it is a selfevident truth as a matter of fact these words branded
and contradicted the merely subjective emotional mysticism to the
emotional mystic salvation lies in the absorption in god in
shapeless thoughtless contemplation richard of st victor founding
his theories on st bernard established six stages of meditation the
franciscan monk bonaventura the famous author of the biblia
pauperum added a seventh a complete rest in godlike the sabbath
after the six days of labour to bonaventura as later on to dante the
world was a ladder leading up to god
if we turn from these thinkers of the neolatin race who in spite of
their undeniable mysticism were completely under the dominion of the
churchto german mysticism we find above and beyond mysticism we find
above and beyond love a new principle the soul of man is the
startingpoint of religious consciousness and the content of the
religious consciousness is the souls road to god the nativity of
christ ceased to be regarded as a historical event and became the birth
of the divine principle in the soul of man in passing i will mention a
german nun mechthild of magdeburg 12121277 who anticipated some of
the great thoughts of eckhart although she was incapable of grasping
their mutual connection the holy trinity and everything in heaven and
earth must be subject to me the soul were words in the true spirit
of eckhart leaving st bernard far behind mechthild found metaphors of
true poetical grandeur when she spoke of the union of the soul with god
the dominion of the fire has yet to come that is jesus christ in whose
hands the heavenly father has laid the salvation of the world and the
last judgment on the day of judgment he shall fashion cups of wondrous
beauty out of the crackling sparks therein the father will drink on his
festival all the holiness which through his dear son he has poured into
human souls
emotional mysticism was the prevailing form of mysticism in those days
even eckharts pupil suso belonged to this class of mystics this
vague sentimentalism saved many a mind from the rigid dogmas of the
church and as its vagueness could be interpreted in more than one way
it caused very little offence but these visions and ecstasies which
are so often mistaken for true mysticism have done much to bring the
latter into contempt with the seriously minded eckhart did not
acknowledge it as genuine mysticism and directly condemned it in many of
his writings and as he rejected mystic sentimentalism clearly divining
its pathological cause so he also rejected asceticism and all religious
ceremonies the evangelical poverty of the franciscan monks was an
object of loathing to him st francis and thirty years before him
peter valdez had navely interpreted the imitation of christ as a life
of absolute poverty and had been relentless in his denunciation of
worldly wealth which every monk of his order had to renounce he
himself never touched money seeing in it the source of all evil his
transcendent treasure was holy poverty jacopone wrote an ardent hymn
to queen poverty and even thomas the representative of dominican
erudition theoretically took up the cudgels on its behalf but even in
the primitive church the principle of worldly and spiritual poverty was
widely spread and encouraged in the defence of poverty which was
practically nearly always synonymous with idleness and begging and
therefore roused much hostility among the people bonaventura pointed
out in his treatise de paupertate christi that jesus himself had
never done any manual work the universal preference for a contemplative
life encouraged the tendency and the extreme charitableness of the
middle ages made its realisation possible work was frequently looked
upon as a punishmenta view which could easily be upheld by reference
to adams expulsion from paradiseand inflicted upon the monks for
offences against the rules dantes friend guido cavalcanti expressed
the natural sentiment that poverty is a distressing condition in a
canzone which bristles with insults hurled at the queen of the
franciscans
     yea rightly art thou hated worse than death
     for he at length is longed for in the breast
       but not with thee wild beast
       was ever aught found beautiful or good
       for life is all that man can lose by death
       not fame and the fair summits of applause
       his glory shall not pause
       but live in mens perpetual gratitude
       while he who on thy naked sill has stood
       he shall be counted low etc
                                    dg rossetti
the concept of the german mystics was infinitely more profound than the
concept of the merely external poverty of the franciscans which in the
case of st francis and jacopone was an inherent characteristic and
pure but in the case of the others more or less vicious man cannot
live in this world without labour says eckhart but labour is mans
portion therefore he must learn to have god in his heart although
surrounded by the things of this world and not let his business or his
surroundings be a barrier there is a passage in the book of an unknown
author entitled the imitation of christs poverty formerly ascribed
to tauler which reads as follows poverty is equality with god a
mind turned away from all creatures poverty clings to nothing and
nothing clings to it a man who is poor clings to nothing which is
beneath him but to that alone which is greater than all things and
that is the loftiest virtue of poverty that it clings only to that which
is sublime and takes no heed of the things which are base so far as it
is possible the soul while it is burdened with temporal and transient
things is not free before it can aspire to freedom and nobility it must
cast away all the things of the world nobody can be really poor
unless god make him so but god makes no man poor unless he be in his
inmost heart then all things will be taken from him which are not
gods the more spiritual a man is the poorer will he be for
spirituality and poverty are one pseudotauler even affirms that a
man can possess abundant wealth and yet be poor in spirit the meaning
of this is clear he whose heart is not wrapped up in the things of the
world will find his way to god a soul which is without desire is rich
but there was a still greater contrast between the nave religion
represented by st francis of assisi and the religion of eckhart the
former lived entirely in the obvious and visible the love of all
creatures filled his heart and shaped his life the heart of the mystic
too was filled with love but it was love transcending the love of the
individual love of the primary cause in the last sense eckhart taught
contrary to traditional christianity and in conformity with indian
wisdom that the soul must be absorbed into the absolute and that
everything transient and individual must cease to exist the highest
freedom is that the soul should rise above itself and flow into the
fathomless abyss of its archetype of god himself
even st bernard was not quite free from this mystical heresy cf the
previously quoted passages when he has reached the highest degree of
perfection man is in a state of complete forgetfulness of self and
having entirely ceased to belong to himself becomes one with god
released from everything not divine even compassion must cease in this
state for there is nothing left but justice and perfection
we recognise here a characteristic of all those who are greatest among
men of goethe for instance of bach or kant namely the
correspondence of intense personality and the most highly developed
objectivity for the greatest personality ceases in the end to
distinguish between itself and the world has eradicated everything
paltry selfish and subjective and has become entirely objective
impersonal divine st francis knew nothing of this consciousness god
has chosen me because among all men he could find no one more lowly and
because through my instrumentality he purposed to confound nobility
greatness strength beauty and the wisdom of the world he was the
disciple of the earthly jesus who went through life the compassionate
consoler of all those who were sorrowful but eckhart aspired to the
shapeless nature of god we will follow him but not in all things
he said of the historical jesus he did many things which he meant us
to understand spiritually not literally  we must always follow him
in the profounder sense compared to the religion of eckhart the
religion of st francis is the faith of a little child picturing god as
a benevolent old man such a religion is equally true and sincere but
it represents an earlier stage on the road of humanity if christianity
wereas we are occasionally assuredthe religion of jesus then the
great mystics cannot be called christians and yet st augustines we
are not christians but christs was fulfilled in them
the profoundest depth of european religion of which eckhart was the
exponent and which found artistic expression in gothic art was not
sounded by music until very much later bach more emphatically in the
high mass and the magnificat but also in his purely instrumental music
brought the universal feeling of mysticism to absolute artistic
perfection the deep religious sentiment which pervades the high mass is
so far above all cults that it has no real connection with any
historical faithit is pure consciousness of the divine
the peculiar state of the soul called mysticism could never become
popular or exert any very great influence a few men such as tauler
suso merswin and the unknown author of the theologica germanica
handed onnot by any means always unadulteratedthe doctrine they had
received from eckhartwhich at all times appealed to a few
thinkersbut the real influence on the world and on history was
reserved for the reformers the reformer in his inmost nature is
related to the people his soul is agitated by formulas and ceremonies
to which the mystic is indifferent they are to him obstacles to his
faith and he strains every nerve to destroy them he has every
appearance of the truly free spirit but he is secretly dependent on
that against which he is fighting he suffers under its inefficiency
his deed is the final reaction against his environment salvation seems
to him to lie in the improvement of existing conditions and not until
he has succeeded in accomplishing his purpose can he hope for religious
peace the mystic is possible in all states of civilisation he is not
dependent on external circumstances his whole consciousness is filled
with one problem only before which everything else pales the
relationship of the soul to god but the reformer is possible only under
certain circumstances he too starts from an inner religious
consciousness but his problem is soon solved and he devotes all his
energy to the world the mystic is not even aware of the difference
between his own conception of god and traditional religion he is under
the impression that he is still an orthodox believer long after he has
broken fresh ground for he has taken from the traditional doctrine
everything which he can reanimate the remainder is dead as far as he
is concerned to accuse him of heresy appears to him as a monstrous
misunderstanding
thus mystic and reformer drink from the same well of direct religious
consciousness but while in the case of the mystic the well is
fathomless it is much more shallow in the case of the reformer certain
of himself he directs his energy to the conversion and reformation of
the world he resembles in some respects the public orator and
agitator he has a grasp of social conditions strives to influence his
surroundings by word and deed and is ready to sacrifice his life to his
convictions the mystic remains solitary and misunderstood luther who
was to some extent influenced by german mysticism fought at his best
against the dogma of historical salvation
it is the tragic fate of all religions that they must crystallise into a
system a reflection of the enthusiasm which animated their founders
still falls on their disciples follow me but the second generation
already demands proofs tradition and clumsy miracles reports are drawn
up and looked upon as sacredreligion has become a glimpse into the
past most people never have any direct religious experience their
salvation lies in the dogmas the universally accepted doctrines the
founder of a new religion is always regarded by his contemporaries as
abnormal and is persecuted accordingly not in malice but of
necessity arnold of brescia died at the stake st francis was no more
than a heretic tolerated by the church and eckhart escaped the tribunal
of the inquisition only through his death
i have attempted to show in diverse domains of the higher spiritual and
psychical life how powerfully the christian principle of the
individual soul the real fundamental value of the european
civilisation manifested itself at the time of the crusades and
everywhere became the germ of new things the deepest thinkers teach the
deification of man as the culmination of existence the ultimate purpose
of this earthly life and claim immortality for the soul this position
which may roughly be conceived as the raising of the individual into the
ideal has determined the european ideal of culture and differentiated
it from all orientalism including even the loftiest indian philosophy
every attempt to substitute for this fundamental concept and its
emotional content something elsewhether it be pantheism buddhism or
naturalismwill always remain a failure
side by side with the splendid achievement of the german mysticism the
teutonic race has always been apt to give practical proof of its
individualism by endless petty quarrels and by splittings into numerous
cliques but even before this race began to play a part in history at
the beginning of the third century the principle of the individual soul
was outwardly carried to extremes while it was the ideal of the man of
antiquity to serve the higher community of the state with body and soul
nascent christianity cared solely for the salvation of the individual
soul and frequently proved this by quite external evidence by living a
hermits life in the desert for instance children left their parents
husband and wife separated dignitaries forsook their office to seek
solitude and prepare their souls for the world beyond the grave the
first conventsthe outcome of christian individualism and
asceticismwere founded and the antisocial extreme of this
individualism acquired such ominous proportions that the emperor valens
in the year of grace 365 was forced to legislate against the monastic
life
this hatred of the world which was quite in harmony with the spirit of
christianity was only overcome by the profounder concepts of german
mysticism for in the primitive dualistic view of the first millenary
the renunciation of the world was the only possibility of avoiding sin
the emperor justinian decreed that any man who induced a consecrated nun
to marry him should be punished by death the thought that personal
greatness did not consist in renouncing the world but in living in it
and overcoming it had not yet been conceived
the delight in the human form characteristic of antiquity was
extinguished a crude dualism denied all antique values the body must
be hated so that the soul could flourish but as the hellenic period
was preceded by vague unindividualised material life so the
impersonal chaotic spiritual life of the first thousand years of
christianity matured the individual soul it found its climax in dante
and eckhart the greatest poet of the neolatin race and the most
illumined religious genius of germany these two men who were
contemporaries dante died in 1321 and eckhart in 1329 finally
revealed the character of two kindred nations completing and
fructifying each other in dante the great artistic power of the
neolatin race appeared for the first time in its full intensity it
took possession of the whole visible universe and poured new beauty
into the traditional myths of christendom eckhart experienced and
recreated the shapeless depths of the soul the regions of the blending
of the soul with god with these two men europe definitely severed
herself from antiquity and barbarism henceforth to follow her own star
the new world had come into existence renascence the lucky heir
gathered the ripe fruit from the tree of art which had blossomed so
marvellously god was no longer sought in the depth of the soul all
emotion was projected into the world of sense churches were built not
from an irresistible impulse but as storehouses of the pictures which
were painted with amazing rapidity the fundamental principle of
personality was externalised in the renascence vanity and boasting
traces of which frequently appeared in the age of chivalry grew
exuberantly no less manifest than the incomparable genius and esprit
of the heyday of the renascencealthough far less frequently commented
onwas the desire to be conspicuous to shine to display wealth and
learning the essence of personality instead of being sought in the
soul was sought in outward magnificence as a matter of fact the much
extolled renascence only perfected the various branches of art and
poetry which had sprung up in the period of the crusades the latter
was the time of the planting of the tree of european culture all that
followed was merely its growth and ramification only exact science had
its origin in the renascence and this fact in historical perspective
must be regarded as the supreme glory of this period however
paradoxical it may soundthe impersonal science is the perfection of
the european system of individualism its most potent weapon for taking
spiritual possession of the world and all that the world contains the
consciousness of personality had to permeate the whole soul before it
could recover its external function organic existence justified by
itself while art borrows from nature and mankind all that we ourselves
deem beautiful perfect valuable and imposes on the world a manmade
lawscience strives to understand all things and all creatures
according to the law which dominates them it strives to comprehend
nature and humanityeven where they are foreign and hostilenot
according to human values but according to their inherent natureand
this is only possible when the individuality of all things is respected
the method of science has slowly become the perfect weapon by whose aid
europe has attained the mastery of the world it rests on the
fundamental feeling for the material and is capable of confronting the
i with the whole system of natural phenomena the noti and
expresses the final victory of comprehending spirit over matter
chapter ii
the deification of woman
the first form of metaphysical eroticism
a the love of the troubadours
in the long chapter on the birth of europe i have attempted to bring
corroborative evidence from all sides in support of my contention that
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries witnessed the birth and gradual
development of a new value of the highest importance the value of
individuality impersonated by the citizen of europe we are now
prepared to realise the psychological importance and the importance for
progress of one of the greatest results of this new developmentthe
spiritual love of man for woman from this subject the specific subject
of my book i shall not again digress
we are aware that the man of antiquity and also the eastern nations of
today recognised between man and woman only the sexual bond
uninfluenced by personal and psychological motives and leading in
greece to the institution of monogamy on purely economical and political
grounds in addition to this bond there existed a very distinct
spiritual love evolved by plato and his circle and projected by one man
on another member of his own sex in the true hellenic spirit this love
aspired to guide the individual to the ideal of perfection the beauty
and wisdom of the friend serving as steppingstones in the upward climb
in christianity the spiritual love of the divine became the greatest
value and the pivot on which the emotions turned the primitive
christian scorned the body his own as well as that of his fellow he
despised beauty of form and regarded only the divine as worthy of love
woman was disparaged and suspected all thinkers down to thomas and
anselm looking upon her merely as a snare and a pitfall the period
discussed in detail in the foregoing chapter ushered in a new and until
then unknown feeling in crude and conscious contrast to sexuality
deprecated alike by classical greece and primitive christianity
spiritual love of man for woman came into existence it was composed of
three clearly distinguishable elements the platonic thought
maintaining that the greatest virtue lies in the striving for absolute
perfection the entirely spiritual love of the divine sufficient in
itself and representing the final purpose of life as developed by
christianity and the dawning knowledge of the value of personality
from these three elements the noblest inheritance of antiquity the
central creation of christianity and the pivot of the newborn european
spirit sprang the new value which is the subject of the second stage of
eroticism the position of woman had changed she was no longer the
medium for the satisfaction of the male impulse or the rearing of
children as in antiquity no longer the silent drudge or devout sister
of the first christian millenary no longer the shedevil of monkish
conception transcending humanity she had been exalted to the heavens
and had become a goddess she was loved and adored with a devotion not
of this earth a devotion which was the sole source of all things lofty
and good she had become the saviour of humanity and queen of the
universe
the rejection of sensuality is an inherent part of the christian
religion only he who had overcome his sinful desires was a hero
spiritual love was as yet unknown only the sexual impulse was realised
and that was looked upon as a sin there was but one way of escape
renunciation this view is very clearly expressed in the legends of
alexius and in barlaam and josaphat which although of indian origin
had found a german interpreter and were known all over europe the
latter legend tells how prince josaphat a devout christian married a
beautiful princess on his wedding night he had a vision of the
celestial paradise the dominion of chastity and the earthly pool of
sin recognising in his bride a devil who had come to tempt him he left
her and fled into the desert many legends illustrate the incapacity of
the first millenary to realise the relationship between the sexes in any
other sense woman was evil the struggle against her a laudable effort
very probably the stigmatising of all eroticism during that long spell
of a thousand years was necessary only the unnatural condemnation of
love in its widest sense a hatred of sex and woman such as was felt by
tertullian and origen could result in the reverse of sexualitypurely
spiritual love with its logical climax the deification and worship of
woman there can be no doubt that the christian ideal of chastity was
largely responsible for the evolution of the ideal of spiritual love
the identity of love and chastity was propoundedin sharp contrast to
sexuality andmore particularly amongst the later troubadours such as
montanhagol sordello and the poets of the sweet new style in
italywith a distinct leaning towards religious ecstasy
infinite tenderness pervaded the nascent cult of woman it seemed as if
man were eager to compensate her for the indignity which he had heaped
upon her for a thousand years his instinctive need to worship had found
an incomparable being on earth before whom he prostrated himself she
was the climax of earthly perfection no word no metaphor was
sufficiently ecstatic to express the full fervour of his adoration a
new religion was created and she was the presiding divinity what were
the world if beauteous woman were not sang johannes hadlaub a german
poet
once more i must revert to personality the fundamental value of the
european in antiquity even in greece and rome personality in its
higher sense did not exist the hero was the epitome of all the energies
of the nation a term for the striving of the community the statesman
was the incarnate political will of the people even the poets ideal
was the representation of the hellenic type in all its aspects
agamemnon was no more than the intelligent ruler achilles the
headstrong hero odysseus the cunning adventurer the individual was a
member and servant of the tribe the town the state each man knew that
his fellow did not essentially differ from him and even at the period
when hellas was at its meridian the individuals were compared to modern
men but slightly differentiated but the greek differed from the
oriental the barbarian inasmuch as he felt himself no longer a
component part of nature but realised his distinct individuality
we find the first germs of the new creative principle of personality in
the platonic figure of socrates who first of all conceived the idea of
a higher spiritual love blended it with the love of ideas and separated
it sharply from base desire though his conception was not yet personal
love in the true sense it was nevertheless a spiritual divine love the
greek state could not tolerate him and sentenced him to death but this
same socrates also said in crito that man was indebted to the state
for his existence did not thy father in obedience to the law take
thy mother to wife and beget thee this sentiment was as antique as it
could well be and the death of socratesas related by platowas the
most magnificent confirmation of the greek idea that the individual
even the wisest was entirely subordinate to the community
the civilisations of china and japan are impersonal even to a greater
extent than the civilisation of ancient greece percival lowell
maintains that the diverse manifestations of the spirit of those
countries can only be understood if regarded from the standpoint of
absolute impersonality he sees in a pronounced impersonality the most
striking characteristic of the far east the foundation on which the
oriental character is built up it is very instructive to observe how
it determines the individuals conception of birth and marriage
thoughts and acts life and death it is carried to so great an extreme
that special terms for i you he do not even exist in the
japanese language and have to be replaced by objective circumlocutions
not content with the fact of having been born impersonal it is the
ambition of the inhabitant of the far east to become more and more so as
his life unfolds itself witness the heroic exploits of japanese
soldiers during the last war individual soldiers frequently went to
their death for the sake of a small advantage to their group we
europeans regard this in the light of heroismand it would be heroism
in the case of a european but with the sacrifice of his individual life
in the interest of the community the japanese instinctively yields the
smaller value in the same way greeks and romans did not attach very
much importance to life suicide was very common and frequently
committed without any special motive as true love is based on
personality it is impossible for the modern eastasiatic to know love
in our sense lowell agrees with this love as we understand it is an
unknown feeling in the east he reports that japanese women will appear
before strangers entirely nude without the least trace of
embarrassmentas would greek womenbecause they are innocent of that
other aspect of personalitythe feeling of shame to be ashamed implies
the desire of concealing something individual and intimate where this
is not the case there can be no feeling of shame finally i should
like to point out that the perversity and sexual refinement peculiar to
china and japan are attributable simply to the fact that the limits of
sexuality cannot be overstepped and that sexuality is therefore
dependent on vice and perversity to satisfy its craving for variety
the first manifestation of overwhelming personality appears in jesus
and he created the religion of love in him personality and love were
convertible forces one might even say they were identical he first of
all revealed their mysterious intimate connection and clearly showed
that love can only be experienced by a distinct personality because it
is an emanation of the soul and not a natural instinct
it was again personality which in the twelfth century produced a new
force spiritual love projected not only on god and nature but also on
woman now only had personality acquired its true significance it no
longer meantas it did in the mature greek worldthe individual
separated from his environment the individual with a conscious
beginning and a conscious end but the principle of the synthesis a
higher entity above the mere individual the source of all values and
virtue
personality is the selfconscious individual soul producing out of its
own wealth the universal ideal values and reabsorbing and assimilating
these ideal values in their higher form it admits of the fusion of the
subjective with the universal and eternal with the religious and
artistic the moral and scientific values of civilisation personality
is the blending of the universal and the individual said kierkegaard
expressing if not exactly my meaning something very near it
i shall endeavour to depict the spiritual love of man for womanthe
position cannot be reversedfrom its inception to its climax i shall
submit abundant evidence to make the great unbroken stream of emotion
clearly apparent and indicate all its tributaries i do not pretend
that i have exhausted the subjectthat would be impossible the works
from which i have drawn may be safely regarded as the direct outpouring
of emotion those purely lyric poets were entirely subjective and ever
intent upon their own feelings there hardly exists one provenal
olditalian or medival lovesong without the i
spiritual love first appeared as a nave sentimentunconscious of its
own peculiar characteristicsin the poems of the earlier troubadours of
provence there is a poem in which the provenals claim the fathership
of the cult of woman their opponents do not deny it but add that it
was an invention which could fill no mans stomach these words
express the great and insurmountable barrier between pure spiritual love
and pleasure the christian dualism soulbody spiritmatter had
invaded the domain of love
spontaneous genuine love untainted by speculations and metaphysics is
found in the songs of the earlier troubadours the greatest among all of
them bernart of ventadour was the first to praise chaste love if any
champion of civilisation deserves a monument it is this poet
     dead is the man who knows not love
     a sweet tremor in the heart
     loves rapture fills my heart
     with laughter and sighs
     grief slays me a hundred times
     joy bids me rise
     sweet is loves happiness
     sweeter loves pain
     joy brings back grief to me
     grief joy again
guillem augier novella expressed the feeling of being elated with
exaltation and grieved to death as follows
     lady often flow my tears
     glad songs in my memry ring
     for the love that makes my blood
     dance and sing
     i am yours with heart and soul
     if it please you lady slay me
aimeril de peguilhan is of opinion that the pain of love is no less
sweet than the joy of love
     for he who loves with all his heart would fain
     be sick with love such rapture is his pain
and bernart again
     god keep my lady fair from grief and woe
     im close to her however far i go
     if god will be her shelter and her shield
     then all my hearts desire is fulfilled
and
     my mind was erring in a maze
     that hour i was no longer i
     when in your eyes i met my gaze
     as in a mirror strange and shy
     oh mirror sweet reflecting me
     sighing i fell beneath your spell
     i perished in you utterly
     as did narcissus in the well
in the same poem he goes on to say that he will ask for no reward but
finally concludes
     my fervent kisses her sweet lips should cover
     for weeks theyd show the traces of her lover
the german minnesinger heinrich of morungen called woman a mirror of
all the delights of the world and sang
     blessed be the tender hour
     blest the time the precious day
     when my brimming heart welled over
     when my secret open lay
     i was startled with great gladness
     and bewildered so with love
     i can hardly sing thereof
the sensuous element still dominated bernart and his contemporaries to
some extent in their poems all of which are genuine and sincere the
longing for kisses sometimes for more is frankly expressed but the
tendency towards the not sensuous and supersensuous is already
apparent the lover loves one woman only and would rather love in vain
patiently enduring every pang she causes him than receive favours from
another woman were she beautiful as venus her self
bernart says
     my sorrow is a sweet distress
     to which no alien bliss compares
     and if my pain such sweetness bears
     how sweet would be my happiness
elias of barjols
     full of joy i am and sorrow
     when i stand before her face
bonifacio calvo
     there is no treasuretrove on earth
     which i would barter for my pain
     i love my grief but spite and wrath
     run riot in my heart my brain
     is reelingand i laugh and cry
     jubilant and desperate
     exultant i bewail my fate
     quarter lady ere i die
the earlier troubadours were still ignorant of the later dogma which
made chaste love the sole fountain of virtue and the road to
perfectionthe beloved woman can make of her admirer what she willsa
saint or a sinner
thus guillem of poitiers says
     love heals the sick
     and a grave does it delve
     for the strong mars the beauty of beauty itself
     makes a fool of the sage with its magic
     a clown of the courteous knight
     and a king of the lowliest wight
the equally early cercamon
     false can i be or true for her
     sincere or full of lies
     a perfect knight or worthless cur
     serene or grave stupid or wise
raimon of toulouse
     in the kingdom of love
     folly rules and not sense
it was typical of this enthusiastic love that the social rank of the
beloved the mistress was invariably above the rank of the lover the
latter was fond of calling himself her vassal and serf proclaiming that
she had invested him with all his goods even kings and german emperors
composed lovesongs although in all probability they would have
achieved their purpose far more quickly by other means but in all cases
we find the characteristic attitude of the humble lover looking up to
his mistress the underlying thought is obvious love the loftiest
value in all the world is the great leveller of all social differences
a force before which wealth is as dust i would rather win a kind
glance from my ladys eyes than the royal crown of france was a
favourite profession of the poets montanhagol for instance in a
rhymed meditation stated that a lady was wise in choosing a lover of a
lower social rank because not only could she always count on his
gratitude and devotion but she would also have more influence over him
a fact which in the case of a social equal or superior was to say the
least a little doubtful this supreme reverence for love soon became an
accepted doctrine we constantly meet the thought that chaste love alone
can make a man noble good and wise i will select a few illustrations
from a wealth of instances
miraval
     noble is every deed whose root is love
peire rogier
     full well i know that right and good
     is all i do for love of her
guirot riquier
     the man who loves not is not nobleminded
     for love is fruit and blossom of the highest
and
     thus love transfigures evry deed we do
     and love gives everything a deeper sense
     love is the teaching of all genuine worth
     so base is no mans heart on this wide earth
     love could not guide it to great excellence
giraut of calenso said of the city of love that no base or ignorant man
could enter it and the italian lapo gianni sang
     the youthful maiden who appeared to me
     so filled my soul with pure and lofty thoughts
     that henceforth all ignoble things i scorn
dante in the vita nuova calls beatrice the destroyer of all evil and
the queen of all virtues
the very thought of the beloved makes a good man of the lover
     i cannot sin when i am in her thoughts
asserts the sincere guirot riquier and he prays christ to teach him the
true love of woman
while it was a generally accepted theory that love was the source of
mans perfection i know of only one passage by raimon of miraval
contending that woman also was perfected by love everywhere else we
meet the universal and silently accepted opinion that the essence of
womanhood is something unearthly unfathomable and divine perhaps the
most classical formulation of the new doctrine to wit that spiritual
love is the begetter of all virtue and the mother of chastity outside
which there is nothing divine is to be found in the poems of the
somewhat pedantic montanhagol
     the lover who loves not the highest love
     is like a fool polluting precious wine
     let loftiest love alone within thee move
     and purity and virtue will be thine
guirot riquier expressed a similar sentiment
     for chaste and pure my love has always been
     from my sweet bliss ive never asked a boon
     if i may humbly serve her night and noon
     my life be her inalienable lien
walter von der vogelweide says love is a treasure heaped up of all
virtues
as time went on the barrier erected between true spiritual love and
insidious sensuality became more and more clearly defined the former
pervaded the erotic emotion of the whole period parallel with chaste
love sensuality continued to exist as something contemptible unworthy
of a noble mind and it must be admitted that according to the
contemporary fabliaux later german comedies and italian and french
novels the sexual manifestations of the period were of incredible
coarseness as against these spiritual love was not merely an artistic
and theoretic concept but the profound emotion of the cultured minds
and remained a powerful and creative force even in later centuries
spiritual love and sexuality were irreconcilable contradistinctions the
man who thought otherwise was looked upon as a libertine the following
passages from the poems of the troubadours and their heirs the italian
poets of the dolce stil nuovo will prove the historical reality of
this relationship the ideal of the declining middle ages we need take
no account of the german minnesingers for although they shared the same
ideal they did not influence principle in the same way as the neolatin
poets
bernart of ventadour
       lady i ask no other meed
     than that you suffer me to serve
     my faith and love shall never swerve
       im yours whatever you decreed
peire rogier
     mine is her smile and mine her jest
     and foolish were i more to ask
     and not to think me wholly blest
     tis no deceit
     to gaze at her is all i need
     the sight of her is my reward
gaucelm faidit
     of all the ways of love i chose the best
     i love you love with ardour infinite
     yours is my life do as you will with it
     nor kiss i ask nor sweet embraces lest
     i were blaspheming
the most enthusiastic champions of pure love were montanhagol sordello
and guirot riqiuer the former maintained that a lover who asked for
favours incompatible with his ladys honour neither loved her nor
deserved to be lovedlove begets purity and he who knows the meaning
of love can never forsake virtue
there is a controversy between peire guillem of toulouse and sordello
which contains the following passages
     of all mankind i never saw
     a man like you sordell i wis
     for he who woman does adore
     will never flout her love and kiss
     and what to others is a prize
     you surely dont mean to despise
     honour and joy i crave from her
     and if a little rose she bind
     into the wreath sir guillem peire
     from mercy not from duty mind
     that would be happiness indeed
     oh that such bliss should be my meed
     a humble lover such as you
     sordell in faith i never knew
     sir peire methinks what you express
     is lacking much in seemliness
in another poem the talented sordello says
     my love for her is so profound
     id serve her spurn and scorn despite
     ere with another id be found
     yet id not serve without requite
and in another after stating that he loves his lady so much that he
would thank her even if she killed him he continues
     thus lady i commend to thee
     my fate and life thy faithful squire
     id rather die in misery
     than have thee stoop to my desire
     the knight who truly loves his dame
     not only loves her comely face
     dearer to him is her fair fame
     undimmed unsullied by disgrace
     how grievously i should offend
     thy virtue if i spoke of passion
     but if i didwhich god forfend
     sweet lady stoop not to compassion
although sordello appeared so extremely modest yet he was grieved to
death because his lady did not return his love there is a poem in which
he compares himself to a drowning man whom the beloved alone could save
this spiritual love then as now puzzled the commonplace and was
misunderstood and regarded with scepticism bertran dalaman taunted
sordello with his hypocritical happiness and the whole deception of
his love and granet in a satirical poem cast doubt upon his
sincerity
it is very significant to find that sordello that typical champion of
chaste love kept up a number of questionable liaisons with all sorts of
women bertran reproached him with having changed his lady at least a
hundred times and he himself shamelessly confesses
     the jealousies of husbands neer amaze me
     for in the art of love i do excel
     and theres no wife however chaste she may be
     who can resist me if i woo her well
       and if her husband hate me ill not grumble
     because his wife receives me in the night
     if mine her kiss if mine sweet loves delight
       his pain and wrath my spirit shall not humble
     no husband eer shall rob me of my pleasure
     none can resist me what i wish i gain
     all do i love and never will refrain
     spite husbands wrath to rob them of their treasure
it may seem strange at first sight that this enthusiastic exponent of
pure love should have led such a double life but sordellos conduct is
not in the least paradoxical in accordance with the tendency of the
period he carefully distinguished in his own heart between sexuality
and love before the one he lay prostrate unable to find words enough
in selfdepreciation so that he might the more exalt his mistress but
with respect to all other women he was a mere sensualist we read that
although he was an expert in the treatment of women in her presence
his voice forsook him and he lost all selfcontrol petrarch whowhile
living with a very earthly womanextolled all his life long a lofty
being whom he called laura was akin to sordello although he was a far
less brutal character the latter approached the type of the seeker of
love the don juan
in a tenzone between peirol and the dauphin of auvergne the former
maintains that love must die at the moment of its consummation i
cannot believe he says that a true lover can continue to love after
he has received the last favour otto weininger agrees with this but
peirol winds up with the subtle suggestion that though love be dead a
man should always continue to behave as if he were still in love
the troubadours never weary of drawing a line between drudaria and
luxuria pure love and base desire mezura seemliness is
contrasted with dezmezura licentiousness pure love is regarded as
the creator of all high values luxuriousness as their destroyer in the
same way the german minnesingers distinguished between low love and
high love
as both cultured minds and the upper classes contemning sexuality
acknowledged spiritual love only it follows as a matter of course that
the avowal of such sentiments became good form the motif that the
honour of the beloved must be carefully shielded and that no desire
must dim her purity occurs again and again but it should not be
forgotten that a poet may love a sentiment for its own sake without
being in the least influenced by it many a troubadour drew inspiration
from an emotion which all praised as the supreme value even if he had
no earthly mistress he adored the sublime sentiment not infrequently
it happened that a troubadour who had been loud in praise of high love
and denunciation of base desirea trick of his tradesuddenly came to
himself and changed his mind folquet of marseilles for instance after
more than ten years of vain sighing came to the conclusion that he had
been a fool
     deceitful love beguiles the simple fool
     and binds with magic thongs the hapless wight
     that like a moth lured by the candlelight
     he hovers helpless round the heartless ghoul
     i cast thee out and follow other stars
     full evil was my meed and recompense
     new courage steels my fainting heart and hence
     i kneel at shrines which passion never mars
in an interesting poem garin the red implores mezura to teach him the
way to love purely and nobly but he is anything but pleased with his
instructress and comes to the conclusion that her whole wisdom is just
good form and nothing else
     but by my merry mood impelled
     i kiss and dally night and morn
     and do the things i feel compelled
     to door else with tonsure shorn
     id seek a cloister
elias of barjols finding that his love will never be returned and
having no mind to sigh all his life in vain renounces love altogether
i should be a fool if i served love any longer
all you lovers are fools exclaimed another do you think you can
change the nature of women this is one of the very rare criticisms of
woman as a rule we hear only of her angelic perfection wisdom beauty
and aloofness
the distinguished poet marcabru was a womanhater and enemy of love
from the very beginning he said of himself that he had never loved a
woman and that no woman had ever loved him
     the love which is always a lie
     and deceiver of men i decry
     and denounce i had more than enough
     can you count all the evil it wrought
     when i think of it i am distraught
     what a madman i was to believe
     to sigh to rejoice and to grieve
     but no longer ill squander my days
     we have come to the parting of the ways etc
he was indefatigable in abusing the tender passion and had a great deal
to say about the immorality of women but it is characteristic of the
strong public opinion of the time that even this misogynist who
perhaps after all was only a disappointed man praised high love
the subject also found its theorists prominent among whom was the
courtchaplain andreas who wrote a very learned book on love in latin
he expressed in propositions and conclusions what the contemporary poets
expressed in verse proving thereby that spiritual love was not merely a
poetic fiction but the profoundest belief of the period supported by
the full complement of its philosophical weapons in the whole world
there is no good and no courtliness outside the fountain of love
therefore love is the beginning and foundation of all good he also
proved that a nobleminded man must be a lover for if he were not he
could not have attained virtue love disregards all barriers and makes
the man of low origin the equal and superior of the nobleman
this conception of spiritual nobility which was later on perfected in
the theory of the cor gentil only existed in provence and in italy
it remained unknown in france and germany
andreas drew a distinction between base love the amor mixtus sive
communis and pure love the amor purus love he maintained fully
agreeing with the poets gives to a man the strength of chastity for
he whose heart is brimming over with the love of a woman cannot think
of dallying with another however beautiful she may be he proved from
substance and form that a man cannot love two women in the leys
damors a voluminous fourteenthcentury provenal treatise largely a
textbook of grammar and prosody we read and now lovers must be
taught how to love passionate lovers must be restrained so that they
may come to realise their evil and dishonourable desires no good
troubadour who is at the same time an honest lover has ever abandoned
himself to base sensuality and ignoble desires the same author opined
that a troubadour who asked his lady for a kiss was committing an act
of indecency on the other hand andreas was very broadminded in
drawing the line between both kinds of love allowing kisses and even
more in the case of true love the best troubadours disagree with him
in this respect
a scholasticism of love modelled on ecclesiastical scholasticism and
substituting the beloved woman for the deity was gradually evolved
love veneration humility hope etc were the sacrifices offered at
her shrine she was full of grace and compassion and was believed in as
fervently as was god some of the poets were animated by a curious
ambition to prove their feelings with scholastic erudition and more
especially by the later italian school amore cor gentil
valore were conceived as substances attributes inherent qualities
etc the allegories of amore played a prominent part and spoiled many
a masterpiece the german poets steered clear of these absurdities
which even dante did not escape
at the famous courts of love presided over by princesses the most
extraordinary questions relating to love were discussed and decided with
a ceremonial closely following the ceremonial of the petty courts of
law andreas preserved for us a number of these judgments some of which
prove the really quite obvious fact that love and marriage are two very
different things for if spiritual love be considered the supreme value
matrimony can only be regarded as an inferior condition and it was a
fact that in the higher ranks of societythe only ones with which we
are concerneda marriage was nothing but a contract made for political
and economical reasons the baron desired to enlarge his estate obtain
a dowry or marry into an influential family no one dreamed of
consulting the future bride whom marriage alone could bring into
contact with people outside her own family to her marriage meant the
permission to shine and be adored by a man who was not her husband it
is an undeniable fact propounded andreas as regula amoris that
there is no room for love between husband and wife and fauriel
translated a passage as follows a husband who proposed to behave to
his wife as a knight would to his lady would propose to do something
contrary to the canons of honour such a proceeding could neither
increase his virtue nor the virtue of his lady and nothing could come
of it but what already properly existsanother judgment maintained
that a lady lost her admirer as soon as the latter became her husband
and that she was therefore entitled to take a new lover at the court
of love of the viscountess ermengarde of narbonne the problem whether
the love between husband and wife or the love between lovers were the
greater was decided as follows the affection between a married couple
and the tender love which unites two lovers are emotions which differ
fundamentally and according to custom it would be folly to attempt a
comparison between two subjects which neither resemble each other nor
have any connection a husband declared it is true i have a
beautiful wife and i love her with conjugal love but because true love
is impossible between husband and wife and because everything good
which happens in this world has its origin in love i am of opinion that
i should seek an alliance of love outside my married life all this was
not frivolity but the only logical conclusion of dualistic eroticism
incapable of blending sensuality and love it was equally logical that
love between divorced persons was not only regarded as not immoral but
as perfectly right and justifiable it was even decided that a new
marriage could never become a drawback to old love in the old novel
grard of roussillon the princess beloved by grard is married to
the emperor charles martel and compelled to part from her knight at
their last meeting before a number of witnesses she called on the name
of christ and said know ye all that i give my love to sir grard with
this ring and this flower from my chaplet i love him more than father
and husband and now i must weep tears of bitter sorrow after this
they parted but their love continued undiminished though there was
nothing between them but tender wishes and secret thoughts
matrimony had no advantage over the lovealliance not even the
sanction of the church a lovealliance was frequently accompanied by a
ceremony in which a priest officiated fauriel describeswithout
mentioning his sourcesuch a ceremony as follows kneeling before his
lady with his folded hands between hers he dedicated himself to her
service vowing to be faithful to her until death and to shield her
from all harm and insults as far as lay within his power the lady on
her side declared her willingness to accept his service promised to
devote her loftiest feelings to him and as a rule gave him a ring as a
symbol of their union then she raised and kissed him always for the
first usually for the last time the parting of the lovers too was a
solemn act resembling in many ways the dissolution of a marriage
       so that our solemn plighted troth
     when love is dead we shall not break
     well to the priest ourselves betake
     you set me free as i do you
     a perfect right then shall we both
     enjoy to choose a love anew
wrote peire of barjac
it was far more easy to dissolve a marriage than a true lovealliance
the husband had only to state that his wife was a distant relation of
his and the church was ready to annul the contract but the
loveallianceso sordello maintained in a long poemshould be more
binding than any marriage
     only one love a woman can
     prefer so let her choose her man
     with care to him she must be true
     for choosing once she neer may rue
     more binding than the weddingtie
     is love for a diversity
     of causes wedlock may divide
     by death alone be love untied
the idea that marriage and love cannot be combined is therefore only the
logical conclusion of the fundamental feeling that love and desire
cannot together be projected on one woman
if matrimonial love had not been questioned the choice would have lain
between two alternatives the canonisation of matrimonyan expedient
chosen by the churchor a fusion of love and sexuality in our modern
sense the first was a stage which humanity had left behind for the
ideal of absolutely perfect and pure love had already been evolved and
the world was not ripe for the second the tendency of the rarest minds
was in the direction of a further idealisation of love of freeing it
from all earthly shackles and bringing it nearer and nearer to heaven
one of the early troubadours jaufre rudel prince of blaya gave a
practical illustration to this feeling by falling in love with a lady
whom he had never seen the story of his love was famous for centuries
he loved a countess of tripoli a christian princess and his whole soul
was filled with his imaginary picture of her the provenal biography
relates that he worshipped her for all the good the pilgrims had
narrated of her in order to see her he took the cross and journeyed
across the sea he fell ill on the ship and was carried ashore in a
dying condition the countess on hearing of his great love hastened to
the inn where he lay as she entered his room jaufre regained
consciousness he knew her at once and died happily in her arms she was
so touched by his love that she henceforth renounced the worldthis
story is no fairy tale it is well attested and universally accounted
genuine today jaufres love expressed in touching poems was no
amour de tte as it is sometimes called but a genuine amour de
coeur a purely spiritual love which asked nothing of the beloved
woman but permission to love her there are other instances and even in
later times it is not an infrequent occurrence in the case of
imaginative people i need only mention brger and klopstock
we men of the present age look upon this eccentric womanworship with
uncomprehending eyes perhaps we shall feel a little less bewildered
when we meet it stripped of courtly theories and mediaeval fashions in
some of the great men who are closely connected with our own period in
michelangelo in goethe and in beethoven
the church dualistic and ascetic from its inception waged war against
sensuality as the evil of evils as fire and water will not mix wrote
st bernard so spiritual and carnal delights cannot be experienced
together the toleration of matrimony was never more than a compromise
we require no proof that as far as the church was concerned chastity
was the only real value even luther took up that position and to this
day christianity and sexuality remain unreconciled but both the
catholic and the protestant professions of faith regarded matrimony as
the lesser evil a concession made to the enemy in order to render
existence possible it is very interesting to observe the position taken
up by the church in connection with the new womanworship which
although it sprang from the most genuine christian dualism had for its
object not god but mortal woman the logical attitude of the church
would have been one of welcome for the chaste worship of woman which
regarded matrimony as an inferior state was her natural ally two
clerics the courtchaplain andreas and the prolific rhymester matfre
ermengau actually elaborated the theory of spiritual love contrary to
the spirit of the church but both men hastened to utter a timely
recantation and recommendation of orthodoxy as the only means of
salvation after establishing all the desirable details of love
according to substance and accidents andreas deduced that every love
not dedicated to god was bound to offend him and advanced eighteen
points against the love of woman starting with the wellknown argument
that woman was naturally of a base disposition covetous envious
greedy fickle garrulous stubborn proud vain sensual deceitful
etc he who serves love cannot serve god he declared and god will
punish every man who apart from matrimony serves venus what good
could come from acting against the will of god here we are face to
face with a grotesque position the official church favouring sexuality
that is matrimony as against the newer and higher standard of ascetic
spiritual love this attitude was quite logical if not in the spirit of
religion and in contradiction to the principle of asceticism yet in the
spirit of orthodoxy for whatever was not for her was against her
the brave janusheaded abb was spokesman for the whole clergy which
branded love not projected on god as fornicatio in his recantation
andreas upheld the previouslydespised matrimonial state at the expense
of love love he maintained destroys matrimony matfre did exactly
the same thing after recapitulating in his breviari damor all the
splendid achievements rooted in the cult of woman he suddenly veered
round at the 27445th verse
     and satan blows on their desire
     in monstrous flames leaps up the fire
     and maddened by the raging fiend
     from love of god and honour weaned
     they turn from their creators shrine
     and call their mistresses divine
     with soul and body mind and sense
     they worship womans excellence
     abandoned in her beauty revel
     and unawares adore the devil
three hundred years later the fanatical savanorola stormed you clothe
and adorn the mother of god as you clothe and adorn your courtesans and
you give her the features of your mistresses which as we shall
presently see was literally true
the clergy resisted all counsels of the cortezia and cavalaria with
the sure instinct desiring the continuance of existing conditions
rather than the victory of the higher conception some writers aver that
it was partly due to this fact that later on the cult of woman developed
into the cult of mary again we are confronted by a process which in the
course of time has been repeated more than once the spiritualmystical
principle of christianity entered upon a new stage and took possession
of a new and important domain but the church rigid and unyielding
preferred clinging to a past lower stage rather than tolerating any
change had she been absolutely consistent her greatest poet would be
on the index today for following his own intuition and ignoring her
rigid dogma he introduced his beloved beatrice into the catholic
heaven
the new spiritual love was not without its caricatures famous in
provence for many strange exploits committed in order to please his
lady was the talented peire vidal on one occasion he caused himself to
be sewn into a wolfskin and ran about the fields but he was set upon by
dogs and so badly mangled that he nearly succumbed to his wounds he was
an insufferable braggart but never had any success in love the prince
of caricatures however was the german knight and minnesinger ulrich
of lichtenstein he is responsible for a novel in prose entitled the
service of woman which is faintly reminiscent of goethes werther
as a page he commenced his glorious career by drinking the water in
which his lady had washed her hands later on he caused his upper lip to
be amputated because it displeased his mistress for whatever she
dislikes in me i too hate on another occasion he cut off one of his
fingers and used it set in gold as a clasp for a volume of his poems
which he sent to her one of his most famous exploits was a journey
through nearly the whole of austria disguised as venus jousting
dressed in womens clothes with every knight he met but in spite of
his eccentricities the tendency of his mind was not at all
metaphysical he craved very obvious favours but as a rule contented
himself with a kind or even an unkind word incidentally we learn that
he was married but he devoted his whole life to deeds of heroism in
honour of his lady not the great book of cervantes as is commonly
believed held up mediaeval court life to ridicule and destroyed it as
an ideal but the life and exploits of this knight and minnesinger the
same spirit animated guilhem of balaun at the command of his lady he
had a fingernail extracted and sent to her after which he was
readmitted to her favour
spiritual love was discovered by the provenals but the greater and
profounder italian poets developed it and brought it to perfection what
had been a nave sentiment with the troubadours became in dantes
circle a system of the universe and a religion the italian poet
sordello who wrote in provenal may be regarded as the connecting
link and the forerunner of the great italians he died in the year of
grace 1270 and dante who was almost a contemporary immortalised his
name in the divine comedy the doctrine on which the dolce stil
nuovo was based pointed to the love of a noble heart as the source of
all perfection in heaven and earth purely spiritual womanworship was
regarded as an absolute virtue the words of the last of the provenal
troubadours guirot riquier love is the doctrine of all sublime
thingswas developed into a philosophy i will quote a few
characteristic verses omitting dante for the present one of the finest
lyric poems of all tongues and ages written by guido guinicelli begins
as follows
     within the gentle heart love shelters him
     as birds within the green shades of the grove
     before the gentle heart in natures scheme
     love was not or the gentle heart ere love
                         transl by dg rossetti
cino da pistoia says in epigrammatic brevity
     you want to know the inmost core of love
     tis art and guerdon of a noble heart
a wonderful canzone by guinicelli contains the following verses
     a song she seems among the rest and these
     have all their beauties in her splendour drowned
     in her is evry grace
     simplicity of wisdom noble speech
     accomplished loveliness
     all earthly beauty is her diadem
     this truth my song must teach
     my lady is of ladies chosen gem
                         transl by dg rossetti
and cavalcanti sings
     whats she whose coming rivets all mens eyes
     who makes the air so tremble with delight
     and thrills so every heart that no man might
     find tongue for words but vents his soul in sighs
                   transl by sir theodore martin
the sentiment which pervades these verses has lifted us into the higher
sphere which will henceforth be our main theme the beloved was more and
more extolled in her presence the lover became more and more convinced
of his insignificance she was worshipped deified the overwhelming
emotion the longing for metaphysical values which dominated the whole
epoch had reached its highest characteristic had reached perfection
it proved the eternal quality of human emotion the impossibility of
finding satisfaction the striving towards the infinite it soared above
its apparent object and sought its consummation in metaphysic the love
of woman and the mystical love of god were blended in a profounder
devotion love had become the sole giver of the eternal value and
consolation yearned for by mortal man christianity had taught man to
look up now his upward gaze lost its rigidity and beheld living
beautymetaphysical eroticism had been evolvedthe canonisation and
deification of woman the ideal of the troubadours to love the adored
mistress chastely and devoutly from a distance in the hope of receiving
a word of greeting no longer satisfied the lover she must become a
divine being must be enthroned above human joy and sorrow queen of the
world traditional religion was transformed so that a place might be
found in it for a woman
the reason for the recognition of spiritual love from the moment of its
inception as something supernatural and divine is obvious the heart of
man was filled with an emotion hitherto unknown an emotion which
pointed direct to heaven the soul the core of profound christian
consciousness had received a new glad content rousing a feeling of
such intensity that it could only be compared to the religious ecstasy
of the mystic man divined that it was the mother of new and great
thingswas it not fitting to regard it as divine and proclaim it the
supreme value the troubadours had known it bernart of ventadour had
sung
     i stand in my ladys sight
     in deep devotion
     approach her with folded hands
     in sweet emotion
     dumbly adoring her
     humbly imploring her
peire raimon of toulouse
     i would approach thee on my knees
     lowly and meek
     i would fare far oer lands and seas
     thy ruth to seek
     and come to theea slave to his lord
     id pay thee homage with eyes that mourn
     until thy mercy id implored
     heedless of laughter heedless of scorn
raimon of miraval had said i am no lover i am a worshipper and
cavalcanti
     my ladys virtue has my blindness riven
     a secret sighing thrills my humbled heart
     when favoured with a sight of her thou art
     thy soul will spread its wings and soar to heaven
peire vidal
     god called the women close to him
     because he saw all good in them

     and many a soul that has not bowed

     mens dazzled eyes can scarce support her splendour
folquet of romans
     when i behold her beauty rare
     im so confused and startled by her worth
     i ween i am no longer on this earth
a canzone which has been attributed to cavalcanti cino da pistoia and
dante reads as follows
     my lady comes and evry lip is silent
     so perfect is her beautys high estate
     that mortal spirit swoons and falls prostrate
     before her glory and she is so noble
     if i uplift to her my inward eye
     my soul is startled as if death were nigh
cavalcanti says
     round you are flowers is the tender green
     the sun is not as bright as your dear face
     all nature in her glorious summersheen
     has not so fair and beautiful a place
     it pales beside you earth has never seen
     a thing so full of loveliness and grace
the perfection which the mere presence of the beloved was supposed to
bestow on the lover is here conceived more broadly and freely not only
the lover but all men are touched and transfigured by her appearance
the sentiment of the lover aspired to become objective truth this was
an important stage on the road from the spiritual to the deifying love
which i have called metaphysical eroticism another rung of the ladder
of evolution had been climbedthe mistress had become queen of the
world and goddess a being enthroned by the side of god i will again
quote guinicelli
     ever as she walks she has a sober grace
     making bold men abashed and good men glad
     if she delight thee not thy heart must err
     no man dare look on her his thoughts being base
     nay let me say even more than i have said
     no man could think base thoughts who looked on her
                                      dg rossetti
the same poet in his canzone al cor gentil says
     she shines on us as god shines on his angels
when madonna dies the angels receive her rejoicing that she has joined

     sings songs of jubilee at her release
     from this dull earth i heard and am at rest

     i know she is in heaven with the blest
     midst flowrs whose glory time can never dim
     singing gods praise and blest by seraphim
     nought but the truth from my glad lips shall fall
     in heaven she is enthroned above all
folquet of romans wrote a letter to his beloved in which he said
amongst other things
        kneeling in church before gods face
        a sinner to beseech his grace
        and for my sins to make amends
        twas you to whom i raised my hands

        exultant at his sacred shrine
        oh lady all my soul is thine
     lady you have bewitched me with your beauty
     that god i have forgotten and myself
cino da pistoia wrote the following commendatory prayer
     into thy hands sweet lady of my soul
     the spirit that is dying i commend
     and which departs so sorrowful that love
     views it with pity while dismissing it
     by you to his dominion it was bound
     so firmly that it since hath had no power
     to call on him but thus oh mighty lord
     whateer thou wilt of me thy will is mine

lancelot one of the great mediaeval lovers possessed a lock of
guineveres hair which he prized above all the relics of the saints
when he parted from his mistress whom he had loved not only
spiritually he fell on his knees before the door of her chamber and
prayed as if he were kneeling before the altar
spiritual love was obviously acquiring a religious tinge the mistress
took the place of god her grace was the source of all joy and
consolation she led the souls of the dying to eternal life god had
yielded his position to her she had stepped to his side nay above
him with the curse of the church still clinging to her she had been
remoulded by mans emotion into a perfect a celestial being the god of
christianity was in dangerwould the new religion of cultured minds
the religion of woman unwilling to tolerate any other god beside her
replace the religion of the masses was a reformation imminent would
the traditional religion be transformed into metaphysical eroticism
dethroning god enthroning a goddess it is impossible to say in what
direction the spiritual history of europe would have developed if dante
had been merely a metaphysical lover and not also an orthodox
theologian if instead of penetrating to the vision of the divine
secret he had fainted before the face of beatrice
the religion of woman and the dominant religion came to terms this
compromise was possible because the christian pantheon included a female
deity who although she had not hitherto played a prominent part held
an exceptional position this was mary the mother of the redeemer from
ad 400 to ad 1200 her rank had been on a level with the rank of the
antique goddesses now the new emotion enveloped and revivified her the
rigid soulless image with the golden circle round the head slowly
melted into sweet womanhood in italy this sentiment inspired wonderful
paintings of the madonna and was responsible for the development of
portraiture in general the hold of the overwhelming tradition was
broken rejecting the universal conviction that the historical mary had
resembled the mary of byzantine art the artist under the dominion of
his womanworshipwhich surpassed and revalued all thingsdrew his
inspiration from the fulness of life i do not agree with thode that we
are indebted to the legend of st francis for the modern soulful and
highly individualised art its source must have been the strongest
feeling of the most cultured minds and that was undoubtedly spiritual
love the jesuit beissel wrote with deep regret every master almost
formed his own conception of mary but in such a way that the hieratic
severity of earlier times disappeared but slowly and he continued it
is true the artists models were the noble ladies of their period not
only on account of their kindly smiling faces but also on account of
the charming coquetry with which their hands drew their cloaks across
the bosom and the arthistorian male says it is a remarkable fact
that in the thirteenth century the legend or the story of the virgin
mary was depicted on the doors of all our ie french cathedrals
the difference between the catholic and the protestant worldprinciples
is strongly marked in this connection catholicism with its striving for
absolute uniformity acknowledging no individual differences but eager
to shape all life and all doctrines in harmony with one definite ideal
very consistently pronounced one single historical woman to be divine
and made her the object of universal worship this dogma had to be
rigid immutable and almost meaningless again the historic and pagan
principle of catholicism was maintained a unique event in the history
of the world was immortalised and systematised and all new religious
conceptions were excluded catholicism invariably places all really
important events in the past even in a quite definite period of the
past a period unassailable by historical criticism but with the
commencement of individual intellectual life the uniform ecclesiastical
image of the madonna gradually gained life and individuality just as
according to protestant teaching every soul must establish its
individual relationship with god which is subject to change because
individuality is not excluded as it is in catholicism so the
imaginative emotionalist created his own queen of heaven frequently he
was still under the impressionthis was especially the case with
monksthat he was worshipping the ecclesiastical deity when he had
long been praying to a metaphysical conception of his own the great
italian art since the fourteenth century as well as the neolatin and
german cults of the virgin mary were though apparently still orthodox
in their innermost essence the outcome of a personal desire for love
and had therefore abandoned the teaching of the church and become
protestant the fact that the socalled protestant church looked askance
at mary and that the rather coarseminded luther said in his
annoyance popery has made a goddess of mary and is therefore guilty
of idolatry does not contradict my statement the true queen of heaven
was a conception of the artist and lover incomprehensible to those who
were only thinkers and moralists
through the legitimation of a divine woman open enmity between the
religion of woman and the religion of the church was avoided a woman
had stepped between god and humanity as mediator intercessor and
redeemer every metaphysicallyloving soul could conceive her as it
pleased could love her and pray to her without being a heretic and
worshipper of the devil matfre had complained that men
     abandoned in her beauty revel
     and unawares adore the devil
but now a means had been found to adore the beloved and yet remain
faithful to god once in a way it was remembered that the adored
strictly speaking was the mother of godif for no other reason for
fear of the inquisition which the dominicans had founded and placed
under the special patronage of maryher bodyguard as it were defending
her from the onslaught of minds all too worldly very rarely the adored
earthly woman was identified with the official queen of heaventhis
may have been done occasionally by monks sometimes as in the case of
michelangelo and guinicelli the beloved was the sole goddess other
poets among whom we may include dante and goethe conceived her as
enthroned by the side of mary
at this point i must interrupt my argument and briefly sketch the
position occupied by mary in the western world from the dawn of
christianity
b the queen of heaven
during the first two hundred years mary did not occupy a prominent place
in the christian communities even in the fourth century she was still
regarded as a human woman and denied divinity by st chrysostom who
reproached her with vainglory but in proportion as christ transcended
humanity and was more dogmatically and formally interpreted by the
churchmore especially the greek churchthe desire for a mediator
between the wrathful deity and sinful humanity grew more pronounced a
mediator who although a human being could be endowed after the manner
of the ancient demigods with superhuman virtues the mother of the
saviour gradually assumed this position she had been an earthly woman
born of earthly parents and would be able to understand human needs and
wishes and she had become the mother of god would not her intercession
have weight with the son of god simultaneously with the growing
recognition of asceticism the doctrine of the immaculate conception
gained ground in the course of time this moment was more and more
emphasised and virginity was set up as an ideal
st athanasius fourth century had written what god did to mary is
the glory of all virgins for they are attached as virginal saplings to
her who is the root at the close of the fourth century a long and
bitter controversy arose over the question as to whether mary had
remained a virgin after the birth of jesus st ambrose st jerome and
st augustine were in favour of this new doctrine st ambrose the
founder of western music was the first to praise her perfection in the
latin tongue and st augustine in his treatise de natura et gratia
maintained that she was the only human being born without original sin
this was the first important step towards the stripping of the saviours
mother of her humanity and establishing her as a divine being st
irenaeus contrasted eve the bringer of sin with mary the second eve
the bringer of salvation and st ambrose said from eve we inherited
damnation through the fruit of the tree but mary has brought us
salvation through the gift of the tree for christ too hung on the tree
like a fruit
hitherto mary had not been worshipped all prayers had been addressed to
god and to christ the idea of approaching her in prayer appeared for
the first time in a pamphlet entitled on the death of mary written
about the end of the fourth century and gregory of nazianz pictured
mary in heaven caring for the welfare of humanity the fourth and fifth
centuries produced the first hymns to the virgin written in syriac but
orthodox bishops objected to her deification st epiphanus end of
fourth century said let us honour mary by all means but let us
worship only the father the son and the holy ghost
this was the position of the evangelical and historical mary before the
famous and decisive council of ephesus
there is a very important fact which must not be overlooked all the
nations dwelling on the shores of the mediterranean semites and
egyptians as well as greeks and romans had been accustomed to the
worship of female deities in the minds of the ancient peoples woman
the symbol of sex had always been endowed with qualities of magic and
mystery there was something supernatural in her power of bringing forth
a living specimen of the race and in all cults the maternal woman
occupied a very important position had christianity suddenly destroyed
this ancient and natural need we know that the church had assimilated a
great number of antique superstitions nor were the female deities
sacrificed the great asiatic mothers had not been forgotten the very
ancient babylonian istar astarte rhea kybele of asia minor and above
all the egyptian isis still lived in the heart of mansubconsciously
probablyas lofty sacred memories but nevertheless influencing his
life the egyptian isis with horus in her lap is the direct model of the
madonna with the child she represented earth bringing forth fruit
without fertilisation this religious custom the worship of isis
says flinders petrie exerted a powerful influence on nascent
christianity it is not too much to say that without the egyptians we
should have had no madonna in our creed the cult of isis was widely
spread at the time of the first emperors when it was fashionable all
over the roman empire when later on it merged into that other great
religious movement and fashion and conviction could be combined its
triumph was assured
advancing christianity had depopulated the national pantheon there must
have been a great sense of loss especially among the lower classes and
it does not require much psychological insight to realise that it was
the lack of female deities which more especially roused a feeling of
anxiety and distress the masses were yearning for a goddess and it was
at ephesus the classical seat of the hundredbreasted diana that the
stolen divinity was restored to them the theologians were divided into
three camps while some of them regarded mary merely as the mother of
man others acknowledged her as the mother of god and nestorius
suggested as a compromise the title mother of christ at the synod of
alexandria in the year of grace 430 and at the council of ephesus in
431 nestorius was found guilty of blasphemy and deprived of his
bishopric henceforth mary was greek theotochos the mother of god
and her worship was sanctioned by the church through thee the holy
trinity has been glorified exclaimed cyril joyfully through thee the
cross of the saviour has been raised through thee the angels triumphed
the devils were driven back the tempter was beaten and human nature
uplifted to heaven through thee all intelligent creatures who were
committing idolatry have learned the truth loud rejoicing filled the
streets of ephesus when the judgment passed on nestorius was announced
the people exclaimed the enemy of the holy virgin has been overcome
glory be to the great the divine mother of god the highest authority
in the land had reestablished the public worship of the great goddess
who had for many years been worshipped in secrecy the ancient paganism
had triumphed over the spiritual intuition of the loftier minds
according to ancient custom sacrifices were offered at marys shrine
the second epoch of her history had begun
in the east the worship of female divinities was older and more
spontaneous than in the western world and thus the cult of mary existed
in the orient long before it penetrated to italy and thence into the
newly christianised countries the virgin who for the first few hundred
years had held a clearly defined position in evangelical history had
become an independent object of worship festivals were held in her
honour churches were dedicated to her the will of the people triumphed
in the litany art took possession of the grateful subject the
tendency to make mary the equal of christ grew steadily metaphors
originally intended for christ alone were used indifferently for either
we constantly find her addressed as the archetype the light of the
world the vine the mediator the source of eternal life etc finally
she ceased being regarded as a passive participator in the work of
salvation as the mother of the saviour and was accredited with
independent saving power john of damascus eighth century first called
mary greek steira tou chosmou and soon after she was styled
saviour of the world in the occident also with this the cult of mary
had reached its third stage the stage which interests us she had
become the object of metaphysical love but before dealing with this
third stage we must glance in passing at the ancient teutonic tribes
they too worshipped goddesses and sacred women virginity a virtue
not appreciated by the orientals here stood in high repute according
to tacitus and others the teutons looked upon the virgin as a
mysterious being approaching divinity more closely than all others
thus there was here perhaps more than on the shores of the
mediterranean a favourable soil for the cult of mary the
characteristics of holda and freya as well as their perfect beauty
were transferred to mary and marys name was substituted for the names
of the old auxiliary goddesses in the oldest german evangelical poems
mary does not yet rank as a divinity she is merely extolled as the most
perfect of all earthborn women in the heliand about ad 830 she
is called the most beautiful of all women the loveliest of all
maidens and the monk otfried of weissenburg 860 calls her of all
women to god the most pleasing the white jewel the radiant maid
mary had now taken her place by the side of god and was commonly
addressed as divine anselm of canterbury explains god is the father
of all created things mary the mother of all things recreated god
begat the creator of the world mary gave birth to its saviour peter
of blois declared that the virgin was the only mediatress between christ
and humanity we were sinners and afraid of the wrath of the father
for he is terrible but we have the virgin in whom there is nothing
terrible for in her is the fulness of mercy and purity the twelfth
century produced the ave maria the angelic salutation the principal
prayer to mary which was introduced into all churches the italian
franciscan monk bonaventura and peter damiani were above all others
instrumental in spreading the worship of the virgin and damiani said of
her to thee has been given all power in heaven and on earth the
fresco of the camposanto at pisa ascribed to orcagna shows the
transfigured virgin sitting by the side of christ not below him the
numerous legends in which mary often regardless of justice and
propriety delivers her faithful worshippers from all manner of dangers
were written during the same period one of the most famous of these is
the legend of theophilus the forerunner of faust in a german version
by brun of schnebeck dating from the thirteenth century theophilus
abjures god and all things divine with the sole exception of mary
wherefore she saves him from eternal damnation this poem therefore
shows us mary as absolutely opposed to god
we have now arrived at the third stage of the cult of mary the new
spiritual love translated into metaphysics was projected on her she
was approached by her worshippers with the ardent love which hitherto
had been the prerogative of earthly women the two currents the one
arising in ecclesiastical tradition and the other in the soul of the
metaphysical lover had met the genuine spiritual cult of mary was the
creation of the great metaphysical lovers who existed not only in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries but are met not infrequently later
on mans irresistible need to raise woman above him and worship her
created the true madonna for whose sake romantic souls of all times
have returned home into the fold of the church the true madonna who
at heart is alien to the principles of the church but is reborn daily
in the soul of the metaphysical lover the hierarchy knew how to take
advantage of and control this adoring love the metaphysical lover
raised his mistress above humanity and prayed before her shrine
religion said the celestial woman whom you may lovingly adore is here
with me all you have to do is to call her by the name i have given her
and the kingdom of heaven will be yours
but on the other hand mary represents today and doubtless will do for
a long time to come a dogmatically acknowledged deity recognised by
the spirit of protestantism as a remnant of paganism and duly detested
the masses in italy and spain pray today to her image as in bygone
days the masses prayed to the images in greek and roman temples this
goddess is unchanging and from the point of view of the psychologist
uninteresting
it is not difficult to understand why the two conceptions of mary more
especially in the souls of the monks were so often inextricably
intermingled circumstances frequently demanded a complete fusion as
late as in the nineteenth century a romantic poet zacharias werner
said
     oh sovreign lady mistress of my fortune
     and thou the queen and ruler of the heavens
     i cannot keep you sundered and apart
i shall endeavour to keep them sundered and apart as far as possible
for i am only concerned with mans metaphysical emotion of love and its
creation womanhood deified and not with catholic dogmas with this
object in view i will return to the poets previously quoted and
continue the unfolding of the process of deification as a rule the
metaphysical lovers were content with immortalising their feelings in
very often excellent verses raising the beloved mistress above the
earth and worshipping her as the culmination of beauty and perfection
the quite unusual craving to give her a place in the eternal structure
of the cosmos animated only one poet dante who combining the catholic
striving for unity with spontaneous magnificent womanworship created
a masterpiece which is unique in literature
typical among the later provenals was guirot riquier several of his
poems which have been preserved to us make it impossible to say whether
they are addressed to an earthly woman or to the queen of heaven these
poems mark in a sense a period of transition they are exceedingly
vague and it is not worth while to translate them but as they are
dated it is interesting to watch the poets love growing more and more
spiritual and religious to see him gradually deserting his earthly love
for the lady of heaven in one poem he prays to his lady who is
worshipped by all true lovers to teach him the right way of loving in
the next he repents his all too earthly passion
     i often thought i was of true love singing
     and knew not that to love my heart was blind
     and folly was as love itself enshrined
     but now such love in all my soul is ringing
     that though to love and praise her i aspire
     as is her meedin vain is my desire
     henceforth her love alone shall be my guide
     and my new hope in that great love abide
     for her great love the uttermost shall proffer
     of honour wealth and earthly joy and bliss
     with her to love my heart will never miss
     those who no gifts like her gifts have to offer
     she the fulfilment is of my desire
     therefore i vow myself her true esquire
     shell love me in returnmy splendid meed
     if i but love aright in word and deed
and one of his rather more religious songs ends as follows
     without true love there is on earth no peace
     love gives us wisdom faith which will not swerve
     a noble mind and willingness to serve
     how rare a thing on earth in perfect ease
     to thee oh virgin mother of all love
     i dedicate this song if thou deniest
     me not thou shall be my sweet bliss with christ
     i pray thee intercede for me above
in this song then he calls mary his sweet bliss bel deport a
name which he had previously given to a certain countess with whom he
had been in love in the next poem in which earthly love and love of
the madonna are again brought into juxtaposition he commends himself
to the virgin the sublime mother of love on whom all my happiness
depends one of his poems which begins in quite an earthly strain ends
thus
     i feel no jealousy for he whose soul
     is filled with yearning for his heavenly love
     has purest happiness he is her serf
     and he has all things that his heart can crave
but long before this in one of his very worldly poems there is a sudden
outburst addressed to the madonna he who does not serve the mother of
god knows not the meaning of love excellent proof of this intimate
connection between earthly and madonna love is found in the poems of the
trouvere ruteboeuf who calls mary his very sweet lady
lanfranc cigala wrote genuine lovesongs to the virgin the following
are two stanzas from one of his poems
     i worship a celestial maid
     serene and wondrously adorned
     and all she does is well arrayed
     in noble love and gentleness
     her smile is bliss to all who mourn
     her tender love is happiness
     and for her kiss the world i scorn
     lady of heaven thy heart incline
     to me and untold bliss is mine
     by day and night my only thought
     art mary thou i am distraught
     say many men for few can gauge
     the ardour which consumes my soul
     i care not that they say bereft
     i am of sense the world ive left
     to worship thee loves spring and goal
but other poems written by cigala are unmistakably addressed to the
celestial madonna some of them seem to be written in a penitential
mood he almost seems to repent of his former passionate adoration the
same poet in his lovesongs uses all the metaphors which are commonly
used for mary or for christ root and climax flower fruit and seed
of all goodness
a little older is an erotic hymn to mary by peire guillem of luserna i
quote a few stanzas
     thy praise is happiness unmarred
     for he who praises thee proclaims the truth
     thou art the flower of beauty love and ruth
     full of compassion with all grace bedight
     from thy white hands we gather all delight
the love of mary had usurped the peculiar property of the love of woman
it had become the source of poetic and artistic inspiration
the songs of aimeric of peguilhan resemble those of cigala the former
bewails the decline of the service of woman he sings of the root and
crown of all noble things but it is not quite clear whether he is
addressing an earthly or a heavenly lady suffer my love which asks
for no reward the terms friends and lovers amans of the
virgin are with these poets convertible terms and the virgin is styled
the true friend ie the beloved
guilhem of autpol wrote a fine poem to the queen of heaven beginning
     thou hope of all sad hearts who yearn for love
     thou stream of loveliness thou well of grace
     thou dove of peace in fret and restlessness
     thou ray of light to those who lightless grope
     thou house of god thou garden of sweet shades
     rest without ceasing refuge of the sad
     bliss without mourning flowr that never fades
     alien to death and shelter in the mad
     whirlpool of life to all who seek thy port
     lady of heaven in whom all hearts rejoice
     thou roseate dawn and light of paradise
perdigon among many worldly songs wrote one to the regina dauteza e
de senhoria which might be translated thus
     supreme ruler of the world
     thy grace sustains
     and maintains
     the world
     thou fragrant rose thou fruitful vine
     thou wert the chosen vessel of
     mercy divine
unsurpassed in the fusion of his earthly and his celestial lady was
folquet de lunel some of his poems cannot be classed with any
certainty
the first poem which obtained a prize at the academy of mastersingers of
toulouse was a hymn to mary
this very genuine sentimentalism appears strange to us we cannot enter
into the feelings of that period a modern philologist karl appel
regards jaufre rudels pathetic songs addressed by him to the countess
of tripoli
     oh love in lands so far away
     my heart is yearning yearning
as songs to the madonna but it is a matter of indifference to the lover
whether his hearts impulse translated into metaphysic is projected on
an unknown countess of tripoli or a still more unknown lady of heaven
it is not the loved woman who is of importancewhat do we know of the
ladies who inspired the exquisite mediaeval poetry they have long been
dust and we may be sure that their perfection was no greater than is
the perfection of their granddaughters but the love of the poets is
alive today an eternal document of the human heart representing one
of the great phases through which the relationship between man and woman
has passed
the following are a few stanzas by the german minnesinger steinmar
which were later on adapted to the holy virgin
     in summertime how glad am i
     when over lea or down
     a country lass mine eyes espy
     of maidens all the crown
     oh paradise how glad am i
     when oer the heavenly down
     god and gods mother i espy
     of women all the crown
the italian poets far more profound than the provenals saw a goddess
in the beloved whom they always addressed as madonna and humbled
themselves before her social differences which played such a prominent
part in the north are here ignored the impecunious poet no longer
extols the princess the wife of his lord and master there is no
question of such a relationship the poet is a free citizen of the town
subject only to the emotion of the heart and his song carries its own
reward it has ceased to be the married womans privilege to be lauded
and extolled the maiden of unaristocratic origin who to the poets
represents more strongly the ideas of purity and perfection has usurped
her place we know that lapo gianni dino frescobaldi guinicelli and
dante worshipped a maiden untouched by as much as a sensuous thought
and frescobaldi decided the question whether it were better to love a
married woman or a maiden in favour of the latter the feeling of those
lovers was pure and lofty and they had the power of giving it perfect
expression
in a canzone the authorship of which is ascribed to both cavalcanti and
cino da pistoia it is said of the beloved dead that god needed her
presence to perfect heaven and that all the saints now worship her
she was a miracle of perfection while she was yet on earth but now
     look thou into the pleasure wherein dwells
     thy lovely lady who is in heaven crowned
     who is herself thy hope in heaven the while
     to make thy memry hallowed she prevails
     of thee she entertains the blessed throngs
     and says to them while yet my body thrave
     on earth i gat much honour which he gave
     commending me in his commended songs
                         transl by dg rossetti
at the conclusion of his finest poem al cor gentil guinicelli next
to dante doubtless the greatest poet of the middle ages says god will
ask me after my death how couldst thou have loved aught but me and
i will reply she came from thy realm and bore the semblance of an
angel therefore in loving her i was not unfaithful to thee here we
have the perfection of metaphysical eroticism the beloved woman is god
he who loves her loves god in her
cavalcanti maintained in a poem that an image of the madonna actually
bore the features of his lady
     guido an image of my lady dwells
     at san michele in orto consecrate
     and daily worshipped fair in holy state
     she listens to the tale each sinner tells
     and among them who come to her who ails
     the most on him the most does blessing fall
     she bids the fiend mens bodies abdicate
     over the curse of blindness she prevails
     and heals sick languors in the public squares
                         transl by dg rossetti
and guido orlandi replies to him from the ecclesiastical standpoint as
to a lost man hadst thou been speaking of mary thou wouldst have
spoken the truth but now i must bewail thy errors
a complete blending of sensuality and maryworship was achieved in an
italian poem of the fifteenth century the author of this poem addressed
mary as queen of my heart and blossom of loveliness and goes on to
say i can tell by your gestures and your face that you respond to my
love when you look at me you smile and when you sigh your eyes are
full of tenderness sometimes in the evening i stand below your
balcony you hear my sighs but you make no reply when i gaze at
your beauty i burn with love but when i think of your cruelty i call
on death to release me in this poem we have a caricature of
metaphysical eroticism
in the sonnets of petrarch metaphysical love has become stereotyped
adoration has become a phrase as cupid has become a phrase with the
earlier poets it is obvious that he loves laura because the play on
the word laura and lauro laurel caught his fancy i can find no
spontaneous feeling in the famous canzoniero all i see is erudition and
perfection of form but among the few sincere specimens there is one
beautiful poem addressed to mary vergine bella che di sol vestida
which is not without erotic warmth but the singer and humanist
expresses himself judiciously
     oh thou the queen of heaven and our goddess
     if it be fitting such a phrase to use
so far we have observed the current which emanating from the beloved
woman lifted her into supernal regions and endowed her with
perfectionthe mistress is stripped of everything earthly the longing
which can never be stilled on earth soars heavenward now we will
examine the opposite current the current which emanates from the
madonna of dogma the lady of heaven who is the same to all men in her
last stage that is to say when she is finally enthroned by the side of
god many a monkearthly love being denied to himwas driven to a
purely spiritual metaphysical love by the fact of his being permitted
to love the lady of heaven without hesitation or remorse she was the
fairest of women and he was at liberty to interpret the meaning of the
fairest in any sense he chose
the climax of the emotional worship of the ecclesiastical mary was
reached by st bernard the doctor marianus mentioned on a previous
occasion he was the author of sermons and homilies in honour of mary
and has been instrumental in dogmatising her worship by placing her side
by side with the saviour it was more fitting that both sexes should
take part in the renewal of mankind he says because both were
instrumental in bringing about the fall man who fell through
woman can be raised only by her humanity kneels at thy feet for the
comfort of the wretched the release of the prisoners the delivery of
the condemned the salvation of the countless sons of adam depend on a
word from thy lips oh virgin hasten to reply speak the word for
which the earth the nethermost hell and the heavens even are waiting
yea the king and ruler of the universe greatly as he desires thy
loveliness awaits thy consent in which he has laid the salvation of
the world basing his description on the revelation of st john the
divine he draws her picture as follows brilliant and white and
dazzling are the garments of the virgin she is so full of light and
radiance that there is not the least darkness about her and no part of
her may be described as less brilliant or not glowing with intense
light and with increasingly pronounced erotic emphasis passing from
the church dogma of salvation to passionate fervour he goes on to say
a garden of sacred delight art thou oh mary in it we gather flowers
of manifold joys as often as we reflect on the fulness of sweetness
which through thee was poured out on the world right lovely art
thou oh perfect one a bed of heavenly spices and precious flowers of
all virtues filling the house of the lord with sweet perfume oh mary
thou violet of humility thou lily of chastity thou rose of love etc
st bernard inaugurated that extraordinary blending of eroticism with
halfcrazy inconceivable allegories and fantasies which lasted for
centuries here again we perceive the ideal of metaphysical eroticism
which in the case of a loyal son of the church could only refer to the
official queen of heaven and consisted partly of the genuine emotion of
love partly of allegorically constructed connections with the church
dogma
st bernards emotional outbursts were comprehended and admired his
authority was sufficient to override all scruples that might have stood
in the way of this downright description of marys charms he became the
model for all her later worshippers suso for instance often quotes
him and brother hans called him the harpist and fiddler of her
praise
the great ecstatic poet jacopone da todi sang marys praise as
follows
     hail purest of virgins
     mother and maid
     gentle as moonlight
     lady of aid
     i greet thee lifes fountain
     fruitladen vine
     infinite mercy
     thou sheddest on thine
     hopes fairest sunshine
     balms well serene
     i claim a dance with thee
     all the worlds queen
     gate of beatitude
     all sins forgiven
     lead us to paradise
     sweet breeze of heaven
     thou pointest us upward
     where angels adore
     white lily of gentleness
     thy grace i implore
     mirror of cherubim
     seraphim laud thy grace
     all things in heaven and earth
     ring with thy praise
the spiritual love of mary especially appealed to the german temper
among the adoring monks suso deserves particular mention he laid great
stress on the difference between high love and low love low love
begins with rapture and ends with pain but high love begins with grief
and is transformed into ecstasy until finally the lovers are united in
eternity he was keenly conscious of the older motive of the cult of
mary namely the need of a gentle mediator between man and the
inaccessible deity oh thou gods chosen delight thou dulcet golden
song of the eternal wisdom suffer me a poor sinner to tell thee a
little of my sufferings my soul prostrates itself before thee with
timorous eyes shamefaced oh thou mother of all mercies i ween that
neither my soul nor the soul of any other poor sinner needs a mediator
or permission to come to thy throne for thou thyself art the
intercessor for all sinners compared to his forerunner st bernard
suso exhibits a marked degree of intimacy in his relationship with mary
he describes heaven as a kind of flowered meadow and mary keeping
court like any earthly princess now go and behold the sweet queen of
heaven whom you love so profoundly leading the procession of the
celestial throng in great gladness and stateliness inclining to her
lover with roses and lilies behold her wonderful beauty shedding light
and joy on the heavenly hosts eya look up to her who giveth gladness
to heart and mind behold the mother of mercy resting her eyes her
tender pitiful eyes on you and all sinners powerfully protecting her
beloved child the whole sixteenth chapter of the booklet of eternal
wisdom is an ardent hymn to the madonna almost comparable to st
bernards prayer to mary in dantes divine comedy it was written
about the time of dantes death not very long therefore after the
composition of the last chapters of the paradise
the life of suso the first german biography ever written evidences
his adoration for the lady of heaven it was customary in his country
swabia for the young men to go to their sweethearts houses on new
years eve singing songs until they received from the maidens a chaplet
in return this custom so pleased his young and ardent heart that he
too went on the eve of the new year to his eternal love to beg her for
a gift before daybreak he repaired to the statue which represented the
virginal mother pressing her tender child the beautiful eternal wisdom
to her bosom and kneeling down before her with a sweet low singing of
his soul he chanted a sequence to her imploring her to let him win a
chaplet from her child he then said to the eternal wisdom and it
is uncertain whether he is addressing the mother or the child thou
art my love my glad easter day the summerjoy of my heart my sweet
hour thou art the love which my young heart alone worships and for the
sake of which it has scorned earthly love give me a guerdon then my
hearts delight and let me not go away from thee emptyhanded
with a sweet low singing of his soul this worshipper approached the
statue of the queen of heaven this is love of woman undisguised it
merely has a religious undertone other secular merrymakings were
adapted by suso to his celestial mistress as for instance the
planting of the maytree and he repeatedly makes use of similes and
metaphors borrowed from the chivalrous service of woman he frequently
alludes to himself as the servant of the eternal wisdom the meaning
of this expression is apparently intentionally obscured but it has a
savour of the feminine suso pictured himself after the manner of
lovers with a chaplet of roses on his brow in his life there is a
passage unsurpassed by the best of the minnesingers in the golden
summertime when all the tender little flowers had opened their buds he
gathered none until he had dedicated the first blossoms to his spiritual
love the gentle flowerlike rosy maiden and mother of god when it
seemed to him that the time had come he culled the flowers with many
loving thoughts carried them into his cell and wove them into a
garland and after he had done so he went into the choir or into our
ladys chapel prostrated himself before his dear lady and placed the
sweet garland on her head hoping that she would not scorn her servants
offering as she was the most wondrous flower herself and the
summerjoy of his heart
doubtless we here have an analogy to the religious feeling of the
mystics the metaphysical lover is still under the impression that he is
worshipping the mary of the catholic church but as in the case of the
mystic the christ of dogma is transformed into the divine spark in his
own soul so the love of mary has become undogmatic and pure
womanworship the ideal of the great lovers of that age
another prominent madonnaworshipper was conrad of wrzburg died 1278
he began his career as a minnesinger but later on entered a monastery
he was the author of a very extensive and in part poetical collection
of songs in praise of the queen of heaven the golden smithy is an
interesting instance of the mingling of genuine metaphysical eroticism
and traditional church doctrines conrad inextricably mingles all the
biblical allegories more or less applicable to mary the stories of the
gospels the doctrine of the immaculate conception etc with his own
emotions and thus creates a world of feeling which though in many
respects exaggerated still represents in its quaint unity something
entirely novel and unique
     thy glorious form
     though by beauty all envested
     never passion has suggested
     nor has lit unholy fire
     in mans heart that gross desire
     from thy purity should spring
he too describes the celestial paradise as a lovely garden in which
mary walks as queen and he says of her celestial maidens perhaps a
reminiscence of the mythological german swanmaidens
     thy white hand with blossoms
     their chaplets enhances
     thou showst them the dances
     of gods paradise
     mid radiant skies
     thou gatherst heavenly roses
the italian franciscan monk giacomo of verona also wrote poems to the
queen of the heavenly meadows on the right hand of christ sits mary
more lovely than the flowers in the meadows and the halfopened
rosebuds before her face stand the heavenly hosts singing jubilant
songs in her praise but she adorns her knights with garlands and gives
them roses just as pons of capduelh describes the transfiguration of
his earthly mistress jacopone describes marys ascent into heaven
where she is received by the angels singing songs of jubilee their
sanctus sanctus sanctus replaced by a joyful sancta sancta
sanctaa goddess has been received in the place of god
gottfried of strassburg the author of the sensuous and passionate epic
poem tristan and isolde composed a long poem in honour of mary
couched in the wellknown terms of the loving worshipper
     thou vale of rosesvioletdell
     thou joy that makest hearts to swell
     eternal well
     of valour queen of heaven
     thou rosy dawn thou morningred
     thou steadfast friend when hope has fled
     the living bread
     oh lady hast thou given
     thou sheen of flowrs with love alight
     thou bridal crown all maids delight
     thou art bedight
     with heavens golden splendour
     thou of all sweetness sweetest shine
     thou sweeter than the sweetest wine
     the sweetness thine
     is my salvation ever
     thou art a potion sweet of love
     sweetly pervading heaven above
     to sailors rough
     sang syrens sweeter never
     thou enterest through eye and ear
     senses and soul pervading
     thou givest to the heart great cheer
     a guerdon dear
     a glory never fading
the poet who wrote of isoldes love potion here calls the queen of
heaven a potion sweet of love a strange metaphor to use in connection
with the mary of dogma another characteristic frequently alluded to is
her sweet perfume an attribute which we today do not look upon as
exclusively celestial
quaintly delicate and tender are the lovesongs of brother hans an
otherwise unknown monk of the fourteenth century he himself tells us
that he deserted his earthly mistress for the queen of heaven perhaps
the dualism between earthly and transcendent love has never been
expressed more clearly than by him for in his case the worshipping love
did not gradually lead up to mary the essence of womanhood but an
earthly love had to be killed so that the pure heavenly love could live
     mary gentle mistress mine
     i humbly kneel before you
     all my heart and soul are thine
and
     oh mary secret fountain
     closed garden of delight
     the prince of heaven mirrors
     him in thy beauty bright
but after describing all the joys of heaven brother hans comes to the
conclusion that a man knows about as much of celestial matters as an ox
knows of discant singing
his relationship to mary is tender intimate and familiar
     within my heart concealed
     there is a secret cell
     at nightfall and at daybreak
     my lady there does dwell
     the mistress of the house is she
     i feel her love and care about
     if she denies herself to me
     methinks the mistress has gone out
in another poem he prays to mary to allow him to tear off a small piece
of her robe so that he may keep himself warm with it in the winter
like cino da pistoia who commended his dying soul not to god but to his
loved one brother hans commends himself to mary
     thus i commend my soul into thy hands
     when it must journey to those unknown lands
     where roads and paths are new and strange to it
and
     oh come to me thou bride of god
     when my faint soul departs from me
there remains one more motif to consider a motif which in a way
completes the picture of the celestial lady as men love and desire the
women of the earth so god loves the lady of heaven st bernard first
expressed this nave idea which makes god the father resemble a little
the ancient jupiter she attracted the eyes of the heavenly hosts even
the heart of the king went out to her he himself the supreme king
and ruler so much desires thy beauty that he is awaiting thy consent
upon which he has decided to save the world and him whom thou
delightest in thy silence thou wilt delight even more by thy speech
for he called to thee from heaven oh fairest among women let me hear
thy voice etc here we have st bernard the rock of orthodoxy
representing god as marys languishing admirer suso is irreproachable
in this respect but conrad says that the colour of marys face was so
bright and made it so lovely
     that even the eternal sire
     was filled with sacred fire
     and all the heavenly princes
thus at the turn of the fourteenth century the great celestial change
was complete by the side of god nay even in the place of god a woman
was enthroned the virgin became the god of the universe says
michelet a thorough though rather imaginative expert on the middle
ages the people primitively worshipped idols the clergy headed by the
dominican and franciscan monks introduced lady days into the calendar
and invented the rosary to facilitate the recital of the aves secular
orders of knighthood placed themselves under the virgins protection la
chevalerie de sainte marie but the rarest minds sublimating the
beloved raised her into heaven and worshipped her as divine the
established religion was compelled to enter into partnership with the
great emotion of the time metaphysical love lest it ran the risk of
losing its sway over humanity
and a feeling was born then which to this day constitutes one of the
striking differences between the eastern and the western worlds the
respect for womanhood it is based on the womanworship of secular and
the madonnaworship of ecclesiastical circles it is true that jesus
anticipating the intuition of europe had taught the divinity of the
human soul and recognised womanin this respectas on an equality with
man but the instincts of greece and the eastern nations had proved to
be stronger than his teaching for twelve hundred years woman was
despised and more than once the question as to whether or no she had a
soulin other words as to whether or no she was a human beinghad
come under discussion the crude and primitively dualistic minds of the
period realised in her sex merely an embodiment of their own sensuality
the enemy against whom they fought and to whom they knew themselves
subject the strongest argument in her favour which the first millenary
could adduce was the fact that the saviour of the world had been borne
by a woman and that consequently her sex had a share in the work of
salvation the idea that through the other eve a part of the sin of
the first eve was expiated but genuine appreciation and respect were
only possible after base sensuality had been contrasted with spiritual
love whose vehicle again was woman now the eternalfeminine
contrasted with the earthlyfemininedrew the lovers upwards and
this new emotion threw such a glamour over the whole sex that it never
entirely died away if today women are respected and their efforts at
emancipation supported they are not indebted as they are sometimes
told to christian ethics but rather to the mundane culture which had
its origin at the courts of the provenal lords whose ideals ultimately
became the controlling ideals of europe and whose inmost essence still
influences the world
the evolution of love had obviously arrived at a stage when respect was
considered due to womenthough not perhaps to all women i will not go
to the courts of the great for evidence but merely relate an episode
from the life of the dominican friar suso in crossing a field suso
met on a narrow path a poor respectable woman when he was close to
her he stepped off the dry path and stood in the mud waiting for her
to pass the woman who knew him was astonished how is it sir she
said that you a venerable priest are humbly standing aside to allow
me a poor woman to pass when it were far more meet that i should
stand aside and make room for you why my good woman replied suso
i like to honour all women for the sake of the gentle mother of god in
heaven
it may seem extraordinary but this absolutely unphilosophical and
really paradoxical emotion found an appreciator in the german
philosopher ludwig feuerbach the enemy of christianity in his essence
of christianity as well as in his treatise on the cult of mary he
refers to it more than once the holy virgin he says the mother of
god is the only divine and positive that is to say the only lovable
and poetical figure of christian mythology and the only one worthy of
worship for mary is the goddess of beauty the goddess of love the
goddess of humanity the goddess of nature the goddess of freedom from
dogma feuerbach is right the lady of heaven stands for the delivery
from dogma because she had her origin in spontaneous emotion clothed
with but a few rags of dogma the monks vowed the vow of chastity he
continues in his great work they suppressed the sexual impulse but in
exchange they had the personification of womanhood of love in the
virgin in heaven the more their ideal fictitious representative of her
sex became an object of spontaneous love the more easily could they
dispense with the women of flesh and blood the more they emphasised in
their lives the complete suppression of sexuality the more prominent
became the part which the virgin played in their emotions she usurped
in many cases the place of christ and even the place of god
feuerbach then explains the need of man to project his noblest
sentiments on heaven and lays much stress on the necessity of believing
in the mother of god because the love of a child for its mother is the
first strong feeling of man where the faith in the mother of god
declines the faith in the son of god and in god the father declines
also
i will now leave the region of the historical and examine the emotion
whose reality and influence i have substantiated from a timeless
standpoint for my principal point is the psychical and more
particularly the metaphysical consummation of the emotion of love the
sole object of the abundant evidence i have been compelled to adduce is
my desire to prove the existence and significance of all the emotions
which stir the soul and in the later middle ages strove so powerfully
to express themselves my thesis that sexuality and love are opposed
principles will no doubt be rejected for under the strong influence of
the theory of evolution all the world is today agreed that love is
nothing but the refinement of the sexual impulse i maintain that as
far as man is concerned they differ very essentially and i have
attempted to prove their incommensurability by submitting historical
facts that they may and will ultimately merge is my unalterable
conviction my assertion that something so fundamental as the personal
love of man and woman did not exist from the beginning but came into
existence in the course of history at a not very remote period may
seem even more strange my only reply is that instead of advancing
opinions i have brought forward facts and allowed them to speak for
themselves moreover to my mind the realisation of the intimate
connection of love and evolving personality is a far more magnificent
proof of the soundness of the evolutionary theory than the reflection
that we have received all things readymade from the hands of nature
has it not been proved to us that the religious consciousness of the
divinity of the human soul was also evolved in historical time and has
never again disappeared
every strong love which finds no response is fraught with the
possibility of an infinite unfolding it may powerfully seize the whole
soul and make life a tragedy but this tragedy is not of the very
essence of tragedy inasmuch as here we have merely love confronted by
an unsurmountable obstacle meeting and overwhelming it the discord is
not inherent many a lover suffering from unrequited love is born with
the tendency to become unhappy with a secret will to the voluptuousness
of pain and melancholy he will enjoy his unhappiness perhaps become
productive through it thus this deliberately unhappy love may be
regarded as an analogy to genuine metaphysical eroticism for the
worship of woman is in its essence infinite striving its object is
always unattainable an illusion every earthly love even if it finds
no response at all may in principle be gratified and is only unhappy
if external circumstances intervene but the love of the madonna is in
itself fraught with the tragic impossibility of requital its foundation
is the recognition or divination of the fact that mortal women are too
insignificant for a passion which yearns for infinitude a lover filled
with the longing to glorify a woman and worship her as a divine being
has frequently experienced a certain disappointment the beloved may
have died youngas did beatricewithout his ever having come into
close contact with her instinctively his soul turns heavenwardand
imagination has ample scope to transform and transfigure the dead or he
may have been disappointed in his mistress it may have been that he
attuned to pure spiritual love has found her all too human he flees
from reality into the world of dreams and envelops her with the veil of
mysteriousness and divinity purely spiritual love is an intense
emotion and as men and women of flesh and blood cannot always live at
high pressure hours of dejection and disappointment will necessarily
have to be experienced the soul takes refuge in an illusion which
becomes more and more an end in itself and gradually the lover creates
an inaccessibly lofty celestial woman for purely spiritual love
aspires to absolute transcendency it cannot bear contact with everyday
life the psychologists of the present day tell us that a feeling in
becoming spiritualised loses strengthhistory teaches us that in the
case of great souls the opposite is the rule
these suggestions purpose to explain the inception of an ecstatic love
but the true metaphysical erotic is born and needs no outside stimulus
his heart yearns for the inaccessible from the very beginning there are
certain elements of feeling which must be present in his soul
simultaneously a religious elementary feeling tending to the
metaphysical the need of a sacreda divinebeing as the foundation
of all existing things a powerful and purely spiritual craving for
love hurt perhaps unconsciously in early youth and finally an
imagination endowed with plastic forceartistic tendencies in the case
of the mystic the soul too is filled with the consciousness of the
divine he too has the capacity for a great love but with him it is
not the love of woman but of something universal not individualised
the world the cosmos god
while the mystic attempts to embody the inconceivable deity in his soul
the worshipper of the madonna like the artist imaginatively creates a
being which he sets up for contemplation at the greatest possible
distance the mystic is blind as it were he is yearning personified
and he would force god into his soul the metaphysical lover needs a
plastic figure which in the extremest case may represent the whole
world to him and this figure must be a woman it is a historical
accident that this woman is frequently connected with a woman of
ecclesiastical tradition an accident strengthened by insufficient
creative power on the part of the lover or lack of courage and
selfconfidence he is grateful for the support given to him by
tradition the greatest metaphysical lovers dante goethe and
michelangelo freely created the objects of their love the protestant
goethewhom some people even accuse of paganismclung more closely
than either of the others to the mary of catholicism in the final scene
of faust the worship of the madonna is the love of great solitary
souls andas is proved by goetheof the great souls in the hours of
their last solitude
while there was only unindividualised sexual instinct the chastity of
woman was of no account we have seen that neither the eastern nations
nor the greeks attached any value to it the woman who had best
fulfilled her vocation as a mother was the woman most highly respected
in the east as well as with jews and romans a woman could be divorced
by her husband for sterility the only women who were to some extent
appreciated for their own sakes were the greek hetaerae but when
asceticism became a moral value chastity too was regarded as a
virtue and personal love between two individuals invested it with a
profound significance henceforth woman should no longer be regarded as
the vehicle for the gratification of male sensuality it should be her
mission to lead the lover to spiritual perfection the fusion of the
older ideal of womanhood the mother acknowledged and sanctioned by
religion in the mother of the saviour with the newer ideal the
virgin created the ideal of the late middle ages the virgin with the
child here the natural vocation of woman and the fantastic mission laid
upon her by man were united in a paradoxical higher intuition and it
is superfluous to point out that the most irreligious minds of the
renascence as well as those of all later eras have to this day
worshipped this ideal and never wearied of representing it under new
forms
but the worship of the virginal mother contains another element an
element of which man in his contact with woman is deeply conscious the
element of mystery to a man a young girl untouched by the faintest
breath of sensuality has a quality of strangeness and mysteriousness
this is probably a result of european sentiment and at all times the
woman who has become a mother has been regarded with a slight feeling of
superstitious awe in the virginal mother these two vaguely reverential
feelings are blended she is a strange and aweinspiring being and man
divining a mystery bows down before her
otto weininger was the first to give us a psychology of the cult of the
madonna and he did it in a manner which proved his entire comprehension
of this peculiar sentimental disposition he realised and pointed out
the contrast between sexuality and eroticism his terms for sexual
impulse and love but in accordance with his extreme mental disposition
he left these two principles in irreconcilable conflict while i regard
their antithesis merely in the light of a transient phase which will be
followed by a reconciling synthesis weininger is i believe in
conflict with spiritual reality when guided by ethical not
psychological considerations he proposes the theory that a man endows
the beloved woman with all the lofty values he desires for himself he
projects his ideal of an absolutely perfect being on another human
being and this and nothing else is the meaning of his love to bestow
all the qualities one would like to possess but never can quite
possess on another individual to make it the representative of all
values that is to love it is a commonplace experience that genuine
love will awaken in the soul new and transcendent emotions compared to
which all previous experience appears petty and insignificant the waves
of this emotion are able to carry the lover to the infinite or at least
his emotion will help him to divine the infinite he sees unexpectedly
his inmost soul revealed to him he has exceeded the limits upon which
he has hitherto looked as a matter of course the barrier between him
and the universe has fallen the whole world belongs to him the egoist
becomes less selfish the cruel man gentle the dullard clairvoyant
every man feels that he has become greater and more human this is
neither illusion nor projection nor is it a subtle psychical
deceptionit is sober reality weiningers suspicion of a delusion is
nothing but the result of his ascetic solipsism refusing to accept
another beings help in his striving for perfection a consequence of
the onesided sterile cult of his individual soul a noble but puerile
pride refusing to be indebted to the world and to his fellowmen the
fanatical metaphysical dualism which is so often met with in the second
stage of eroticism and to which stage he belongs
weininger shrank from the idea that an individual might be made the
means to an end instead of being an end in itself in my opinion his
justification for the translation of this formulaframed by kant for
pure ethicsto empirical psychology is doubtful to use an individual
only as a means to an end which is alien to his inmost being is
certainly immoral but all social life is based on a mutual relationship
of means and ends a man is an end in himself at the same time that he
is a means to other individuals and the community the teacher is a
means as far as his pupils are concerned the poet is a means in respect
to all who seek in his writings information or recreation to carry the
stigmatisation of these facts to a logical conclusion one would have to
call it immoral to accept anything from parents or teachers one would
have to reject every good influencewhich always comes from
outsideand become completely absorbed in the cult of ones own soul
one would even have to object to being born and would have to create
ones self out of nothing it has always been regarded as the splendid
privilege of great men to exert an ennobling influence on otherswhy
therefore should the influence of a beloved woman on her lover be
objectionable
weiningers error in the sphere of eroticism arises from the fact of his
imprisoning love in a formula which is by no means applicable to it in
love the mutual relationship of means and ends does not exist the lover
feels that the beloved is always an end in herself in the highest sense
he would find it impossible inwardly to establish such a relationship
between himself and her very frequently himself his wellbeing and his
life are of no account to him if he can serve her weiningers
assertion that at the consummation of love every woman is merely the
means of gratifying a mans passion is simply not true on the
contrary it is a characteristic of genuine love that the physical
embrace is of no great importance does not even rise to full
consciousness the personality of the beloved is everything physical
sensation nothing weininger identifies love with passion and his
argument is easily refutable by the experience of many in love there is
neither means nor end if however categoric formulas must be used one
might speak of a reciprocal action equally erroneous is his
corresponding assertion that the artist loves a woman spiritually that
is in the sense of deifying her for the purpose of drawing from her
inspiration for his work if he loves her then his love is the alpha
and omega of his striving and if love inspires him to achieve a
masterpiece the effect of love on him must be considered great and
good because it is a creative effect
the extreme individualistic ideal would lead to an absolutely
unproductive view of life asceticism stands condemned because it is
unproductive i may regard an indian fakir who has become so godlike
that he can sustain life on six grains of rice a day and draw breath
once every quarter of an hourto say nothing of speech or
cleanlinessas a very strange individual but i see nothing positive or
important in him the road which leads from the individual to the
universal cannot be the rejection of the world it must be its
perfection resulting from productivity of mind or soul or deed he
who on principle refuses to be productive condemns himself to
annihilation in the higher sense i admit that he who works at his own
perfection does good work too but it is the inexplicable secret of all
truly creative labourin the highest as well as in the lowest
sensethat it must ultimately affect the world and eternity the
strongest emotions the inner illumination of the mystic and the love of
the great erotic have been conceived in the heart of hearts and have
ultimately grown beyond their creator from the individual to the
universal the more intimate and powerful the creative impulse has been
the more retarded and abundant may perhaps be the effect but the
chain which links the great soul to humanity cannot be broken the work
will make itself manifestthe work of deed the work of the mind the
work of lovei do not say to the public but to life to the world
the creative personality alone is the father of the objective values of
civilisation
the great love which led dante goethe and wagner to the summits of
humanity is in the highest sense positive and creative and he who
realises that love is not subject to sexual impulse who knows it as
something purely personal foreign and even hostile to the genus must
admit that it is one of the very highest of values a contrary ethic is
sterile indian unproductive not european i am well aware that
weininger did not explicitly draw this conclusion but he rejects
spiritual love because it endows the lover with new capacities the
capacities of growth and perfection and he is therefore in the last
resort a representative of philosophic nihilism
c dante and goethe
the worship of woman found its climax in dante through the work of his
youth the vita nuova and his masterpiece the divine comedy we can
trace step by step the stages of the road beginning with a glimpse of a
young girl in florence and ending with the incorporation of a woman
into the worldsystem we are face to face with an extraordinary process
of evolution the young girl he had seen a few times and who died in
her youth goes on growing and developing in his soul until at last
in him the will to raise woman above time into eternity the will to
make her a member of the divine system reaches its full realisation
what had been begun by the troubadours and fully comprehended by the
poets of the sweet new style reached completion in dante and was
henceforth an eternal value for all humanity
we see that the later troubadours were inclined to blend the lady of
their heart with the universal lady of heaven the need of deifying the
loved woman was at the root of many dubious growths and possibly these
early poets were also to some extent influenced by their dread of the
inquisition which never gained much importance in italy the new poets
deepened this feeling stripped it of all externalities and appeared
before the adored simply as lovers they did not require the dogmatic
support of the church their own feeling was sufficient guarantee
dante moreover was possessed by a craving for an absolutely perfect
and consistent worldsystem and had besides the power to build it up
and people it with sublime intelligences and in this system the crown
and perfection of the mediaevalcatholic conception of the universe he
assigned to the love of his youth a high and permanent place by the side
of the deities dante thus raised his individual feeling to a universal
dogma and enriched the catholic heaven by his personal love what for
two hundred years had been a dream and a desire had become a matter of
faith and truth now and not until now love and religion were one the
love of a woman had been included in the system of eternal verities and
had become identical with the love of immortality love which moves the
sun and all the stars was acknowledged as a fundamental feeling the
anchoring of the subjective in the eternal was achieved in this
metaphysical setting the deification of the beloved and no greater
gift was ever vouchsafed to man than the creation of metaphysically true
beings and values all that had been done before had merely prepared the
ground for this great deed the enshrinement of the beloved in the heart
of the divine secrets
the vita nuova which is at once a glorified historical record and the
greatest testimony of metaphysical love emphasises from the outset the
inspiring purifying influence emanating from the beloved beatrice is
the destroyer of all evil and the queen of all virtue when i saw her
coming towards me and could hope for her salutation the world held no
enemy for me yea i was filled with the fire of brotherly love to such
an extent that i was ready to forgive anybody who had ever offended me
and whoever had begged me for a gift i should have replied love and
my face would have been full of humility even before his love had been
translated to the world beyond he portrayed spiritual love as hardly
any other poet before or after him the women of florence ask dante
why doest thou love this lady seeing that thou canst not even bear her
presence tell us for the end of such love must be incomprehensible to
men and he replies ladies the end and aim of my love is but the
salutation of that lady therein i find that beatitude which is the goal
of my desire and now that it has pleased her to deny me her salutation
my whole happiness is contained in that which can never perish and the
women tell us then wherein lies such happiness in the words that
praise my lady that is to say in the emotion which is an end in itself
and in its artistic expression the lover never exchanged a word with
her had he done so attempting to establish a reciprocal relationship
beatrice bereft of his idealising love would have had to descend from
her pedestal and show herself a girl like all the rest not until after
her deification has become an established fact does beatrice in the
beginning of the divine comedy remember her lover and come to save
him in one of his poems dante says that not every woman could inspire
such a love but only a woman of peculiar nobility of character it is
very apparent that dante at first was not sure of himself and that he
only gradually discovered the new consciousness which was stirring his
soul with every chapter the beloved recedes to a greater distance and
becomes more sacred to him
it is quite in keeping with all this that our knowledge of this girl of
eighteen is very vague and uncertain some of dantes commentators
believe her to have been a figment of his brain a woman who never
lived or an allegory of wisdom virtue the church theology etc but
at the death of her father beatrice again behaves like any other earthly
maiden there is a grain of truth in every one of these theories for
dante was a great scholastic as well as a great poet and in more
advanced years he felt a need somehow to connect the love of his youth
with the system of the church this could be done in an allegorical way
without being inwardly untruthful
vague forces which the lover himself realises as mysterious run high
in the vita nuova and in the poems the lover has hallucinations in
sleep and sickness in the third canzone dante speaks of the
impossibility of comprehending what gave him a glimpse of the nature of
his mistress it was a foreboding of new and great things struggling
slowly and gradually to take shape for the creation of a worldsystem
one of whose supporting pillars was personal love of an individual was
an unprecedented achievement when she speaks a spirit inclines from
heaven the angels implore god to call this miracle into their midst
but god wills that they shall have patience until the hope of the
blessed appears
     love says of her can there be mortal thing
     at once adorned so richly and so pure
     then looks on her and silently affirms
     that heaven designed in her a creature new
                              transl by c lyell
again and again recurs the motif of her beauty before which the world
must fall prostrate in a sonnet not included in the vita nuova he

     in heaven itself that lady had her birth

the lover has a foreboding of the fate awaiting him i have set my feet
into that phase of life from whence there is no return he divines the
sorrow to which love has predestined him but others too divining that
this man expects more perhaps of love than others ask him to
explain to them the essence of love and he answers them with the famous
sonnet
     amor e cor gentil sono una cosa
     love and the gentle heart are but one thing
the death of beatrice is accompanied by the same phenomena as was the
death of christ the sun lost its brilliance stars appeared in the
sky birds fell to the ground dead the earth trembled god visibly
intervened in the course of nature
     for from the lamp of her meek lowlihead
     such an exceeding glory went up hence
     that it woke wonder in the eternal sire
     until a sweet desire
     entered him for that lovely excellence
     so that he bade her to himself aspire
     counting this weary and most evil place
     unworthy of a thing so full of grace
                         transl by dg rossetti
in the 29th chapter which we today do not readily understand dante
established by a system of symbolical numbers a connection between
beatrice and the trinity the deification of the beloved had been
achieved in thought and emotion religion enriched by a new divinity
love weeping has filled my heart with new knowledge he says at the
conclusion of the work of his youth i repeat what i have already said
in another place and supported by passages from the divine comedy it
was never dantes intention to write fictitious poems in our meaning of
the term but at every hour of his life he was convinced that he was
proclaiming the pure truth he knew himself to be the chosen vehicle for
the interpretation of the eternal system of the world
at the conclusion of the vita nuova beatrice is a divine being
devoid of all emotionenthroned in heaven in the comedy she becomes
her lovers saviour and redeemer and through him a helper of all
humanity the love of the youth had found no response in the heart of
the florentine maiden but the soul of the glorified woman was inspired
by love of him she trembles for him and when marys messenger
admonishes her why doest thou not help him who has loved thee so
much she sends virgil to him as a guide and finally herself leads her
redeemed lover to god now she responds to his love she has even wept
for him this ultimately fulfilled but always chastely hidden longing
for love in return gives the womanworship of dante a peculiarly noble
charm at the end of his journey through life he prays to her who has
again disappeared from his sight and his last confession is into a
free man thou transformst a slave
loves greatest miracle has been made manifest in him it has
transfigured and purified him and made of the slave of the world and
its desires a personalitythe fundamental motif of love
there is a close connection between the metaphysical love of dante and
goethes confession in the last scene of faust which reveals the
poets deepest conviction his final judgment of life the confessions
of both poets are identical to the smallest detail the divine comedy
represents the journey of humanity through the kingdoms of the world in
a manner unique and representative applicable alike to all men in the
sense of the catholic middle ages the fundamental idea of faust is
again the desire of man to find the right way through the world here
also the journey through life is intended to be typical it is
undertaken five hundred years later the scene is laid for the most part
on the surface of the earth but the ultimate goal of the wayfarer is
heaven hell instead of being a subterraneous region is embodied in a
presence accompanying and tempting man modern man has no faithful
guide he must himself seek the way which to the man of the middle ages
was clearly indicated in the bible the love of his youth which in the
case of dante fills a book in itself is merely an episode at the
beginning of the tragedythe lover wanders through all the kingdoms of
the world finally to return home to the beloved
the last scene of faust is an unfolding of metaphysical love into its
inherent multiplicity its summit is the metaphysical love of woman all
human striving is determined and crowned by the saving grace of love
faust has no longer a specific name he has dropped everything
subjective and is briefly styled a lover like dante he has become
representative of humanity the hour of death revives the memory of the
love of his youth apparently forgotten in the storm and stress of a
crowded life yet never quite extinguished in the heart of his heart
margaret is present and guides him as beatrice guided dante upward to
the eternalfeminine that is to say to the metaphysical consummation
of all male yearning for love the love from on high saves faust as it
has saved dante the blessed boys who as well as the angels are
present in both poems singing
     whom ye adore shall ye
     see face to face2
are again referring to the transcendently loving lover like beatrice
margaret intercedes for him intercession for her lover has always been
womans profoundest prayer with the queen of heaven
     incline oh incline
     all others excelling
     in glory aye dwelling
     unto my bliss thy glance benign
     the loved one ascending
     his long trouble ending
     comes back he is mine
these words are more intimate and human than the words of beatrice but
fundamentally they mean the same thing dante meeting beatrice again
says
     and oer my spirit that so long a time
     had from her presence felt no shuddering dread
     albeit my eyes discovered her not there moved
     a hidden virtue from her at whose touch
     the power of ancient love was strong within me3
but when he who has said so much beholds her face to face he is
stricken dumb
beatrice receives dante from his guide and herself unveils to him the
mysteries of life similarly margaret beseeches the virgin
     to guide him be it given to me
     still dazzles him the newborn day
and receives from on high the command which the symbolically burdened
beatrice knows intuitively
     ascend thine influence feeleth he
     hell follow on thine upward way
as beatrice approaches the angels sing
     oh turn
     thy saintly eyes to this thy faithful one
     who to behold thee many a wearisome pace
     hath measured
and with the fundamental feeling of dantes divine comedy faust
concludes
     the everwomanly
     draws us above
the earthly love of his youth is fulfilled in the dream of metaphysical
love in the dream of a divine woman the genius creates at the
conclusion of his life the fulfilment of all longing it may sound
paradoxical but faustlike dante and peer gyntunconsciously sought
margaret in the hurlyburly of the world not the young girl whom he had
seduced and deserted but the eternalfeminine the purely spiritual
love which in his youth he divined but destroyed bound by the
shackles of desire to dante to whom life and poem were one as well as
to goethefaust the memory of first love remained typical of all
genuine profound feeling with dante love and beatrice are identical
in the soul of these two men metaphysical love the longing for the
eternal in woman which they did not find on earth gradually awoke to
life both place the glorified mistress by the side of another woman
the catholic queen of heaven in dantes as well as in goethes
paradise two women a personal one and a universal one are loved and
adored the second woman too has her exclusive ecstatic worshipper
st bernard the doctor marianus of dante prostrating himself before
her addresses to her the sublime prayer which begins
     oh virgin mother daughter of thy son
and in faust we meet again the doctor marianus burningas the
representative of the totality of her worshipperswith the sacred joy
of love dante says
     the queen of heaven for whom my soul
     burns with loves rapture
and pronouncing the most beautiful prayer to the madonna which the world
possesses and which is almost identical with dantes
     virgin pure from taint of earth
     mother we adore thee
     with the godhead one by birth
     queen we bow before thee
and prostrated before her
     penitents her saviourglance
     gratefully beholding
     to beatitude advance
     still new powrs unfolding
     thine each better thought shall be
     to thy service given
     holy virgin gracious be
     mother queen of heaven
in the divine comedy st bernard prays
     so mighty art thou lady and so great
     that he who grace desireth and comes not
     to thee for aidence fain would have desire
     fly without wings
the chorus mysticus could equally well form the conclusion of the
comedy the inadequate which to fulness groweth is what the
provenals already in their time realised as folly as a paradox
the metaphysical love of woman for ever remaining dream and longing
always unfulfilled the eternalfeminine
as the mater gloriosa appears dante exclaims
     thenceforward what i saw
     was not for words to speak nor memorys self
     to stand against such outrage on her skill
and goethe
     in starry wreath is seen
     lofty and tender
     midmost the heavenly queen
     known by her splendour
here the sacred fire of love metaphysical eroticism has reached its
absolute climax the universe is represented by a divine woman and man
abandoning himself to her worships her goethes faust concludes at
this point but dante went further right into the heart of the eternal
glory of the deity there to lose himself
i have previously said that the last scene of faust was the final
unfolding of the manifold blossom of metaphysical eroticism and i will
proceed to establish my point hitherto i have used the term
metaphysical eroticism always in its narrow sense of love of woman
henceforth i shall use it in its broader meaning of mystical love in
general all love that is projected on the transcendental and the
divine emotion is the specific domain of humanity its power its
essence and in the profoundest emotion in love a connection between
the temporal and the eternal may be divined hence the christian mystery
of mysteries god giving his son to the world for love of humanity god
unable to approach the world other than as a loversacrificing himself
for the sake of love we cannot conceive the sublime with any other
principal function than that of love for love is the deepest and
profoundest emotion of the human heart and in accordance with the
first postulate must therefore be the soul of the universe on this
point all mystics and all metaphysical ecstatics are agreed god is
love is written in the gospel of st john love which moves the sun
and all the stars stands at the termination of dantes masterpiece
and in faust the pater profundus confesses
     so love almighty allpervading
     does all things mould does all sustain
he is still wrestling for divine love he still has to fight against the
temptations of doubt of thought
     oh god my troubled thoughts composing
     my needy heart do thou illume
but the true enthusiastic lover of the divine compelled to annihilate
himself so as to become absorbed in god the lover who no longer knows
the difference between pain and delight is represented by the pater
ecstaticus the condition of rest is foreign to him ceaselessly moving
up and down he sings
     joys everlasting fire
     loves glow of pure desire
     pang of the seething breast
     rapture a hallowed guest
     darts pierce me through and through
     lances my flesh subdue
     clubs me to atoms dash
     lightnings athwart me flash
     that all the worthless may
     pass like a cloud away
     while shineth from afar
     loves gem a deathless star
these ejaculations completely exhaust the emotional life of the
selfdestructive metaphysical erotiche is conscious of nothing but his
passion of love which eclipses all else with him the second form of
metaphysical love the lovedeath is reached goethe in creating this
character must have had in his mind the unique jacopone da todi for
this rapturous love was the keynote of jacopones character his whole
life was one great ecstasy
     my heart was all to broken
     as prostrate i was lying
     with dear loves fiery token
     swift from the archer flying
     wounded with sweet pain soaken
     peace became warand dying
     my soul with pain was soaken
     distraught with throes of love
     in transports i am dying
     oh loves astounding wonder
     for love his fell spear plying
     has cleft my heart asunder
     around the blade are lying
     sharp teeth my life to sunder
     in rapture i am dying
     distraught with throes of love
and
     oh love oh love oh jesus my desire
     oh love i hold thee clasped in sweet embrace
     oh love embracing thee could i expire
     oh love id die to see thee face to face
     oh love oh love i burn in raptures fire
     i die enravished in the souls embrace
the legend has it that the heart of jacopone broke with the intensity of
love this would have been a lovedeath of cosmic grandeur
before jacopone st bernard in whom all the radiations of metaphysical
eroticism are traceable was consumed by similar emotions some of his
latin poems very much resemble the poems of his successor
     oh most sweet jesu saviour blest
     my yearning spirits hope and rest
     to thee mine inmost nature cries
     and seeks thy face with tears and sighs
     thou my hearts joy whereer i rove
     thou art the perfecting of love
     thou art my boastall praise be thine
     jesu the worlds salvation mine
     then his embrace his holy kiss
     the honeycomb were naught to this
     twere bliss fast bound to christ for aye
     but in these joys is little stay
     this love with ceaseless ardour burns
     how wondrous sweet no stranger learns
     but tasted once the enraptured wight
     is filled with ever new delight
     now i behold what most i sought
     fulfilled at last my longing thought
     lovesick my soul to jesus turns
     and all my heart within me burns
                          transl by tg crippen
we read in his writings blessed and sacred is he to whom it has been
given to experience this in his earthly life even if he have
experienced it only once for the space of a fleeting minute for to
melt away completely as it were as if one had ceased to exist to be
emptied of self dissolved in holy emotion has not been given to mortal
life but is the state of the blessed
i shall have to refer to both men in a future chapter when i shall
examine the degenerate growths of metaphysical eroticism for the ardour
of their souls was frequently kindled by sexual imaginings in the case
of emotional mystics it is often difficult to distinguish between
sensual conceptions and the pure love of god a fact which does not
however justify the superficial opinion that all mysticism is diverted
sexuality
it is obvious that this love of god is not the original creation of the
lover as is the deifying love of woman but the mystic love whose
selfevident object is god or eternity jacopones and later on
zinzendorfs love of jesus though projected on a historical
personality was fundamentally the same thing the love of god alsoand
in this connection i might mention jacob boehme alphonso da liguori
novalisis metaphysical eroticism but i have restricted my subject to
the metaphysical love of woman and shall not overstep my limits i will
merely elucidate a little more the last scene of faust
pater seraphicus a title given both to st francis and to
bonaventurarequires but a few words he too praises metaphysical
love the essence of the supreme spirits
     thus the spirits nature stealing
     through the ethers depths profound
     love eternal selfrevealing
     sheds beatitude around
but even the more perfect angels cannot free themselves from the
dualism of all things human body and soulan unmistakable confession
of metaphysical dualism
     parts them gods love alone
       their union ending
the identity of the last scene of faust goethes masterpiece and the
conclusion of dantes divine comedy is so obvious that i do not think
any one could deny it i have pointed out the thought underlying both
works and could easily advance further proof of their similarity but i
will keep within the limits of the last scene which contains the
totality of metaphysicoerotic yearning and i contend that it is very
remarkable that a lifetime after the composition of margaret faust and
with him goethe very old very wise and a little cold having had
loveaffairs with demigoddesses and having finally renounced the love
of woman found his mission and his happiness in uninterrupted
productive activity he has discovered the final value in work but the
longforgotten heaven opens and the love of his youth comes to meet him
stripped of everything earthly a divine being she still loves him and
shows him the way to salvation presented under the aspect of the
eternalfeminineexactly as in the divine comedy there must be a
reason for the uniformity of feeling in the case of the two greatest
subjective poets of europe shakespeare was greater than either but he
was quite impersonal for the logical possibility that goethe imitated
dante and borrowed his supreme values from him cannot be maintained
for a moment their mutual characteristic is the longing for
metaphysical love when these great lovers experienced for the first
time the sensation of love their hearts were thrown open to the
universe they had the first powerful experience of eternity and they
became poets the first love and the cosmic consciousness of genius were
simultaneously present they were one in their inmost soul with the
philosopher it is a different matter for to him the love of woman is
not fraught with the same tremendous significance this experience of
first love awakening the consciousness of eternity remained to them
for all time interwoven with religion and metaphysicsinterwoven that
is to say with all transcendent longing and though the aged faust had
believed it to be buried in the dark night of forgotten things it was
still alive in his inmost heart and the dying mans vision of the
divine took colour and shape from it
the source of both great poems was the poets will to assimilate the
world and recreate it impregnated with his own soul the secret motive
powers were the mystic love of eternity and the love of woman which had
outgrown this world and aspired to the next to goethe thirsting to
give a concrete shape to his yearning god and eternity were too
intangible too remote and incomprehensiblebut the woman he loved with
religioerotic intensity was familiar to him the eternalfeminine is
thus not fraught with incomprehensibility but is rather and this
necessarily the final conclusion for this conclusion is a profession
of metaphysical eroticism that is to say the eternalfeminine in
contradistinction to the transitoryfeminine both dante the devout
son of the middle ages and goethe the champion of modern culture
demand in virtue of the inherent right of their genius the
consummation of their mystic yearning for love in another life and
achieve the creation of the divine woman precisely because margaret was
nothing but a little provincial goethe could sublimate her into a new
being for the greater the tension between reality and the vision of the
soul the greater is the task and the more gigantic the creative power
which such a task may develop it has been said that in this scene
goethe revealed leanings towards catholicism i do not pretend to deny
it offhand but i must insist on these leanings being understood in the
sense of my premises goethe took from tradition those elements which
were able to materialise his spiritual life and gave them a new
interpretation we are justified in believing that he accepted nothing
but what was conformable to his nature the madonna represented his
profoundest feeling and like dante i attribute the greatest importance
to this he created a new deity moulded in the shape of his first
love and placed it by the side of the universal queen of heaven the
madonna of the catholic church transformed by love
the emotional life of both poets agrees fundamentally they differ not
so much in feeling as in thought and in faith dante possessed
unshakable faith in the reality of his visions eternal love in the
shape of beatrice was awaiting him his vision was pure eternal truth
the vision of goethe on the other hand was poetic longing tragical
because the vision of the transcendent came to the modern poet only in
rare hours where dante possessed goethe must seek strive and err
the deifying love of woman is as we have seen the extreme development
of the second stage in which sexual impulse and spiritual love are
strictly separated in which man despises and fights his natural
instinct or abandons himself to itwhich is the same in
principlewhile his soul worshipping love soars heavenward this
dualism of feeling corresponds to the persistent dualism of christianity
and the whole mediaeval period but as goethe is frequently looked upon
as a monist my proposition that he was a dualist in eroticis will
possibly be rejected in spite of the fact that his emotional life is
revealed to us with great lucidity his first important work his
werther which is also one of the most important monuments of
sentimental love contains the germs of love as we understand it the
love which is no longer content to look upon sexuality and soul as two
opposed principles but strives to blend them in the person of the
beloved i will revert to werther later on this third stage love in
the modern sense is programmatically established as it were in
elective affinities but all the rest of the very abundant evidence of
his emotional life exhibits the typically dualistic feeling many of his
early poems evidence sexuality pure and simple in the venetian
epigrams and in the roman elegies it is even held up as a positive
value in the third elegy for instance the poets sensuality is linked
directly to the famous lovers of antiquity and everything which aspires
beyond it is rejected in the same way his westeastern divan is
characterised by a gay sensuality with homosexual tendencies
the sensual quality of goethes eroticism was partly spent in his
relationship with christiane vulpius the following passage which forms
an interesting counterpart to goethes famous correspondence with
charlotte von stein is taken from a letter written to christiane
vulpius during his absence from home the beds everywhere are very
wide and you would have no reason for complaint as you sometimes have
at home oh my sweet heart there is no such happiness on earth as
being together
if christiane represented sensuality unrelieved by any other feeling
frau von stein represented the most important object of goethes craving
for spiritual love these two liaisons were to some extent
contemporaneous the roman elegies and the famous letters to charlotte
von stein were written at the same period when she reproached him with
his loveaffair with christiane he replied with consistent dualism
and what sort of an affair is it whose interests are suffering by it
frau von stein his senior by seven years was thirtyfour years old
and mother of seven children when goethe first met her according to
schiller she can never have been beautiful and in a letter to koerner
the latter says they say that their relationship goethes and
charlotte von steins is absolutely pure and irreproachable it was a
great mistake ever to regard this relationship as anything but a purely
spiritual one goethe never felt any passion for charlotte he called
her his sister the guide of his soul he told her of his little
loveaffairs and was never jealous of her husband the following are a
few typical passages culled from his letters arranged chronologically
my only love whom i can love without torment then quite in the
spirit of the dolce stil nuovo your soul in which thousands believe
in order to win happiness the purest truest and most beautiful
relationship which with the exception of my sister ever existed
between me and any woman the relationship between us is so strange
and sacred that i strongly felt on that occasion that it cannot be
expressed in words that men cannot realise it the following passage
written by goethe when he was thirty might have been written by
guinicelli or by dante you appeared to me like the madonna ascending
into heaven in vain did the abandoned mourner stretch out his arms in
vain did his tearful glance plead for a last returnshe was absorbed in
the splendour surrounding her longing only for the crown hovering
above her head i long to be purified in triple fire so as to be
worthy of you he addresses a prayer to her and says on my knees i
implore you to complete your work and make a good man of me while
writing tasso i worshipped you charlotte knew intuitively what he
desired of her and remained silent and passive like the madonna not a
single sensual or even passionate word replied to all these
utterances
in the course of time the relationship between the lovers became one of
equality the note of adoration disappeared and the keynote of his
letters became friendship and familiarity farewell sweet friend and
beloved whose love alone makes me happy in another letter he said
that all the world held no further prize for him since he had found
everything in her and just as spiritual love approached more and more
the mean of a familiar friendship so was his sexuality concentrated on
a single woman on christiane in this connection too seeking a mean
but it is an important point that the fundamental dualistic feeling
remained unchanged there was no woman in goethes life in regard to
whom he arrived at or even aspired to the blending of both emotions in
a higher intuition
even before his friendship with frau von stein at the time of his
engagement to lili schoenemann goethe experienced a spiritual love for
a girl he had never seen he calls countess auguste stolberg his
angel his only only maiden his golden child and says i have
an intuition that you will save me from great tribulation and that no
other being on earth could do it these letters also contain the
significant passage miserable fate which has denied me a happy mean
and touching the love of his youth lotte goethe wrote to kestner i
really had no idea that all that was in her for i always loved her far
too much to observe her
the princess in tasso and iphigenia who delivers orestes from unrest
and insanity are modelled on charlotte tasso is unmistakably a
fantastic womanworshipper a fact of which leonore is fully aware
     now he exalts her to the starry heavens
     in radiant glory and before that form
     bows down like angels in the realms above
     then stealing after her through silent fields
     he garlands in his wreath each beauteous flower
     he loves not usforgive me what i say
     his lovd ideal from the spheres he brings
     and does invest it with the name we bear
     he has relinquished passions fickle sway
     he clings no longer with delusion sweet
     to outward form and beauty to atone
     for brief excitement by disgust and hate4
and tasso says
                                  my very knees
     trembled beneath me and my spirits strength
     was all required to hold myself erect
     and curb the strong desire to throw myself
     prostrate before her scarcely could i quell
     the giddy rapture
the significant avowal addressed by dante to beatrice into a free man
thou transformst a slave the seal of all great spiritual love was
repeated by goethe in his letters to charlotte and is again repeated in
tasso
     over my spirits depths there comes a change
     relieved from dark perplexity i feel
     free as a god and all i owe to you
very interesting is also a remark which goethe made to eckermann woman
is a silver vessel in which we men lay golden apples i did not deduce
my idea of woman from reality but i was born with it or i conceived
itgod knows how these notable words deliberately pronounced reveal
goethes feeling very clearly he knows that there is a little
selfdeception in his attitude towards woman but he consciously and
lovingly clings to it his pronouncements are not contradictions it is
natural almost essential that in the soul of the highlygifted and
highlydeveloped representative of a mature civilisation the whole
wealth of human emotions should be revivified he possesses all
psychical qualitiesat least potentiallyand one element after the
other regains life and becomes productive we shall see this with
startling clearness when we come to examine the emotional life of
richard wagner the intimate connection between the individual and the
entire evolutionary process of the race will then become evident
it is remarkable that dante too wrote a poem clearly expressive of the
fact that the beloved woman does not actually possess the qualities
ascribed to her but that she has been endowed with them by the
imagination of her lover
i shall discuss the emotional life of only one other poet in detail and
that one is michelangelo for the most part the poets whose emotions
were akin to that of dante and goethe were men who created their ideal
woman because reality left them unsatisfied in passing i will mention
beethoven and his touching letter to his immortal love my angel my
all my i whose name in spite of all the strenuous attempts to
discover it is to this day not known with any certainty even if it
should ever be discovered beethovens immortal love will yet remain a
figment of his brain based on a human woman
together with beethoven we may notice the other great old bachelor
grillparzer and his eternal fiance kathi frhlich and the critical
hebbel who at the time of composing genovefa wrote in his diary
all earthly love is merely the road to the heavenly love
before closing this chapter i must draw attention to a strange fact in
connection with the psychology of races all nations endowed with fair
mental gifts and a sympathetic understanding of nature have in the
period of their youth and anthropomorphistic and animistic thought
worshipped light and its source the sun as the supreme deity the
giver of joy and abundance all the benevolent deities of the arians
were celestial beings all the malevolent divinities spirits of
darkness olympian gods and the demons of the netherworldaesir and
giants to the nave mind of the indogermanic races it appeared a
matter of course that the sun the conqueror of night and winter the
fertilizing lifegiving deity should be worshipped as the active male
principle and represented as a god while on the other hand the moon
was usually conceived as a female deity in primitive christianity
christ as the bringer of light was worshipped under the symbol of the
sun thus we naturally find in the old and new indogermanic languages
the designation of the sunor the sungodof the masculine gender in
the following words our word sun is easily recognisable
     savar and svari the oldest indogermanic tongue
     svar and surya sanscrit savitarthe sungod
     saval the oldest european language
     savel graccoitalian
     sol latin and related languages
in the germanic languages and in the prussianlithuanian both genders
occur gothic sunnan and old highgerman sunno sol in the norse
edda is a female deity and the anglosaxon sol is also feminine the
transition from the male to the female gender was achieved in the
middlehighgerman language of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and
the german language is the only one in which the word sun is
feminine as the old teutonic deities of light were male baldur and
sigurd this change of gender must seem strange the germanic tribes at
all times observed natural phenomena with the greatest attention
borrowed their ethical symbols from nature and used natural objects to
represent their highest values the change of gender of the supreme
symbol of divinity the sun can only be explained by the fact that in
the period of womanworship the highest value was no longer felt as male
but as female that secretly a goddess had usurped the place of a god
very likely the minnesingers finally fixed the female gender when it had
become problematical and worshipped the loved woman under the divine
symbol of lady sun
the great erotic heinrich of morungen says in one of his poems that
his lady is radiant as the sun at break of day and also
     my lady shines into the heart
     as through the glass the sun does shine
     thus the beloved lady mine
     is sweet as may full of delight
     unclouded sunshine golden light
mary who had been called maris stella the morning star gradually
assumed the symbol of the allconquering sun suso in one of his poems
still clinging to the older epithet makes use of a metaphor
corresponding to the breaking of the sun through clouds when the
radiant morning star mary broke through the suffering of thy darkened
heart it was saluted with gladness and with these words greeting
beautiful rising morning star from the fathomless depths of all loving
hearts but he also calls mary thou dazzling mirror of the eternal
sun and his biography contains the following beautiful passage and
his eyes were opened and he fell on his knees saluting the rising
morning star the tender queen of the light of heaven as the little
birds in the summer time salute the day so he saluted the luminous
bringer of the eternal day and he spoke his salutation not
mechanically but with a sweet low singing of his soul this is pure
and genuine natureworship mingled with the worship of mary
so much for suso in goethes faust doctor marianus prays
     in thy tent of azure blue
     queen supremely reigning
     let me now thy secret view
     vision high obtaining
it is obvious that here the queen of heaven and the sun are conceived as
one eichendorff makes use of the metaphor
     the sun is smiling languidly
     like to a woman wondrous sweet
the typically unteutonic modern poet alfred mombert on the other
hand conceives the sun as a youth and contrary to all custom calls a
poem der sonnengeist the sunspirit
the great italians also were not unaware of this change of the sex of
the supreme value at the conclusion of the paradise there is a
passage in st bernards prayer which points to a connection in
dantes mind between the sun and the queen of heaven
     the love that moves the sun in heaven
d michelangelo
in michelangelo we meet the spirit of plato and the plastic genius of
greece raised to a higher plane and lit by the peculiar glory of
christianitythe conception of the soul as an absolute value
michelangelo was thrilled by a passionate love of beauty beauty
absolute eternal and immutable he felt profoundly the need of
salvation and he possessed an unprecedented power of spiritual vision
in the end added to all these things came consuming love for a woman
love raised to the pitch of selfdestruction an adoration which
entitles us to regard him next to dante as the greatest metaphysical
lover of all times
at the court of the medici at florence ficinio had founded a platonic
academy where platos works and the writings of plotinushis greatest
pupilwere after two thousand years translated and elucidated many
read and a few understood but only in michelangelo did the spirit of
platonic hellenism revive and become productive the platonic ideal of a
purely masculine culture aesthetically and spiritually perfect
illumined his soul once again the unconditional cult of beauty and the
love of the perfect male form which speaks to us from the dialogues
quickened an imagination and boyhood and youth were portrayed in a
manner which has never since been equalled
nearly all michelangelos youthful male figureswith the exception
perhaps of the gigantic daviddeviate from the decidedly masculine and
approach the mean the human in the abstract thus they seem to us
imbued with a quality of femininity they even exhibit decidedly female
characteristics i have in mind first and foremost the youths depicted
on the ceiling of the sistine chapel the most soulful adolescent
figures in the world but also bacchus st john adonis and the
figures in the background of the holy family at florence cupid and
david apollo in the bargello are almost hermaphroditic and even the
adam and the unfinished slaves in the bobili gardens exhibit female
characteristics without going further into detail i would draw
attention to the breasts and thighs which positively raise a doubt on
the question of sex i am referring to the two youths above the
erythrean sybil seen from a distance they create the impression of
female figures while the youth above jeremiah is a perfect hellenic
ephebos on the other handwith the exception of two of his early
madonnas and perhaps evehe has not given us one glorified female
figure all his women are characterised by something careworn and
unlovely some of his old womenmost strikingly the cumaic sybilare
depicted with absolutely masculine features masculine figures and
gigantic musculature his ideal was the hellenic ideal was a human form
neither man nor woman all extremes but also all peculiarities and
everything personal were if not completely suppressed at any rate
pushed into the background we regard this ideal which is alien to our
inherent nature with a feeling akin to contempt for the modern ideal
is male and female but it nevertheless was of great moment in the
obliteration of sex and the accentuation of the purely human the
platonic and also michelangelos love of young men was in its essence
pure love of humanity love of the perfect human body and the perfect
human soul whose greatest harmony was achieved in the adolescent
moreover the superior mental endowment of the boy made an intelligent
conversationso highly appreciated by platonists and neoplatonists
possible whereas with a girl a man could only jest
civilisations and individuals inclining to erotic male friendships are
endowed with great plastic talent artists and poets whose genius lies
in the direction of the plastic arts rather than in music frequently
have homosexual leanings a musical talent however is as a rule
accompanied by the love of woman i know of no great musician or great
lyrical poet inclined to erotic friendships with men the simple song
suggests the love of woman the artificial metre let us say the greek
rhythm the love of man i am however merely pointing out this
connection without drawing any conclusions
the poems addressed by michelangelo to tommaso dei cavalieri breathe a
deep longing for friendship and complete surrender but above all things
for a return of affection all barriers between the friends must be
thrown down for one soul is living in two bodies
these poems are calm and wellbalanced and differ greatly from the rest
of his poetry
     if each the other love himself foregoing
     with such delight such savour and so well
     that both to one sole end their wills combine
                          transl by ja symonds
michelangelo painted ganymede for tommaso and even at a ripe old age
he addressed poems to cechino bracci who died at the age of seventeen
his contempt of woman without which the spirit of classical greece
too is unthinkable formed a parallel to his male friendships
in the prime of his life the platonic element was superseded by the
other great element which stirred his soul so profoundly exceeding the
perfection of form of antique statuary his later works throb with a
spiritual and passionate life quite peculiar to him an inward fire
seems to consume his ardent figures they are not creatures of this
earth a breath of eternity has touched them they are an embodiment of
the platonic heritage which accounts all earthly things as symbols of
eternal beauty fertilised and glorified by a deep mourning over human
destiny and a longing for deliverance and when his years were already
beginning to decline vittoria colonna came into his life a semblance
and symbol of divine perfection the love which took possession of him
transformed his whole life and lifted it into religion in his
tempestuous soul this first love coming so late in life far exceeded
human limits it became adoration and religious ecstasy michelangelo
who could not tolerate in friendship any other relationship than that of
complete selfsurrender and equality threw himself into the very dust
before his love and debased himself almost to selfdestruction
his book of poems is filled with an unspeakable longing for the
perfection of earthly beauty and for eternity and his beloved mistress
is the sole symbol of this metaphysical climax earthly beauty is but an
imperfect semblance of the divine beauty the embodiment of which is his
love we meet all the familiar motives he is nothing before her he is
unworthy of existence he is like the moon receiving her light from the
sun love has raised him from his base condition and is teaching him the
futility of all he had hitherto valued
     yea well i see what folly twere to think
     that largess dropped from thee like dews from heaven
     could ever be paid by work so frail as mine
                          transl by ja symonds
and of love he says
     from loftiest stars shoots down a radiance all their own
     drawing the soul above
     and such we say is love
                               transl by harford
his poems which would proclaim him a great poet if he were not an even
greater sculptor breathe an emotion unsurpassed in its intensity they
reveal to us in an almost unique manner the emotional process which
culminated in the deification of the beloved if we did not know that
vittoria colonna was an historical individual not much younger than
michelangelo himself and if we are to credit her portrait a very
plain woman with a large masculine nose we might be tempted to believe
her to be a mythical personage like beatrice portinari or margaret in
faust but the conviction that all true perfection was centred only in
her now faced his art and threw its terrible shadow over it
michelangelo conceived love in the platonic sense wrote his friend
and biographer condivi but this is only a part of the truth in the
heart of michelangelo there took place the tremendous reconciliation
between the greek cult of beauty and the religion of the beyond he
blended the finest blossom of hellenism with the profoundest spirit of
christianity he sublimated plato and dante into a higher intuition the
eroico furore of his contemporary giordano had found an embodiment
the two great rays which illuminated his life the perfect earthly
beauty to which destiny had called him and the boundless religious
longing the last fundamental force of his soul converged in the
glorified woman vittoria appeared to him as the solution of the
worlddiscord a solution which he had no right to expect a miracle
she was the greatest experience of his great life an experience which
almost broke him more than once the thought of vittoria filled him with
sudden dread in her he had seen god and the world in one the powerful
effect of this on so selfreliant a character a man who had been unable
to find much sympathy with patrons and friends to whom women had meant
nothing may easily be imagined all at once he had found a centre and
more than thata solution of all the discords of life of the eternal
dualism of the earthly and the divine his love was not the love of a
youth stretching out feelers to the world beyond but the final creed of
a lonely life which had known nothing but beauty and divinity with the
passion characteristic of him he threw himself into this new experience
and made it his fate flinging world and art aside before vittoria he
ceased to be a sculptor and became a worshipper
we realise the great difference between this worship and the worship of
dante the latter formed the consciousness of eternity and became a
poet early in life he never doubted the profoundest truth the
metaphysical importance of his love but in the case of michelangelo
the love of an old man was the last event in a life consumed by
restlessness the adoration of this mysogynist was almost an act of
despair not a sweet delivery from doubt but a source of fresh shocks
it problematised his whole previous existence and nullified the work of
his life for before this new experienceperfection met in the
fleshart broke down the greatest of sculptors never made an attempt
to imprison the beauty which had appeared to his soul in marble or in
canvas deeply convinced that such an achievement was beyond the power
of earthly endeavour
before vittoria michelangelo became deeply conscious of his inmost self
she gave direction to his longing and was its symbol she was the
perfection for which he had always strivenand he despaired of his art
     thy beauty it befell in yonder spheres
     a symbol of salvation brightning heaven
     th eternal artist sent it down to earth
     if it diminish years succeeding years
     my love will lend it but a greater worth
     age cannot fade the beauty god has given
and the conviction that only the idea of eternal beauty has any value
and that all earthly things are as nothing before it became stronger
and more tormenting one instance from many
     as heat from fire from loveliness divine
     the mind that worships what recalls the sun
     from whence she sprang can be divided never
                          transl by ja symonds
in the same way he realised the futility of earthly love compared to
metaphysical love
     the one love soars the other downward tends
     the soul lights this while that the senses stir
and
     the highest beauty only i desire
it is extraordinary however that even this ecstatic adorer vaguely
suspected that he himself might be the creator of the beauty which he
saw in his mistress in a sonnet he asks cupid whether her beauty
really exists or whether it is a delusion of his senses and he
receives the reply
     the beauty thou discernest all is hers
     but grows in radiance as it soars on high
                                       ja symonds
it is indescribably tragic to watch michelangelo slowly despairing of
his own genius and art and becoming more and more dominated by the
thought of the futility of all earthly things and all earthly beauty
the religious conception of eternity and transcendent beauty the forma
universale became his last refuge after vittorias death michelangelo
said to condivi i have only one regret and that is that i never kissed
vittorias brow or lips when she lay dying more and more he brooded on
sin and salvation incarnation and crucifixion the beloved mistress had
become the sole herald of eternal truths melancholy and mourning took
possession of his soul with an iron grip he could conceive of only one
happiness death closely following on birth but the thought of death
again was seized and symbolised with the old artistic passion
     and cleansed by fire i shall live for ever
     and as the flames are soaring to the sky
     i changed and purified shall soar to heaven
     oh blissful day when in a single flash
     time slips away into eternity
     the sun no longer rides across the skies
michelangelo was conscious of his near kinship with dante he
illustrated a copy of the divine comedy which unfortunately is lost
and wrote a poem on dante in which the following lines occur
     were i but he born for like lingering pains
     against his exile coupled with his good
     id gladly change the worlds inheritage
                          transl by ja symonds
the paintings in the sistine chapel with their materialised thoughts of
destiny retribution and eternity originated in a feeling akin to the
feeling underlying the divine comedy both here and there the creation
of celestial and infernal spirits was the outcome of the infinite
longing of the artistic imagination both men could spend the human and
creative passions with which their souls were thrilled only on the
supreme and universal the eternal destiny of man fate sin the
futility of all earthly things the relationship of the world to god
love surpassing all human limits and aspiring to the eternalthese are
the common objects over which they brooded but while it was given to
dante to create his picture of the world in harmony with his own soul
and account it a true representation of the worldsystem while his
world was a definite place with a beginning and an end and his
lifework remained in harmony with his own soul and the universe
michelangelos lacerated soul could find peace only in the ultimate
truth which filled his heart and to which he yearned to give plastic
life only to be unsatisfied after achieving it george simmel in a
profound work draws our attention to the infinite melancholy which
overshadows all michelangelos figures because his genius aspired to
express the inexpressible even the supremest plastic representation of
the passion and longing for the transcendental which thrilled his soul
did not satisfy him this tragedy is the tragedy of the metaphysical
erotic overflowing its own specific domain dantes faith in the
absolute value of his work and in the truth of the consummation of his
love in eternitywhich was the sustaining power of his liferemained
unshaken but michelangelo lost his faith in his work art and love
forsook him and withdrew into a transcendental world which he could
divine but could not grasp his faith was no blissful certainty he
knew no more than the dark aspect of things the imperfection of even
the sublimest of his art and his love
shakespeares genius could breathe life into all things human and he
found satisfaction in doing so michelangelos creative plastic power
seemed illimitable he possessed all the gifts an artist could possibly
have but from year to year his conviction of the futility of all
earthly things grew to a profounder certainty he had knocked at the
iron gate of humanity with his hammer and his chisel they had broken
into fragments and sorrow made him dumb there is a stage in the life of
every genius when he comes to this gate when he has to show his
credentials and reveal the inmost kernel of his being dante attempted
to grasp the transcendental in one gigantic vision goethe timidly
shrank back from it
in examining the prophets and youths in the sistine chapel or the
chained men in the louvre who seem unable to bear existence and are
therefore slaves of the earth or in contemplating the halffinished
slaves in the boboli gardens who seem almost to burst the stone in
their wild longing for a higher life or in reading his last sonnets we
can conceive a vague idea of the deep melancholy darkening the life of
this man a gloom which was not the melancholy of the individual but of
all humanity unable and unwilling to deceive itself further can there
be a greater tragedy than the tragedy of this incomparable artist
looking back at the work of his lifetime with despair
     for art and wit and passion fade and vanish
     countless achievements ever new and great
     are naught but dross within the sight of heaven
to vasari he sent a sonnet denouncing the artistic passion which
abandons itself completely to art
     now know i well that that fond phantasy
     which made my soul the worshipper and thrall
     of earthly art is vain
                          transl by ja symonds
faith is to him the mercy of mercies for he has never possessed its
deepest conviction
but the passion which burned in him remained unquelled to the last his
soul is torn between love and the thought of death
     flames of love
     and chill of death are battling in my heart
he longed to break away from love and find peace and he called on death
for delivery but in vain
     burdened with years and full of sinfulness
     with evil customs grown inveterate
     both deaths i dread that both before me wait
     yet feed my heart on poisonous thoughts no less
                          transl by ja symonds
and later on he thanks love again for being his deliverer and not
death
michelangelo poured all his heart into these last sonnets we see his
solitary and heroic age overshadowed by the thought of death his whole
soul is wrapped in gloom art is vanity love is sorrow the thought of
the futility of all things frames the portrait of his love with a wreath
of black laurel he ponders on his life and comes to the conclusion
that
     among the many years not one was his
this man the supremest creative genius the world has known accused
himself of having wasted his life
no song of praise ever rose to the deity from michelangelos heart as
it did at least once or twice during his lifetime from the heart of
beethoven he never had one hour of true inward peace he represents the
metaphysical worldfeeling which in addition to love is the foundation
of the deification of woman but it has grown into immensity and has
been lifted to a higher plane not only love but all life is felt as
fragmentary and pointing to a world beyond if at an earlier stage it
was the love of woman which could not find its consummation on earth it
is now the whole of our earthly life and all our aspirations which can
only attain to their highest meaning and to final truth in a
metaphysical existence the tragedy of metaphysical love has deepened
into the supreme tragedy of life

chapter iii
perversions of metaphysical eroticism
a the brides of christ
hitherto i have confined myself to the analysis of the emotional life of
man but there are two other points which must be taken into account
the first is the question of womans attitude towards the lofty position
assigned to her by man the second and more important one is the
question as to whether the women of that period exhibit in their
emotional life any traces of a feeling akin to the deification of their
sex the reply to the first question is simple enough naturally the
adoration and worship of their lovers could not have been anything but
pleasant to women there is a poem by the talented provenal countess
beatrix de die which betrays genuine sorrow at the infidelity of her
friend and at the same time leaves no doubt that sheand probably a
great many otherstook the eulogies showered upon them by the
enraptured poets literally once again woman accepts the position
thrust upon her by man not this time the position of a drudge but that
of a perfect and godlike being countess beatrix credits herself with
all the qualities with which the imagination of her worshipper had
endowed her as if they were unquestionable facts
     hence all my songs will be with sadness fraught
     my lover fills my soul with bitter woe
     and yet is all the happiness i know
     my grace and favour all avail me naught
     my sparkling wit my loveliness supreme
     they cannot hold his love and tender thought
     of all my lofty worth bereft i seem
but far more interesting than this psychological misunderstanding on the
part of the muchlauded sex is the question as to whether the emotional
life of woman matured anything that can be called a worship of man the
answer to this is a decided no at no time in the history of woman do
we find even the smallest indication of a parallel phenomenon the
profound and tragic dualism of the middle agesone result of which was
the spiritual love of womanpassed her by without touching her in the
feminine soul conflict apparently results not in tragedy and
productivity but in morbidness and hysteria
it may be argued that the love of jesus which inspired both the nuns of
the middle ages and those of a later period represents a type of
manworship but in examining all these more or less famous nuns and
ascetics we find instead of genuine spirituality a concealed and often
morbid condition which in some cases degenerated into hysteria the
dualistic period the age of metaphysical love made no impression upon
the female soul there can be no doubt that the emotional life of woman
in strict contrast to the emotional life of man has had no evolution
and can therefore have no history it is unadulterated nature and in
its way it is perfect
in studying the female mystics we find an imitation of metaphysical
eroticism sufficiently transparent to be easily recognised even by the
layman as belonging to the domain of pathology these ecstatics were
animated not by a pure but by an impure spirit perverted sensualists
they believed their hearts to be filled with spiritual love contrary to
the striving of the greater number of the men who raised their love
into heaven so as to keep it pure and made it one with their religious
aspirations all the figures and symbols of religion were used by these
women as an outlet and a foil to their sexuality the loving soul
repairing to the nuptial chamber is the transparent veil of desire
halfconcealed by religious conceptions women have described similar
situations in metaphors whichfor sensuous passionleave nothing to be
desired even the famous lovepotion of tristan is not wanting
the material is abundant and i have repeatedly touched upon it in
previous chapters at the period of great mystical enthusiasm the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries this morbid love of god was a sinister
attendant phenomenon of true mysticism whole convents were seized by
epidemics of hysteria the women writhed in convulsions flogged each
other sang hymns day and night and had hallucinationsfor all of which
the love of god or the temptation of the devil were made responsible
among the more notable of these pseudomystics are christine ebner the
author of a book entitled on the fullness of mercy and mary of
oignies a passionate worshipper of christ who mutilated herself in her
ecstasies and who on her deathbed still sang how beautiful art thou
oh my lord god
a shining exception among the german nuns of that time was mechthild of
magdeburg a woman of rare gifts she was a genuine mystic but she
too revelled in fervent sensuous metaphors and it would be an
interesting task to separate the two elements in her case but having
admitted her genuine mysticism in a previous chapter i will here
restrict myself to a few quotations which show her from her other side
her dialogue between love and the soul abounds in passages like the
following tell my beloved that his chamber is prepared and that i am
sick with love of him the closer the embrace the sweeter the
kisses then he took the soul into his divine arms and placing his
fatherly hand on her bosom he gazed into her face and kissed her right
well mechthild too was ready to die with love
everyone of the most celebrated brides of christ belonged to the latin
race they were hysterics and as such have long been claimed by the
psychopathist
the love of jesus professed by catherine of siena 13471388 a clever
politician who was in correspondence with the leading statesmen of her
time found vent in passages like the following
i desire then that you withdraw into the open side of the son of god
who is a bottle so full of perfume that even the things which are sinful
become fragrant there the bride reclines on a bed of fire and blood
there the secret of the heart of the son of god is revealed and made
manifest oh thou overflowing cup refreshing and intoxicating every
loving and yearning heart i long to behold the body of my lord and
straightway the bridegroom appeared to her opened his side and said to
her now drink as much of my blood as thou desirest
but the saint who enjoyed the greatest famepartly on account of her
frequent portrayal by the plastic artswas doubtless st teresa
teresia de jesus a spanish nun 15151582 during childhood and
early youth she suffered from serious illnesses and on one occasion was
even believed to be dead before i felt the presence of god she says
in her biography i experienced for some time a very delightful
sensation a sensation which i believe one is partly able to produce at
will  a pleasure which is neither quite sensuous nor quite
spiritual but which comes from god she describes in her life four
stages of prayer which gradually lead the soul to god there is no joy
to be compared with the joy which the lord giveth to the soul in its
exile so great is this delight that frequently it seems that the least
thing would make it forsake the body for ever when the soul seeks god
in this way the saint feels with supreme delight her strength ebbing
away and a trance stealing over her until devoid of breath and all
physical strength she can only move her hand with great pain the
delights experienced by her are described in great detail and very
sensuous language hysterical conditions such as painful convulsions
and hallucinations are represented as religious phenomena it is
dreadful what one has to suffer from confessors who do not understand
these things she says in one of her writings with deep regret
st teresa relates her life with the wellknown longwinded
selfcomplacency of the hysterical subject she frequently had visions
of jesus and again and again she emphasised the beauty of his hands
standing by my side he said to me i have come to thee my daughter
i am here it is i show me thy hands and it seemed to me that he took
my hands in his and laid them in his side behold my wound he said
thou art not separated from me bear this brief exile on earth
etc
on one occasion she had a vision of an angel whom she describes as
follows he was not tall but small very beautiful his face so radiant
that he seemed to be one of the highest angels who are i believe all
fire  in his hand he held a golden spear at the point of which was a
little flame he appeared to thrust this spear into my heart again and
again it penetrated my entrails and as he drew it out he seemed to
draw them out also and leave me on fire with a great love of god the
pain was so intense that i could not but sigh deeply yet so surpassing
was the sweetness of this pain that it made me wish never to be without
it it is not physical but spiritual pain although the body often
suffers greatly from it the caressing love between god and the soul is
so sweet that i implore him of his mercy to let all those experience it
who believe that i am lying
the treatise thoughts of the love of god on some words of the song of
songs is crowded with purely sensuous passages in accordance with the
general custom she interprets this navely sensual semitic poem
allegorically becomes tremendously excited in meditating on the kiss of
the beloved and discusses the question of what the soul should do to
satisfy so sweet a bridegroom
in the pamphlet the fortress of the soul and its seven dwellings st
teresa describes similar states of mind the bridegroom commands the
doors of the dwellings to be closed and also the gates of the fortress
and its surrounding walls in freeing the soul from the body he stops
the bodys breathing so that even if the other senses are not quite
deadened speech is impossible at other times all sensuous perceptions
disappear simultaneously body and hands grow rigid and it seems as if
the soul had left the body which is scarcely breathing this condition
is of short duration the rigidity passes away to some extent the body
slowly regains life the breath comes and goes only to die away again
and thus endow the soul with greater freedom but this deep trance does
not endure long she continues to describe her ecstasies and is careful
to point out the complete fusion of supreme delight and bodily pain
perhaps no hysterical subject has ever described her states of mind so
well her avowal made in a letter to father rodrigue alvarez of her
complete unconsciousness of her body is quite in harmony with those
states of rapture she wrote a number of spiritual lovesongs which are
said to be conspicuous for their ardour and beauty probably they have
never been translated from the original spanish
finally there is the famous madame guyon 16481717 whoin addition
to many other workswrote a very detailed autobiography she lived with
her husband whom she treated with coldness finding her sole joy in her
spiritual intercourse with god i desire only the divine love which
thrills the soul with inexpressible bliss the love which seems to melt
my whole being god burns her with his fire and still trembling with
delight she says to him oh lord the greatest libertine if thou
didst make him experience thy love as thou didst make me experience it
would forswear carnal pleasure and strive only after thy divine love
i was like a person intoxicated with wine or love unable to think of
anything but my passion etc the fact that she sought in this love the
pleasure of the senses is very apparent
we are not concerned here with the problem of how far these women may be
regarded as pathological cases all of them were filled with a vague
feminine desire for selfsurrender which they projected on a celestial
being either because they did not come into contact with a suitable
terrestrial object or because the impulse was abnormal from the
beginning but their spiritual love never rose above empty
sentimentality and hysterical rapture all of them and some of them
were highly gifted were thrilled with the love of jesus they had
visions of the sweet wounds of the saviour and so on but their
emotion did not kindle the smallest spark of creative power the queen
of heaven on the other hand was a free creation of spiritually loving
poets and monks
the women imitated metaphysical love and distorted it sexual impulse
arrogantly attempting to reach beyond the earth reigned in the place of
spiritual deifying love
i have included these phenomena not for their own sakes but to indicate
my boundaryline for very frequently these women are cited as genuine
mystics even schopenhauer mentions these saints in one breath with
german mystics and indian philosophers he calls madame guyon a great
and beautiful soul whose memory i venerate and yet there can be no
doubt that it is not the fictitious object of love which is conclusive
but the emotion of the lover the sensualist can approach god and the
virgin with inflamed senses but to the lover every woman is divine
the result of this chapter is as far as our investigation is concerned
negative the deifying love of man has no parallel phenomenon in the
emotional life of woman
b sexual mystics
sexual mysticism is a contradiction in itself because true mysticism
has nothing whatever to do with sexuality but frequently suppressed
sexuality secretly luxuriating takes possession of the whole soul and
a religious construction is put on the results the sexually excited
subject attributes religious motives to his ecstasy i have no
hesitation in asserting that the majority of these ecstasiesespecially
in the case of womenare rooted in sexuality and that this socalled
mysticism is nothing but a deviation or wrong interpretation of the
sexual impulse the same thing applies to the flagellants of the
declining middle ages and some protestant sects of modernity the
raptures of st teresa and madame guyon also belong to this category
however much the fact may be concealed by pseudoreligious conceptions
i have no doubt that eastern mysticism too grew up on a sexual
foundation but as i have done all along i will limit my subject to
the civilisation of europe
this counterfeit mysticism fed from dubious sources and calling itself
love of god taints the pure intuitions of some of the genuine mystics
and metaphysical erotics they were not always able to steer clear of
spurious outgrowths here too the psychological navet of mediaeval
times must to some extent be held responsible conspicuous amongst
these is st bernard of clairvaux who in his sermones in canticum
took the song of songs as a base for mysticallysexual imaginings
there is nothing really new in this direction but i will cite a few
stanzas written by st bernard which might equally well have come from
one of the amorous nuns
           to the sidewound of christ
     lord with my mouth i touch and worship thee
     with all the strength i have i cling to thee
     with all my love i plunge my heart in thee
     my very life blood would i draw from thee
     oh jesus jesus draw me unto thee
     how sweet thy savour is who tastes of thee
     oh jesus christ can relish naught but thee
     who tastes thy living sweetness lives by thee
     all else is void the soul must die for thee
     so faints my heartso would i die for thee
                   transl by emily mary shapcote
the greatest religious poet of all times after st bernard was jacopone
da todi who also though rarely revelled in fervid utterances the
latin hymn stabat mater speciosa ascribed to him is spurious i
quote a translation taken from the rosary of the bvm
     other virgins far transcending
     virgin be not thou unbending
     to thy humble suppliants suit
     grant me then to thee united
     by the love of christ excited
     here to sing my jubilee
but he is undoubtedly the author of the following stanzas
     soaring upwards loveenkindled
     does the soul rejoice afire
     in her glad triumphant flight
     earthly cares to naught have dwindled
     loves sweet footfalls drawing nigh her
     to espouse his hearts delight
     all transformed and naked quite
     laughing low with joy imbued
     pure and like a snake renewed
     love divine will ever tend her
but poems like the following undoubtedly originated in a truly religious
and pure sentiment
     enwrapt in love thine arms him fast enfolding
     so closely clasp him that they loose him never
     and in thy heart his sacred image holding
     far from the path of sin thoult journey ever
     his death in twain shall blast thy callous heart
     as once the solid rock he rent apart
the most distinguished among the fervid lovers of god of later times
were the saints jean de la croix alfonso da liguori and franois de
sales the tract of the love of god written by franois de sales
surpasses everything ever achieved in this direction
i will not dilate further on this barren aspect of emotionalism so
easily traceable through the later centuries in many a catholic and
protestant sentimentalist but will conclude this chapter with a brief
discussion of novalis if i mention this poet in this connexion it is
not because i desire to depreciate his genius but because possessing
as he did in a rare degree depth of feeling and power of expression
he is an important witness of an unusual type true here and there his
poems are reminiscent of jacopone but he is not sufficiently ingenuous
and is altogether too morbid to be classed with that ardent fanatic he
shares with jacopone and other poets the yearning to grasp
transcendental things with the senses to approach the deity with a love
which cannot be called anything but sensuous novalis hymns to the
night are the most magnificent example of this perfect interpenetration
of sensuous and transcendental love and at the same time represent a
complete fusion of the love he bore to his fiance who died young and
the worship of mary night has opened infinite eyes in us and we
behold the secret of love unfolding itself in the heart of this poet at
once unique and pathetic lofty and morbid the whole universe he
conceives as a female being for whose embrace he is longing it is a new
emotion neither the chaste worship of the madonna nor the
sexuallymystic striving to embrace with the soul the night gives birth
to a foreboding which excites and soothes all vague desires the lover
thus soliloquises of the night
     in infinite space
     thoudst dissolve
     if it held thee not
     if it bound thee not
     and thrilled thee
     that afire
     thou begettest the world
     verily before thou art i was
     with my sex
     the mother sent me
     to live in thy world
     and to hallow it
     with love
here the ancient mystical longing to become one with god is conceived
under the symbol of the night a symbol which we shall meet again
magnified in wagners tristan
     lo love has burst its prison
     no parting now shall be
     and lifes full tide has risen
     like to a boundless sea
     one night of love supernal
     only one golden song
     and the face of the eternal
     to light our path along
in addition novalis was a perfect womanworshipper he loved the middle
ages and catholicism the reformation killed christianity henceforth
christianity has ceased to exist catholicism preached nothing but
love for the holy beautiful lady of christianity who endowed with
divine virtue was able to deliver all loyal hearts from the most
terrible dangers he wrote hymns to mary in the style of the pietists
emphasising more especially the principle of motherliness
     oh mary at thy altar
     a thousand hearts lie prone
     in this drear life of shadows
     they yearn for thee alone
     all hoping to recover
     from lifes distress and smart
     if thou oh holy mother
     wilt take them to thy heart
he idolised his fiance who died young her memory shall be my better
self a sacred image in my heart before which a sanctuary lamp is ever
burning and which will save me from the temptations of the evil one
and through the mouth of heinrich of ofterdingen he proclaims my
beloved is the abbreviation of the universe the universe is the
elongation of my beloved heaven has given you to me to worship i
adore you you are a saint you are divine glory you are eternal life
this sentimental worship of woman combined with an alltranscending
insatiable sensuousness produced the peculiar sexuallymystic
worldfeeling which is so characteristic of him night deeply moves his
soul longing the memory of the beloved woman adoration for the
virgin his fantastic conception of an incarnated universe are fused
into one great emotion
     praise to the queen of the world
     the lofty herald
     of the sacred world
     the patroness
     of rapturous love
     thou art coming beloved
     night has descended
     my soul is ravished
     over is this earthly journey
     and thou art mine again
     i gaze into thy dark deep eyes
     and see naught but love and happiness
     we sink down on the altar of the night
     the soft couch
     the veil falls
     and kindled by the rapturous embrace
     glows the pure fire
     of the sweet sacrifice
the climax and unique example of sensuousness unsurpassed for its
symbols of the physical embrace is the hymn few know the secret of
love it is too long to give in full the following are a few stanzas
     would that the ocean
     blushed
     and in fragrant flesh
     melted the rock
     infinite is the sweet repast
     never satisfied is love
     nor close nor fast enough
     can it hold the beloved
     by ever more tender lips
     transformed the past ecstasy
     grows closer more intimate
     rapturous love
     thrills the soul
     hungrier and thirstier
     grows the heart
     and thus the transports of love
     endure for ever
here the remotest limit has been reachedsensuousness seems to flow
into eternity voluptuousness would shatter the world to pieces and
create a new relationship of things before this poem all ecstasies of
sensuousness masquerading as cosmic emotion are dull and timid the
transcendent symbols of catholicism are used to guide the insatiable
sensuous imagination to metaphysics who can say that he understands
the nature of blood novalis may ask this question it is truly blood
human blood longing to gush forth and pulsate through the body of the
universe
     in time to come all will be body
     one body
     in celestial blood
     float the enraptured twain
the human blood has become celestial blood the voluptuousness of man
the voluptuousness of the world and because the whole world is one
body it needs no duality sexuality which has become a cosmic law rules
over humanity god christ and the universe this hymn is the
immortalisation of voluptuousness if the lovedeath is the
immortalisation of love unable to find satisfaction on earth so its
counterpart cosmic sensuousness is in the last sense orientalism
only a genius could invent a new symbolic language to express feelings
so alien to the european earthly sensuality did not satisfy novalis
voluptuousness detached from man voluptuousness in itself was his
dream and his religionthe supremest creation ever achieved by
sexuality intensified into a cosmic emotion
i think that i have now made clear the fact that the emotional life of
man is rooted in two elements completely distinct from the beginning
the sexual impulse and personal love it is in studying the love of the
transcendental that culminating point of so many feelings springing
from various sources that the inherent contrast between the two
fundamental principles becomes most apparent and that we realise why
they have always been intermingled both in theory and in reality
we have last examined the attempt of sexuality to possess itself of the
whole universe we will now turn our attention to the true union of both
erotic elements this union occurred at the time when goethe and novalis
were bringing spiritual love and cosmic sensuousness to their highest
summit
the third stage
the unity of sexual impulse and love
chapter i
the longing for the synthesis
humanity inherited the pairinginstinct from the animalworld but as
differentiation progressed this instinct tended to restrict itself to a
few individualssometimes even to a single representative onlyof the
other sex in the beginning of the twelfth century a new and
unprecedented emotionspiritual love of man for woman based on
personalitymade its appearance and until modern times the two
fundamental erotic principles existed side by side without inner
relationship sexuality with its various manifestations has existed from
the beginning the ultimate object of sexual intercourse is pleasure
but here and there and parallel with sexual pleasure there have been
in varying degrees of intensity instances of spiritual love in the
second half of the eighteenth century there appearedtimidly at first
but gradually gaining in strength and determinationa tendency to find
the sole course of every erotic emotion in the personality of the
beloved a longing no longer to dissociate sexual impulse and spiritual
love but to blend them in a harmonious whole personality should knit
body and soul together in a higher synthesis the first signs of this
longing became apparent in the period of the french revolution we find
traces of it in the works of rousseau and in goethes werther it was
developed by the romanticists and represents the typical form of modern
love with all its incompleteness and inexhausted possibilities the
achievement of this eagerly desired unity which would be synonymous
with the victory of personality over the limitations of body and soul
is the great problem of modern time in the domain of eroticism the
characteristic of this third stage of eroticism is the complete triumph
of love over pleasure the neutralisation of the sexual and the
generative by the spiritual and the personal the physical and spiritual
unity of the lovers has become so much supreme erotic reality that the
line of demarcation between soul and senses is completely obliterated
in extreme caseswhich are not at all rarethe bodily union is not
realised as anything distinct specifically pleasurable it does not
occupy a prominent position in the complex of love sensuous pleasure
the universal inheritance from the animal world has been vanquished by
personality the supreme treasure of man the characteristic of the
first stage was the unquestioned sway of one of the elements of erotic
life sensual gratification this stage has of course never ceased to
exist as well as the aesthetic pleasure in the beauty of the human
form the second stage gave prominence to all those spiritual qualities
which were most appreciated virtue purity kindness wisdom etc
because love rouses and embraces everything in the human soul which is
perfect in the third stage sensuous pleasure and spiritual love no
longer exist as separate elements the personality of the beloved in its
individuality is the only essential regardless as to whether she be the
bringer of weal or woe whether she be good or evil beautiful or plain
wise or foolish personality hasin principlebecome the sole supreme
source of eroticism in this stage there is no tyranny of man over
womanas in the sexual stageno submission of man to womanas in the
stage of womanworship it is the stage of the complete equality of the
sexes a mutual giving and taking if sexuality is infinite as matter
spiritual love eternal as the metaphysical ideal the synthesis is human
and personal
before the eighteenth century this new erotic union did not exist as a
phenomenon of civilisation but occasionally we find it anticipated or
vaguely alluded to some of the early german minnesingers such as
dietmar von aist and krnberg sometimes betray especially when
speaking through the medium of a woman sentiments prophetic of our
modern sentimental ballads the following verses by albrecht of
johansdorf express the reciprocity characteristic of modern love
     when two hearts are so united
     that their love can never wane
     then i ween no man should blight it
     death alone should part the twain
even more modern in sentiment are the following stanzas
     this is loves measure
     two hearts and one pleasure
     two loves one love nor more nor less
     and both right full of happiness
     in woe one woe
     and neither from the other go
though walter von der vogelweide adopted the contemporaneous conception
of love as the source of everything good and noble tell me what is
love he never quite accepted it
     love is the ecstasy of two fond hearts
     if both share equally then love is there
more ancient evidence even is the definition of marriage by the
scholastic hugo of st victor who had leanings towards mysticism
marriage is the friendship between man and woman he says
my knowledge of the subject cannot of course be unexceptional but i
do not believe that personal love of the third stage that is the
blending of both erotic elements was quite definitely expressed before
the second half of the eighteenth century we may be justified in
maintaining that the tension between sexuality and spiritual love had
been slackening in the course of the centuries that sexuality was
conceived as less diabolical and love as less celestial than
heretofore but the principle had remained unchanged only the female
portraits of leonardo da vinci are deserving of special mention the
great artist was possibly the first who artistically divined if he did
not achieve the synthesis the exceptional position always granted to
his womenparticularly to his mona lisamust doubtless be ascribed to
this premonition we may be certain that leonardo not only as artist
but as lover also was ahead of his time but he must be regarded as an
isolated instance the three stages apply to the eroticism of man only
his emotion soared from brutality to divinity and then gradually became
human his feeling alone has a history the force which seized moulded
and transformed him had no influence over woman compared to man she
is today what she was at the beginning pure nature her lover has
always been everything to her never merely a means for the
gratification of the senses nor on the other hand a higher being to
whom she looked up and whom she worshipped with a purely spiritual love
but at all times he possessed her undivided love unable in its nave
simplicity to differentiate between body and soul the higher intuition
the object of the supreme erotic yearning of man for the possession of
which he has struggled for centuries and even today does not fully
possess has always been a matter of course to her she whose truest
vocation is love received from nature that which the greatest of men
have striven hard to win and only half succeeded in winning mans
profound dualism is alien to her her greatnessbut also her
limitationlies in the simplicity and infallibility of her instinct
which has had no evolution and is consequently not liable to produce
atavisms and aberrations she is hardly conscious of the chasm between
sexual instinct and personal love wherever this is not so we may
find intellectual greatness as for instance in the case of the empress
catherine of russia but as a rule we find only morbidness despondency
and callousness to the normal woman the phenomena of dualistic
eroticism appear unintelligible even unwholesome the unity of love is
a matter of course to her so that the third stage is practically male
acquiescence to female intuition
even in our time when so much is said and written about modern woman
and her claims her feeling is still perfect in itself compared to the
discord and heterogeneity of man she represents simplicity and harmony
both purely spiritual worship and undifferentiated sexual desire are
exceptions as far as she is concerned and must still be regarded as
abnormal
this unbroken determinative female eroticism may possibly be explained
as weininger explains it by womans sexuality which is absolute and
does not rise above the horizon of distinct consciousness but
weiningers dualism is in this direction attempting to value and
standardise something which in its essence is alien to his standard
psychophysical unity then is the basic characteristic of female
eroticism but the state of affairs in the case of male eroticism is a
very different one a study of the gradual origin of the erotic elements
will facilitate a better understanding of the relevant phenomena
in the case of woman the primary sexual instinct pervades the whole
being it has been refined and purified without any great fluctuations
or changes in the case of man it has always been restricted to certain
regions of his physical and psychical life and an entirely novel
experience was required before it could win to the final form of
personal love this prize in his case is therefore enhanced by the
fact of being the outcome of a long conflict the reward of a task still
showing the traces of the struggle and pain of centuries the truth of
the words pleasure is degrading had been established by experience
a few historical instances illustrating female eroticism will uphold
my contention in the remote days of greek antiquity we find an example
of undivided wifely love in alcestis whose devotion to her husband sent
her to voluntary death in order to lengthen his life wifely devotion
accomplished what parental love could not achieve the alcestis of
euripides represents a feeling very familiar to us penelope the
faithful martyr is a similar instance
at the time when spiritual love accompanied by eccentricities and latin
treatises gradually and amidst heavy conflict struggled into
existence the soul of woman was already glowing with the emotion which
we today realise as love i have three witnesses to prove this
statement the lais of the french poetess marie de france based on
breton and celtic motifs are permeated by a sweet sentimentality very
nearly related to the sentiment of our popular ballads they tell of
simple feelings of love and longing and the grief of love one of her
lais treats the touching story of lanval and guinevere and another an
episode of tristan and isolde
     de tristan et de la reine
     de leur amour qui tant fut fine
     dont ils eurent mainte doulour
     puis en moururent en un jour
the nave sentiment of these poems forms a delicious contrast to the
contemporaneous mature and subtile art of provence and the entire
erudite armoury of love
a great baron declared that only the man who could carry his daughter in
his arms to the summit of a certain mountainan impossible
featshould win her hand in marriage no man possessed strength to
carry her farther than half way but the knight whom she loved secretly
went out into the world and after years of searching discovered a
magic potion able to endow him who quaffed it with enormous strength
full of joy he returned home and his beloved in his arms began the
laborious ascent strong and jubilant he laughed at the potion but
after a while feeling his strength ebbing away the maiden implored
him drink i beseech thee beloved my heart is strong to drink
were waste of time and again she pleaded drink now beloved thy
strength is diminishing fast but he eager to win her only by his own
effort staggered on and reached the summit only to sink to the ground
and expire the maiden throwing herself on his lifeless body kissed
his eyes and lips and died with him
we recognise in this simple tale the new form of love mutual devotion
and the thought of the consummation of this love the lovedeath
which was not definitely realised until six hundred years later it
originated in the celtic soul as the worship of woman originated in the
romanesque the teutonic soul shared in the development of both it was
a dream of the suppressed celtic race spending its whole soul in dreams
and producing visions of such depth and beauty that even we of today
cannot read them without being profoundly moved
next there are three loveletters written in latin by a german woman of
the twelfth century in very touching words she tells her lover that the
love of him can never be torn out of her heart i turn to you whom i
hold for ever enclosed in my inmost heart she promises and claims
faithfulness until death among thousands my heart has chosen you you
alone can satisfy my longing and you will never find my love wanting i
trust myself to you all my hope is centred in you i could say a great
deal more she concludes but there is no need of it and then
follow the charming german stanzas
     thou to me and i to thee
     knit for all eternity
     in my heart art thou imprisoned
     and i threw away the key
     nevermore canst thou be free
in the third letter she drops the formal latin and addresses him in
intimate simple german but the mans replies are clumsy and strange
and plainly evidence his uncertainty of himself you have put a human
head on a horses neck and the beautiful female form ends in an ugly
fishs tail it looks as if a parting were inevitable
but the most touching testimony from the middle ages is the famous love
story of ablard and hlose we probably possess no older document of
the passionate devotion of a woman differing in nothing from the
sentiment of the present age than the letters of hlose ablard
persuaded her to take the veil and repent in a convent the sin of
voluptuousnessbut she knows nothing of godher whole soul is wrapped
up in her lover i expect no reward from god for what i did was not
done for love of him i wanted nothing from you but yourself i
desired only you not that which belonged to you i did not expect
marriage or gifts i did not seek to gratify my desires and do my will
but yours and well you know that i am speaking the truth the name of
wife may seem sacred and honourable to you but i prefer to be called
your mistress or even your harlot the more i degraded myself for your
sake the more i hoped to find grace in your eyes i renounced all
the pleasures of the world to live only for you i kept nothing for
myself but the desire to belong entirely to you ablards replies are
pious sermons and theological treatises he thinks of the love of the
past only as the cursed desires of the flesh the snare in which the
devil had caught them and urges hlose to thank god that henceforth
they are safe my love which entangled both of us in sin he says in
one of his letters deserves not the name of love for it was naught
but carnal lust i sought in you the gratification of my sinful
desires etc he blessed the savage crime committed on him because it
saved him for ever from the sin of voluptuousness what hlose loved
and treasured as her sweetest memory was to him hell and devils work
he wrote to her almost as if in mockery what splendid interest does
the talent of your wisdom bear to the lord day after day how many
spiritual daughters you have borne to him what a terrible loss it would
have been if you had abandoned yourself to the lust of the flesh had
borne with travail a few earthly children while now with joy you
bear a great number of daughters for the kingdom of heaven you would
have remained a woman like all the rest but now you are far exalted
even above men this correspondence plainly reveals the tragedy of the
lacerated man of the middle ages as compared to the nevervarying
woman emerging perfect from the hands of nature a long and toilsome
road still stretches out before him she had reached the goal without a
struggle at the outset how strange is this cry of a mediaeval nun it
seems as if the world had grown old as if all men and all living
creatures had lost their freshness as if love had grown cold not in
many but in all hearts
what was really the final cause of the hostility to sensuousness
displayed by dualistic mediaeval christianity was it not contained in
eroticism itself
this hostility was based on the fact that the world knew as yet only
spiritual love and its antithesis the sexuality which man shares with
the animals the only salvation not merely in the christian sense but
from the point of view of every lofty conception of civilisation lay in
the victory over animalism the contempt of and the struggle against
the lower form of eroticism animating the dualistic period was
absolutely consistent asceticism represents the highest form of culture
attainable by that period the rejection of spiritual love was an
inconsistency on the part of the clergy the principle of personality
was the fundamental principle of christianity this is clearly expressed
by the fact that christianity regarded the soul as the supreme value
and what is the soul but the consciousness of human personality
conceived navely as substance in the light of this higher intuition
sensuousness was bound to appear base and degrading
it is therefore historically correct though essentially an error to
regard christianity as the religion of asceticism for the asceticism of
the middle ages was nothing but the immature stage of the principle of
personality directly spiritual love was no longer in opposition to
sexuality directly a synthesis had been effected christianity should
have drawn the obvious conclusion from its fundamental principle and
acknowledged love which united the hostile elements protestantism did
so halfheartedly luthers vacillating attitude towards sexuality is
typical of this indecision at heart he could not justify sexuality he
regarded it in the same way as did the fathers of the church as an
evil with which one had to make terms his sanction of marriage was
nothing but a crooked and illfounded compromise and as he remained at
the old dualistic standpoint it could not have been otherwise but the
moment the new sensuoussupersensuous form of love had come into
existence it behoved christianity as the religion of personality to
acknowledge it
after this digression i return to the period of the inception of the
third stage of love if i were writing a history of eroticism i should
now have to describe the rococo period a period essentially
rationalistic and devoted to pleasure a period which believed in
nothing but the obvious and understood love only in the sense of sensual
pleasure if sensuality had hitherto been evilat least
theoreticallyit now became obscene stripped of every grand and cosmic
feature it degenerated into the principal form of amusement the
eighteenth century though instructive and interesting to the student of
eroticism produced nothing new under the undisputed sway of france a
period of sensuality set in unparalleled by any other epoch in the
history of the race except perhaps the early oriental epoch even the
gynecocratic family of remote antiquity was openly revived by the ladies
of paris casanova was the sexual hero of the age as he is to some
extent the hero of our present impotent epoch indefatigable in the
pursuit of woman and successful until old age he was a wellbred
sexualist without subtlety or depth the vicomte de valmont the hero of
choderlos de laclos famous and realistic novel les liaisons
dangereuses an absolutely cold and cunning seducer was its god they
were seconded by the pleasureloving ninon de lenclos who was still
desired at the age of eighty
this ultrarefinement was followed by the loathing of civilisation and
love of nature expressed by rousseau werther and hlderlin closely
allied to these passions was sentimental love the direct precursor of
our modern conception of love its peculiarity lay in the fact that
although spiritual in its source it yearned for psychophysical unity
and was therefore always slightly discordant rousseau was the first
exponent of this romantic nature cult and sentimental love of woman he
represents the sharp recoil from the frivolity of the ancien rgime
and the beginning of the third stage of love his nouvelle hlose
1759 was probably the first work in which sentimental love found
expression in goethes werther 1774 which is a faithful portrayal
of the poets personal feelings it was represented more powerfully
werthers love was purely spiritual at its inception lotte is sacred
to me all desire is silent in her presence but in the end he desires
her with unconquerable passion a dream undeceives him about the nature
of his feelings and as he clasps her in a passionate embrace he is
conscious of having reached the summit of his longing this would seem
the goal of modern love embodying all its previous stages it is
interesting to find embodiments of the extreme poles in two incidental
characters one has been driven mad by his adoring love for a woman and
wanders about the fields in november to gather flowers for his queen
the other is a young peasant who kills his rival in jealous rage but
werther himself steering a middlecourse between these two extremes
walks straight into modern love which means death to him
both the new hlose and werther are sentimentally efforts to
reach the synthesis via the soul friedrich schlegel in his famous
lucinda 1799 tried the opposite way he has been savagely attacked
for it by one side and lauded to the skies by the other and when the
emancipation of the flesh became the motto of the day he was glorified
as a martyr the philosopher and theologian schleiermacher saw in
lucinda a delivery from the tyranny of centuries love has become
whole again and of one piece he exclaims joyfully calling the poem a
vision of a future world god knows how distant love shall come again
a new life shall unite and animate its broken limbs it shall rule the
hearts and works of men in freedom and gladness and supersede the
lifeless phantoms of fictitious virtues schleiermacher also voiced the
idea of the synthesis and why should we be arrested in this struggle
ie between love as the flower of sensuousness and the intellectual
mystical component of love when in all domains we are striving to
bring the ideas born by the new development of humanity into harmony
with the result of the work of past ages his confidential letters on
schlegels lucinda have made the protestant pastor schleiermacher the
philosopher of the third stage of eroticism as the chaplain andreas was
the theorist of the second the third stage gained its first footing
amongst the german romanticists women were largely instrumental in
achieving its victory i will not go into detail but will confine myself
to mentioning in passing the names of jean paul henrietta herz
brentano sophy mereau dorothy vest schelling friedrich gentz w von
humboldt records a conversation which he had in the year of the
revolution with schiller the latter unhesitatingly professed his faith
in the unity of love it the blending of love and sensuality is
always possible and always there but humboldt was diffident unable
fully to grasp the new conception i said that it would sever the most
beautiful most delicate relationships that it was too heterogeneous to
admit of coherence but my principal argument was that in the majority
of cases it was out of the question
there is a document from the year 1779 which contains in its entirety
the modern conception of harmonious love together with its ecstatic
apotheosis the lovedeath a document which puts the later theorising
romanticists and lucinda completely in the shade i am referring to
the only one of gottfried august brgers letters to molly which has
been preserved it contains the following passages i cannot describe
to you in words how ardently i embrace you in the spirit there is in me
such a tumult of life that frequently after an outburst my spirit and
soul are left in such weariness that i seem to be on the point of death
every brief calm begets more violent storms often in the black darkness
of a stormy rainy midnight i long to hasten to you throw myself into
your arms sink with you into the infinite ocean of delight anddie oh
love oh love what a strange and wonderful power art thou to hold body
and soul in such unbreakable bonds i let my imagination roam through
the whole world yea through all the heavens and the heaven of heavens
and examine every delight and compare it to you but by the eternal god
there is nothing i desire so ardently as to hold you sweetest and
heavenliest of all women in my arms if i could win you by walking
round the earth naked and barefoot through thorns and thistles over
rocks and snow and ice and on the point of death with the last spark
of life sink into your arms and draw new life and happiness from your
loving bosom i should consider that i bought you for a trifle
to adduce more historical evidence of modern love would serve no
purpose in the next chapter i shall discuss its metaphysical
consummation the lovedeath but i will briefly point out the not quite
obvious difference between synthetic love and sexuality projected on a
specific individual in several of the higher animals the sexual
instinct is to some extent individualised but nevertheless it is no
more than instinct seeking a suitable mate for its gratification all
the wellknown theories of sexual attraction from schopenhauer to
weininger accounting love as nothing but a mutual supplementing of two
individuals for the purpose of the best possible reproduction of the
species do not apply to love in the modern sense but to the sexual
impulse they completely disregard the individual and are only aware of
the species they apprehend individualisation as an instrument in the
service of the race but genuine personal love is not kindled by
instinct it is not differentiated sexual impulse it embraces the
psychophysical unity of the beloved without being conscious of sexual
desire it shares with the purely spiritual love the eagerness of man to
raise and glorify the beloved woman without ulterior motive or desire
this distinction may be called hairsplitting and i admit that it is
frequently impossible to make it in practice but it is important in
principle because it goes back to origins and finds in the metaphysical
climax of the third stage the lovedeath its practical antigeneric
proof but with all this it is of common occurrence that spiritual and
sensual love are at different times projected on one and the same woman
schopenhauers instinct of philoprogenitiveness has today become an
article of faith with the learned and unlearned schopenhauer was the
first probably to conceive the idea that love was the consciousness of
the unconscious instincts in the service of the species and had no
other content or purpose than the will of the species to produce the
best possible offspring in a chapter of his principal work entitled
the metaphysics of love he essayed to promulgate and prove his theory
in detail all love however ethereal it may pretend to be is rooted
solely in the sexual instinct it is nothing more nor less than
specialised strictly speaking individualised sexual desire
schopenhauers conception of love does not rise above this specialised
impulse he calmly ignores all phenomena such as those i have described
because they do not fit his theory with the exception of his cheap
observation that contrasts attract each other which is the pith of all
his truths he does not adduce the smallest evidence for the truth of
his myth of the genius of the species spreading his wings over the
coming generation however much the results of breeders may be
applicable to the human species they have nothing to do with love and
the believers in the theory of the instinct of philoprogenitiveness are
silent on the subject of the best and most suitable subject for the
purpose is it the lawabiding citizen the restless reformer or the
artist and thinker strange to say the legend of the instinct of
philoprogenitiveness intuitively conscious of the right way is today
accepted even by scientists who are in sympathy neither with
schopenhauers nor with any other metaphysic it is taken for granted
that love can only serve the purpose of the species the fact that this
theory is both metaphysically and scientifically unsound is ignored for
even leaving the genius of the species out of the question his
intelligent comprehension of the composition of the next generation is
nevertheless devoutly believed in even nietzsche that
archindividualist was completely under the spell of this dogma as is
proved by many of his utterances for instance by the wellknown
socialistic definition of marriage as the will of twain to create that
which is higher than its creators and also by his theory that man is
not an end in himself but a bridge to something else nietzsches
pronouncement that he has not yet found the woman whom he would like to
be the mother of his children echoes the philosophy of schopenhauer
the superstition of the genius of philoprogenitiveness the intrinsic
worth of love without any ulterior motive without a view to pleasure or
to offspring seems to have been unknown to nietzsche schopenhauers
hero puts the purport of love not in the actual individual but in a
conception and annihilates the value of the individual and the unique
every great emotion is an end in itself and whatever we may read into
it of purposes and expediencies is an invention and independent of
the emotion itself the aim of the purely spiritual love of the second
stage was not propagation and yet it was an emotion whose loftiness
cannot easily be surpassed with the deification of woman love reached
far beyond the beloved into infinitude and the phenomenon of the
lovedeath renders all the supposed generic purpose of love impossible
but even if we ignored love altogether and admitted the existence of the
sexual instinct only its mysterious endeavour in the interest of the
species would still remain pure imagination and a conception far
inferior to that of the winged god of love the instinct does not
possess a trace of discretion takes no interest in the weal and woe
of humanity but is utterly selfish seeking its own gratification and
nothing else
the theory which fits so well into schopenhauers metaphysics has
without it neither sense nor support there is no instinct of
philoprogenitiveness but rather a pairinginstinct and in addition to
this a conscious desire for offspring the difference between these two
instincts is great for as a rule the pairinginstinct is not
accompanied by a wish for children that it should be so unconsciously
is a theory not worth considering seriously and the longing for
children very frequently exists without any sexual desire to
manufacture an instinct out of those two inherently dissimilar impulses
is fantastic metaphysics and not spiritual reality the history of
antiquity furnishes ample proof of my contention for in the days of the
remote past the sexual impulse had its special domain as well as the
wish for progeny which was often regarded in the light of a duty
the legend of the instinct of philoprogenitiveness which is today so
universally believed is undoubtedly the result of the general feeling
that sexual intercourse as such is base and degrading but because of
the more or less clear consciousness that sexual intercourse is really
what is most desired in love and because of the lack of courage openly
to admit it attempts are made to justify it from a social standpoint
the task of establishing the equilibrium between love and sensuousness
has not yet been accomplished what is so often realised as the sexual
trouble has its origin in the fact that the higher stage has not yet
been finally reached there is an infinite number of unions all of
which have a flaw witness modern literature with its indefatigable
treatment of eroticism if a complete unity is ever to be established
then doubtless it will be the privilege of the germanic race to achieve
it for the neolatin nations mean by love either the individualised
instinct or the rare purely spiritual love but it is not likely that
the third stage will become a universal condition in all probability it
will for a long time to come be limited to special individuals and
even then only to specific phases of their lives the feeling of the
great majority of men has not changed it is primitively sexual in the
state of mind which is called to be in love it is centred on an
individual woman to be after a time gradually stifled by other
interests the emotional life of the majority of women on the other
hand is still what it was in remotest antiquity love impels woman into
the arms of a man to whom she remains faithful until slowly her
instincts are transformed into love for her children but in the case
even of the average woman body and soul are equally affected there is
no more terrible moment in a womans life than the one in which she
discovers that the man to whom she has given herself has merely used her
as a means for gratification harmoniously organised woman has given
herself to a merely sexual man who sought in her only the satisfaction
of his senses this also is the cause of the horror with which the
normal woman regards the prostitute for the latter has made of herself
a means for the gratification of male sexuality losing thereby her
inherent harmony and individuality and it is also the reason why in
spite of ethical convictions and logical conclusions we should have
different standards for the loyalty of the husband and the loyalty of
the wife in man sexuality is a distinct element an element it is
true which we do not value but which nevertheless exists and has as
we have seen a historical root when a man gives way to his instincts
his individuality is not only not destroyed but it is hardly affected
it is very different in the case of the woman with her emancipated
sexuality is synonymous with inward annihilation for it has not the
support of the past and cannot exist independently a mans spiritual
annihilation from the emotional sphere is unthinkable because his
organisation is naturally heterogeneous the mere sexualist represents a
past stage of male eroticism which has been largely overcome but he is
rarely so completely under the spell of sexuality that he cannot highly
develop other parts of his entity the double morality has therefore
an objective reason though perhaps not a higher justification and
would only be unjustifiable if man had achieved a complete erotic unity
the more complicated life becomes the more numerous and complex are the
relations between individuals and groups a man is a member of a trades
union he has political artistic sporting and social relations he may
be a collector or interested in certain social phenomena etc in modern
civilisation every component part of the human personality is separated
from the entire personality and brought into a systematic connection
with similar component parts of other entities our social principle is
division of labour not only in the community but also in the
individual with one man one can talk only philosophy with another
music with a third personal matters and so on but because in this way
only one part of man and never the whole being can be satisfied at a
time the desire to expend ones whole personality in one great
achievement or in connection with another individual is increasing
exactly in proportion as specialisation is increasing in the community
and in the individual the more richly endowed and synthetic a man the
more inappeasable will be his yearning to find the talents scattered
broadcast over humanity combined in one personality and to give himself
wholly and entirely to that personality the splitting up of man caused
by our social conditions is one of the principal causes of the longing
for the great and strong love which we hear so much discussed the
yearning for the absolute for perfection no longer separating and
selecting but embracing man as a whole annihilating body and soul in a
higher intuition the longing for mutual selfsurrender for giving and
receiving an undivided self is growing stronger and stronger the idea
of modern love a love embracing the whole breadth of human development
is unequalled in human history a single person shall stand for all
mankind the lover has always been all the world to woman but man has
possessed many things in addition to the beloved our age claims
wherever it understands its own eroticism that woman on her part
shall give to man all things in existence in a higher and purer form
not only complete satisfaction of the senses not only the lofty emotion
of spiritual love but also friendship as a fellowman she shall be to
him the friend who meant so much to the greek and the ancient teuton it
is selfevident that the true erotic of our time has very little to
spare for friendship while on the other hand the man who is not erotic
in the true sense of the word but merely sexual has generally a poor
idea of woman and a great appreciation of male friendship but modern
love does not only seek to combine all human relationships it would
fain include work recreation art the instinctive jealousy of every
occupation which she does not share with her lover is nothing more than
a loving womans fear that the things which belong to him exclusively
may become a danger to the unity of love whether such an allabsorbing
love is possible in richlyendowed natures and whether it will not be
the cause of new conflict are questions which cannot here be entered
upon but one thing is certain the great love cannot find its
consummation on earth
chapter ii
the lovedeath
the second form of metaphysical eroticism
the craving for infinitude is latent in love its essence is the longing
to reach beyond the attainable to find the meaning of the world in
ecstasy the great erotic is a man whose inward being rests on emotion
who must bring this emotion to its climaxand who is wrecked on the
incompleteness of human feeling we recognise in him one of the tragic
figures at the confines of humanity for it is the final tragedy of a
soul impelled by the inexorable will to selfrealisation to be broken
on the wheel of human limitations
the tragedy of the great man of action is less conditioned by principle
than the tragedy of other types of greatness because he is not limited
by the universal restrictions of humanity but by individual and
accidental ones he recognises partly because of his unmetaphysical
constitution no limits to human activity and in gaining his individual
object he reaches a relative end it is otherwise with the thinker the
artist the religious enthusiast and the lover the thinker possesses
the highest intellectual endowments he represents cognisant humanity
and his portion is the anguish of realising that the essence of being
cannot be grasped by the intellect the great artist creates a
masterpiece his heart is aglow with the ideal of perfect beauty beheld
by none but him but his ideal eternally eludes him the saint has
achieved perfection as far as perfection is possible to humanity and
stands aghast at the burden of insufficiency which weighs down mankind
the great erotic is the hero in the world of feeling his soul yearns
for the consummation of his loveand already he has reached the
confines of life
there are various paths by which the erotic may travel towards
perfection they correspond to the principal erotic types i have
devoted a special chapter to the seeker of love or the don juan the
womanworshipper who cannot find satisfaction on earth has been dealt
with already the great and rare lover however the exponent of the
final form of love who loves a woman of flesh and blood with every
fibre of his being differs very essentially from either of these types
the profounder the emotional depth of the soul the greater is the
difficulty of finding a complementary being the erotically
undifferentiated nature whose intellectual level may however be a
high one finds and in case of loss replaces the complementary being
comparatively easily the difficulty both of finding and of substitution
increases in proportion to the differentiation and the intensity of
feeling the true erotic once he has found his complementary being is
overwhelmed by the will to the perfect realisation of his passion it
appears with the unanswerable logic of the unique and final carrying in
its train supreme happiness and infinite sorrow a love able to deliver
a soul from its solitude is rare once there the whole world is as
nothing to it all life is embraced and brought under its spell in
this connection i need only mention michelangelo a lover of this type
surrenders himself to love unconditionallylove shall completely
annihilate completely renew him
but it is just in this overwhelming love that the impassable barrier
becomes apparent the lovers are two beings and not one indivisible
entity the fundamental fact of individuality stands between them as the
last obstacle to their complete union the more intense the emotion the
more desperately it tilts against this barrier against the
impossibility of complete mutual absorption and the more passionately
it demands another common form of existence individuality and the
eternal duality of being is felt as a curse the lovers cannot endure
the thought of continuing life as distinct personalities
the great erotic who against all expectation finds the being to whom
he can surrender himself unreservedly and with a sense of immortality
discovers within himself the supreme and only happiness and by that
very fact has himself become the source of his unhappiness personality
the greatest gift bestowed upon the children of man has flashed its
light upon the tragedy of life solitude eternal duality the soul
recognises with unspeakable dismay in its own fundamental principle the
cause of its isolation and the impossibility of final union with the
beloved the supreme value of european civilisation the value of
complete personality into whose gradual development and perfecting all
human forces had been built and in whose interest countless sacrifices
had been made knows itself as the cause of supreme suffering as an
element which ought on no account to exist not its completion but its
annihilation is what should really be desired we have here arrived at
the very confines of humanity if the great thinker has found the
boundaries of all knowledge in the limitations of the intellect and is
thus the representative of the human mind with its unattainable goal
knowledge of the secret of being the erotic has gone a step further he
has found the boundary in the very perfection of his personality and to
him the barrier is unendurable in the rare love of the rare
personality is discovered the eternal separateness of the ego only the
destruction of its origin the annihilation of itself might perhaps
throw down the barrier which separates the lovers inevitably there
arises in the soul the desire and the will to escape together with the
beloved the insufferable solitude of existence to achieve in death
what life denies to realise another a higher condition divined in
dreams and seen in visions to become one with the beloved to transform
all human existence into a new divine universal existence then i
myself am the world everything individual all life is blotted out
the death of the lovers from love and through love is the mystic portal
of a higher state of being it is the last ecstasy of unitythe
lovedeathan ecstasy which life cannot give because it must always be
wrecked on duality it is the despairing attempt to escape from
separateness to effect a delivery which to human understanding seems
final and it is characteristic that wagner who made the problem of
redemption peculiarly his own should have expressed this attempt
uniquely and with unparalleled grandeur
it would be a mistake to read into the idea of the lovedeath a
rejection of the european view of life a denial of the worldfeeling of
personality and a victory of the impotent philosophy of the east which
exalts nonexistence above existence that is to say individual
existence for the essence of the lovedeath is contained in the
determination of personality to realise itself in a new and positive
form of existence it is felt as the final synthesis exactly as in
other spheres the union of the ideal with the personal is seen as the
perfection of human life how would it be possible at once to annihilate
and to transcend the individual soul the source of personal love if
this soul were not first presupposed as the essential and supreme value
where personal love does not exist as in the orient and japan the
thought of the lovedeath would be an absurdity the burning of indian
widows is a phenomenon widely differing from the lovedeath the indian
widow slavishly abandons a life which has become aimless through her
masters death she does not make a sacrifice in the true sense of the
word and is not actuated by love
the complete unity of the lovers is possible on earth for a brief hour
and it will in most cases satisfy erotic yearning it can be realised
in two ways by the blissful rest of the lovers in each other which
silences all desires and apparently robs time of its tyranny
     the heart is still and nothing can disturb
     the deepest thought the thought to be her own
says goethe and a newer poet
     close around me wondrous being
     wind thy magic veil oblivion
     all my heart from unrest freeing
     let there be untroubled calm
     give me peace the helter skelter
     of the wide world has gone by
     and this narrow silent shelter
     holds the potent healing balm
by the side of this idyllic consummation of the longing for love there
is the other the ecstatic consummation of mutual rapture it almost
blots out individual consciousness in the singly no longer doubly
felt body and soul entrancing ecstasy it is such sheer delight that
pleasure is no longer perceived as a distinct element but rather is
there the consciousness of a complete transformation of life pleasure
which a great psychologist maintains craves eternity is annihilated
in its perfection knows no more of itself and is a part of the lovers
sense of complete unity it does not crave eternity such a craving is
its last stage but one the outer court further than which nietzsche as
far as eroticism is concerned never penetrated in the innermost
sanctuary pleasure disappears it has no longer any meaning it becomes
void before the new consciousness the supreme ecstasy of great love
proves that the summit of human emotion is beyond pleasure and pain and
does not acknowledge the limitations of bodily existence thus of
necessity the rapture of love must engender the idea of its own
eternity the destruction of individual consciousness i will quote in
this connection a few verses by erika rheinsch
     to open now my lips were vain indeed
     nor word nor even kiss could eer confess
     what sighs and joy and grief and happiness
     would flash from me to you with lightning speed
     nor hope nor prayr can still the souls desire
     for god himself can never join us twain
     my bitter tears fall on my heart like rain
     and cannot quench its allconsuming fire
     oh now to break the spellthe storm to breast
     with broken heart and lifeblood ebbing fast
     bearing the pangs of death for you at last
     dark troubled loveat last thou wert at rest
we perceive that love can no longer content itself with the
penultimateit must dare the last heroic step which creates beyond body
and soul something new and final for god himself can never join us
twain the lovedeath is the last and inevitable conclusion of
reciprocal love which knows of no value but itself and is resolved to
face eternity so that no alien influence shall reach it the two
powers love and death tower above human life fatefully and
mysteriously an isolated experience cannot appease them they involve
the whole existence to the individual who loves with an allabsorbing
love and to the individual on the point of death everything dwindles
into insignificance before the majesty of the lovedeath life breaks
down to be laid hold of and transcended in a new divined sphere
the thought of the lovedeath the will that the world should be
governed by love is the most unconditional postulate of feeling ever
laid down for the lovedeath is the definite and irrevocable victory of
emotion it is ecstasy as a solution of the worldproblem and the
worldprocess it is human to regard love and death as antitheses to
consider them far removed from each other marriage and funeral are the
poles of social life the ecstasy of the lovedeath however owing to
its alltranscending claim unites the two poles the climax of life
shall also be its end
it is here in the voluntary surrender of life in order to attain a
divined unity and not in the union of begetting and destroying that
the frequently assumed connection between love and death is to be found
voluptuousness and death are not interlinked as is so frequently
asserted since novalis not on the higher plane of eroticism but
voluptuousness has immolated itself has been annihilated in the
lovedeath the view that begetting and destroying are related
functions is based on the supposition that love is bound up with
propagation this is the fateful error of the modern theory of love a
rationalistic metaphysical abstraction which touches no corresponding
chord in the human soul to base the relationship of love and death on
an association of becoming and declining is a beautiful idea but
nothing more modern synthetic love produces this relationship in its
metaphysical perfection out of itself it is foreign alike to pure
sexuality and to spiritual love wherever the desire to destroy is
found hand in hand with sensuality morbid instincts are at play
it frequently occurs that lovers commit suicide together because
external circumstances prevent their union this is a step corresponding
to suicide from offended vanity or incurable disease life has become
unbearable to the individual haunted by a fixed idea and he throws it
away but this has nothing whatever to do with the lovedeath it is a
purely negative act of despair whereas the lovedeath is an altogether
positive act namely the will to win to a higher and to the intellect
inconceivable and paradoxical metaphysical unity the lovedeath
aspires to perform a miracle it has possibly never been realised in
its full greatness the evidence of the common death of heinrich von
kleist and henrietta vogel must be rejected during the last days of his
life kleist was wrapped up in the idea of their common death and in a
letter to his cousin marie von kleist he says if you could only
realise how death and love strive to beautify these last moments of my
life with heavenly and earthly roses you would be content to let me
die i swear to you i am supremely happy in the same letter he speaks
of the most voluptuous of deaths and yet it was no real lovedeath
that is to say death following as a necessary corollary in order that
love may be consummated kleist as well as henrietta had separately
resolved to commit suicide and when theyalmost accidentallyheard of
this mutual intention they conceived the idea of the new voluptuousness
of a common death love did not play a very great part in this kleist
further says in the same letter her resolution to die with me drew me
i cannot tell you with what unspeakable and irresistible power into her
arms do you remember that i asked you more than once to die with me
but you always said no from this and other passages it is clear that
kleist would have taken his life in any case and that he only seized
this specific opportunity to plunge into the ecstasy of a common death
the thought of the lovedeath is often present in the hearts of
individuals who are genuinely in love we read in schlegels lucinda
there in a transcendental life our longings may perhaps be
satisfied and in lenaus letters to sophy the same thought is more
than once apparent
the idea reached perfection and immortality in wagners tristan and
isolde it is wagners worldfamous deed to have lived through and
embodied this complex of emotion for the first and so far for the last
time his lovers are in a superlative degree representative of human
love they typify the climaxes of human emotion wagner has immortalised
the metaphysical form of synthetic love his importance to synthetic
love surpasses dantes importance to deification
already in the first act the exchange of lovepotion and deathdraught
is profoundly significant both tristan and isolde seek death because
they are alarmed by the external obstacles to their love but the
thought of death and love the foreboding that their love can find rest
only in the ultimate in finality has been in their hearts from the
outset together they receive new life from love and together love
leads them step by step to death in the profoundest sense no exchange
of potions has taken place but the power of the lovepotion has made
them conscious of what was latent in their souls waiting to burst into
life at the very moment when isolde proffers tristan the deathdraught
the conviction flashes into his soul that she is giving him death
through love when thy dear hand the goblet raised i recognised that
death thou gavst and in the same way isolde from golden day i
sought to flee in darkest night draw thee with me where my heart
divined the end of deceit where illusions haunting dream should fade
to drink eternal love to thee joined everlastingly to death i doomd
thee
the second act leads them further and further into the coils of their
love they are more and more convinced that death alone is left to them
step by step they discover the secret of the mystical unionand yet
they are still completely imprisoned within the limits of their
personalities and cannot quite understand the miracle how to grasp it
how to grasp it this great gladness far from daylight far from
sadness far from parting for it is the profoundest secret of the
world which here must be guessed by lovethe final unity of two souls
and through it unity with all life clearer and clearer and more and
more compelling looms the thought of a common death until it is grasped
and comprehended the lovers realise that to be completely one they must
surrender their lives and that by losing life they can lose nothing
essential all death can destroy is that which divides us ultimately
tristan pronounces the final decision and isolde repeats it word by
word follows it step by step like a sleepwalker so as to make it
quite her own thus should we die no more to part in endless joy one
soul one heart never waking never haunted by pale fear in love
undaunted each to each united aye dream of loves eternity the
grand artistic symbol for this state of consciousness touches
metaphysic wagner introduces night as the visible emblem of an
existence in a worldinconceivable by our sensesbeyond the grave in
contrast to the earthly day to the days deceptive glamour
nietzsche later on adopted this symbol midnight as the emblem of
everything lofty the lovers who in their dayconsciousness believed
that they hated each other now that they are walking towards eternal
night divine that which is beyond the reach of their separated selves
beyond all illusion and duality the duality is outwardly expressed by
their different names separated and united by the little word and
all at once the knowledge dawns upon them that great love cannot be
consummated in the day of the world but that it points to a life
beyond they have discovered the final meaning of life and the
worldthe annihilation of individual life and death through
loveanalogous to the last wisdom of the mystic to become god i
myself am the world death is the inevitable corollary of supreme love
but as they tremblingly yearn for and await the inconceivable earth
once more stretches out her arms to them the dream of metaphysical
existence melts slowly away in the orchestration phantoms of the day
dreams of morning suppress the new the divined conception
at the opening of the third act the motif for horns and violas gradually
ascending and dying away expresses the unspeakable dreariness and
senselessness of material life after its profound meaning the
recreation of the world by love has been lost this feeling of
absolute senselessness dominates the awakening sleeper tristan
interpreting it in the sense of schopenhauer as the universal
aimlessness of the world and of life is merely expressing the doom of
his own longing for the supreme he has divined and has lost the
loftiest value wagner intuitively perceives that sin is a component
part of the supreme sublimation of love and personality tristan must
curse himself and the beloved woman because love as the last
consequence of sin demands the lovedeath which can never find
completion the terrible draught myself i have brewed it a curse on
thee terrible draught a curse on him who brewed it
in the music at the end of the third act which is known by the not
quite relevant title of isoldes lovedeath wagner after previously
expressing by tristans last words do i near light the inadequacy of
the physical sensesattempts to describe the metaphysical condition of
the unity of love which to our consciousness can only have the negative
characteristics of the unthinkable and intangiblethe unconscious this
he tried to accomplish artistically by making use of the senses by
trying to convey in terms of sound light scent what he understood by
this complete immersion in the swirling totality of cosmic lifein
des weltatems wehendem all the essence of this condition is that the
duality of the souls and finally the multiplicity of the world is
resolved in a higher unity but as we are concerned with the emotional
life of the lovers and not with vague metaphysical propositions we may
say that such a death is not a being dead destroyed annihilated
dispersed but a being transformed perfected in love the amazing
phenomenon of this complex of feeling is the fact that real life has
become unbearable and that another life is created without the least
regard to possibility or truth it is as if the emotion of the lovers
were endowed with divine creative power
those who realise the lovedeath as a necessity of their inmost being
resemble the great ecstatic whom earthly life can no longer satisfy
because he is conscious of a force compelling him to enter into a higher
cosmic existence his inmost experience is the annihilation of the
individual soul in god he aspires to a direct pouring of the soul into
the divine love those who die in love are directly seeking complete
unity with each other and only indirectly through this unity the
divined annihilation in metaphysical being the lovedeath is the
erotic bihuman form of mystic ecstasy and could not be evolved until
the highest form of love had been developed
metaphysical eroticism is a product of the spirit of europe for it is
linked to personality whose will is the immortalisation of love
orientalism neither comprehends nor appreciates this emotion for it
lacks the foundation of the culture of personality the semite the
indian and the japanese experience only the rapture of the senses and
gratification restlessly revolving round itself between enjoyment and
exhaustion is condemned to eternal sterility all religiosexual orgies
of which history tells us are so many attempts of sensuality to possess
itself of a higher intuitionvain attempts because casual intercourse
and the annihilation of the individual can never produce new values
according to hegel the immanent sense of everything that happens in the
world is the destiny of the individual to grow from slavery into
freedom but is it not rather the meaning of increased culture that man
should realise himself as an individual which is by no means a
contradiction to the first proposition metaphysical eroticism is the
completion of personality in love simultaneously with the birth of
personality originated the deification of woman the destruction of the
most highly evolved personality the last painful consequence of its
blessedunblessed nature gives birth to the conception of the
lovedeath like antique torchbearing genii the two metaphysical forms
of love stand at the head and the feet of selfconscious man here and
there erotic emotion transcending all limitations becomes the pathway
leading to the ultimate secrets of life deification creates a
supernatural female being as the erotic representative of everything
divine this is a productive act erotic artistic and religious at the
same time it produces out of its own fulness new forces for the service
of higher ideals it creates a new world of emotion with new contents
simultaneously with the projection of the love of woman into eternity
were sown the seeds of those great things on which the higher spiritual
life of today is based deification demands shape and individuality
beyond the earthly sphere in eternity but from one side it is love
love without response unless the lover finds response in and through
artistic expression the eroticism of the solitary man and it occurs
as such to this day in rare minds womanworship is the natural and the
highest form of love for the man who does not seek his own perfection in
dualitya reciprocal relationship with another beingbut solitarily
and yet not as the mystic shapelessly but rather in a love definitely
projected on another being the dream of the perfect woman is the only
erotic dream which reality can never disappoint for it makes no claim
on reality doubtless it is to some extent paradoxical that the
inherently social feeling anchored in duality should be experienced
and perfected solitarily that it should waive all claim to response
and reciprocity to all appearances the most important elements of love
the lovedeath corresponds more completely to the erotic ideal inasmuch
as it is founded on absolute equality in reciprocity it finds its
climax not in solitude but in the company of the beloved the idea of
complete abandonment is revolting to the solitarily loving individual
the lover whose whole soul turns to the beloved cannot understand the
love of the solitary soul it appears to him unnatural and cold perhaps
meaningless and crazy woman does not know true solitude the thought of
deification is foreign to her nature she attains to the supreme only
with and through man it is easier to her to give herself to her lover
entirely and even to follow him into death but in this connection i am
unable to suppress a doubt as to whether the fundamental emotion of the
mystical worldunion is altogether present in woman whether she really
divines behind her lovereternity
while deification is universally creative while it is fresh as the
spring and full of faith the lovedeath with its gloomy pathos demands
the entire individual and destroys everything but itself it has no
creative power for there is nothing beyond it one may justly maintain
that the lovedeath realises the mysticoecstatic religious emotion
while in the deification of woman the religious need to worship finds
satisfaction both are combinations of love and religion both are
metaphysical eroticism paradoxical and yet logical conclusions of human
emotion
the overwhelming longing which is connected at least with the first
stages of a great love may be interpreted in another in a social
sense love is the intensest and most direct relationship which can
exist between two beings and the impossibility of realising its final
longing represents the most genuine tragedy of life among men and women
of the social world the need which impels two beings to each other
lacks in this union too the possibility of complete consummation and
if the most powerful of all social emotions and as many believe the
root of all others suffers from an inner duality to how much greater
an extent must the less intense feelings which unite individuals share
the same lot humanity wherever it is comprehended profoundly and
spiritually not economically carries within itself the germ of its
tragical imperfection whatever social relationship we may enter we
find that it has a flaw and the more genuine and profound the
relationship the less dictated by utilitarian considerations which in
this connection correspond to the element of sensuality in eroticism
the more painfully does this flaw make itself feltwhether it be in
friendship in the relationship of master and man or in free
companionship every relationship between individuals is stricken with
the curse of incompletenesseven love cannot escape this fate love
enforces in the deification of woman a transcending of earthly lifeand
it throws itself into the last embrace of a common deaththat is to
say it shudderingly admits the impossibility of its consummation
chapter iii
the conflict between sexuality and love
the seeker of love and the slave of love
it is obvious that even an equilibrium between sexuality and love cannot
always be established while a genuine and complete unification is very
unusual and may perhaps be called utopian in the previous chapters i
have dealt with the blending of both elements in the highest form of
eroticism in the following i will attempt to throw light on some of the
principal phenomena resulting from a defective union of sexuality and
love phenomena which i am convinced have never been correctly
interpreted i allude to perversions which are not inherently
pathological although they are as a rule only observed and described in
their pathological form
the fundamental form of socalled sadism may be discovered in an erotic
type which i will call the seeker of love a lover of this type is
characterised by an unappeasable longing for pure spiritual love he
passes from woman to woman in the hope of realising this desire but
owing to his own material disposition he is unable to do so time after
time he succumbs to sexual promptings thus groping frequently quite
unconsciouslyfor a fictitious being he hates every woman whose fate
it is to rouse his desire for each one cheats him out of that which he
seeks a genuine illusionist he knows nothing of the woman of flesh and
blood and continues seeking his ideal only to be again and again
disappointed he blames every woman he conquers for what is really his
own insufficiency he despises her or revenges himself on her punishes
and illtreats her we recognise the true don juan and his morbid
caricature the sadist but even the most brutal representative of this
type may still be psychologically described as a man who seeks
spiritual love in woman after woman and finding only sexuality
revenges himself on her quite a number of men harbour sadistic
feelings for only one woman and that the one to whom they owe their
great disillusionment doubtless many men have almost lost the psychical
roots of their perversions and are completely involved in physical acts
there is nothing remarkable in this fact it occurs in every sphere of
human life the vague instinct of revenge on woman animates also though
perhaps unconsciously the pathological sadist
there is one thing which the seeker of love and the womanworshipper
have in common both seek a higher ideal far beyond the woman of
everyday life but while the worshipper safeguards the purity of his
feeling by putting the greatest possible distance between him and the
object of his worship and is therefore never disappointed the seeker
of love blinded by the illusion that he has at last found the object of
his quest draws every woman towards him and again and again discovers
that he is nothing but a sensualist every fresh conquest destroys his
dream afresh and he revenges himself if he is a don juan by despising
and disgracing the unfortunate victim and if he is a sadist by
maltreating her and yet he never entirely loses his illusion he craves
for complete satisfaction and as he is incapable of selfknowledge he
never abandons the hope of meeting the woman he seeks he differs very
little from the type represented by sordello who loved one woman
spiritually but regarded all the others from the standpoint of sex it
is the tragedy of don juan to revolt from the low erotic sphere which is
his portion and where he rules supreme and for ever to aspire to a
realm from which he is shut out he is convinced that with the help of a
woman he may redeem himselfand sinks deeper and deeper into the slough
of his own sensuality he becomes malevolent cruel and callous the
pleasure whose slave he is repels him
     from craving to enjoyment thus i reel
     and in enjoyment languish for desire
he is insatiable but not as the primitive hedonist whose natural
element is pleasure but because he again and again mistakes pleasure
for love he knows only women and thus he sins against personality
and the love which is the outcome of personality
the opinion that don juan is no more than a votary of pleasure is not
worthy of criticism the famous casanova for instance has nothing in
common with him casanova was a sensualist without psychical complexity
and without tragedy his sole endeavour was to wring the utmost measure
of enjoyment out of life he knew the woman of reality and did not waste
his time in running after phantoms in his old age he revelled in the
aftertaste and settled down to write his memoirs don juan on the
contrary has such a loathing for all the women he betrays that he
hardly remembers them and certainly has the strongest disinclination to
evoke their memory casanova was an entirely unmetaphysical and
unproblematical nature his philosophy is clearly expressed in the
preface to his memoirs i always regarded the enjoyment of sensual
pleasures as my principal object i never knew a more important one
casanova who strange to say enjoys such high erotic honours was
merely an ordinary very successful man of the world and is of no
importance to the subject in hand but even the greater and wilder
vicomte de valmont the hero of the famous novel of choderlos de laclos
is in spite of all his art and esprit and perverse principles no
seeker of love and no don juan but a fop and a braggart seducing women
in order to boast of his success he is moreover only a representative
of the bored upper ten of the ancien rgime and not by any means
unique
thoughtful critics contend that don juan was an autocrat a destroyer a
criminal nature with satanic tendencies bent on the enslavement of
women on their social and moral death that conquest only not
enjoyment was his passion i do not altogether reject this
interpretation but it fastens too exclusively on the external and the
obvious and overlooks the essential what is the reason of his
preposterous procedure is he really actuated by the evil desire to
injure the women he woos such a motive may occur occasionally the
vicomte de valmont was so constituted but it cannot be regarded as the
guiding principle of a lifeand above everything its pettiness is the
exact reverse of so great and demoniacal a character as don juan were
he conqueror in the highest sense thenascetic and proudhe would be
content with the mere consciousness of victory but his whole attitude
belies the idea of a conqueror he is not in the least interested in the
women to whom he makes love they are as necessary to him as the air he
breathes but they are unable to give him what he seeks at the moment
of disappointment he abandons them in disgust innocent of any despotic
desires which would presuppose interest as far as he is concerned
women exist only for the purpose of quickening something in his soul
but his soul remains dead divine love has no part in him he cannot be
saved and is doomed to eternal damnation
but what is the reason why women cannot resist him let us first settle
the point as to why women are attracted to men i will answer this
question briefly and though my answer may appear dogmatical it need
not therefore be wrong women know very little of man but there is one
thing they feel with unfailing certainty and that is whether their sex
is of great or of small significance to him i am only alluding to the
general effect of men on women not to genuine personal love which is
always incommensurable the greater the importance a man attaches to
women the more readily do they respond to his influence they are
attracted by his erotic will not by one or the other of his spiritual
or physical qualities women cannot resist a man to whom they mean much
everything it is as if they were compelled to throw themselves into the
chasm of his vacuityevery fresh victim with the fond hope of filling
itbut all of them perish and yet at the moment of their defeat they
are supremely happy for they experience the full intensity of his
passion and the boundlessness of his longing the erotic craving of a
man simply means that women are to him the most important thing in life
women instinctively yield to that man who most eagerly desires them the
coarse sensualist to whom all women are alike attracts sensual women
not exactly because they find in him the satisfaction of their craving
but because they themselves act on him indiscriminately but a woman
will adapt herself with the greatest ease to the needs of the
differentiated erotic for instance she will become really sentimental
to please the man who prefers sentimental women for she loves to give
herself to the man who most desires her and as he desires her
don juan animated by illimitable erotic yearning is therefore the
undisputed master of the other sex he has the power of bestowing
absolute happiness even if only for a brief hour because in his
boundless love which is projected on anything but her a woman receives
the supreme value maybe he would be saved if a woman denied herself to
himmaybe he would cease to be a seeker of love and become a
worshipper for he could not refuse to believe in the woman who
rejected him but it is his fate that no woman he woos can resist him
that all throw themselves into his arms without an exception and without
a struggle
thus the seeker of love too though in a restricted sense may be
regarded as a metaphysical erotic for he loathes sexualityhis
portionand yearns for a higher form of love he shares this attitude
with the slave of love who is also a sensualist and a wouldbe lover
the slave of love imitates the attitude of the worshipper but he
infallibly sinks into the sexual sphere what the psychopathist since
kraftebbing designates as masochism is the pathological degeneration
of this particular emotion which is very common and appears in various
forms but does not seem to me to be at all morbid certainly it is
morbid when a man allows himself to be insulted bound and flogged but
it is fairly normal when his passionate admiration is roused by an
imperious woman who passes him by like a queen without even noticing
his abject adoration when he longs to kneel down before her and kiss
her feet which in reward would spurn him quite normal too is the
boyish happiness in serving an admired and adored woman kraftebbing
calls this pageism described so beautifully in dostoievskys novel a
young hero and fairly common among troubadours and minnesingers i
need only mention ulrich von lichtenstein there are numerous degrees
of this feelingwe frequently come across it in the novels of
dostoievsky jacobsen strindberg dannunzio and othersbut the
essence of it is always contained in the fact that the man although
yearning to worship the beloved woman cannot maintain himself in the
sphere of spiritual love and aspires to direct physical contact his
attitude which closely imitates purely spiritual love cannot be other
than sexual the blending of love and sexuality together with the
incapacity of effecting a real synthesis the confusion of value and
pleasure is most clearly shown in the masochistfar more clearly than
in the case of the rare seeker of love the outward modes preferred by
the individual are a matter of indifference for the most part they are
symbolical acts indicating the lovers inferiority and the loftiness
and power of his mistress what is really of importance is the spiritual
attitude which induces him to commit these strange acts and in these we
find the characteristic attitude of the womanworshipper that of the
slave before his queen the slave of love is a sensualist incapable of
approaching woman in a normally manly instinctive and natural way but
requiring the pose of the spiritual worshipper one might be tempted to
believe that he harboured the secret wish to atone for his incapacity of
feeling a pure love by being degraded and illtreated thus from a human
point of view the slave of love is a higher type than the seeker of
love all his transgressions the fault of his morbid disposition come
home to him he takes the blame of his sin upon his own shoulders while
the seeker of love revenges himself on his victims for his own
shortcomings the seeker of love is by nature polygamous while the
slave of love is as a rule monogamous and consequently has little
success with the opposite sex both aspire to a union of sensual and
spiritual eroticism but in both cases the union is a failure all the
repulsive and terrible manifestations of these perversions which have
been recorded can easily be shown to fit my theory in psychological
research it is merely a question of selecting the great types from the
mass of phenomena and determining them correctly
the socalled fetichist too whose passion is roused by indifferent
objects which belonged or might belong to the beloved or in fact to
any woman is a variant of the slave of love the classical
representative of fetichism is the mediaeval knight who carried a
handkerchief a glove or any other article of clothing belonging to his
lady next to his heart thus believing himself proof against evil
influences there we see already spiritual love groping for material
objects in order to gain earthly support not every man is a dante not
every man is capable of keeping his soul free from the taint of this
earthly sphere but even the plaitcutter so well known to the reader
of newspapers the collector of garters and similar desperadoes
require a relic a fetich which they apparently worship to the same
category belongs the idolatrous cult which some men especially
artistsbut also madmenpractise with female pictures and statues
more especially with heads in this case the fundamental feeling of
the love of beauty which we know as an essential factor of purely
spiritual eroticism is made to serve sensual purposes the desired
illusion of spiritual worship is facilitated and is protected from
selfrevelation owing to the fact that a painted head rouses in the
normal individual no passion but inspires him with purely spiritual
sentiments
i have briefly touched on this subject because my theory of the two
roots of eroticism permits of a new and in my opinion plausible
explanation of erotic perversions one might even go as far as to say
that the existence of perversions follows as a necessary consequence
that they must exist because it obviously cannot always be possible to
maintain a harmonious balance of sensuality and love this chapter is
therefore a necessary supplement to the previous ones in which the
perfection of modern love is dealt with the seeker of love and the
slave of love are phenomena of dualistic eroticism incapable of
attaining to unity for this reason they neither existed in antiquity
nor do we find genuine examples of them in the female sex all female
perversions closely examined are hysteriathat is to say want of inner
balancein various forms a womans subjection to the will of a man is
in very many instances a natural symptom and cannot be regarded as
perverse and thus we again perceive that the eroticism of woman is more
harmonious and natural than that of the eternally groping and eternally
erring man
chapter iv
the revenge of sexuality
the demoniacal and the obscene
in conclusion i will attempt to elucidate a group of phenomena which
play a part important though often ignored in the emotional life of
the present day they are related to the subject under discussion
inasmuch as they too are the result of a lack of harmony between
sensuousness and love as long as sensuousness is felt and understood as
a natural element and one which does not under normal circumstances
enter consciousness as a distinct principle the emotional sphere which
may be designated as demoniacalsexual and obscene does not exist not
until sensuousness is confronted by a higher principle a now solely
acknowledged spiritualdivine principle will natural life and
particularly normal sexuality be stigmatised as low and ungodly even
as demoniacal in proportion as the conception of god became more
spiritual and divine the conception of the devil became more horrible
the higher the soul soared the deeper sank the body this philosophy of
pure spirituality was expressed by st bernard of clairvaux in the
following words oh soul stamped with the image of god adorned with
his semblance espoused to faith endowed with his spirit redeemed by
his blood the compeer of angels invested with reasonwhat hast thou
in common with the flesh for which thou must suffer so much and yet
it is thy dearest companion behold there will come a day when it shall
be a miserable pallid corpse food for worms for however beautifully
it may be adorned yet it is nothing but flesh the man of the later
middle ages and especially the cleric who was completely dominated by
the contrast of the ascetic and the sexual feared the devil more than
he loved god and regarded the sensual temptations which beset his
excited superstitious and eternally unsatisfied imagination as sent by
the devil the navet of sensuality had passed away for ever as
goodness was looked upon as divine and supernatural nature and natural
instincts were condemned man was torn asunder
but the devil was not only feared he was also worshipped a
devilworship the details of which have been little studied existed
from the tenth to the fourteenth century when it reached its climax
side by side with the worship of god the greater the dread of heresy
and witchcraft the greater became the number of men who despairing of
salvation prostrated themselves before the devil whom they seemed
unable to escape a single evil thought was sufficient to doom their
souls to eternal damnation in the hope that he would at least save
their bodies from the stake and vouchsafe them the pleasures of this
world satan promised his worshippers unlimited pleasure he became the
redeemer of those whom the clergy persecuted it is asserted that his
worship consisted in an obscene parody of the mass according to
michelet the body of a female worshipper served as the altar on which a
toad was consecrated and partaken of instead of the host the adept
solemnly renounced jesus and did homage to satan by kissing his image
asceticism and libertinism always go hand in hand they are convertible
principles rending their victim temptation is the fundamental motif
of this condition the devil was believed to send out his servants to
win new souls monks were visited by demons in the shape of a voluptuous
woman the succubus satan himself or one of his emissaries
disguised as a fashionable gentleman the incubus appeared to the
nuns undoubtedly the dreams of overexcited men and women played a very
important part in this connection many hysterical women felt the
devils kiss and embrace all these women were themselves convinced of
the truth of their hallucinations and imaginings and once the belief in
witchcraft was firmly established in the thirteenth century the
obvious atonement for their hysteria was the stake
the fear of witches which existed parallel with the love of the
madonna was typical of the declining middle ages the first christian
centuries knew neither the lady of heaven in the later meaning of the
word nor did they know anything of witches in the reign of charlemagne
the penalty for the belief in witchcraft was death at all times man has
exhibited a tendency to see in woman either a celestial or an infernal
being and nowhere was this tendency more strongly developed than in the
soul of the mediaeval dualist he created the beloved and adored queen
of heaven the mediator between god and humanity and as her counterpart
the witch the despised and dreaded seducer a being between man and
devil powerless to effect a reconciliation between spiritual love and
sensuous pleasure he required two distinct female types as
personifications of the two directions of his desire love and the
pleasure of the senses could have nothing in common and once the
highest value was realised in the spiritual love of woman pleasure
could not appear otherwise than degraded sinful and diabolical in this
respect also woman submitted without a murmur to the dictates of male
will
mary and the devil became more and more the real hostile powers of the
thirteenth century the classical time of womanworship was also the
climax of the fear of the devil and witchcraft the dominican monks
who above all other orders contributed to the spread of the cult of
mary proceeded soon after the establishment of the inquisition
against the witches the enemies of mary in the second half of the
thirteenth century the persecution of heresy gradually gave way to the
persecution of witchcraft
i will not go into these wellknown details for the psychical position
is clear enough to the man whose heart is filled with the love of good
and the spiritual love of woman sensuousness will appear as dangerous
and perilous and will have at the same time the glamour of the
demoniacallysexual it is the diabolical element of dualistic
consciousness in the sphere of eroticism many people of the present day
will not be able to understand this feeling for it presupposes a
completely inharmonious emotional life
the consciousness of the obscene is allied to the conception of the
demoniacal it accompanies modern synthetic love as its temptation and
its shadow in personal love sensuality and soul are no longer
independent contrasted principles personality taking the spiritual as
its foundation includes the sensuous in this highest stage all
eroticism not hallowed by mutual affection is felt as unpardonable the
purely sexual principle continues to exist but whenever it appears in
its impersonal and brutal crudity as an element hostile to personality
it creates the consciousness of the obscene the obscene is therefore
the purely sexual not in its nave normality but as a force inimical
to a value as a rule to the value of personality the obscene expresses
scorn and hatred for personal love it is the seduction of the primitive
which is no longer something earlier but something baser for every
age must gauge all things by its own standard the aesthetic
principlein this connection the sense of the beauty of the human
formso powerful an element in nave sensuality as well as in every
other form of eroticism is excluded because in this particular
condition the beauty of the human body is not objectively realised but
is looked upon with the eyes of the senses the moment personality is
acknowledged as the only decisive factor in erotic life chaotic
impersonal sensuality stands condemned the obscene is the darker aspect
of modern love and without modern love it could not exist its essence
is negative is the tendency to caricature and mock the highest form of
love the photograph of a nude woman is not obscene but if the face is
hidden and thus the personal moment intentionally eliminated in favour
of the generic element it approaches the obscene this accounts for the
widely felt pleasure in obscene pictures the beholder is not personally
engaged he can enjoy these pictures without taking upon his shoulders
any kind of responsibility even that minimum of respect which the very
dregs of humanity may claim is not required of him the picture is
capable of affording pleasure without claiming a grain of human
kindness thus it would seem that sensual pleasure is possible without
any sacrifice of the inwardly professed higher eroticism a sacrifice
which might be a bar to a primitive relationship with a woman of flesh
and blood actually however it is not possible for with the surrender
to the base source of enjoyment the spiritual position is abandoned
and personally conceived humanity inwardly annihilated
it follows from the foregoing that the fascination of the obscene can
only be fully felt by one who has completely acknowledged the principle
of personality in eroticism and who has also latent within him the
possibility of erotic dualism the more highly evolved the emotional
life of a man all these considerations apply only to a man in whom the
possibility of dualism is latent the more will he realise the purely
sexual the emphasis of the element of pleasure as something unseemly
and disagreeable something which he ought to deny himself but which
attracts him with the irresistible fascination of the obscene the man
who surrenders himself navely to sensuality does not realise it as
obscene but the man who conscious of his higher concept strives
against it experiences the reaction of sensuality with the full force
of its perverse seduction even if only for a brief space he
annihilates the higher element and gives himself up to the pleasure of
the base and degraded
in this connection we are face to face with the strange but still
logical fact that a man who has completely attained to the third stage
of love feels even the purely spiritual love as odious in its
incompleteness it strikes him as unnatural and forced a feeling which
must however not be confused with the ordinary contempt of spiritual
love
primitively constituted man knows only undifferentiated sexuality he
enjoys the nude and sees no difference between a venus by titian and an
ordinary photograph of a nude figure the aesthete and more especially
the artist can never understand that a work of art may be sensually
stimulating that it may be so will always be bluntly denied by an
individual capable of enjoying a beautiful form but to the uncultivated
mind the picture of the female body will only evoke memories of
pleasure this feeling however is quite distinct from the obscene it
is neither hostile to the higher spiritual life nor is it criminal it
is natural and harmonious but the same feeling may become obscene if a
man aware of higher aesthetic values ignores art and enjoys the
picture merely as a representation of a nude figure here too the
seduction lies in a demoniacal element namely in the destruction of the
aesthetic value the destructive characteristic of the obscene wars
against all higher conceptions it is the revenge of chaotic sex
deposed by a higher principle and has the special charm of secret
wrongdoing
i might go even further and maintain that because modern love does not
admit pleasure as its foundation and content and because the craving
for pleasure is deeply rooted in human nature love favours to a high
degree the desire to reserve a sphere for pleasure distinct from
personal love this region is the obscene and one might prophesy that
it will grow in proportion as the principle of personal love acquires
dominion for pleasure will always need an undisturbed retreat
untroubled by higher demands this can only be found in the sphere of
the obscene in which the element of personality is entirely eliminated
modern man is beset by another peculiar temptation the beauty of woman
which in the days of the past was regarded as sacred can be made a
means of pleasure and thus drawn from the realm of values into the
realm of sensuality this is a breach with the principle of personal
love for to the latter the beauty of a woman is so much part and parcel
of the whole personality that it cannot be enjoyed separately that
indeed it can hardly be noticed as a distinct element this cleavage has
become so nearly universal that we are hardly conscious of its profound
perversity it is the archsin of all higher eroticism to realise beauty
not as the undetachable and selfevident outward form of a beloved soul
but as a means of heightening pleasure although in its essence it is
the same thing as the examination of a work of art merely for the sake
of the pleasure it affords to the senses the offence is here aggravated
because personality is involved this degradation of the higher values
whether of nature art beauty knowledge kindness religion or the
human soul to serve the ends of sensual pleasure is the expression of a
perversity which is possibly the most radical and characteristic of our
age today the soul of a woman has frequently the same effect on man as
her physical beauty he enjoys it as a subtile charm instead of
respecting it as a mystery
i can hardly expect to make my meaning quite clear to the multitude but
the tendency to enjoy beauty of form or soul as a distinct element
represents a rupture with the principle of synthetic love the love
which does not separate but realises the personality of the beloved as
an indivisible entity the enjoyment of beauty as a separate element
presupposes a conscious spiritual division not only of the beloved
but also of the lover and is therefore the destruction of the principle
of unity aesthete and libertine alike sink to the lower level of
pleasure and their emotions become obscene there is no question of a
division when tristan in his vision of isolde exclaims how beautiful
thou art for great love can create the beauty of the beloved out of
its own soul
prudery is based on a similar duality it expresses a consciousness that
the nude can only be alluring obscene indecent and should therefore
be feared and avoided it is the defensive weapon of sexually excited
for the most part slightly hysterical women against the purely sexual
whose sphere they often extend amazingly prudery conceives sexuality as
a distinct restricted complex in consciousness such division is alien
to woman and where it exists a hysterical condition a condition of
inner discord is clearly indicated we may take it that the obscene
which affects normal men affects only hysterical inwardly discordant
women who try to take shelter behind prudery to the normal woman the
obscene does not exist as a spiritual principle she turns with a
feeling of displeasure from all the lower sexual manifestations and
even finds them absurd the elimination of personality of eroticism the
charm of which is felt by even the most highly differentiated man has
always been foreign to womanshe lacks the duality of erotic emotion
which man is slowly and laboriously striving to overcomea still
further proof of the unbroken synthetic emotion of woman
conclusion
the psychogenetic law
the individual as an epitome of the human race
the biogenetic law of ernst haeckel teaches us that the human embryo
passes through all the stages of development traversed by its ancestors
in their evolution from the lower forms of the animal world although
each successive stage completely replaces the preceding one the latter
is there as its organic supposition man is not born as a human being
until he has travelled over the principal portions of the road to
evolution this law which establishes the natural connection of the
individual with the whole chain of organisms is continued in a
psychogenetic law not founded on the heredity of the blood but on the
heredity of culture and therefore quite independent of the doctrine of
the origin of species in the course of his development the individual
repeats the psychospiritual stages through which the species has
passed but while the human body cannot sustain life until it is
perfectly developed the degrees of psychic perfection vary very
considerably not every individual reaches perfection most men attain
to some degree but there are others who do not even acquire the
rudiments
it would be an attractive and grateful task to point out the
haltingplaces of the human race in the life of the individual to fix
the moment when for the first time in his life the child says ia
moment which usually occurs in his second year and represents the
humanisation of the race the great intuition when primitive man
divining his spiritual nature severed himself from the external world
to perceive the childlike its primitive ancestors in their
daytreating all weaker creatures which fall into its hands with almost
bestial cruelty to watch the boyish games reflecting the period when
the nations lived on war and the chase their eagerness to draw up rules
and regulations and create gradations of rank and marks of distinction
i am not able to carry out such a task in detail and moreover as i am
dealing with the erotic life only such a proceeding would be out of
place here
the psychogenetic law then comes to this every welldeveloped male
individual of the present day successively passes through the three
stages of love through which the european races have passed the three
stages are not traceable in all men with infallible certainty there are
numerous individuals whose development in this respect has been
arrested but in the emotional life of every highly differentiated
member of the human race they are clearly distinguishable and the
greater the wealth and strength of a soul the more perfectly will it
reflect the history of the race the evolution of every wellendowed
individual presents a rough sketch of the history of civilisation it
has its prehistoric its classical its mediaeval and its modern
period many men remain imprisoned in the past others are fragmentary
or appear to be suspended in midair rootless the spirit of humanity
has lived through the past and overcome it so as to be able to create
its future
the gynecocratic stage actually survives to this day in the nursery
here the mother rules supreme the father is an intruder the brothers
are dominated by their sisters often their juniors women mature at an
earlier age than men this assertion applies with equal force to
individual and sex in connection with the history of civilisation after
he has left the nursery there follows in the life of the boy a period
during which he associates only with his schoolfriends shuns the
society of his mother and sisters and is ashamed of his female
relatives this represents the revival of the mens unions of remote
antiquity in the life of the individual of the present day
at the period of puberty the sexual instinct makes itself felt for the
first time as a rule if its nature is not recognised it is
accompanied by restlessness and depression i do not believe that the
instinct is as soon as it appears directed to the other sex or
anything else outside the individual this fact cannot be explained by
want of opportunity shyness or bad example there is a positive reason
for it the longing for a member of the other sex is still unfelt
between his twentieth and thirtieth year a man is often dominated by an
enthusiastic spiritual love quite unconnected with the sensuality which
has hitherto ruled his emotions i will not elaborate the growth of this
love and the new feelings which arise in connection with it just as in
the remote past the sense of personality was born as the centre of a new
consciousness so the individual now undergoes a period of purification
and regeneration through the love for his mistress he discovers his
inmost self of which until now he had been practically ignorant the
generative undifferentiated impulse is supplanted by the love for an
individual and stigmatised as base and contemptible guincellis words
characterising the second erotic stage of the race amor e cor gentil
sono una cosa today apply to the second stage in the life of the
individual it also occurs that in the heart of a man whom reality has
failed to satisfy an ideal woman gradually wins life and shape
sometimes it is the idealised counterpart of an actual woman but not
infrequently it is a vague unsubstantial shadow here we have the
deification of the woman reproduced in the heart of the individual to
illustrate my point i will quote the very pertinent conversation
between foldal the embittered old clerk and john gabriel borkman
ibsen
     borkman indeed can you show me one who is any good
     foldal thats just the point the few women ive known are no
     good at all
     borkman with a sneer whats the good of them if you dont know
     them
     foldal excitedly dont say that john gabriel isnt it a
     magnificent an ennobling thought to know that somewhere far
     away never mind where the true woman lives
     borkman impatiently stop your high falutin nonsense
     foldal hurt high falutin nonsense you call my most sacred
     belief high falutin nonsense
in conclusion i should like to mention here that i look upon otto
weininger as a tragic victim of the second stage of love whichin our
daysis sick with an almost insurmountable inner insufficiency
there is no need to elaborate my subject further and point out thatthe
first stage passedthe prime of life brings with it the fusion of
sexuality and love this union is the inner meaning of marriage in the
modern sensewhether it is rarely or frequently realised is beside the
point
in previous chapters i have illustrated various phenomena of the
emotional life by showing their reflections on the lives of two or three
distinguished men in conclusion i will endeavour to point out the
reproduction of all the erotic stages through which the race has passed
in the psychical evolution of richard wagner and their immortalisation
in his works we shall recognise in him the erotic representative of
modern man a personality in whom all that which as a rule is vague and
only half expressed has become great and typical love has been the
leitmotif of his life the concluding phrase of the crude fairy tale
die feen the fairies composed by the youth of nineteen is the
infinite power of love and the last words written down two days before
his death were lovetragedy
the opera das liebesverbot the prohibition to love written in
1834 is eminently symptomatic of the first stage it is a coarser
rendering of that bluntest of all shakespearean plays measure for
measure its sole subject is the pursuit of sensual pleasure in which
all indulge and the ridiculing of those who appear to yearn for
something higher to detail the contents of the textit cannot be
called a poemwould serve no purpose biographically but not
artistically interesting it exhibits with amazing candour the first
purely sexual stage of the young man of twentyone it was the period
when young germanys device was the emancipation of sensuality wagner
himself says that his conception was mainly directed against puritan
cant and led to the bold glorification of unrestrained sensuality i
was determined to understand the grave shakespearean subject only in
this sense and in his autobiographical sketch he says i learned to
love matter in addition to this wagner gives us the following synopsis
of a lost libretto die hochzeit the wedding written at an
earlier period a youth madly in love with his friends fiance
climbs through the window into her bedroom where the latter is awaiting
the arrival of her lover the fiance struggles with the frenzied youth
and throws him down into the yard where he expires
the second discordant stage of love is embodied in tannhuser
composed when wagner was twentynine years of age there is probably no
modern work of art in which the mediaeval feeling of dualism in the
scheme of the universe has been expressed with greater pathos we see
man tossed between heaven and hell between the worshipped saint and
seductive sensuality impersonated by a shedevil a man of the middle
ages would have recognised in this work the tragedy of his soul wagner
had planned the opera before he had really reached the second period
under the title of der venusberg the mountain of venus and in
this earlier version the purely sexual occupied a far more prominent
place probably in closer conformity with the old legend for here
tannhuser returns to venus unsaved and defying the eternal values
determined to renounce a higher life and give himself up to the pleasure
of the senses for all eternity this idea was retained in a later
version up to the decisive final turn the purely spiritual love for
elizabeth eventually overcomes the unrestrained instinct
as the despairing monk of mediaeval times apparently abandoned by the
love of god turned to satan and worshipped him so tannhuser cast out
of the kingdom of heaven by the words of the pope and renounced by
elizabeth again gives himself up to sensuality which is here
contrasted with spiritual love and represented as demoniacal
tannhuser is not vacillating between the love of two womena
spiritualised and a sensual love he is wavering between the purely
spiritual love of elizabeth and promiscuous sexuality represented by
venus not centring on her as an individual but diffused as it were
through her whole kingdom the dualism which rends the whole universe is
strongly and uncompromisingly emphasised in text and music and wagner
himself explained to the opera singer schnorr von carolsfeld that the
main characteristic of the principal part was the intensest expression
of delight and remorse without any intermediate stage of feeling
changing abruptly and decisively the closing words of the first scene
my salvation lies in mary are the real turning point of the drama as
abrupt as his desertion of venus for mary is his return to her in the
third act by the side of mary is placed the more human the more
earthly but yet idealised form of elizabeth a figure closely resembling
beatrice and margaret
the music of tannhuser more especially the overture expresses the
contrast between the two erotic worldelements with striking
abruptness the harmonious and musically perfect motive of religious
yearning the chorus of the pilgrims which forms the beginning and the
end of the overture is assailed by the briefer motives of sensuous
seduction and ecstasy of the middle the quivering tickling passages of
the violins play round the sacred music of the chorale like so many
seductive elves the venusberg music is probably the most perfect
expression of pure sensuality which has ever been reached in the world
of music it is the complete translation of sensual craving and sensual
rapture into the language of music in the venusberg music composed for
the performance in paris this motive is still more richly elaborated
and the recently published sketches for the scene in the venusberg
contain a number of details which were eliminated from the later
version here bestial and demoniacal sensuality not content with human
couples nymphs maenads sirens and fauns calls for beings halfbrute
halfhuman represented by centaurs and sphinxes for black goats cats
tigers panthers and so on finally for obscene representations of
antique legends such as leda and the swan europa and the bull symbols
and illustrations of the climax of perversion it is a magnificent
poeticomusical picture of untrammelled sexuality whose queen is woman
the priestess of voluptuousness represented by venus tannhusers
yearning for humanity and divinely pure love gives to this world a tinge
of the demoniacal for the latter is nothing but natural sensuality
regarded from a higher standpoint in this case from the point of view
of spiritual love whenever it is opposed to the transcendental the
natural is conceived as dangerous and diabolical at the moment of the
abrupt inner change in tannhuser venus and her world must vanish like
a phantom of the night a consuming voluptuous excitement kept my
blood and nerves tingling while i sketched and composed the music of
tannhuser says wagner in one place and in another he confesses
that sensual pleasure while attracting and seducing him filled him
with repugnance he speaks of his longing to satisfy my craving in a
higher nobler element which unpolluted by the sensuality so
characteristic of modern life and art appears to me as something pure
something chaste and virginal unapproachable and intangible what else
can this longing for love the noblest feeling i am capable of be than
the yearning to leave this world of facts behind me and become absorbed
in an element of infinite transcendental love to which death would be
the gate
the dualism in the music of tannhuser is consistently maintained the
two elements war against each other without ever merging into one those
parts of the music which characterise elizabeth are full of noble pathos
and a little sentimental at the beginning of the second act she is not
yet herself she can still laugh like a lighthearted girl but when she
again succumbs to tannhusers unearthly and to her fatal charm and
realises how irrevocably he has surrendered himself to venus she rises
to true greatness and resolutely faces the swords unsheathed to punish
the offender before our eyes she is transformed into the saint who
realises her mission and is ready to take her burden upon her more
heroic than beatrice or margaret she points to him who laughingly
stabbed her heart the road to salvation like her two predecessors
elizabeth prays to mary for the salvation of her loverthe prayer for
the beloved has ever been womans truest and most fervent prayer
the thought of achieving a mans salvation through a great and steadfast
love is the subject of the flying dutchman and plays as is well
known an important part with wagner strange to say he has for this
very reason frequently been scoffed at by those who call themselves
admirers of goethe dantegoethes great problem of salvation is
represented in tannhuser with the utmost lucidity the essence of it
is that love can positively intervene in the life of a man whose soul is
turned towards it but who is confused and beset by temptations his
vacillating heart feels the love which is brooding over him and
ultimately abandons itself to it to be saved by its unswerving loyalty
maybe this is as much a miracle as grace but it is also a psychical
fact because the love which yearns for the sinner awakens and increases
not only his faith in its power to help but also in his own strength
darkness and evil dismay him and he turns towards the light in
tannhuser this spiritual condition which is of such primary
importance in the last scene of faust is clearly expressed his love
for elizabeth has been strong enough to kill desire kindled in his heart
again and again by venus yet again he is on the point of succumbing to
his senses the vision of venus appears before his eyes but at
wolframs exclamation elizabeth he realises in a flash that
elizabeth has been praying for him day and night and has given her life
to save him before this sudden illumination the power of venus sinks
into nothing divine love falls into his darkness like a ray of
lightoh sacred loves eternal powerit quickens his own love
which is striving upwards and with the words saint elizabeth pray
for me he sinks to the ground his way like fausts although
onesidedly emotional leads from chaos and sin to pure love and
salvation not through his own strength but by the help vouchsafed to
him in the love of his glorified mistress
by the side of the struggling suffering tannhuser tossed hither and
thither between god and the devil between elizabeth and venus stands
wolfram the untempted womanworshipper the two extremes clash upon
each other in the contest of the minnesingers tannhuser at war with
himself exasperated by the calm matteroffact way in which wolfram
sings the praise of spiritual love rushes to the other extreme and
bursts into rapturous praise of the goddess of love and the pleasure of
the senses i need not lay stress on the fact that at that time of his
life wagners own heart was the arena in which the conflict was fought
out a work like tannhuser is not made it is conceived in the
innermost soul of its creator every one of wagners great works bears
the unmistakable stamp of sincerity and intensity while with goethe on
the other hand it is not difficult to distinguish the genuine ones
that is to say those which were written under the pressure of a
compelling impulse from those which owed their existence to the
intellect rather than to the soul
tannhuser immortalises the adolescence of the european races of
mankind the third stage is not even anticipated
lohengrin the principal interest of which is other than erotic
represents a transitional phase between the second and the third stage
body and soul are no longer regarded as warring against each other a
greater harmony beyond either is dimly divined lohengrin has set out
from a distant transcendental kingdom to find earthly happiness in
elsas lovebut he is doomed to disappointment i will not analyse the
theme but rather quote a few passages from wagner lohengrin is
seeking the woman who is ready to believe in him who will not ask him
who he is and whence he comes but love him as he is and because he is
so lohengrins only desire is for love to be loved to be
understood through love in spite of the superior development of his
senses in spite of his intense consciousness he desires nothing more
than to live the life of an ordinary citizen of this earth to love and
be lovedto be a perfect specimen of humanity wagner further speaks
of his longing to find the woman the female principle quite simply
for ever appearing to him under new forms the woman for whom the
flying dutchman longed in his unfathomable distress the woman who like
a radiant star guided tannhuser from the voluptuous caverns of the
venusberg to the pure regions of the spirit and drew lohengrin from his
dazzling heights to the warm bosom of the earth we find here the new
form of love not yet fully comprehended but desired and anticipated in
art
in tristan and isolde it is attained completely and in its highest
perfection we possess in wagners letters to matilda wesendonk and in
the diary written for her the documents of the personal experience out
of which tristan grew and which unfold one of the most touching
lovestories as i have already discussed tristan and isolde in a
previous chapter i will here only quote a passage from a letter written
by wagner and addressed to liszt at the time of his first meeting with
matilda it fully expresses the harmony of the third stage give me a
heart a mind a womans love in which i can plunge my whole beingwho
will fully understand mehow little else i should need in this world
it is very significant that side by side with tristan we have die
meistersinger composed a little later on here the third stage of love
is realised in its idyllic possibility the synthesis has been given the
shape of middleclass matteroffactness that is to say the fulfilment
of love in marriage i love a maid and claim her hand for this reason
the work although the fundamental idea is not erotic is entitled to be
placed by the side of tristan with its demand for the absolute
metaphysical consummation of love
it is an amazing fact that the same genius should have experienced and
portrayed both stages so perfectly doubtless tannhuser and tristan are
the most personal selfrevelations of the great lover pulsating with
passion and far remote from the colossal objective world of the
niebelungs the lofty serenity of lohengrin and the wisdom of parsifal
wagner had finished the ring before he conceived the idea of tristan
and isolde it was printed in 1852 in the former he intentionally
raised the value of love and its position in the universe to a problem
embodying his knowledge of the world and more especially of the modern
world in supernatural mythical figures the greatest ambition of man
is power and wealth the symbol of which is a golden ring gold in
itself is innocentelementarya bauble at the bottom of the river a
toy for laughing children but the insatiable thirst for power and
wealth has robbed it of its harmlessness and made it the tool and symbol
of tyranny only a being completely in the grip of the greed for riches
and dominion a being who looks upon the world and all men as objects to
be bent to his will and who has consequently renounced love could have
thus enslaved the world love does not impair the worth of a
fellowcreature but sets him above all things a lover cannot be
entirely selfish his feeling at least for his mistress and through her
for the rest of the world must be pure and unselfish the struggle
between these two most powerful instincts both in the race and in the
heart of the individual wotan is the incomparable subject of this
tragedy the whole worldprocess is represented as a struggle between
the apparently great who are yet the slaves of gold and authority and
the truly free man who serves love and on whom ambition has no hold
the representatives of the petty greedy toiling human vermin who
readily renounced love for the sake of wealth because the latter will
always buy lust and pleasure are the niebelungs the dwellers in the
netherworld who never see the sun they have but one standard money
one supreme value power the gift of wealth mime bewails his people
the small tradesmen as it were as follows lighthearted smiths we
used to fashion gems and trinkets for our wives gorgeous jewels the
niebelungs pretty trifleswe laughed at the labour but alberich the
capitalist through the magic of the ring has usurped the power and
enslaved his fellows now the felon compels us to creep in the heart of
the mountains to labour for him there we must delve and explore and
despoil plunder and smelt and hammer the metal restlessly toiling to
increase his treasure the really daemonic property of the gold is that
everybody succumbs to its seduction and strives to possess it the
former nave joy of living embodied in the rhinedaughters and their
not yet humanised song which seems to come direct from the heart of
nature is destroyed by the theft of the rhinegold what till then had
been a serenely shining star of the deep has been transformed into a
means by which to win authority the programme of the greedy and
tyrannous never varies alberich proclaims it the whole world will i
win and it is his daemonic will to depreciate love and set up power as
the only value so that nobody shall doubt his greatness and unique
genius as i renounce love so all shall renounce it with gold have i
bought you for gold shall you crave love shall die and lust shall
take its place he will force even the wives of the gods to do his will
for his wealth has made him master of the whole world compared to his
restless activity the giant fafner is stupid he is incapable of
transforming gold into power he merely enjoys its possession content
with the consciousness of his wealth
but the curse of alberich the first who transmuted the shining metal
into money rests on gold and power it shall not bring gladnesswho
has it be seared by sorrow who lacks it devoured by envy the curse
of the eternal concatenation tyrannyslavery the care which
accompanies wealth and the envy of the havenots can only be lifted
from the world by a man who is inwardly free who is neither master nor
slave siegfried understands the song of the birds and the elementary
beings the rhinedaughters he is a stranger to human desires and
passions i inherited nothing but my bodyand living it is consumed
he is proof against the magic of the ring the only value he knows is
love alberich his opponent says in speaking of him my curse has no
sting for the mettlesome hero for he knows not the worth of the ring
he squanders his prodigal strength laughing and glowing with love his
body is burning away half way between alberich the inwardly worthless
wielder of power and siegfried the truly free man the embodiment of
all virtue who is murdered by the powers of darkness stands wotan in
whose heart both motives authority and love are struggling for
supremacy who will renounce neither love nor power artistically and
symbolically the salvation of the world from the curse of greed and
tyranny is brought about by the restitution of the ring and its
dissolution in the pure waters of the river from whence it had been
taken the gold is given back to the rhinedaughters to fulfil again
its original purpose namely to delight the heart of man with its
dazzling sheen
thus wagner the greatest and most inspired exponent of love among
modern artists declared that of all values love was the greatest his
intuitive genius left all the doctrines formulated by schopenhauer and
buddha far behind and definitely rejected pessimism as a creed there is
an interesting letter from him to matilda wesendonk written while he
was composing the music of tristan and containing modifications of
schopenhauers philosophy which he considered requisite it is a
question of pointing out the road to salvation which no philosopher not
even schopenhauer discovered the road which leads to the perfect
pacification of the will through love i do not mean abstract love for
all humanity but true love based on sexual love that is to say love
between man and woman
in parsifal the last and most mature of all his works wagner is
breaking new ground here love between man and woman is deposed from the
exalted position it hitherto held subordinated to the metaphysical
purpose of the world that is to say the purpose of attaining to
perfection and absorbed in a higher association of ideas sexual love
has undergone a change it is no longer love in the true sense but the
unconditional love of the mystic the enigmatical figure of kundry is
not the impersonation of one woman she is woman herself the
incarnation of everything female she embodies the sensuous seductive
and destructive element together with the contempt of the man who falls
under her spell as well as the motherly and finally the
humblyadministrative principle which so far had not yet become a part
of the erotic ideal she is both positive and negative a blind tool of
the element of evil which prompts man to forget his higher mission
reminiscent of the second mediaeval period and passionately yearning
for salvation she dies before the holy grail the religious ideal made
visible beside kundry there are the flowermaidens navely sensuous
beings who blossom like the flowers and fade again unconscious and
irresponsible i refrain from a discussion of this work which would
lead too far and only maintain that the music corresponding to the
text is entirely unerotic and unsentimental absolutely pure and
religious the love of a man for a woman has been superseded by love for
the absolute and supernatural thus after wagner had experienced all
the stages of love through which humanity has passed and embodied them
in his works he reached a new point of view a stage to which we have
not yet attained and which very likely we are not even able fully to
understand this fourth stagenot unlike weiningers idealis the
overthrow of the female and earthly element in man by a voluntary
surrender to the metaphysical
wagners last position taken up quite deliberately permits of two
explanations which i will point out without pressing either of them
only a man possessing both the wisdom of the aged wagner and a knowledge
of the evolution of the race and the road which still stretches out in
front of it would be entitled to speak a decisive word the first
obviously is that wagner divined a last stage in the emotional life of
man a period which has outgrown sexual love and replaced it by
mysticism in conjecturing a potential fourth stage the three previous
ones must be regarded as one the second explanation is that wagners
feeling in his last work is no longer representative of the feeling of
the race but is as it were a personal matter at least in so far as
love is concerned for although the principal subject in parsifal is
not love yet it plays a very prominent part in it i am only touching
upon these two alternatives but if the latter debatable point be
omitted my analysis of wagners emotional life must have shown in which
sense the inspired man may be rightly regarded as typical of the race
he leads the broadest and at the same time the most personal life and
yet he manifests in it something which is far greater far more
universal and representative
my argument proves that the evolution as well as the aberrations of love
have affected man alone and roughly speaking to this day affect only
him he is the odysseus wandering through heaven and hell ultimately
to return home perhaps to where woman the unchangeable is awaiting
him that which has been womans natural endowment from all beginning
the blending of spiritual and sensual love man looks upon and desires
today as his highest erotic ideal his chaotic sexual impulse the
inheritance of the past appears to him low and base in the presence of
her in whom sexuality has always been blended with love his worship
intensified until it reached the metaphysical seems to him unfounded
and eccentric before her who has ever been and ever will be entirely
human and who is perfect in his eyes because she possesses what he is
striving after this and nothing else is the meaning of the vague
statement that in all matters pertaining to love woman occupies a higher
position than man she is always the same he is always new and
problematical never perfect he falls into error and sin where she
cannot err for her instinct is nature herself and she knows not the
meaning of sin whatever burden man has laid upon her she has borne it
patiently and silently she has allowed him to worship her as a goddess
and stigmatise her as a fiend while all the time she remained
problemless and natural inwardly remote from the aberrations in which
her intellect believed so readily the conclusion which we have to draw
and which touches the foundation of the psychology of both sexes is
that only mans emotions have a history while those of the woman have
undergone no change
if there is a law by which the human race is reproduced in the
individual then the socalled atavism in the shape of abnormality
cannot be the sudden or apparently sudden reappearance of conditions
which once were normal and then disappeared rather must it be the final
arrest of an individual on a previous and lower stage preventing him
from reaching our standard in one or the other emotional sphere the
more humanity a man has in him the more perfectly will he repeat in his
life the stages through which the race has passed or in other words
the oftener that which once quickened the heart of man is repeated and
surpassed the greater is the possibility that new things may grow out
of it atavism therefore is not so much the persistence of the earlier
as the absence of the later stages this agrees with freuds conception
of the neurotic subject
it is obvious that the three stages of love are merely the expression of
a period in one definite direction the emotions of antiquity were
entirely earthly obvious and impersonal the middle ages on the other
hand attached value only to the world beyond the grave and matters
pertaining to the soul the beauty of spring was to them but a reflexion
of another beauty
     how glorious is life below
     what greater glories may the heavens hold
sings brother john characteristically but our period is conscious of
the need of realising all our desires and attaining to the highest
possible spiritual perfection in this earthly life and this not by
destroying the transcendent ideals but by stripping them of their
metaphysical character and bringing them to bear on this life so that
it may become a higher and holier one the will of our intellectual
heroes is not the rejection of the doctrine of the survival of the soul
but the comprehension of past transcendental values so that they may
become a safe guide to us in this earthly life a more perfect blending
of realism and idealism the glorification of life under the aspect of
eternity this applies to love as well the thought of the infinite
eternal love must transfigure and ennoble all that which is natural and
human
if my theories are correct they prove the ontological character of
historical evolution and the value of the study of history for the
comprehension of the human soul i have shown in a specific and highly
important domain that that which we are fond of regarding as the
characteristic quality of man was not present from the beginning but
has gradually been evolved in historical time in other words history
can and must teach us the origin and evolution of the spirit and soul of
man as anthropology teaches us the construction of the body in
philosophically approaching history it must not be our object to
discover what has been but what has become how we became and what
we are the science of history which loses sight of its bearing on our
time content with its knowledge of the past is antiquarian and dead
at the most it has aesthetic value but it is worthless as far as the
history of civilisation is concerned only that which has been
productive in the past which has had a quickening influence producing
new values is historical in the highest sense it creates a new and
close relationship between psychology and history the principal
purpose or one of the principal purposes of psychology that is the
knowledge of the construction of the normal human being has received a
new possibility of solution every essential quality which the human
race has evolved in the course of history must be present in every
normally developed individual of our time the normal man of today is
not the normal man of the past every successive century finds him
richer and more complex but he can always be discovered intuitively in
history in this sense history is an auxiliary science of psychology or
rather the psychology of the human race for the evolution of the
psychology of the individualwhich has been studied very littleis
merely an abbreviated history of the evolution of the psychology of the
species a past period of civilisation can be traced in the life of
every fully developed man and vice versa the stages in the life of
the individual point the way in history
if it can be established that the fundamental emotions of the human
heart originated in historical time the widely spread but unproved
theory that everything great and decisive existed from the beginning
will be contradicted the other complementary assertion that nothing
which once existed ever quite disappears must be admitted nothing
perishes in the soul of man its position with regard to the whole is
merely shifted by newly intervening motives and values and even when
it does not change its fundamental character it becomes a different
thing in the whole complex of the soul sexuality which in the remote
past was a matter of course unassailable by doubt became problematical
and demoniacal as soon as it entered into relationship with the new
factors of erotic life an existence in harmony with nature was possible
as long as the human race was still in evolution and not yet conscious
of itself but as soon as intellect and selfconsciousness had been
evolved civilisation became possible nature has no history in the
sense of the origin of values in the case of still uncivilised tribes
every new generation is a faithful reproduction of the preceding one
certainly there is modification caused by adaptation to the environment
but there are no moral values and consequently there is no history
i have attempted to explain why tragedy is inseparable from love in its
highest intensity to show the limits which check all deep emotion and
the yearning which would overstep them the emotional life of man which
is capable of infinite evolution can only find satisfaction on its
lower animal stages hunger thirst and sexual craving can be
satisfied without much difficulty and therefore no tragic shadow falls
on the first stage but the emotion which overwhelms the soul cannot be
appeased not only the great thinkers thirst for knowledge the
mystics religious yearning the aesthetic will of the rare artist but
also the love and longing of the passionate lover must reach beyond the
attainable to the infinite this earth is the kingdom of mean actions
mean emotions and mean men and the lover unable to bear its
limits creates for himself a new worldthe world of metaphysical lov
