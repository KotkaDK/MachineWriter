preface
the rapid advances made in the science of botany within the last few
years necessitate changes in the text books in use as well as in
methods of teaching having in his own experience as a teacher felt
the need of a book different from any now in use the author has
prepared the present volume with a hope that it may serve the purpose
for which it is intended viz an introduction to the study of botany
for use in high schools especially but sufficiently comprehensive to
serve also as a beginning book in most colleges
it does not pretend to be a complete treatise of the whole science
and this it is hoped will be sufficient apology for the absence from
its pages of many important subjects especially physiological topics
it was found impracticable to compress within the limits of a book of
moderate size anything like a thorough discussion of even the most
important topics of all the departments of botany as a thorough
understanding of the structure of any organism forms the basis of all
further intelligent study of the same it has seemed to the author
proper to emphasize this feature in the present work which is
professedly an introduction only to the science
this structural work has been supplemented by so much classification
as will serve to make clear the relationships of different groups and
the principles upon which the classification is based as well as
enable the student to recognize the commoner types of the different
groups as they are met with the aim of this book is not however
merely the identification of plants we wish here to enter a strong
protest against the only too prevalent idea that the chief aim of
botany is the ability to run down a plant by means of an analytical
key the subject being exhausted as soon as the name of the plant is
discovered a knowledge of the plant itself is far more important than
its name however desirable it may be to know the latter
in selecting the plants employed as examples of the different groups
such were chosen as far as possible as are everywhere common of
course this was not always possible as some important forms eg
the red and brown seaweeds are necessarily not always readily
procurable by all students but it will be found that the great
majority of the forms used or closely related ones are within the
reach of nearly all students and such directions are given for
collecting and preserving them as will make it possible even for those
in the larger cities to supply themselves with the necessary
materials such directions too for the manipulation and examination
of specimens are given as will make the book it is hoped a
laboratory guide as well as a manual of classification indeed it is
primarily intended that the book should so serve as a help in the
study of the actual specimens
although much can be done in the study even of the lowest plants
without microscopic aid other than a hand lens for a thorough
understanding of the structure of any plant a good compound microscope
is indispensable and wherever it is possible the student should be
provided with such an instrument to use this book to the best
advantage as however many are not able to have the use of a
microscope the gross anatomy of all the forms described has been
carefully treated for the especial benefit of such students such
portions of the text as well as the general discussions are printed
in ordinary type while the minute anatomy and all points requiring
microscopic aid are discussed in separate paragraphs printed in
smaller type
the drawings with very few exceptions which are duly credited were
drawn from nature by the author and nearly all expressly for this
work
a list of the most useful books of reference is appended all of which
have been more or less consulted in the preparation of the following
pages
the classification adopted is with slight changes that given in
goebels outlines of morphology and classification while perhaps
not in all respects entirely satisfactory it seems to represent more
nearly than any other our present knowledge of the subject certain
groups like the diatoms and charace are puzzles to the botanist
and at present it is impossible to give them more than a provisional
place in the system
if this volume serves to give the student some comprehension of the
real aims of botanical science and its claims to be something more
than the analysis of flowers it will have fulfilled its mission

botany
chapter i
introduction
all matter is composed of certain constituents about seventy are at
present known which so far as the chemist is concerned are
indivisible and are known as elements
of the innumerable combinations of these elements two general classes
may be recognized organic and inorganic bodies while it is
impossible owing to the dependence of all organized matter upon
inorganic matter to give an absolute definition we at once recognize
the peculiarities of organic or living bodies as distinguished from
inorganic or nonliving ones all living bodies feed grow and
reproduce these acts being the result of the action of forces
resident within the organism inorganic bodies on the other hand
remain as a rule unchanged so long as they are not acted upon by
external forces
all living organisms are dependent for existence upon inorganic
matter and sooner or later return these elements to the sources
whence they came thus a plant extracts from the earth and air
certain inorganic compounds which are converted by the activity of the
plant into a part of its own substance becoming thus incorporated
into a living organism after the plant dies however it undergoes
decomposition and the elements are returned again to the earth and
atmosphere from which they were taken
investigation has shown that living bodies contain comparatively few
elements but these are combined into extraordinarily complex
compounds the following elements appear to be essential to all living
bodies carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen sulphur potassium
besides these there are several others usually present but not
apparently essential to all organisms these include phosphorus iron
calcium sodium magnesium chlorine silicon
as we examine more closely the structure and functions of organic
bodies an extraordinary uniformity is apparent in all of them this
is disguised in the more specialized forms but in the simpler ones is
very apparent owing to this any attempt to separate absolutely the
animal and vegetable kingdoms proves futile
the science that treats of living things irrespective of the
distinction between plant and animal is called biology but for
many purposes it is desirable to recognize the distinctions making
two departments of biologybotany treating of plants and zology
of animals it is with the first of these only that we shall concern
ourselves here
when one takes up a plant his attention is naturally first drawn to
its general appearance and structure whether it is a complicated one
like one of the flowering plants or some humbler member of the
vegetable kingdoma moss seaweed toadstoolor even some still
simpler plant like a mould or the apparently structureless green scum
that floats on a stagnant pond in any case the impulse is to
investigate the form and structure as far as the means at ones
disposal will permit such a study of structure constitutes
morphology which includes two departmentsgross anatomy or a
general study of the parts and minute anatomy or histology in
which a microscopic examination is made of the structure of the
different parts a special department of morphology called
embryology is often recognized this embraces a study of the
development of the organism from its earliest stage and also the
development of its different members
from a study of the structure of organisms we get a clue to their
relationships and upon the basis of such relationships are enabled to
classify them or unite them into groups so as to indicate the degree
to which they are related this constitutes the division of botany
usually known as classification or systematic botany
finally we may study the functions or workings of an organism how it
feeds breathes moves reproduces this is physiology and like
classification must be preceded by a knowledge of the structures
concerned
for the study of the gross anatomy of plants the following articles
will be found of great assistance 1 a sharp knife and for more
delicate tissues a razor 2 a pair of small finepointed scissors
3 a pair of mounted needles these can be made by forcing ordinary
sewing needles into handles of pine or other soft wood 4 a hand
lens 5 drawingpaper and pencil and a note book
for the study of the lower plants as well as the histology of the
higher ones a compound microscope is indispensable instruments with
lenses magnifying from about 20 to 500 diameters can be had at a cost
varying from about 20 to 30 and are sufficient for any ordinary
investigations
objects to be studied with the compound microscope are usually
examined by transmitted light and must be transparent enough to allow
the light to pass through the objects are placed upon small glass
slips slides manufactured for the purpose and covered with
extremely thin plates of glass also specially made if the body to be
examined is a large one thin slices or sections must be made this
for most purposes may be done with an ordinary razor most plant
tissues are best examined ordinarily in water though of course
specimens so mounted cannot be preserved for any length of time1
1 for the mounting of permanent preparations see chapter xix
in addition to the implements used in studying the gross anatomy the
following will be found useful in histological work 1 a small
camelshair brush for picking up small sections and putting water in
the slides 2 small forceps for handling delicate objects 3
blotting paper for removing superfluous water from the slides and
drawing fluids under the cover glass 4 pieces of elder or sunflower
pith for holding small objects while making sections
in addition to these implements a few reagents may be recommended for
the simpler histological work the most important of these are
alcohol glycerine potash a strong solution of potassium hydrate in
water iodine either a little of the commercial tincture of iodine
in water or better a solution of iodine in iodide of potassium
acetic acid and some staining fluid an aqueous or alcoholic
solution of gentian violet or methyl violet is one of the best
a careful record should be kept by the student of all work done both
by means of written notes and drawings for most purposes pencil
drawings are most convenient and these should be made with a
moderately soft pencil on unruled paper if it is desired to make the
drawings with ink a careful outline should first be made with a hard
pencil and this inked over with indiaink or black drawing ink ink
drawings are best made upon light bristol board with a hard
smoothfinished surface
when obtainable the student will do best to work with freshly
gathered specimens but as these are not always to be had when wanted
a few words about gathering and preserving material may be of service
most of the lower green plants alg may be kept for a long time in
glass jars or other vessels provided care is taken to remove all
dead specimens at first and to renew the water from time to time they
usually thrive best in a north window where they get little or no
direct sunshine and it is well to avoid keeping them too warm
numbers of the most valuable fungiie the lower plants that are
not greengrow spontaneously on many organic substances that are kept
warm and moist fresh bread kept moist and covered with a glass will
in a short time produce a varied crop of moulds and fresh horse
manure kept in the same way serves to support a still greater number
of fungi
mosses ferns etc can be raised with a little care and of course
very many flowering plants are readily grown in pots
most of the smaller parasitic fungi rusts mildews etc may be kept
dry for any length of time and on moistening with a weak solution of
caustic potash will serve nearly as well as freshly gathered specimens
for most purposes
when it is desired to preserve as perfectly as possible the more
delicate plant structures for future study strong alcohol is the best
and most convenient preserving agent except for loss of color it
preserves nearly all plant tissues perfectly
chapter ii
the cell
if we make a thin slice across the stem of a rapidly growing
planteg geranium begonia celerymount it in water and
examine it microscopically it will be found to be made up of numerous
cavities or chambers separated by delicate partitions often these
cavities are of sufficient size to be visible to the naked eye and
examined with a hand lens the section appears like a piece of fine
lace each mesh being one of the chambers visible when more strongly
magnified these chambers are known as cells and of them the whole
plant is built up
illustration fig 1a single cell from a hair on the stamen of the
common spiderwort tradescantia  150 pr protoplasm w cell
wall n nucleus
  in order to study the structure of the cell more exactly we will
  select such as may be examined without cutting them a good example
  is furnished by the common spiderwort fig 1 attached to the base
  of the stamens fig 85 b are delicate hairs composed of chains
  of cells which may be examined alive by carefully removing a stamen
  and placing it in a drop of water under a cover glass each cell
  fig 1 is an oblong sac with a delicate colorless wall which
  chemical tests show to be composed of cellulose a substance closely
  resembling starch within this sac and forming a lining to it is
  a thin layer of colorless matter containing many fine granules
  bands and threads of the same substance traverse the cavity of the
  cell which is filled with a deep purple homogeneous fluid this
  fluid which in most cells is colorless is called the cell sap and
  is composed mainly of water imbedded in the granular lining of the
  sac is a roundish body n which itself has a definite membrane
  and usually shows one or more roundish bodies within besides an
  indistinctly granular appearance this body is called the nucleus of
  the cell and the small one within it the nucleolus
  the membrane surrounding the cell is known as the cell wall and in
  young plant cells is always composed of cellulose
  the granular substance lining the cell wall fig 1 pr is
  called protoplasm and with the nucleus constitutes the living
  part of the cell if sufficiently magnified the granules within the
  protoplasm will be seen to be in active streaming motion this
  movement which is very evident here is not often so conspicuous
  but still may often be detected without difficulty
illustration fig 2an amba a cell without a cell wall n
nucleus v vacuoles  300
the cell may be regarded as the unit of organic structure and of
cells are built up all of the complicated structures of which the
bodies of the highest plants and animals are composed we shall find
that the cells may become very much modified for various purposes but
at first they are almost identical in structure and essentially the
same as the one we have just considered

cells the terminal rounded cell secretes a peculiar scented oil that
gives the plant its characteristic odor b  50 c  150
very many of the lower forms of life consist of but a single cell
which may occasionally be destitute of a cell wall such a form is
shown in figure 2 here we have a mass of protoplasm with a nucleus
n and cavities vacuoles v filled with cell sap but no cell
wall the protoplasm is in constant movement and by extensions of a
portion of the mass and contraction of other parts the whole creeps
slowly along other naked cells fig 12 b fig 16 c are
provided with delicate threadlike processes of protoplasm called
cilia sing cilium which are in active vibration and propel
the cell through the water

young plant of a fern  150 the contents of the cell contracted
by the action of a solution of sugar
  on placing a cell into a fluid denser than the cell sap eg a
  tenpercent solution of sugar in water a portion of the water
  will be extracted from the cell and we shall then see the
  protoplasm receding from the wall fig 4 c showing that it is
  normally in a state of tension due to pressure from within of the
  cell sap the cell wall shows the same thing though in a less
  degree owing to its being much more rigid than the protoplasmic
  lining it is owing to the partial collapsing of the cells
  consequent on loss of water that plants wither when the supply of
  water is cut off
as cells grow new ones are formed in various ways if the new cells
remain together cell aggregates called tissues are produced and
of these tissues are built up the various organs of the higher plants
the simplest tissues are rows of cells such as form the hairs
covering the surface of the organs of many flowering plants fig 3
and are due to a division of the cells in a single direction if the
divisions take place in three planes masses of cells such as make up
the stems etc of the higher plants result fig 4 a b

classification of plantsprotophytes
for the sake of convenience it is desirable to collect into groups
such plants as are evidently related but as our knowledge of many
forms is still very imperfect any classification we may adopt must be
to a great extent only provisional and subject to change at any time
as new forms are discovered or others become better understood
the following general divisions are usually accepted i subkingdom
or branch ii class iii order iv family v genus vi species
to illustrate the white pine belongs to the highest great division
subkingdom of the plant kingdom the plants of this division all
produce seeds and hence are called spermaphytes seed plants
they may be divided into two groups classes distinguished by
certain peculiarities in the flowers and seeds these are named
respectively gymnosperms and angiosperms and to the first our
plant belongs the gymnosperms may be further divided into several
subordinate groups orders one of which the conifers or
conebearing evergreens includes our plant this order includes
several families among them the fir family abietine including
the pines and firs of the subdivisions genera sing genus of
the fir family one of the most familiar is the genus pinus which
embraces all the true pines comparing different kinds of pines we
find that they differ in the form of the cones arrangement of the
leaves and other minor particulars the form we have selected differs
from all other native forms in its cones and also in having the
leaves in fives instead of twos or threes as in most other kinds
therefore to distinguish the white pine from all other pines it is
given a specific name strobus
the following table will show more plainly what is meant

protophytes
the name protophytes protophyta has been applied to a large number
of simple plants which differ a good deal among themselves some of
them differ strikingly from the higher plants and resemble so
remarkably certain low forms of animal life as to be quite
indistinguishable from them at least in certain stages indeed there
are certain forms that are quite as much animal as vegetable in their
attributes and must be regarded as connecting the two kingdoms such
forms are the slime moulds fig 5 euglena fig 9 volvox
fig 10 and others

bit of rotten wood  3 b outline of a part of the same  25

other protophytes while evidently enough of vegetable nature are
nevertheless very different in some respects from the higher plants
the protophytes may be divided into three classes i the slime moulds
myxomycetes ii the schizophytes iii the green monads
volvocine
class ithe slime moulds
these curious organisms are among the most puzzling forms with which
the botanist has to do as they are so much like some of the lowest
forms of animal life as to be scarcely distinguishable from them and
indeed they are sometimes regarded as animals rather than plants at
certain stages they consist of naked masses of protoplasm of very
considerable size not infrequently several centimetres in diameter
these are met with on decaying logs in damp woods on rotting leaves
and other decaying vegetable matter the commonest ones are bright
yellow or whitish and form soft slimy coverings over the substratum
fig 5 a penetrating into its crevices and showing sensitiveness
toward light the plasmodium as the mass of protoplasm is called may
be made to creep upon a slide in the following way a tumbler is
filled with water and placed in a saucer filled with sand a strip of
blotting paper about the width of the slide is now placed with one end
in the water the other hanging over the edge of the glass and against
one side of a slide which is thus held upright but must not be
allowed to touch the side of the tumbler the strip of blotting paper
sucks up the water which flows slowly down the surface of the slide
in contact with the blotting paper if now a bit of the substance upon
which the plasmodium is growing is placed against the bottom of the
slide on the side where the stream of water is the protoplasm will
creep up against the current of water and spread over the slide
forming delicate threads in which most active streaming movements of
the central granular protoplasm may be seen under the microscope and
the ends of the branches may be seen to push forward much as we saw in
the amba in order that the experiment may be successful the whole
apparatus should be carefully protected from the light and allowed to
stand for several hours this power of movement as well as the power
to take in solid food are eminently animal characteristics though
the former is common to many plants as well
after a longer or shorter time the mass of protoplasm contracts and
gathers into little heaps each of which develops into a structure
that has no resemblance to any animal but would be at once placed
with plants in one common form trichia these are round or
pearshaped bodies of a yellow color and about as big as a pin head
fig 5 d occurring in groups on rotten logs in damp woods
others are stalked arcyria stemonitis fig 5 j k and
of various colorsred brown etc the outer part of the structure
is a more or less firm wall which breaks when ripe discharging a
powdery mass mixed in most forms with very fine fibres
  when strongly magnified the fine dust is found to be made up of
  innumerable small cells with thick walls marked with ridges or
  processes which differ much in different species the fibres also
  differ much in different genera sometimes they are simple
  hairlike threads in others they are hollow tubes with spiral
  thickenings often very regularly placed running around their
  walls
  the spores may sometimes be made to germinate by placing them in a
  drop of water and allowing them to remain in a warm place for about
  twentyfour hours if the experiment has been successful at the end
  of this time the spore membrane will have burst and the contents
  escaped in the form of a naked mass of protoplasm zospore with a
  nucleus and often showing a vacuole fig 5 v that
  alternately becomes much distended and then disappears entirely on
  first escaping it is usually provided with a long whiplike
  filament of protoplasm which is in active movement and by means of
  which the cell swims actively through the water fig 5 i i
  sometimes such a cell will be seen to divide into two the process
  taking but a short time so that the numbers of these cells under
  favorable conditions may become very large after a time the lash is
  withdrawn and the cell assumes much the form of a small amba i
  ii
the succeeding stages are difficult to follow after repeatedly
dividing a large number of these ambalike cells run together
coalescing when they come in contact and forming a mass of protoplasm
that grows and finally assumes the form from which it started
  of the common forms of slime moulds the species of trichia figs
  d i and physarum are perhaps the best for studying the
  germination as the spores are larger than in most other forms and
  germinate more readily the experiment is apt to be most successful
  if the spores are sown in a drop of water in which has been infused
  some vegetable matter such as a bit of rotten wood boiling
  thoroughly to kill all germs a drop of this fluid should be placed
  on a perfectly clean cover glass which it is well to pass once or
  twice through a flame and the spores transferred to this drop with
  a needle previously heated by these precautions foreign germs will
  be avoided which otherwise may interfere seriously with the growth
  of the young slime moulds after sowing the spores in the drop of
  culture fluid the whole should be inverted over a socalled moist
  chamber this is simply a square of thick blotting paper in which
  an opening is cut small enough to be entirely covered by the cover
  glass but large enough so that the drop in the centre of the cover
  glass will not touch the sides of the chamber but will hang
  suspended clear in it the blotting paper should be soaked
  thoroughly in pure water distilled water is preferable and then
  placed on a slide covering carefully with the cover glass with the
  suspended drop of fluid containing the spores the whole should be
  kept under cover so as to prevent loss of water by evaporation by
  this method the spores may be examined conveniently without
  disturbing them and the whole may be kept as long as desired so
  long as the blotting paper is kept wet so as to prevent the
  suspended drop from drying up
class iischizophytes
the schizophytes are very small plants though not infrequently
occurring in masses of considerable size they are among the commonest
of all plants and are found everywhere they multiply almost entirely
by simple transverse division or splitting of the cells whence their
name there are two pretty wellmarked ordersthe bluegreen slimes
cyanophyce and the bacteria schizomycetes they are
distinguished primarily by the first with a very few exceptions
containing chlorophyll leafgreen which is entirely absent from
nearly all of the latter
the bluegreen slimes these are with few exceptions green plants of
simple structure but possessing in addition to the ordinary green
pigment chlorophyll or leafgreen another coloring matter soluble
in water and usually blue in color though sometimes yellowish or
red

filaments of the natural size b single filament  300 c a
piece of a filament that has become separated s sheath  300
as a representative of the group we will select one of the commonest
forms oscillaria known sometimes as green slime from forming a
dark bluegreen or blackish slimy coat over the mud at the bottom of
stagnant or sluggish water in watering troughs on damp rocks or
even on moist earth a search in the places mentioned can hardly fail
to secure plenty of specimens for study if a bit of the slimy mass is
transferred to a china dish or placed with considerable water on a
piece of stiff paper after a short time the edge of the mass will
show numerous extremely fine filaments of a dark bluegreen color
radiating in all directions from the mass fig 6 a the filaments
are the individual plants and possess considerable power of motion
as is shown by letting the mass remain undisturbed for a day or two
at the end of which time they will have formed a thin film over the
surface of the vessel in which they are kept and the radiating
arrangement of the filaments can then be plainly seen
if the mass is allowed to dry on the paper it often leaves a bright
blue stain due to the blue pigment in the cells of the filament this
blue color can also be extracted by pulverizing a quantity of the
dried plants and pouring water over them the water soon becoming
tinged with a decided blue if now the water containing the blue
pigment is filtered and the residue treated with alcohol the latter
will extract the chlorophyll becoming colored of a yellowgreen
  the microscope shows that the filaments of which the mass is
  composed fig 6 b are single rows of short cylindrical cells of
  uniform diameter except at the end of the filament where they
  usually become somewhat smaller so that the tip is more or less
  distinctly pointed the protoplasm of the cells has a few small
  granules scattered through it and is colored uniformly of a pale
  bluegreen no nucleus can be seen
  if the filament is broken there may generally be detected a
  delicate colorless sheath that surrounds it and extends beyond the
  end cells fig 6 c the filament increases in length by the
  individual cells undergoing division this always taking place at
  right angles to the axis of the filament new filaments are produced
  simply by the older ones breaking into a number of pieces each of
  which rapidly grows to full size
the name oscillaria arises from the peculiar oscillating or swinging
movements that the plant exhibits the most marked movement is a
swaying from side to side combined with a rotary motion of the free
ends of the filaments which are often twisted together like the
strands of a rope if the filaments are entirely free they may often
be observed to move forward with a slow creeping movement just how
these movements are caused is still a matter of controversy
the lowest of the cyanophyce are strictly singlecelled separating
as soon as formed but cohering usually in masses or colonies by means
of a thick mucilaginous substance that surrounds them fig 7 d
the higher ones are filaments in which there may be considerable
differentiation these often occur in masses of considerable size
forming jellylike lumps which may be soft or quite firm fig 7
a b they are sometimes found on damp ground but more commonly
attached to plants stones etc in water the masses vary in color
from light brown to deep blackish green and in size from that of a
pin head to several centimetres in diameter

in the higher forms special cells called heterocysts are found they
are colorless or light yellowish regularly disposed but their
function is not known besides these certain cells become
thickwalled and form resting cells spores for the propagation of
the plant fig 7 c sp in species where the sheath of the
filament is well marked fig 7 h groups of cells slip out of the
sheath and develop a new one thus giving rise to a new plant
the bacteria schizomycetes although among the commonest of
organisms owing to their excessive minuteness are difficult to
study especially for the beginner they resemble in their general
structure and methods of reproduction the bluegreen slimes but are
with very few exceptions destitute of chlorophyll although often
possessing bright pigmentsblue violet red etc it is one of
these that sometimes forms bloodred spots in flour paste or bits of
bread that have been kept very moist and warm they are universally
present where decomposition is going on and are themselves the
principal agents of decay which is the result of their feeding upon
the substance as like all plants without chlorophyll they require
organic matter for food most of the species are very tenacious of
life and may be completely dried up for a long time without dying
and on being placed in water will quickly revive being so extremely
small they are readily carried about in the air in their driedup
condition and thus fall upon exposed bodies setting up decomposition
if the conditions are favorable
a simple experiment to show this may be performed by taking two test
tubes and partly filling them with an infusion of almost any organic
substance dried leaves or hay or a bit of meat will answer the
fluid should now be boiled so as to kill any germs that may be in it
and while hot one of the vessels should be securely stopped up with a
plug of cotton wool and the other left open the cotton prevents
access of all solid particles but allows the air to enter if proper
care has been taken the infusion in the closed vessel will remain
unchanged indefinitely but the other will soon become turbid and a
disagreeable odor will be given off microscopic examination shows the
first to be free from germs of any kind while the second is swarming
with various forms of bacteria
illustration fig 8bacteria
these little organisms have of late years attracted the attention of
very many scientists from the fact that to them is due many if not
all contagious diseases the germs of many such diseases have been
isolated and experiments prove beyond doubt that these are alone the
causes of the diseases in question
  if a drop of water containing bacteria is examined we find them to
  be excessively small many of them barely visible with the strongest
  lenses the larger ones fig 8 recall quite strongly the smaller
  species of oscillaria and exhibit similar movements others are so
  small as to appear as mere lines and dots even with the strongest
  lenses among the common forms are small nearly globular cells
  oblong rodshaped or threadshaped filaments either straight or
  curved or even spirally twisted frequently they show a quick
  movement which is probably in all cases due to cilia which are
  however too small to be seen in most cases

reproduction is for the most part by simple transverse division as in
oscillaria but occasionally spores are produced also
class iiigreen monads volvocine
this group of the protophytes is unquestionably closely related to
certain low animals monads or flagellata with which they are
sometimes united they are characterized by being actively motile and
are either strictly unicellular or the cells are united by a
gelatinous envelope into a colony of definite form
of the first group euglena fig 9 may be selected as a type
  this organism is found frequently among other alg and occasionally
  forms a green film on stagnant water it is sometimes regarded as a
  plant sometimes as an animal and is an elongated somewhat
  wormlike cell without a definite cell wall so that it can change
  its form to some extent the protoplasm contains oval masses which
  are bright green in color but the forward pointed end of the cell
  is colorless and has a little depression at this end there is a
  long vibratile protoplasmic filament c by means of which the
  cell moves there is also to be seen near this end a red speck e
  which is probably sensitive to light a nucleus can usually be seen
  if the cell is first killed with an iodine solution which often
  will render the flagellum c more evident this being invisible
  while the cell is in motion the cells multiply by division
  previous to this the flagellum is withdrawn and a firm cell wall is
  formed about the cell fig 9 b the contents then divide into
  two or more parts which afterwards escape as new individuals
of the forms that are united in colonies2 one of the best known is
volvox fig 10 this plant is sometimes found in quiet water
where it floats on or near the surface as a dark green ball just
large enough to be seen with the naked eye they may be kept for some
time in aquaria and will sometimes multiply rapidly but are very
susceptible to extremes of temperature especially of heat
2 the term colony is perhaps inappropriate as the whole mass of
cells arises from a single one and may properly be looked upon as an
individual plant
illustration fig 10volvox a mature colony containing
several smaller ones x  50 b two cells showing the cilia
 300
  the colony fig 10 a is a hollow sphere the numerous green
  cells of which it is composed forming a single layer on the outside
  by killing with iodine and using a strong lens each cell is seen
  to be somewhat pearshaped fig b with the pointed end out
  attached to this end are two vibratile filaments cilia or
  flagella and the united movements of these cause the rolling
  motion of the whole colony usually a number of young colonies
  fig x are found within the mother colony these arise by the
  repeated bipartition of a single cell and escape finally forming
  independent colonies
  another sexual form of reproduction occurs similar to that found
  in many higher plants but as it only occurs at certain seasons it
  is not likely to be met with by the student
other forms related to volvox and sometimes met with are
gonium in which there are sixteen cells forming a flat square
pandorina and eudorina with sixteen cells forming an oval or
globular colony like volvox but much smaller in all of these the
structure of the cells is essentially as in volvox
chapter iv
subkingdom ii
alg3
3 alg sing alga
in the second subkingdom of plants is embraced an enormous assemblage
of plants differing widely in size and complexity and yet showing a
sufficiently complete gradation from the lowest to the highest as to
make it impracticable to make more than one subkingdom to include
them they are nearly all aquatic forms although many of them will
survive long periods of drying such forms occurring on moist earth
rocks or the trunks of trees but only growing when there is a
plentiful supply of water
all of them possess chlorophyll which however in many forms is
hidden by the presence of a brown or red pigment they are ordinarily
divided into three classesi the green alg chlorophyce
ii brown alg phophyce iii red alg rhodophyce
class igreen alg
the green alg are to be found almost everywhere where there is
moisture but are especially abundant in sluggish or stagnant fresh
water being much less common in salt water they are for the most
part plants of simple structure many being unicellular and very few
of them plants of large size
we may recognize five wellmarked orders of the green algi green
slimes protococcace ii confervace iii pond scums
conjugat iv siphone v stoneworts charace
order iprotococcace
the members of this order are minute unicellular plants growing
either in water or on the damp surfaces of stones tree trunks etc
the plants sometimes grow isolated but usually the cells are united
more or less regularly into colonies
a common representative of the order is the common green slime
protococcus fig 11 a c which forms a dark green slimy
coating over stones tree trunks flower pots etc owing to their
minute size the structure can only be made out with the microscope

  scraping off a little of the material mentioned into a drop of water
  upon a slide and carefully separating it with needles a cover
  glass may be placed over the preparation and it is ready for
  examination when magnified the green film is found to be composed
  of minute globular cells of varying size which may in places be
  found to be united into groups with a higher power each cell
  fig 11 a is seen to have a distinct cell wall within which is
  colorless protoplasm careful examination shows that the chlorophyll
  is confined to several roundish bodies that are not usually in
  immediate contact with the wall of the cell these green masses are
  called chlorophyll bodies chloroplasts toward the centre of the
  cell especially if it has first been treated with iodine the
  nucleus may be found the size of the cells as well as the number
  of chloroplasts varies a good deal
  with a little hunting specimens in various stages of division may
  be found the division takes place in two ways in the first
  fig 11 b known as fission a wall is formed across the cell
  dividing it into two cells which may separate immediately or may
  remain united until they have undergone further division in this
  case the original cell wall remains as part of the wall of the
  daughter cells fission is the commonest form of cell multiplication
  throughout the vegetable kingdom
  the second form of cell division or internal cell division is shown
  at c here the protoplasm and nucleus repeatedly divide until a
  number of small cells are formed within the old one these develop
  cell walls and escape by the breaking of the old cell wall which
  is left behind and takes no part in the process the cells thus
  formed are sometimes provided with two cilia and are capable of
  active movement
  internal cell division as we shall see is found in most plants
  but only at special times
  closely resembling protococcus and answering quite as well for
  study are numerous aquatic forms such as chlorococcum fig 12
  these are for the most part destitute of a firm cell wall but are
  imbedded in masses of gelatinous substance like many cyanophyce
  the chloroplasts are smaller and less distinct than in
  protococcus the cells are here oval rather than round and often
  show a clear space at one end
illustration fig 12chlorococcum a plant related to
protococcus but the naked cells are surrounded by a colorless
gelatinous envelope a motionless cells b a cell that has
escaped from its envelope and is ciliated  300
  owing to the absence of a definite membrane a distinction between
  fission and internal cell division can scarcely be made here often
  the cells escape from the gelatinous envelope and swim actively by
  means of two cilia at the colorless end fig 12 b in this
  stage they closely resemble the individuals of a volvox colony or
  other green flagellata to which there is little doubt that they
  are related
  there are a number of curious forms common in fresh water that are
  probably related to protococcus but differ in having the cells
  united in colonies of definite form among the most striking are
  the different species of pediastrum fig 11 d e often met
  with in company with other alg and growing readily in aquaria when
  once established they are of very elegant shapes and the number of
  cells some multiple of four usually sixteen
  the cells form a flat disc the outer ones being generally provided
  with a pair of spines
  new individuals arise by internal division of the cells the
  contents of each forming as many parts as there are cells in the
  whole colony the young cells now escape through a cleft in the wall
  of the mother cell but are still surrounded by a delicate membrane
  fig 11 e within this membrane the young cells arrange
  themselves in the form of the original colony and grow together
  forming a new colony
  a much larger but rarer form is the water net fig 11 g in
  which the colony has the form of a hollow net the spaces being
  surrounded by long cylindrical cells placed end to end other common
  forms belong to the genus scenedesmus fig 11 f of which
  there are many species
order iiconfervace
under this head are included a number of forms of which the simplest
ones approach closely especially in their younger stages the
protococcace indeed some of the socalled protococcace are
known to be only the early stages of these plants
a common member of this order is cladophora a coarsebranching
alga growing commonly in running water where it forms tufts
sometimes a metre or more in length by floating out a little of it in
a saucer it is easy to see that it is made up of branching filaments
  the microscope shows fig 13 a that these filaments are rows of
  cylindrical cells with thick walls showing evident stratification
  at intervals branches are given off which may in turn branch
  giving rise to a complicated branching system these branches begin
  as little protuberances of the cell wall at the top of the cell
  they increase rapidly in length and becoming slightly contracted at
  the base a wall is formed across at this point shutting it off
  from the mother cell
  the protoplasm lines the wall of the cell and extends in the form
  of thin plates across the cavity of the cell dividing it up into a
  number of irregular chambers imbedded in the protoplasm are
  numerous flattened chloroplasts which are so close together as to
  make the protoplasm appear almost uniformly green within the
  chloroplasts are globular glistening bodies called pyrenoids
  the cell has several nuclei but they are scarcely evident in the
  living cell by placing the cells for a few hours in a one per cent
  watery solution of chromic acid then washing thoroughly and
  staining with borax carmine the nuclei will be made very evident
  fig 13 b such preparations may be kept permanently in dilute
  glycerine

415 pm  150 d a zospore  350
  if a mass of actively growing filaments is examined some of the
  cells will probably be found in process of fission the process is
  very simple and may be easily followed fig 13 c a ridge of
  cellulose is formed around the cell wall projecting inward and
  pushing in the protoplasm as it grows the process is continued
  until the ring closes in the middle cutting the protoplasmic body
  completely in two and forms a firm membrane across the middle of
  the cell the protoplasm at this stage c iii is somewhat
  contracted but soon becomes closely applied to the new wall the
  whole process lasts at ordinary temperatures 2025 c from
  three to four hours
  at certain times but unfortunately not often to be met with the
  contents of some of the cells form by internal division a large
  number of small naked cells zospores fig 13 d which
  escape and swim about actively for a time and afterwards become
  invested with a cell wall and grow into a new filament these cells
  are called zospores from their animallike movements they are
  provided with two cilia closely resembling the motile cells of the
  protococcace and volvocine
there are very many examples of these simple confervace some like
conferva being simple rows of cells others like stigeoclonium
fig 14 a chtophora and draparnaldia fig 14 b c
very much branched the two latter forms are surrounded by masses of
transparent jelly which sometimes reach a length of several
centimetres

among the marine forms related to these may be mentioned the sea
lettuce ulva shown in figure 15 the thin brightgreen
leaflike fronds of this plant are familiar to every seaside student
illustration fig 15a plant of sea lettuce ulva onehalf
natural size
somewhat higher than cladophora and its allies especially in the
differentiation of the reproductive parts are the various species of
dogonium and its relatives there are numerous species of
dogonium not uncommon in stagnant water growing in company with
other alg but seldom forming masses by themselves of sufficient size
to be recognizable to the naked eye
  the plant is in structure much like cladophora except that it is
  unbranched and the cells have but a single nucleus fig 16 e
  even when not fruiting the filaments may usually be recognized by
  peculiar capshaped structures at the top of some of the cells
  these arise as the result of certain peculiarities in the process of
  cell division which are too complicated to be explained here
  there are two forms of reproduction nonsexual and sexual in the
  first the contents of certain cells escape in the form of large
  zospores fig 16 c of oval form having the smaller end
  colorless and surrounded by a crown of cilia after a short period
  of active motion the zospore comes to rest secretes a cell wall
  about itself and the transparent end becomes flattened out into a
  disc e d by which it fastens itself to some object in the
  water the upper part now rapidly elongates and dividing repeatedly
  by cross walls develops into a filament like the original one in
  many species special zospores are formed smaller than the ordinary
  ones that attach themselves to the filaments bearing the female
  reproductive organ ogonium and grow into small plants bearing
  the male organ antheridium fig 16 b

the others  150
  the sexual reproduction takes place as follows certain cells of a
  filament become distinguished by their denser contents and by an
  increase in size becoming oval or nearly globular in form fig 16
  a b when fully grown the contents contract and form a naked
  cell which sometimes shows a clear area at one point on the
  surface this globular mass of protoplasm is the egg cell or female
  cell and the cell containing it is called the ogonium when the
  egg cell is ripe the ogonium opens by means of a little pore at
  one side fig 16 a
  in other cells either of the same filament or else of the small
  male plants already mentioned small motile cells called
  spermatozoids are formed these are much smaller than the egg cell
  and resemble the zospores in form but are much smaller and
  without chlorophyll when ripe they are discharged from the cells in
  which they were formed and enter the ogonium by careful
  observation the student may possibly be able to follow the
  spermatozoid into the ogonium where it enters the egg cell at the
  clear spot on its surface as a result of the entrance of the
  spermatozoid fertilization the egg cell becomes surrounded by a
  thick brown wall and becomes a resting spore the spore loses its
  green color and the wall becomes dark colored and differentiated
  into several layers the outer one often provided with spines
  fig 16 f as these spores do not germinate for a long time
  the process is only known in a comparatively small number of
  species and can hardly be followed by the ordinary student
illustration fig 17a plant of coleochte  50 b a few
cells from the margin with one of the hairs
much like dogonium but differing in being branched is the genus
bulbochte characterized also by hairs swollen at the base and
prolonged into a delicate filament fig 16 g
the highest members of the confervace are those of the genus
coleochte fig 17 of which there are several species found in
the united states these show some striking resemblances to the red
seaweeds and possibly form a transition from the green alg to the
red the commonest species form brightgreen discs adhering firmly
to the stems and floating leaves of water lilies and other aquatics
in aquaria they sometimes attach themselves in large numbers to the
glass sides of the vessel
  growing from the upper surface are numerous hairs consisting of a
  short sheathlike base including a very long and delicate filament
  fig 17 b in their methods of reproduction they resemble
  dogonium but the reproductive organs are more specialized

order iiipond scums conjugat
the conjugat while in some respects approaching the confervace
in structure yet differ from them to such an extent in some respects
that their close relationship is doubtful they are very common and
familiar plants some of them forming great floating masses upon the
surface of every stagnant pond and ditch being commonly known as
pond scum the commonest of these pond scums belong to the genus
spirogyra and one of these will illustrate the characteristics of
the order when in active growth these masses are of a vivid green
and owing to the presence of a gelatinous coating feel slimy slipping
through the hands when one attempts to lift them from the water
spread out in water the masses are seen to be composed of slender
threads often many centimetres in length and showing no sign of
branching

 150
  for microscopical examination the larger species are preferable
  when one of these is magnified fig 18 a c the unbranched
  filament is shown to be made up of perfectly cylindrical cells with
  rather delicate walls the protoplasm is confined to a thin layer
  lining the walls except for numerous fine filaments that radiate
  from the centrally placed nucleus n which thus appears
  suspended in the middle of the cell the nucleus is large and
  distinct in the larger species and has a noticeably large and
  conspicuous nucleolus the most noticeable thing about the cell is
  the green spiral bands running around it these are the
  chloroplasts which in all the conjugat are of very peculiar
  forms the number of these bands varies much in different species of
  spirogyra but is commonly two or three these chloroplasts like
  those of other plants are not noticeably different in structure
  from the ordinary protoplasm as is shown by extracting the
  chlorophyll which may be done by placing the plants in alcohol for
  a short time this extracts the chlorophyll but a microscopic
  examination of the decolored cells shows that the bands remain
  unchanged except for the absence of color these bands are
  flattened with irregularly scalloped margins and at intervals have
  rounded bodies pyrenoids imbedded in them fig 18 c py
  the pyrenoids especially when the plant has been exposed to the
  light for some time are surrounded by a circle of small granules
  which become bluish when iodine is applied showing them to be
  starch to show the effect of iodine on starch on a large scale
  mix a little flour which is nearly all starch with water and add
  a little iodine the starch will immediately become colored blue
  varying in intensity with the amount of iodine the cells divide
  much as in cladophora but the nucleus here takes part in the
  process the division naturally occurs only at night but by
  reducing the temperature at night to near the freezing point 4 c
  or a little lower the process may be checked the experiment is
  most conveniently made when the temperature out of doors approaches
  the freezing point then it is only necessary to keep the plants in
  a warm room until about 10 pm when they may be put out of doors
  for the night on bringing them in in the morning the division will
  begin almost at once and may be easily studied the nucleus divides
  into two parts which remain for a time connected by delicate
  threads fig 18 b that finally disappear at first no nucleoli
  are present in the daughter nuclei but they appear before the
  division is complete
  new filaments are formed by the breaking up of the old ones this
  sometimes being very rapid as the cells break apart the free ends
  bulge strongly showing the pressure exerted upon the cell wall by
  the contents fig 18 a
spores like those of dogonium are formed but the process is
somewhat different it occurs in most species late in the spring but
may sometimes be met with at other times the masses of fruiting
plants usually appear brownish colored if spores have been formed
they can in the larger species at least be seen with a hand lens
appearing as rows of darkcolored specks
  two filaments lying side by side send out protuberances of the cell
  wall that grow toward each other until they touch fig 18 d at
  the point of contact the wall is absorbed forming a continuous
  channel from one cell to the other this process usually takes place
  in all the cells of the two filaments so that the two filaments
  connected by tubes at regular intervals have the form of a ladder
  in some species adjoining cells of the same filament become
  connected the tubes being formed at the end of the cells fig 18
  h and the cell in which the spore is formed enlarges
  soon after the channel is completed the contents of one cell flow
  slowly through it into the neighboring cell and the protoplasm of
  the two fuses into one mass the union of the nuclei has also been
  observed the young spore thus formed contracts somewhat becoming
  oval in form and soon secretes a thick wall colorless at first
  but afterwards becoming brown and more or less opaque the
  chlorophyll bands although much crowded are at first
  distinguishable but later lose the chlorophyll and become
  unrecognizable like the resting spores of dogonium these require
  a long period of rest before germinating

evidently related to the pond scums but differing in being for the
most part strictly unicellular are the desmids fig 20 they are
confined to fresh water and seldom occur in masses of sufficient size
to be seen with the naked eye usually being found associated with
pond scums or other filamentous forms many of the most beautiful
forms may be obtained by examining the matter adhering to the leaves
and stems of many floating water plants especially the bladder weed
utricularia and other fineleaved aquatics
  the desmids include the most beautiful examples of unicellular
  plants to be met with the cells having extremely elegant outlines
  the cell shows a division into two parts and is often constricted
  in the middle each division having a single large chloroplast of
  peculiar form the central part of the cell in which the nucleus
  lies is colorless
  among the commonest forms often growing with spirogyra are
  various species of closterium fig 20 a b recognizable at
  once by their crescent shape the cell appears bright green except
  at the ends and in the middle the large chloroplast in each half is
  composed of six longitudinal plates united at the axis of the cell
  several large pyrenoids are always found often forming a regular
  line through the central axis at each end of the cell is a vacuole
  containing small granules that show an active dancing movement
the desmids often have the power of movement swimming or creeping
slowly over the slide as we examine them but the mechanism of these
movements is still doubtful
in their reproduction they closely resemble the pond scums
order ivsiphone
the siphone are alg occurring both in fresh and salt water and
are distinguished from other alg by having the form of a tube
undivided by partition walls except when reproduction occurs the
only common representatives of the order in fresh water are those
belonging to the genus vaucheria but these are to be had almost
everywhere they usually occur in shallow ditches and ponds growing
on the bottom or not infrequently becoming free and floating where
the water is deeper they form large dark green felted masses and
are sometimes known as green felts some species grow also on the
wet ground about springs an examination of one of the masses shows it
to be made up of closely matted hairlike threads each of which is
an individual plant
  in transferring the plants to the slide for microscopic examination
  they must be handled very carefully as they are very easily
  injured each thread is a long tube branching sometimes but not
  divided into cells as in spirogyra or cladophora if we follow
  it to the tip the contents here will be found to be denser this
  being the growing point by careful focusing it is easy to show that
  the protoplasm is confined to a thin layer lining the wall the
  central cavity of the tube being filled with cell sap in the
  protoplasm are numerous elongated chloroplasts cl and a larger
  or smaller number of small shining globular bodies ol these
  latter are drops of oil and when the filaments are injured
  sometimes run together and form drops of large size no nucleus can
  be seen in the living plant but by treatment with chromic acid and
  staining numerous very small nuclei may be demonstrated

  when the filaments are growing upon the ground or at the bottom of
  shallow water the lower end is colorless and forms a more or less
  branching rootlike structure fastening it to the earth these
  rootlets like the rest of the filament are undivided by walls
  one of the commonest and at the same time most characteristic
  species is vaucheria racemosa fig 21 a f the plant
  multiplies nonsexually by branches pinched off by a constriction at
  the point where they join the main filament or by the filament
  itself becoming constricted and separating into several parts each
  one constituting a new individual
  the sexual organs are formed on special branches and their
  arrangement is such as to make the species instantly recognizable
  the first sign of their development is the formation of a short
  branch fig 21 a growing out at right angles to the main
  filament this branch becomes clubshaped and the end somewhat
  pointed and more slender and curves over this slender curved
  portion is almost colorless and is soon shut off from the rest of
  the branch it is called an antheridium and within are produced
  by internal division numerous excessively small spermatozoids
  as the branch grows its contents become very dense the oil drops
  especially increasing in number and size about the time that the
  antheridium becomes shut off a circle of buds appears about its
  base fig 21 b og these are the young ogonia which
  rapidly increase in size assuming an oval form and become
  separated by walls from the main branch c unlike the
  antheridium the ogonia contain a great deal of chlorophyll
  appearing deep green
  when ripe the antheridium opens at the end and discharges the
  spermatozoids which are however so very small as scarcely to be
  visible except with the strongest lenses they are little oval
  bodies with two cilia which may sometimes be rendered visible by
  staining with iodine
illustration fig 22a nonsexual reproduction in vaucheria
sessilis b nonsexual spore of v geminata  50
  the ogonia which at first are uniformly colored just before
  maturity show a colorless space at the top from which the
  chloroplasts and oil drops have disappeared d and at the same
  time this portion pushes out in the form of a short beak soon after
  the wall is absorbed at this point and a portion of the contents is
  forced out leaving an opening and at the same time the remaining
  contents contract to form a round mass the germ or egg cell
  fig 21 e o almost as soon as the ogonium opens the
  spermatozoids collect about it and enter but on account of their
  minuteness it is almost impossible to follow them into the egg
  cell or to determine whether several or only one enter the
  fertilized egg cell becomes almost at once surrounded by a wall
  which rapidly thickens and forms a resting spore as the spore
  ripens it loses its green color becoming colorless with a few
  reddish brown specks scattered through it f
  in some species the sexual organs are borne directly on the filament
  fig 21 g
  large zospores are formed in some of the green felts fig 22
  a and are produced singly in the ends of branches that become
  swollen dark green and filled with very dense protoplasm this end
  becomes separated by a wall from the rest of the branch the end
  opens and the contents escape as a very large zospore covered
  with numerous short cilia a ii after a short period of
  activity this loses its cilia develops a wall and begins to grow
  iii iv other species b produce similar spores which
  however are not motile and remain within the mother cell until
  they are set free by the decay of its wall
order vcharace
the charace or stoneworts as some of them are called are so
very different from the other green alg that it is highly probable
that they should be separated from them
the type of the order is the genus chara fig 23 called
stoneworts from the coating of carbonate of lime found in most of
them giving them a harsh stony texture several species are common
growing upon the bottom of ponds and slow streams and range in size
from a few centimetres to a metre or more in height
the plant fig 23 a consists of a central jointed axis with
circles of leaves at each joint or node the distance between the
nodes internodes may in the larger species reach a length of several
centimetres the leaves are slender cylindrical structures and like
the stem divided into nodes and internodes and have at the nodes
delicate leaflets
at each joint of the leaf in fruiting specimens attached to the
inner side are borne two small roundish bodies in the commoner
species of a reddish color fig 23 a r the lower of the two
is globular and bright scarlet in color the other more oval and
duller
examined with a lens the main axis presents a striated appearance the
whole plant is harsh to the touch and brittle owing to the limy
coating it is fastened to the ground by fine colorless hairs or
rootlets

  by making a series of longitudinal sections with a sharp razor
  through the top of the plant and magnifying sufficiently it is
  found to end in a single nearly hemispherical cell fig 23 b
  s this from its position is called the apical cell and from
  it are derived all the tissues of the plant segments are cut off
  from its base and these divide again into two by a wall parallel to
  the first of the two cells thus formed one undergoes no further
  division and forms the central cell of an internode y the other
  divides repeatedly forming a node or joint x
  as the arrangement of these cells is essentially the same in the
  leaves and stem we will examine it in the former as by cutting
  several crosssections of the whole bunch of young leaves near the
  top of the plant we shall pretty certainly get some sections
  through a joint the arrangement is shown in figure 23 e
  as the stem grows a covering is formed over the large internodal
  cell y by the growth of cells from the nodes these grow both
  from above and below meeting in the middle of the internode and
  completely hiding the long axial cell a section across the
  internode shows the large axial cell y surrounded by the
  regularly arranged cells of the covering or cortex fig 23 d
  all the cells contain a layer of protoplasm next the wall with
  numerous oval chloroplasts if the cells are uninjured they often
  show a very marked movement of the protoplasm these movements are
  best seen however in forms like nitella where the long
  internodal cells are not covered with a cortex in chara they are
  most evident in the root hairs that fasten the plant to the ground
  the growth of the leaves is almost identical with that of the stem
  but the apical growth is limited and the apical cell becomes
  finally very long and pointed fig 23 c in some species the
  chloroplasts are reddish in the young cells assuming their green
  color as the cells approach maturity
the plant multiplies nonsexually by means of special branches that
may become detached but there are no nonsexual spores formed
  the sexual organs have already been noticed arising in pairs at the
  joints of the leaves the ogonium is formed above the antheridium
  below
  the young ogonium f o consists of a central cell below
  which is a smaller one surrounded by a circle of five others which
  do not at first project above the central cell but later completely
  envelop it g each of these five cells early becomes divided
  into an upper and a lower one the latter becoming twisted as it
  elongates and the central cell later has a small cell cut off from
  its base by an oblique wall the central cell forms the egg cell
  which in the ripe ogonium l o is surrounded by five
  spirally twisted cells and crowned by a circle of five smaller
  ones which become of a yellowish color when full grown they
  separate at the time of fertilization to allow the spermatozoids to
  enter the ogonium
  the antheridium consists at first of a basal cell and a terminal
  one the latter which is nearly globular divides into eight nearly
  similar cells by walls passing through the centre in each of these
  eight cells two walls are next formed parallel to the outer surface
  so that the antheridium apart from the basal cell contains
  twentyfour cells arranged in three concentric series g an
  these cells especially the outer ones develop a great amount of a
  red pigment giving the antheridium its characteristic color
  the diameter of the antheridium now increases rapidly and the
  central cells separate leaving a large space within of the inner
  cells the second series while not increasing in diameter
  elongate assuming an oblong form and from the innermost are
  developed long filaments i j composed of a single row of
  cells in each of which is formed a spermatozoid
  the eight outer cells are nearly triangular in outline fitting
  together by deeply indented margins and having the oblong cells
  with the attached filaments upon their inner faces
  if a ripe antheridium is crushed in a drop of water after lying a
  few minutes the spermatozoids will escape through small openings in
  the side of the cells they are much larger than any we have met
  with each is a colorless spiral thread with about three coils one
  end being somewhat dilated with a few granules the other more
  pointed and bearing two extremely long and delicate cilia k to
  see the cilia it is necessary to kill the spermatozoids with iodine
  or some other reagent
  after fertilization the outer cells of the ogonium become very
  hard and the whole falls off germinating after a sufficient period
  of rest
according to the accounts of pringsheim and others the young plant
consists at first of a row of elongated cells upon which a bud is
formed that develops into the perfect plant
there are two families of the charace the chare of which
chara is the type and the nitelle represented by various
species of nitella and tolypella the second family have the
internodes without any cortexthat is consisting of a single long
cell and the crown at the top of the ogonium is composed of ten
cells instead of five they are also destitute of the limy coating of
the chare
both as regards the structure of the plant itself as well as the
reproductive organs especially the very complex antheridium the
charace are very widely separated from any other group of plants
either above or below them

h diatoma all  300
these plants are all characterized by the presence of a brown pigment
in addition to the chlorophyll which almost entirely conceals the
latter giving the plants a brownish color ranging from a light
yellowish brown to nearly black one order of plants that possibly
belongs here diatomace are single celled but the others are for
the most part large seaweeds the diatoms which are placed in this
class simply on account of the color are probably not closely related
to the other brown alg but just where they should be placed is
difficult to say in some respects they approach quite closely the
desmids and are not infrequently regarded as related to them they
are among the commonest of organisms occurring everywhere in stagnant
and running water both fresh and salt forming usually slimy
yellowish coatings on stones mud aquatic plants etc like the
desmids they may be single or united into filaments and not
infrequently are attached by means of a delicate gelatinous stalk
fig 25
illustration fig 25diatoms attached by a gelatinous stalk
 150
  they are at once distinguished from the desmids by their color
  which is always some shade of yellowish or reddish brown the
  commonest forms eg navicula fig 24 c are boatshaped
  when seen from above but there is great variety in this respect
  the cell wall is always impregnated with large amounts of flint so
  that after the cell dies its shape is perfectly preserved the flint
  making a perfect cast of it looking like glass these flinty shells
  exhibit wonderfully beautiful and delicate markings which are
  sometimes so fine as to test the best lenses to make them out
  this shell is composed of two parts one shutting over the other
  like a pill box and its cover this arrangement is best seen in such
  large forms as pinnularia fig 24 a ii
most of the diatoms show movements swimming slowly or gliding over
solid substances but like the movements of oscillaria and the
desmids the movements are not satisfactorily understood although
several explanations have been offered
they resemble somewhat the desmids in their reproduction
the true brown alg
these are all marine forms many of great size reaching a length in
some cases of a hundred metres or more and showing a good deal of
differentiation in their tissues and organs

one of the commonest forms is the ordinary rock weed fucus which
covers the rocks of our northeastern coast with a heavy drapery for
several feet above lowwater mark so that the plants are completely
exposed as the tide recedes the commonest species f vesiculosus
fig 26 a is distinguished by the air sacs with which the stems
are provided the plant is attached to the rock by means of a sort of
disc or root from which springs a stem of tough leathery texture and
forking regularly at intervals so that the ultimate branches are very
numerous and the plant may reach a length of a metre or more the
branches are flattened and leaflike the centre traversed by a
thickened midrib the end of the growing branches is occupied by a
transversely elongated pit or depression the growing point is at the
bottom of this pit and by a regular forking of the growing point the
symmetrical branching of the plant is brought about scattered over
the surface are little circular pits through whose openings protrude
bunches of fine hairs when wet the plant is flexible and leathery
but it may become quite dry and hard without suffering as may be seen
when the plants are exposed to the sun at low tide
the air bladders are placed in pairs for the most part and buoy up
the plant bringing it up to the surface when covered with water
the interior of the plant is very soft and gelatinous while the outer
part forms a sort of tough rind of much firmer consistence the ends
of some of the branches fig 26 a x are usually much swollen
and the surface covered with little elevations from which may often be
seen protruding clusters of hairs like those arising from the other
parts of the plant a section through one of these enlarged ends shows
that each elevation corresponds to a cavity situated below it on some
of the plants these cavities are filled with an orangeyellow mass in
others there are a number of roundish olivebrown bodies large enough
to be easily seen the yellow masses are masses of antheridia the
round bodies the ogonia
if the plants are gathered while wet and packed so as to prevent
evaporation of the water they will keep perfectly for several days
and may readily be shipped for long distances if they are to be
studied away from the seashore sections for microscopic examination
should be mounted in salt water about 3 parts in weight of common
salt to 100 of water if fresh material is not to be had dried
specimens or alcoholic material will answer pretty well
  to study the minute structure of the plant make a thin
  crosssection and mount in salt water the inner part or pith is
  composed of loosely arranged elongated cells placed end to end
  and forming an irregular network the large spaces between filled
  with the mucilaginous substance derived from the altered outer walls
  of these cells this mucilage is hard when dry but swells up
  enormously in water especially fresh water the cells grow smaller
  and more compact toward the outside of the section until there are
  no spaces of any size between those of the outside or rind the
  cells contain small chloroplasts like those of the higher plants
  but owing to the presence of the brown pigment found in all of the
  class in addition to the chlorophyll they appear golden brown
  instead of green
  no nonsexual reproductive bodies are known in the rock weeds
  beyond small branches that occur in clusters on the margins of the
  main branches and probably become detached forming new plants in
  some of the lower forms however eg ectocarpus and
  laminaria fig 28 a c zospores are formed
  the sexual organs of the rock weed as we have already seen are
  borne in special cavities conceptacles in the enlarged ends of
  some of the branches in the species here figured f vesiculosus
  the antheridia and ogonia are borne on separate plants but in
  others eg f platycarpus they are both in the same
  conceptacle
  the walls of the conceptacle fig 26 b are composed of closely
  interwoven filaments from which grow inward numerous hairs filling
  up the space within and often extending out through the opening at
  the top
  the reproductive bodies arise from the base of these hairs the
  ogonia fig 26 c e arise as nearly colorless cells that
  early become divided into two cells a short basal cell or stalk and
  a larger terminal one the ogonium proper the latter enlarges
  rapidly and its contents divide into eight parts the division is
  at first indicated by a division of the central portion which
  includes the nucleus and is colored brown into two four and
  finally eight parts after which walls are formed between these the
  brown color spreads until the whole ogonium is of a nearly uniform
  olivebrown tint
  when ripe the upper part of the ogonium dissolves allowing the
  eight cells still enclosed in a delicate membrane to escape
  fig 27 h finally the walls separating the inner cells of the
  ogonium become also absorbed as well as the surrounding membrane
  and the eight egg cells escape into the water fig 27 i as
  naked balls of protoplasm in which a central nucleus may be dimly
  seen
  the antheridia fig 26 f g are small oblong cells at first
  colorless but when ripe containing numerous glistening reddish
  brown dots each of which is part of a spermatozoid when ripe the
  contents of the antheridium are forced out into the water g
  leaving the empty outer wall behind but still surrounded by a thin
  membrane after a few minutes this membrane is dissolved and the
  spermatozoids are set free these fig 27 k are oval in form
  with two long cilia attached to the side where the brown speck seen
  while still within the antheridium is conspicuous
  the act of fertilization may be easily observed by laying fresh
  antheridia into a drop of water containing recently discharged egg
  cells to obtain these all that is necessary is to allow freshly
  gathered plants to remain in the air until they are somewhat dry
  when the ripe sexual cells will be discharged from the openings of
  the conceptacles exuding as little drops those with antheridia
  being orangeyellow the masses of ogonia olive within a few
  minutes after putting the ogonia into water the egg cells may be
  seen to escape into the water when some of the antheridia may be
  added the spermatozoids will be quickly discharged and collect
  immediately in great numbers about the egg cells to which they
  apply themselves closely often setting them in rotation by the
  movements of their cilia and presenting a most extraordinary
  spectacle j owing to the small size of the spermatozoids and
  the opacity of the eggs it is impossible to see whether more than
  one spermatozoid penetrates it but from what is known in other
  cases it is not likely the egg now secretes a wall about itself
  and within a short time begins to grow it becomes pearshaped the
  narrow portion becoming attached to the parent plant or to some
  other object by means of rootlets and the upper part grows into the
  body of the young plant fig 27 m

the simpler brown seaweeds so far as known multiply only by means of
zospores which may grow directly into new plants or as has been
observed in some species two zospores will first unite a few like
ectocarpus fig 28 a are simple branched filaments but most
are large plants with complex tissues of the latter a familiar
example is the common kelp devils apron laminaria often three
to four metres in length with a stout stalk provided with rootlike
organs by which it is firmly fastened above it expands into a
broad leaflike frond which in some species is divided into strips
related to the kelps is the giant kelp of the pacific macrocystis
which is said sometimes to reach a length of three hundred metres

class iiithe red alg rhodophyce
these are among the most beautiful and interesting members of the
plant kingdom both on account of their beautiful colors and the
exquisitely graceful forms exhibited by many of them unfortunately
for inland students they are with few exceptions confined to salt
water and consequently fresh material is not available nevertheless
enough can be done with dried material to get a good idea of their
general appearance and the fruiting plants can be readily preserved
in strong alcohol specimens simply dried may be kept for an
indefinite period and on being placed in water will assume perfectly
the appearance of the living plants prolonged exposure however to
the action of fresh water extracts the red pigment that gives them
their characteristic color this pigment is found in the chlorophyll
bodies and usually quite conceals the chlorophyll which however
becomes evident so soon as the red pigment is removed
the red seaweeds differ much in the complexity of the plant body but
all agree in the presence of the red pigment and at least in the
main in their reproduction the simpler ones consist of rows of
cells usually branching like cladophora others form cell plates
comparable to ulva fig 30 c d while others among which is
the wellknown irish moss chondrus form plants of considerable
size with pretty well differentiated tissues in such forms the outer
cells are smaller and firmer constituting a sort of rind while the
inner portions are made up of larger and looser cells and may be
called the pith between these extremes are all intermediate forms
they usually grow attached to rocks shells wood or other plants
such as the kelps and even the larger red seaweeds they are most
abundant in the warmer seas but still a considerable number may be
found in all parts of the ocean even extending into the arctic
regions

the methods of reproduction may be best illustrated by a specific
example and preferably one of the simpler ones as these are most
readily studied microscopically
the form here illustrated callithamnion grows attached to wharves
etc below lowwater mark and is extremely delicate collapsing
completely when removed from the water the color is a bright rosy
red and with its graceful form and extreme delicacy it makes one of
the most beautiful of the group
if alcoholic material is used it may be mounted for examination
either in water or very dilute glycerine
  the plant is composed of muchbranched slender filaments closely
  resembling cladophora in structure but with smaller cells
  fig 29 b the nonsexual reproduction is by means of special
  spores which from being formed in groups of four are known as
  tetraspores in the species under consideration the mother cell of
  the tetraspores arises as a small bud near the upper end of one of
  the ordinary cells fig 29 c i this bud rapidly increases in
  size assuming an oval form and becoming cut off from the cell of
  the stem fig 29 c ii the contents now divide into four equal
  parts arranged like the quadrants of a sphere when ripe the wall
  of the mother cell gives way and the four spores escape into the
  water and give rise to new plants these spores it will be noticed
  differ in one important particular from corresponding spores in most
  alg in being unprovided with cilia and incapable of spontaneous
  movement
  occasionally in the same plant that bears tetraspores but more
  commonly in special ones there are produced the sexual organs and
  subsequently the sporocarps or fruits developed from them the
  plants that bear them are usually stouter that the nonsexual ones
  and the masses of ripe carpospores are large enough to be readily
  seen with the naked eye
  if a plant bearing ripe spores is selected the young stages of the
  female organ procarp may generally be found by examining the
  younger parts of the plant the procarp arises from a single cell of
  the filament this cell undergoes division by a series of
  longitudinal walls into a central cell and about four peripheral
  ones fig 29 d i one of the latter divides next into an upper
  and a lower cell the former growing out into a long colorless
  appendage known as a trichogyne fig 29 d tr
  the antheridia fig 29 e are hemispherical masses of closely
  set colorless cells each of which develops a single spermatozoid
  which like the tetraspores is destitute of cilia and is dependent
  upon the movement of the water to convey it to the neighborhood of
  the procarp occasionally one of these spermatozoids may be found
  attached to the trichogyne and in this way fertilization is
  effected curiously enough neither the cell which is immediately
  fertilized nor the one beneath it undergo any further change but
  two of the other peripheral cells on opposite sides of the filament
  grow rapidly and develop into large irregular masses of spores
  fig 29 d iii iv
while the plant here described may be taken as a type of the group
it must be borne in mind that many of them differ widely not only in
the structure of the plant body but in the complexity of the sexual
organs and spores as well the tetraspores are often imbedded in the
tissues of the plant or may be in special receptacles nor are they
always arranged in the same way as here described and the same is
true of the carpospores these latter are in some of the higher forms
eg polysiphonia fig 29 f contained in urnshaped
receptacles or they may be buried within the tissues of the plant

subkingdom iii
fungi
the name fungi has been given to a vast assemblage of plants
varying much among themselves but on the whole of about the same
structural rank as the alg unlike the alg however they are
entirely destitute of chlorophyll and in consequence are dependent
upon organic matter for food some being parasites growing upon
living organisms others saprophytes feeding on dead matter some
of them show close resemblances in structure to certain alg and
there is reason to believe that they are descended from forms that
originally had chlorophyll others are very different from any green
plants though more or less evidently related among themselves
recognizing then these distinctions we may make two divisions of the
subkingdom i the algafungi phycomycetes and ii the true
fungi mycomycetes
class iphycomycetes
these are fungi consisting of long undivided often branching tubular
filaments resembling quite closely those of vaucheria or other
siphone but always destitute of any trace of chlorophyll the
simplest of these include the common moulds mucorini one of which
will serve to illustrate the characteristics of the order
if a bit of fresh bread slightly moistened is kept under a bell jar
or tumbler in a warm room in the course of twentyfour hours or so it
will be covered with a film of fine white threads and a little later
will produce a crop of little globular bodies mounted on upright
stalks these are at first white but soon become black and the
filaments bearing them also grow darkcolored
these are moulds and have grown from spores that are in the
atmosphere falling on the bread which offers the proper conditions
for their growth and multiplication
one of the commonest moulds is the one here figured fig 32 and
named mucor stolonifer from the runners or stolons by which it
spreads from one point to another as it grows it sends out these
runners along the surface of the bread or even along the inner
surface of the glass covering it they fasten themselves at intervals
to the substratum and send up from these points clusters of short
filaments each one tipped with a spore case or sporangium
  for microscopical study they are best mounted in dilute glycerine
  about onequarter glycerine to threequarters pure water after
  carefully spreading out the specimens in this mixture allow a drop
  of alcohol to fall upon the preparation and then put on the cover
  glass the alcohol drives out the air which otherwise interferes
  badly with the examination
  the whole plant consists of a very long muchbranched but
  undivided tubular filament where it is in contact with the
  substratum rootlike outgrowths are formed not unlike those
  observed in vaucheria at first the walls are colorless but later
  become dark smoky brown in color a layer of colorless granular
  protoplasm lines the wall becoming more abundant toward the growing
  tips of the branches the spore cases sporangia arise at the
  ends of upright branches fig 32 c which at first are
  cylindrical a but later enlarge at the end b and become
  cut off by a convex wall c this wall pushes up into the young
  sporangium forming a structure called the columella when fully
  grown the sporangium is globular and appears quite opaque owing
  to the numerous granules in the protoplasm filling the space between
  the columella and its outer wall this protoplasm now divides into a
  great number of small oval cells spores which rapidly darken
  owing to a thick black wall formed about each one and at the same
  time the columella and the stalk of the sporangium become
  darkcolored
  when ripe the wall of the sporangium dissolves and the spores
  fig 32 e are set free the columella remains unchanged and
  some of the spores often remain sticking to it fig 32 d

  spores formed in a manner strongly recalling those of the pond scums
  are also known but only occur after the plants have grown for a
  long time and hence are rarely met with fig 32 i
another common mould m mucedo often growing in company with the
one described differs from it mainly in the longer stalk of the
sporangium which is also smaller and in not forming runners this
species sometimes bears clusters of very small sporangia attached to
the middle of the ordinary sporangial filament fig 32 f h
these small sporangia have no columella
other moulds are sometimes met with parasitic upon the larger species
of mucor
related to the black moulds are the insect moulds entomopthore
which attack and destroy insects the commonest of these attacks the
house flies in autumn when the flies thus infested may often be
found sticking to window panes and surrounded by a whitish halo of
the spores that have been thrown off by the fungus
order iiwhite rusts and mildews peronospore
these are exclusively parasitic fungi and grow within the tissues of
various flowering plants sometimes entirely destroying them
as a type of this group we will select a very common one cystopus
bliti that is always to be found in late summer and autumn growing
on pig weed amarantus it forms whitish blisterlike blotches
about the size of a pin head on the leaves and stems being commonest
on the under side of the leaves fig 33 a in the earlier stages
the leaf does not appear much affected but later becomes brown and
withered about the blotches caused by the fungus
  if a thin vertical section of the leaf is made through one of these
  blotches and mounted as described for mucor the latter is found
  to be composed of a mass of spores that have been produced below the
  epidermis of the leaf and have pushed it up by their growth if the
  section is a very thin one we may be able to make out the structure
  of the fungus and then find it to be composed of irregular
  tubular muchbranched filaments which however are not divided by
  crosswalls these filaments run through the intercellular spaces of
  the leaf and send into the cells little globular suckers by means
  of which the fungus feeds
  the spores already mentioned are formed at the ends of crowded
  filaments that push up and finally rupture the epidermis fig 33
  b they are formed by the ends of the filaments swelling up and
  becoming constricted so as to form an oval spore which is then cut
  off by a wall the portion of the filament immediately below acts in
  the same way and the process is repeated until a chain of half a
  dozen or more may be produced the lowest one being always the last
  formed when ripe the spores are separated by a thin neck and
  become very easily broken off
  in order to follow their germination it is only necessary to place a
  few leaves with fresh patches of the fungus under a bell jar or
  tumbler inverted over a dish full of water so as to keep the air
  within saturated with moisture but taking care to keep the leaves
  out of the water after about twentyfour hours if some of the
  spores are scraped off and mounted in water they will germinate in
  the course of an hour or so the contents divide into about eight
  parts which escape from the top of the spore which at this time
  projects as a little papilla on escaping each mass of protoplasm
  swims away as a zospore with two extremely delicate cilia after a
  short time it comes to rest and after developing a thin cell wall
  germinates by sending out one or two filaments fig 33 c e

  under normal conditions the spores probably germinate when the
  leaves are wet and the filaments enter the plant through the
  breathing pores on the lower surface of the leaves and spread
  rapidly through the intercellular spaces
  later on spores of a very different kind are produced unlike those
  already studied they are formed some distance below the epidermis
  and in order to study them satisfactorily the fungus must be freed
  from the host plant in order to do this small pieces of the leaf
  should be boiled for about a minute in strong caustic potash and
  then treated with acetic or hydrochloric acid by this means the
  tissues of the leaf become so soft as to be readily removed while
  the fungus is but little affected the preparation should now be
  washed and mounted in dilute glycerine
  the spores ospores are much larger than those first formed and
  possess an outer coat of a dark brown color fig 33 h each
  spore is contained in a large cell which arises as a swelling of
  one of the filaments and becomes shut off by a wall at first
  fig 33 f its contents are granular and fill it completely
  but later contract to form a globular mass of protoplasm g
  o the germ cell or egg cell the whole is an ogonium and
  differs in no essential respect from that of vaucheria
  frequently a smaller cell antheridium arising from a neighboring
  filament and in close contact with the ogonium may be detected
  fig 33 f g an and in exceptionally favorable cases a
  tube is to be seen connecting it with the germ cell and by means of
  which fertilization is effected
  after being fertilized the germ cell secretes a wall at first thin
  and colorless but later becoming thick and darkcolored on the
  outside and showing a division into several layers the outermost
  of which is dark brown and covered with irregular reticulate
  markings these spores do not germinate at once but remain over
  winter unchanged
illustration fig 34fragment of a filament of the white rust of
the shepherdspurse showing the suckers h  300
it is by no means impossible that sometimes the germ cell may develop
into a spore without being fertilized as is the case in many of the
water moulds
closely related to the species above described is another one
c candidus which attacks shepherdspurse radish and others of
the mustard family upon which it forms chalky white blotches and
distorts the diseased parts of the plant very greatly
  for some reasons this is the best species for study longitudinal
  sections through the stem showing very beautifully the structure of
  the fungus and the penetration of the cells of the host4 by the
  suckers fig 34
4 host the plant or animal upon which a parasite lives
illustration fig 35nonsexual spores of the vine mildew
peronospora viticola  150
very similar to the white rusts in most respects but differing in the
arrangement of the nonsexual spores are the mildews peronospora
phytophthora these plants form mouldylooking patches on the
leaves and stems of many plants and are often very destructive among
them are the vine mildew peronospora viticola fig 35 the
potato fungus phytophthora infestans and many others
order iiisaprolegniace water moulds
these plants resemble quite closely the white rusts and are probably
related to them they grow on decaying organic matter in water or
sometimes on living water animals fish crustaceans etc they may
usually be had for study by throwing into water taken from a stagnant
pond or aquarium a dead fly or some other insect after a few days it
will probably be found covered with a dense growth of fine white
filaments standing out from it in all directions fig 36 a
somewhat later if carefully examined with a lens little round white
bodies may be seen scattered among the filaments

  on carefully removing a bit of the younger growth and examining it
  microscopically it is found to consist of long filaments much like
  those of vaucheria but entirely destitute of chlorophyll in
  places these filaments are filled with densely granular protoplasm
  which when highly magnified exhibits streaming movements the
  protoplasm contains a large amount of oil in the form of small
  shining drops
  in the early stages of its growth the plant multiplies by zospores
  produced in great numbers in sporangia at the ends of the branches
  the protoplasm collects here much as we saw in v sessilis the
  end of the filament becoming clubshaped and ending in a short
  protuberance fig 36 b this end becomes separated by a wall
  and the contents divide into numerous small cells that sometimes are
  naked and sometimes have a delicate membrane about them the first
  sign of division is the appearance in the protoplasm of delicate
  lines dividing it into numerous polygonal areas which soon become
  more distinct and are seen to be distinct cells whose outlines
  remain more or less angular on account of the mutual pressure when
  ripe the end of the sporangium opens and the contained cells are
  discharged fig 36 c in case they have no membrane they swim
  away at once each being provided with two cilia and resembling
  almost exactly the zospores of the white rust fig 36 d e
  when the cells are surrounded by a membrane they remain for some
  time at rest but finally the contents escape as a zospore like
  those already described by killing the zospores with a little
  iodine the granular nature of the protoplasm is made more evident
  and the cilia may be seen they soon come to rest and germinate in
  the same way as those of the white rusts and mildews
  as soon as the sporangium is emptied a new one is formed either by
  the filament growing up through it fig 36 f and the end being
  again cut off or else by a branch budding out just below the base
  of the empty sporangium and growing up by the side of it
  besides zospores there are also resting spores developed ogonia
  like those of vaucheria or the peronospore are formed usually
  after the formation of zospores has ceased but in many cases
  perhaps all these develop without being fertilized antheridia are
  often wanting and even when they are present it is very doubtful
  whether fertilization takes place5
5 the antheridia when present arise as branches just below the
ogonium and become closely applied to it sometimes sending tubes
through its wall but there has been no satisfactory demonstration of
an actual transfer of the contents of the antheridium to the egg cell
  the ogonia fig 36 g h arise at the end of the main
  filaments or of short side branches very much as do the sporangia
  from which they differ at this stage in being of globular form the
  contents contract to form one or several egg cells naked at first
  but later becoming thickwalled resting spores h
chapter ix
the true fungi mycomycetes
the great majority of the plants ordinarily known as fungi are
embraced under this head while some of the lower forms show
affinities with the phycomycetes and through them with the alg
the greater number differ very strongly from all green plants both in
their habits and in their structure and reproduction it is a
muchdisputed point whether sexual reproduction occurs in any of them
and it is highly probable that in the great majority at any rate the
reproduction is purely nonsexual
probably to be reckoned with the mycomycetes but of doubtful
affinities are the small unicellular fungi that are the main causes
of alcoholic fermentation these are the yeast fungi saccharomycetes
they cause the fermentation of beer and wine as well as the incipient
fermentation in bread causing it to rise by the giving off of
bubbles of carbonic acid gas during the process
if a little common yeast is put into water containing starch or sugar
and kept in a warm place in a short time bubbles of gas will make
their appearance and after a little longer time alcohol may be
detected by proper tests in short alcoholic fermentation is taking
place in the solution
  if a little of the fermenting liquid is examined microscopically it
  will be found to contain great numbers of very small oval cells
  with thin cell walls and colorless contents a careful examination
  with a strong lens magnifying from 5001000 diameters shows that
  the protoplasm in which are granules of varying size does not fill
  the cell completely but that there are one or more large vacuoles
  or spaces filled with colorless cell sap no nucleus is visible in
  the living cell but it has been shown that a nucleus is present
  if growth is active many of the cells will be seen dividing the
  process is somewhat different from ordinary fission and is called
  budding fig 37 b a small protuberance appears at the bud or
  at the side of the cell and enlarges rapidly assuming the form of
  the mother cell from which it becomes completely separated by the
  constriction of the base and may fall off at once or as is more
  frequently the case may remain attached for a time giving rise
  itself to other buds so that not infrequently groups of half a
  dozen or more cells are met with fig 37 b c
illustration fig 37a single cells of yeast b c similar
cells showing the process of budding  750
that the yeast cells are the principal agents of alcoholic
fermentation may be shown in much the same way that bacteria are shown
to cause ordinary decomposition liquids from which they are excluded
will remain unfermented for an indefinite time
there has been much controversy as to the systematic position of the
yeast fungi which has not yet been satisfactorily settled the
question being whether they are to be regarded as independent plants
or only one stage in the life history of some higher fungi possibly
the smuts which through cultivation have lost the power of
developing further
class ithe smuts ustillagine
the smuts are common and often very destructive parasitic fungi
living entirely within the tissues of the higher plants owing to
this as well as to the excessively small spores and difficulty in
germinating them the plants are very difficult of study except in a
general way and we will content ourselves with a glance at one of the
common forms the corn smut ustillago maydis this familiar fungus
attacks indian corn forming its spores in enormous quantities in
various parts of the diseased plant but particularly in the flowers
tassel and young ear
  the filaments which resemble somewhat those of the white rusts
  penetrate all parts of the plant and as the time approaches for the
  formation of the spores these branch extensively and at the same
  time become soft and mucilaginous fig 38 b the ends of these
  short branches enlarge rapidly and become shut off by partitions
  and in each a globular spore fig 38 c is produced the outer
  wall is very darkcolored and provided with short spines to study
  the filaments and spore formation very thin sections should be made
  through the young kernels or other parts in the vicinity before
  they are noticeably distorted by the growth of the sporebearing
  filaments

ustillago b filaments of the fungus from a thin section of a
diseased grain showing the beginning of the formation of the spores

as the spores are forming an abnormal growth is set up in the cells
of the part attacked which in consequence becomes enormously enlarged
fig 38 a single grains sometimes growing as large as a walnut
as the spores ripen the affected parts which are at first white
become a livid gray due to the black spores shining through the
overlying white tissues finally the masses of spores burst through
the overlying cells appearing like masses of soot whence the popular
name for the plant
the remaining mycomycetes are pretty readily divisible into two
great classes based upon the arrangement of the spores the first of
these is known as the ascomycetes sac fungi the other the
basidiomycetes mushrooms puffballs etc
class iiascomycetes sac fungi
this class includes a very great number of common plants all
resembling each other in producing spores in sacs asci sing
ascus that are usually oblong in shape and each containing eight
spores although the number is not always the same besides the spores
formed in these sacs ascospores there are other forms produced in
various ways
there are two main divisions of the class the first including only a
few forms most of which are not likely to be met with by the student
in these the spore sacs are borne directly upon the filaments without
any protective covering the only form that is at all common is a
parasitic fungus exoascus that attacks peachtrees causing the
disease of the leaves known as curl
all of the common ascomycetes belong to the second division and
have the spore sacs contained in special structures called spore
fruits that may reach a diameter of several centimetres in a few
cases though ordinarily much smaller
among the simpler members of this group are the mildews
perisporiace mostly parasitic forms living upon the leaves and
stems of flowering plants sometimes causing serious injury by their
depredations they form white or grayish downy films on the surface of
the plant in certain stages looking like hoarfrost being very
common they may be readily obtained and are easily studied one of
the best species for study podosphra grows abundantly on the
leaves of the dandelion especially when the plants are growing under
unfavorable conditions the same species is also found on other plants
of the same family it may be found at almost any time during the
summer but for studying the spore fruits material should be
collected in late summer or early autumn it at first appears as
white frostlike patches growing dingier as it becomes older and
careful scrutiny of the older specimens will show numerous brown or
blackish specks scattered over the patches these are the spore
fruits

  for microscopical study fresh material may be used or if
  necessary dried specimens the latter before mounting should be
  soaked for a short time in water to which has been added a few
  drops of causticpotash solution this will remove the brittleness
  and swell up the dried filaments to their original proportions a
  portion of the plant should be carefully scraped off the leaf on
  which it is growing thoroughly washed in pure water and
  transferred to a drop of water or very dilute glycerine in which it
  should be carefully spread out with needles if air bubbles
  interfere with the examination they may be driven off with alcohol
  and then the cover glass put on if the specimen is mounted in
  glycerine it will keep indefinitely if care is taken to seal it
  up the plant consists of muchinterlaced filaments divided at
  intervals by crosswalls6 they are nearly colorless and the
  contents are not conspicuous these filaments send up vertical
  branches fig 39 a that become divided into a series of short
  cells by means of crosswalls the cells thus formed are at first
  cylindrical but later bulge out at the sides becoming broadly
  oval and finally become detached as spores conidia it is these
  spores that give the frosty appearance to the early stages of the
  fungus when seen with the naked eye the spores fall off very easily
  when ripe and germinate quickly in water sending out two or more
  tubes that grow into filaments like those of the parent plant
  fig 39 b
6 the filaments are attached to the surface of the leaf by suckers
which are not so readily seen in this species as in some others a
mildew growing abundantly in autumn on the garden chrysanthemum
however shows them very satisfactorily if a bit of the epidermis of a
leaf on which the fungus is just beginning to grow is sliced off with
a sharp razor and mounted in dilute glycerine or water removing the
air with alcohol these suckers are then seen to be globular bodies
penetrating the outer wall of the cell fig 40

  the spore fruits as already observed are formed toward the end of
  the season and in the species under consideration at least appear
  to be the result of a sexual process the sexual organs if they are
  really such are extremely simple and owing to their very small
  size are not easily found they arise as short branches at a point
  where two filaments cross one of them fig 39 c ar the
  female cell or archicarp is somewhat larger than the other and
  nearly oval in form and soon becomes separated by a partition from
  the filament that bears it the other branch antheridium grows up
  in close contact with the archicarp and like it is shut off by a
  partition from its filament it is more slender than the archicarp
  but otherwise differs little from it no actual communication can be
  shown to be present between the two cells and it is therefore still
  doubtful whether fertilization really takes place shortly after
  these organs are fullgrown several short branches grow up about
  them and soon completely envelop them d e these branches
  soon grow together and crosswalls are formed in them so that the
  young spore fruit appears surrounded by a single layer of cells
  sufficiently transparent however to allow a view of the interior
  the antheridium undergoes no further change but the archicarp soon
  divides into two cellsa small basal one and a larger upper cell
  there next grow from the inner surface of the covering cells short
  filaments that almost completely fill the space between the
  archicarp and the wall an optical section of such a stage fig 39
  f shows a double wall and the two cells of the archicarp the
  spore fruit now enlarges rapidly and the outer cells become first
  yellow and then dark brown the walls becoming thicker and harder as
  they change color sometimes special filaments or appendages grow
  out from their outer surfaces and these are also darkcolored
  shortly before the fruit is ripe the upper cell of the archicarp
  which has increased many times in size shows a division of its
  contents into eight parts each of which develops a wall and becomes
  an oval spore by crushing the ripe spore fruit these spores still
  enclosed in the mother cell ascus may be forced out fig 39
  h these spores do not germinate at once but remain dormant
  until the next year

  frequently other structures resembling somewhat the spore fruits
  are found associated with them fig 39 i k and were for a
  long time supposed to be a special form of reproductive organ but
  they are now known to belong to another fungus cicinnobulus
  parasitic upon the mildew they usually appear at the base of the
  chains of conidia causing the basal cell to enlarge to many times
  its original size and finally kill the young conidia which shrivel
  up a careful examination reveals the presence of very fine
  filaments within those of the mildew which may be traced up to the
  base of the conidial branch where the receptacle of the parasite is
  forming the spores contained in these receptacles are very small
  fig 39 k and when ripe exude in long wormshaped masses if
  the receptacle is placed in water
the mildews may be divided into two genera podosphra with a
single ascus in the spore fruit and erysiphe with two or more in
the latter the archicarp branches each branch bearing a spore sac
fig 41 b
the appendages growing out from the wall of the spore fruit are often
very beautiful in form and the two genera given above are often
subdivided according to the form of these appendages
a common mould closely allied to the mildews is found on various
articles of food when allowed to remain damp and is also very common
on botanical specimens that have been poorly dried and hence is often
called herbarium mould eurotium herbariorum

  the conidia are of a greenish color and produced on the ends of
  upright branches which are enlarged at the end and from which grow
  out little prominences which give rise to the conidia in the same
  way as we have seen in the mildews fig 42 a
  spore fruits much like those of the mildews are formed later and
  are visible to the naked eye as little yellow grains fig 42 d
  these contain numerous very small spore sacs e each with eight
  spores
there are numerous common species of eurotium differing in color
and size some being yellow or black and larger than the ordinary
green form
another form common everywhere on mouldy food of all kinds as well
as in other situations is the blue mould penicillium this in
general appearance resembles almost exactly the herbarium mould but
is immediately distinguishable by a microscopic examination fig 42
g
  in studying all of these forms they may be mounted as directed for
  the black moulds in dilute glycerine but must be handled with
  great care as the spores become shaken off with the slightest jar
of the larger ascomycetes the cup fungi discomycetes may be
taken as types the spore fruit in these forms is often of
considerable size and as their name indicates is open having the
form of a flat disc or cup a brief description of a common one will
suffice to give an idea of their structure and development
ascobolus fig 43 is a small discshaped fungus growing on horse
dung by keeping some of this covered with a bell jar for a week or
two so as to retain the moisture at the end of this time a large
crop of the fungus will probably have made its appearance the part
visible is the spore fruit fig 43 a of a light brownish color
and about as big as a pinhead
  its development may be readily followed by teasing out in water the
  youngest specimens that can be found taking care to take up a
  little of the substratum with it as the earliest stages are too
  small to be visible to the naked eye the spore fruits arise from
  filaments not unlike those of the mildews and are preceded by the
  formation of an archicarp composed of several cells and readily
  seen through the walls of the young fruit fig 43 b in the
  study of the early stages a potash solution will be found useful in
  rendering them transparent
  the young fruit has much the same structure as that of the mildews
  but the spore sacs are much more numerous and there are special
  sterile filaments developed between them if the young spore fruit
  is treated with chloriodide of zinc it is rendered quite
  transparent and the young spore sacs colored a beautiful blue so
  that they are readily distinguishable

  the development of the spore sacs may be traced by carefully
  crushing the young spore fruits in water the young spore sacs
  fig 43 e i are colorless with granular protoplasm in which a
  nucleus can often be easily seen the nucleus subsequently divides
  repeatedly until there are eight nuclei about which the protoplasm
  collects to form as many oval masses each of which develops a wall
  and becomes a spore figs iiiv these are imbedded in protoplasm
  which is at first granular but afterwards becomes almost
  transparent as the spores ripen the wall acquires a beautiful
  violetpurple color changing later to a dark purplebrown and
  marked with irregular longitudinal ridges fig 43 f the
  fullgrown spore sacs fig 43 e w are oblong in shape and
  attached by a short stalk the sterile filaments between them often
  become curiously enlarged at the end g as the spore fruit
  ripens it opens at the top and spreads out so as to expose the
  spore sacs as they discharge their contents fig 43 d
of the larger cup fungi those belonging to the genus peziza
fig 43 h are common growing on bits of rotten wood on the
ground in woods they are sometimes bright scarlet or orangered and
very showy another curious form is the morel morchella common in
the spring in dry woods it is stalked like a mushroom but the
surface of the conical cap is honeycombed with shallow depressions
lined with the spore sacs
order lichenes
under the name of lichens are comprised a large number of fungi
differing a good deal in structure but most of them not unlike the
cup fungi they are with few exceptions parasitic upon various forms
of alg with which they are so intimately associated as to form
apparently a single plant they grow everywhere on exposed rocks on
the ground trunks of trees fences etc and are found pretty much
the world over among the commonest of plants are the lichens of the
genus parmelia fig 44 a growing everywhere on tree trunks
wooden fences etc forming gray flattened expansions with much
indented and curled margins when dry the plant is quite brittle but
on moistening becomes flexible and at the same time more or less
decidedly green in color the lower surface is white or brown and
often develops rootlike processes by which it is fastened to the
substratum sometimes small fragments of the plant become detached in
such numbers as to form a grayish powder over certain portions of it
these when supplied with sufficient moisture will quickly produce
new individuals
not infrequently the spore fruits are to be met with flat discs of a
reddish brown color two or three millimetres in diameter and closely
resembling a small cup fungus they are at first almost closed but
expand as they mature fig 44 a ap

  if a thin vertical section of the plant is made and sufficiently
  magnified it is found to be made up of somewhat irregular
  thickwalled colorless filaments divided by crosswalls as in the
  other sacfungi in the central parts of the plant these are rather
  loose but toward the outside become very closely interwoven and
  often grown together so as to form a tough rind among the
  filaments of the outer portion are numerous small green cells that
  closer examination shows to be individuals of protococcus or some
  similar green alg upon which the lichen is parasitic these are
  sufficiently abundant to form a green line just inside the rind if
  the section is examined with a simple lens fig 44 b
  the spore fruits of the lichens resemble in all essential respects
  those of the cup fungi and the spore sacs fig 44 f are much
  the same usually though not always containing eight spores which
  are sometimes twocelled the sterile filaments between the spore
  sacs usually have thickened ends which are darkcolored and give
  the color to the inner surface of the spore fruit

owing to the toughness of the filaments the finer structure of the
lichens is often difficult to study and free use of caustic potash is
necessary to soften and make them manageable

  not infrequently in this form as well as in other lichens special
  cavities known as spermogonia fig 44 d are found in which
  excessively small spores are produced which have been claimed to
  be male reproductive cells but the latest investigations do not
  support this theory

the last group of the ascomycetes are the black fungi
pyrenomycetes represented by the black knot of cherry and plum
trees shown in figure 46 they are mainly distinguished from the cup
fungi by producing their spore sacs in closed cavities some are
parasites others live on dead wood leaves etc forming very hard
masses generally black in color giving them their common name owing
to the hardness of the masses they are very difficult to manipulate
and as the structure is not essentially different from that of the
discomycetes the details will not be entered into here
of the parasitic forms one of the best known is the ergot of rye
more or less used in medicine other forms are known that attack
insects particularly caterpillars which are killed by their attacks

fungicontinued
class basidiomycetes
the basidiomycetes include the largest and most highly developed of
the fungi among which are many familiar forms such as the mushrooms
toadstools puffballs etc besides these large and familiar forms
there are other simpler and smaller ones that according to the latest
investigations are probably related to them though formerly regarded
as constituting a distinct group the most generally known of these
lower basidiomycetes are the socalled rusts the larger
basidiomycetes are for the most part saprophytes living in decaying
vegetable matter but a few are true parasites upon trees and others
of the flowering plants
all of the group are characterized by the production of spores at the
top of special cells known as basidia8 the number produced upon a
single basidium varying from a single one to several
8 sing basidium
of the lower basidiomycetes the rusts uredine offer common and
easily procurable forms for study they are exclusively parasitic in
their habits growing within the tissues of the higher land plants
which they often injure seriously they receive their popular name
from the reddish color of the masses of spores that when ripe burst
through the epidermis of the host plant like many other fungi the
rusts have several kinds of spores which are often produced on
different hosts thus one kind of wheat rust lives during part of its
life within the leaves of the barberry where it produces spores quite
different from those upon the wheat the cedar rust in the same way
is found at one time attacking the leaves of the wild crabapple and
thorn

the first form met with in most rusts is sometimes called the
clustercup stage and in many species is the only stage known in
figure 47 f is shown a bit of the leaf of the indian turnip
arisma affected by one of these clustercup forms to the naked
eye or when slightly magnified the masses of spores appear as bright
orange spots mostly upon the lower surface the affected leaves are
more or less checked in their growth and the upper surface shows
lighter blotches corresponding to the areas below that bear the
cluster cups these at first appear as little elevations of a
yellowish color and covered with the epidermis but as the spores
ripen they break through the epidermis which is turned back around
the opening the whole forming a little cup filled with a bright
orange red powder composed of the loose masses of spores
  putting a piece of the affected leaf between two pieces of pith so
  as to hold it firmly with a little care thin vertical sections of
  the leaf including one of the cups may be made and mounted
  either in water or glycerine removing the air with alcohol we find
  that the leaf is thickened at this point owing to a diseased growth
  of the cells of the leaf induced by the action of the fungus the
  mass of spores fig 47 g is surrounded by a closely woven mass
  of filaments forming a nearly globular cavity occupying the bottom
  of the cup are closely set upright filaments each bearing a row of
  spores arranged like those of the white rusts but so closely
  crowded as to be flattened at the sides the outer rows have
  thickened walls and are grown together so as to form the wall of
  the cup
  the spores are filled with granular protoplasm in which are
  numerous drops of orangeyellow oil to which is principally due
  their color as the spores grow they finally break the overlying
  epidermis and then become rounded as the pressure from the sides is
  relieved they germinate within a few hours if placed in water
  sending out a tube into which pass the contents of the spore
  fig 47 i
one of the most noticeable of the rusts is the cedar rust
gymnosporangium forming the growths known as cedar apples
often met with on the red cedar these are rounded masses sometimes
as large as a walnut growing upon the small twigs of the cedar
fig 47 a this is a morbid growth of the same nature as those
produced by the white rusts and smuts if one of these cedar apples is
examined in the late autumn or winter it will be found to have the
surface dotted with little elevations covered by the epidermis and on
removing this we find masses of forming spores these rupture the
epidermis early in the spring and appear then as little spikes of a
rusty red color if they are kept wet for a few hours they enlarge
rapidly by the absorption of water and may reach a length of four or
five centimetres becoming gelatinous in consistence and sometimes
almost entirely hiding the surface of the apple in this stage the
fungus is extremely conspicuous and may frequently be met with after
rainy weather in the spring
  this orange jelly as shown by the microscope is made up of
  elongated twocelled spores teleuto spores attached to long
  gelatinous stalks fig 47 b they are thickwalled and the
  contents resemble those of the clustercup spores described above
  to study the earlier stages of germination it is best to choose
  specimens in which the masses of spores have not been moistened by
  thoroughly wetting these and keeping moist the process of
  germination may be readily followed many usually begin to grow
  within twentyfour hours or less each cell of the spore sends out a
  tube fig 47 c through an opening in the outer wall and this
  tube rapidly elongates the spore contents passing into it until a
  short filament basidium is formed which then divides into several
  short cells each cell develops next a short pointed process which
  swells up at the end gradually taking up all the contents of the
  cell until a large oval spore sp is formed at the tip
  containing all the protoplasm of the cell
experiments have been made showing that these spores do not germinate
upon the cedar but upon the hawthorn or crabapple where they
produce the clustercup stage often met with late in the summer the
affected leaves show bright orangeyellow spots about a centimetre in
diameter fig 47 d and considerably thicker than the other parts
of the leaf on the upper side of these spots may be seen little black
specks which microscopic examination shows to be spermogonia
resembling those of the lichens later on the lower surface appear
the cluster cups whose walls are prolonged so that they form little
tubular processes of considerable length fig 47 e
  in most rusts the teleuto spores are produced late in the summer or
  autumn and remain until the following spring before they germinate
  they are very thickwalled the walls being darkcolored so that in
  mass they appear black and constitute the blackrust stage
  fig 47 j associated with these but formed earlier and
  germinating immediately are often to be found large singlecelled
  spores borne on long stalks they are usually oval in form rather
  thinwalled but the outer surface sometimes provided with little
  points the contents are reddish so that in mass they appear of the
  color of iron rust and cause the red rust of wheat and other
  plants upon which they are growing
the classification of the rusts is based mainly upon the size and
shape of the teleuto spores where they are known as the clustercup
and redrust stages are pretty much the same in all of the commoner
genera melampsora and uromyces fig 47 l i have unicellular
teleuto spores puccinia ii and gymnosporangium twocelled
spores triphragmium threecelled and phragmidium iii four or
more
the rusts are so abundant that a little search can scarcely fail to
find some or all of the stages the clustercup stages are best
examined fresh or from alcoholic material the teleuto spores may be
dried without affecting them
probably the bestknown member of the group is the wheat rust
puccinia graminis which causes so much damage to wheat and
sometimes to other grains the redrust stage may be found in early
summer the blackrust spores in the stubble and dead leaves in the
autumn or spring forming black lines rupturing the epidermis
probably to be associated with the lower basidiomycetes are the
large fungi of which tremella fig 51 a is an example they are
jellylike forms horny and somewhat brittle when dry but becoming
soft when moistened they are common growing on dead twigs logs
etc and are usually brown or orangeyellow in color
of the higher basidiomycetes the toadstools mushrooms etc are
the highest and any common form will serve for study one of the most
accessible and easily studied forms is coprinus of which there are
several species growing on the excrement of various herbivorous
animals they not infrequently appear on horse manure that has been
kept covered with a glass for some time as described for ascobolus
after two or three weeks some of these fungi are very likely to make
their appearance and new ones continue to develop for a long time

the first trace of the plant visible to the naked eye is a little
downy white speck just large enough to be seen this rapidly
increases in size becoming oblong in shape and growing finally
somewhat darker in color and by the time it reaches a height of a few
millimetres a short stalk becomes perceptible and presently the whole
assumes the form of a closed umbrella the top is covered with little
prominences that diminish in number and size toward the bottom after
the cap reaches its full size the stalk begins to grow slowly at
first but finally with great rapidity reaching a height of several
centimetres within a few hours at the same time that the stalk is
elongating the cap spreads out radial clefts appearing on its upper
surface which flatten out very much as the folds of an umbrella are
stretched as it opens and the spaces between the clefts appear as
ridges comparable to the ribs of the umbrella fig 48 b the
under side of the cap has a number of ridges running from the centre
to the margin and of a black color due to the innumerable spores
covering their surface c almost as soon as the umbrella opens
the spores are shed and the whole structure shrivels up and
dissolves leaving almost no trace behind
  if we examine microscopically the youngest specimens procurable
  freeing from air with alcohol and mounting in water or dilute
  glycerine we find it to be a little nearly globular mass of
  colorless filaments with numerous crosswalls the whole arising
  from similar looser filaments imbedded in the substratum fig 48
  g if the specimen is not too young a denser central portion can
  be made out and in still older ones fig 48 h this central
  mass has assumed the form of a short thick stalk crowned by a flat
  cap the whole invested by a loose mass of filaments that merge more
  or less gradually into the central portion by the time the spore
  fruit for this structure corresponds to the spore fruit of the
  ascomycetes reaches a height of two or three millimetres and is
  plainly visible to the naked eye the cap grows downward at the
  margins so as to almost entirely conceal the stalk a longitudinal
  section of such a stage shows the stalk to be composed of a
  smallcelled close tissue becoming looser in the cap on whose
  inner surface the sporebearing ridges gills or lamell have
  begun to develop some of these run completely to the edge of the
  cap others only part way to study their structure make
  crosssections of the cap of a nearly fullgrown but unopened
  specimen and this will give numerous sections of the young gills
  we find them to be flat plates composed within of loosely
  interwoven filaments whose ends stand out at right angles to the
  surface of the gills forming a layer of closelyset upright cells
  basidia fig 48 d these are at first all alike but later
  some of them become clubshaped and develop at the end several
  usually four little points at the end of which spores are formed
  in exactly the same way as we saw in the germinating teleuto spores
  of the cedar rust all the protoplasm of the basidium passing into
  the growing spores fig 48 e f the ripe spores e sp
  are oval and possess a firm dark outer wall occasionally some of
  the basidia develop into very large sterile cells e x
  projecting far beyond the others and often reaching the neighboring
  gill
similar in structure and development to coprinus are all the large
and common forms but they differ much in the position of the
sporebearing tissue as well as in the form and size of the whole
spore fruit they are sometimes divided according to the position of
the spores into three orders the closedfruited angiocarpous
forms the halfclosed hemiangiocarpous and the open or
nakedfruited forms gymnocarpous

the little birdsnest fungus cyathus growing on rotten wood or

subkingdom iv
bryophyta
the bryophytes or mosses are for the most part land plants though a
few are aquatic and with very few exceptions are richly supplied with
chlorophyll they are for the most part small plants few of them
being over a few centimetres in height but nevertheless compared
with the plants that we have heretofore studied quite complex in
their structure the lowest members of the group are flattened
creeping plants or a few of them floating aquatics without distinct
stem and leaves but the higher ones have a pretty welldeveloped
central axis or stem with simple leaves attached
there are two classesi liverworts hepatic and ii mosses
musci
class ithe liverworts
one of the commonest of this class and to be had at any time is
named madotheca it is one of the highest of the class having
distinct stem and leaves it grows most commonly on the shady side of
tree trunks being most luxuriant near the ground where the supply of
moisture is most constant it also occurs on stones and rocks in moist
places it closely resembles a true moss in general appearance and
from the scalelike arrangement of its leaves is sometimes called
scale moss
the leaves fig 52 a b are rounded in outline unequally
twolobed and arranged in two rows on the upper side of the stem so
closely overlapping as to conceal it entirely on the under side are
similar but smaller leaves less regularly disposed the stems branch
at intervals the branches spreading out laterally so that the whole
plant is decidedly flattened on the under side are fine whitish
hairs that fasten it to the substratum if we examine a number of
specimens especially early in the spring a difference will be
observed in the plants some of them will be found to bear peculiar
structures fig 52 c d in which the spores are produced
these are called sporogonia they are at first globular but when
ripe open by means of four valves and discharge a greenish brown mass
of spores an examination of the younger parts of the same plants will
probably show small buds fig 54 h which contain the female
reproductive organs from which the sporogonia arise
illustration fig 52a part of a plant of a leafy liverwort
madotheca  2 b part of the same seen from below  4 c
a branch with two open sporogonia sp  4 d a single

on other plants may be found numerous short side branches fig 53
b with very closely set leaves if these are carefully separated
the antheridia can just be seen as minute whitish globules barely
visible to the naked eye plants that like this one have the male
and female reproductive organs on distinct plants are said to be
dicious
  a microscopical examination of the stem and leaves shows their
  structure to be very simple the former is cylindrical and composed
  of nearly uniform elongated cells with straight crosswalls the
  leaves consist of a single layer of small roundish cells which
  like those of the stem contain numerous rounded chloroplasts to
  which is due their dark green color
  the tissues are developed from a single apical cell but it is
  difficult to obtain good sections through it
  the antheridia are borne singly at the bases of the leaves on the
  special branches already described fig 53 a an by
  carefully dissecting with needles such a branch in a drop of water
  some of the antheridia will usually be detached uninjured and may
  be readily studied the fullgrown ones being just large enough to
  be seen with the naked eye they are globular bodies attached by a
  stalk composed of two rows of cells the globular portion consists
  of a wall of chlorophyllbearing cells composed of two layers
  below but single above fig 53 c within is a mass of
  excessively small cells each of which contains a spermatozoid in
  the young antheridium a an the wall is single throughout
  and the central cells few in number to study them in their natural
  position thin longitudinal sections of the antheridial branch
  should be made

madotheca the small side branchlets bear the antheridia  2 b

  when ripe if brought into water the antheridium bursts at the top
  into a number of irregular lobes that curl back and allow the mass
  of sperm cells to escape the spermatozoids which are derived
  principally from the nucleus of the sperm cells 53 d are so
  small as to make a satisfactory examination possible only with very
  powerful lenses the ripe spermatozoid is coiled in a flat spiral
  53 e and has two excessively delicate cilia visible only
  under the most favorable circumstances
  the female organ in the bryophytes is called an archegonium and
  differs considerably from anything we have yet studied but recalls
  somewhat the structure of the ogonium of chara they are found in
  groups contained in little budlike branches 54 h in order to
  study them a plant should be chosen that has numbers of such buds
  and the smallest that can be found should be used those containing
  the young archegonia are very small but after one has been
  fertilized the leaves enclosing it grow much larger and the bud
  becomes quite conspicuous being surrounded by two or three
  comparatively large leaves by dissecting the young buds archegonia
  in all stages of growth may be found

  when very young the archegonium is composed of an axial row of three
  cells surrounded by a single outer layer of cells the upper ones
  forming five or six regular rows which are somewhat twisted
  fig 54 a b as it becomes older the lower part enlarges
  slightly the whole looking something like a longnecked flask c
  d the centre of the neck is occupied by a single row of cells
  canal cells with more granular contents than the outer cells the
  lowest cell of the row being somewhat larger than the others
  fig 54 c o when nearly ripe the division walls of the
  canal cells are absorbed and the protoplasm of the lowest cell
  contracts and forms a globular naked cell the egg cell d o
  if a ripe archegonium is placed in water it soon opens at the top
  and the contents of the canal cells are forced out leaving a clear
  channel down to the egg cell if the latter is not fertilized the
  inner walls of the neck cells turn brown and the egg cell dies but
  if a spermatozoid penetrates to the egg cell the latter develops a
  wall and begins to grow forming the embryo or young sporogonium

  the first division wall to be formed in the embryo is transverse
  and is followed by vertical ones fig 54 e em as the
  embryo enlarges the walls of the basal part of the archegonium grow
  rapidly so that the embryo remains enclosed in the archegonium
  until it is nearly fullgrown fig 55 as it increases in size it
  becomes differentiated into three parts a wedgeshaped base or
  foot penetrating downward into the upper part of the plant and
  serving to supply the embryo with nourishment second a stalk
  supporting the third part the capsule or sporebearing portion of
  the fruit the capsule is further differentiated into a wall which
  later becomes dark colored and a central cavity in which are
  developed special cells some of which by further division into four
  parts produce the spores while the others elongating enormously
  give rise to special cells called elaters fig 56 b
illustration fig 56spore a and two elaters b of
madotheca  300
  the ripe spores are nearly globular contain chlorophyll and drops
  of oil and the outer wall is brown and covered with fine points
  fig 56 a the elaters are longpointed cells having on the
  inner surface of the wall a single or double dark brown spiral band
  these bands are susceptible to changes in moisture and by their
  movements probably assist in scattering the spores after the
  sporogonium opens
just before the spores are ripe the stalk of the sporogonium
elongates rapidly carrying up the capsule which breaks through the
archegonium wall and finally splits into four valves and discharges
the spores
there are four orders of the liverworts represented in the united
states three of which differ from the one we have studied in being
flattened plants without distinct stems and leavesat least the
leaves when present are reduced to little scales upon the lower
surface
the first order ricciace are small aquatic forms or grow on damp
ground or rotten logs they are not common forms and not likely to be
encountered by the student one of the floating species is shown in
figure 57 a
the second order the horned liverworts anthocerote are
sometimes to be met with in late summer and autumn forms growing
mostly on damp ground and at once recognizable by their longpointed
sporogonia which open when ripe by two valves like a bean pod
fig 57 b
the third order marchantiace includes the most conspicuous
members of the whole class some of them like the common liverwort
marchantia shown in figure 57 f k and the giant liverwort
fig 57 d are large and common forms growing on the ground in
shady places the former being often found also in greenhouses they
are fastened to the ground by numerous fine silky hairs and the
tissues are well differentiated the upper surface of the plant having
a wellmarked epidermis with peculiar breathing pores large enough
to be seen with the naked eye fig 57 e j k each of these
is situated in the centre of a little area fig 57 e and beneath
it is a large air space into which the chlorophyllbearing cells
cl of the plant project j
the sexual organs are often produced in these forms upon special
branches g or the antheridia may be sunk in discs on the upper

the highest of the liverworts jungermanniace are for the most
part leafy forms like madotheca and represented by a great many
common forms growing usually on tree trunks etc they are much like
madotheca in general appearance but usually very small and
inconspicuous so as to be easily overlooked especially as their
color is apt to be brownish and not unlike that of the bark on which
they grow fig 57 l
class iithe true mosses
the true mosses musci resemble in many respects the higher
liverworts such as madotheca or jungermannia all of them having
wellmarked stems and leaves the spore fruit is more highly
developed than in the liverworts but never contains elaters
a good idea of the general structure of the higher mosses may be had
from a study of almost any common species one of the most convenient
as well as common forms funaria is to be had almost the year
round and fruits at almost all seasons except midwinter it grows in
close patches on the ground in fields at the bases of walls
sometimes in the crevices between the bricks of sidewalks etc if
fruiting it may be recognized by the nodding capsule on a long stalk
that is often more or less twisted being sensitive to changes in the
moisture of the atmosphere the plant fig 58 a b has a short
stem thickly set with relatively large leaves these are oblong and
pointed and the centre is traversed by a delicate midrib the base of
the stem is attached to the ground by numerous fine brown hairs
the mature capsule is broadly oval in form fig 58 c and
provided with a lid that falls off when the spores are ripe while the
capsule is young it is covered by a pointed membranous cap b
cal that finally falls off when the lid is removed a fine fringe
is seen surrounding the opening of the capsule and serving the same
purpose as the elaters of the liverworts fig 58 e

if the lower part of the stem is carefully examined with a lens we
may detect a number of fine green filaments growing from it looking
like the root hairs except for their color sometimes the ground
about young patches of the moss is quite covered by a fine film of
such threads and looking carefully over it probably very small moss
plants may be seen growing up here and there from it
illustration fig 59longitudinal section through the summit of a
small male plant of funaria a a antheridia p paraphysis
l section of a leaf  150
this moss is dicious the male plants are smaller than the female
and may be recognized by the bright red antheridia which are formed at
the end of the stem in considerable numbers and surrounded by a
circle of leaves so that the whole looks something like a flower
this is still more evident in some other mosses see figure 65 e
f
  the leaves when magnified are seen to be composed of a single layer
  of cells except the midrib which is made up of several thicknesses
  of elongated cells where the leaf is one cell thick the cells are
  oblong in form becoming narrower as they approach the midrib and
  the margin they contain numerous chloroplasts imbedded in the layer
  of protoplasm that lines the wall the nucleus fig 63 c n
  may usually be seen without difficulty especially if the leaf is
  treated with iodine this plant is one of the best for studying the
  division of the chloroplasts which may usually be found in all
  stages of division fig 63 d in the chloroplasts especially
  if the plant has been exposed to light for several hours will be
  found numerous small granules that assume a bluish tint on the
  application of iodine showing them to be starch grains if the
  plant is kept in the dark for a day or two these will be absent
  having been used up but if exposed to the light again new ones
  will be formed showing that they are formed only under the action
  of light
illustration fig 60a b young antheridia of funaria

spermatozoids of sphagnum  600
  starch is composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen and so far as is
  known is only produced by chlorophyllbearing cells under the
  influence of light the carbon used in the manufacture of starch is
  taken from the atmosphere in the form of carbonic acid so that
  green plants serve to purify the atmosphere by the removal of this
  substance which is deleterious to animal life while at the same
  time the carbon an essential part of all living matter is combined
  in such form as to make it available for the food of other
  organisms
  the marginal cells of the leaf are narrow and some of them
  prolonged into teeth
  a crosssection of the stem 63 e shows on the outside a single
  row of epidermal cells then larger chlorophyllbearing cells and
  in the centre a group of very delicate small colorless cells
  which in longitudinal section are seen to be elongated and similar
  to those forming the midrib of the leaf these cells probably serve
  for conducting fluids much as the similar but more perfectly
  developed bundles of cells fibrovascular bundles found in the
  stems and leaves of the higher plants
  the root hairs fastening the plant to the ground are rows of
  cells with brown walls and oblique partitions they often merge
  insensibly into the green filaments protonema already noticed
  these latter have usually colorless walls and more numerous
  chloroplasts looking very much like a delicate specimen of
  cladophora or some similar alga if a sufficient number of these
  filaments is examined some of them will probably show young moss
  plants growing from them fig 63 a k and with a little
  patience the leafy plant can be traced back to a little bud
  originating as a branch of the filament its diameter is at first
  scarcely greater than that of the filament but a series of walls
  close together are formed so placed as to cut off a pyramidal cell
  at the top forming the apical cell of the young moss plant this
  apical cell has the form of a threesided pyramid with the base
  upward from it are developed three series of cells cut off in
  succession from the three sides and from these cells are derived
  all the tissues of the plant which soon becomes of sufficient size
  to be easily recognizable
  the protonemal filaments may be made to grow from almost any part of
  the plant by keeping it moist but grow most abundantly from the
  base of the stem
  the sexual organs are much like those of the liverworts and are
  borne at the apex of the stems
  the antheridia figs 59 60 are clubshaped bodies with a short
  stalk the upper part consists of a single layer of large
  chlorophyllbearing cells enclosing a mass of very small nearly
  cubical colorless sperm cells each of which contains an
  excessively small spermatozoid
  the young antheridium has an apical cell giving rise to two series
  of segments fig 60 a which in the earlier stages are very
  plainly marked
  when ripe the chlorophyll in the outer cells changes color becoming
  red and if a few such antheridia from a plant that has been kept
  rather dry for a day or two are teased out in a drop of water they
  will quickly open at the apex the whole mass of sperm cells being
  discharged at once
  among the antheridia are borne peculiar hairs fig 59 p tipped
  by a large globular cell

  owing to their small size the spermatozoids are difficult to see
  satisfactorily and other mosses eg peat mosses figure 64 the
  hairy cap moss figure 65 i are preferable where obtainable
  the spermatozoids of a peat moss are shown in figure 60 d like
  all of the bryophytes they have but two cilia
  the archegonia fig 61 should be looked for in the younger plants
  in the neighborhood of those that bear capsules like the antheridia
  they occur in groups they closely resemble those of the liverworts
  but the neck is longer and twisted and the base more massive
  usually but a single one of the group is fertilized

  to study the first division of the embryo it is usually necessary
  to render the archegonium transparent which may be done by using a
  little caustic potash or letting it lie for a few hours in dilute
  glycerine will sometimes suffice if potash is used it must be
  thoroughly washed away by drawing pure water under the cover glass
  with a bit of blotting paper until every trace of the potash is
  removed the first wall in the embryo is nearly at right angles to
  the axis of the archegonium and divides the egg cell into nearly
  equal parts this is followed by nearly vertical walls in each cell
  fig 62 a very soon a twosided apical cell fig 62 b
  a is formed in the upper half of the embryo which persists until
  the embryo has reached a considerable size as in the liverworts the
  young embryo is completely covered by the growing archegonium wall
  the embryo may be readily removed from the archegonium by adding a
  little potash to the water in which it is lying allowing it to
  remain for a few moments and pressing gently upon the cover glass
  with a needle in this way it can be easily forced out of the
  archegonium and then by thoroughly washing away the potash
  neutralizing if necessary with a little acetic acid very beautiful
  preparations may be made if desired these may be mounted
  permanently in glycerine which however must be added very
  gradually to avoid shrinking the cells

  for some time the embryo has a nearly cylindrical form but as it
  approaches maturity the differentiation into stalk and capsule
  becomes apparent the latter increases rapidly in diameter assuming
  gradually the oval shape of the fullgrown capsule a longitudinal
  section of the nearly ripe capsule fig 58 g shows two distinct
  portions an outer wall of two layers of cells and an inner mass of
  cells in some of which the spores are produced this inner mass of
  cells is continuous with the upper part of the capsule but
  connected with the side walls and bottom by means of slender
  branching filaments of chlorophyllbearing cells
  the spores arise from a single layer of cells near the outside of
  the inner mass of cells g sp these cells h sp are
  filled with glistening granular protoplasm have a large and
  distinct nucleus and no chlorophyll they finally become entirely
  separated and each one gives rise to four spores which closely
  resemble those of the liverworts but are smaller
  near the base of the capsule on the outside are formed breathing
  pores fig 58 f quite similar to those of the higher plants
  if the spores are kept in water for a few days they will germinate
  bursting the outer brown coat and the contents protruding through
  the opening surrounded by the colorless inner spore membrane the
  protuberance grows rapidly in length and soon becomes separated from
  the body of the spore by a wall and lengthening more and more
  gives rise to a green filament like those we found attached to the
  base of the fullgrown plant and like those giving rise to buds
  that develop into leafy plants
classification of the mosses
the mosses may be divided into four orders i the peat mosses
sphagnace ii andreace iii phascace iv the common
mosses bryace
illustration fig 64a a peat moss sphagnum   b a
sporogonium of the same  3 c a portion of a leaf  150 the
narrow chlorophyllbearing cells form meshes enclosing the large
colorless empty cells whose walls are marked with thickened bars and
contain round openings o
the peat mosses fig 64 are large palegreen mosses growing often
in enormous masses forming the foundation of peatbogs they are of a
peculiar spongy texture very light when dry and capable of absorbing
a great amount of water they branch fig 64 a the branches
being closely crowded at the top where the stems continue to grow
dying away below

the sexual organs are rarely met with but should be looked for late
in autumn or early spring the antheridial branches are often
brightcolored red or yellow so as to be very conspicuous the
capsules which are not often found are larger than in most of the
common mosses and quite destitute of a stalk the apparent stalk
being a prolongation of the axis of the plant in the top of which the
base of the sporogonium is imbedded the capsule is nearly globular
opening by a lid at the top fig 64 b
  a microscopical examination of the leaves which are quite destitute
  of a midrib shows them to be composed of a network of narrow
  chlorophyllbearing cells surrounding much larger empty ones whose
  walls are marked with transverse thickenings and perforated here
  and there with large round holes fig 64 c it is to the
  presence of these empty cells that the plant owes its peculiar
  spongy texture the growing plants being fairly saturated with
  water
the andreace are very small and not at all common the capsule
splits into four valves something like a liverwort
the phascace are small mosses growing on the ground or low down on
the trunks of trees etc they differ principally from the common
mosses in having the capsule open irregularly and not by a lid the
commonest forms belong to the genus phascum fig 65 a
the vast majority of the mosses the student is likely to meet with
belong to the last order and agree in the main with the one
described some of the commoner forms are shown in figure 65
chapter xii
subkingdom v
pteridophytes
if we compare the structure of the sporogonium of a moss or liverwort
with the plant bearing the sexual organs we find that its tissues are
better differentiated and that it is on the whole a more complex
structure than the plant that bears it it however remains attached
to the parent plant deriving its nourishment in part through the
foot by means of which it is attached to the plant
in the pteridophytes however we find that the sporogonium becomes
very much more developed and finally becomes entirely detached from
the sexual plant developing in most cases roots that fasten it to the
ground after which it may live for many years and reach a very large
size
the sexual plant which is here called the prothallium is of very
simple structure resembling the lower liverworts usually and never
reaches more than about a centimetre in diameter and is often much
smaller than this
the common ferns are the types of the subkingdom and a careful study
of any of these will illustrate the principal peculiarities of the
group the whole plant as we know it is really nothing but the
sporogonium originating from the egg cell in exactly the same way as
the moss sporogonium and like it gives rise to spores which are
formed upon the leaves
the spores may be collected by placing the sporebearing leaves on
sheets of paper and letting them dry when the ripe spores will be
discharged covering the paper as a fine brown powder if these are
sown on fine rather closely packed earth and kept moist and covered
with glass so as to prevent evaporation within a week or two a fine
green mosslike growth will make its appearance and by the end of
five or six weeks if the weather is warm little flat heartshaped
plants of a darkgreen color may be seen these look like small
liverworts and are the sexual plants prothallia of our ferns
fig 66 f removing one of these carefully we find on the lower
side numerous fine hairs like those on the lower surface of the
liverworts which fasten it firmly to the ground by and by if our
culture has been successful we may find attached to some of the
larger of these little fern plants growing from the under side of the
prothallia and attached to the ground by a delicate root as the
little plant becomes larger the prothallium dies leaving it attached
to the ground as an independent plant which after a time bears the
spores

in choosing spores for germination it is best to select those of large
size and containing abundant chlorophyll as they germinate more
readily especially favorable for this purpose are the spores of the
ostrich fern onoclea struthiopteris fig 70 i j or the
sensitive fern o sensibilis another common and readily grown
species is the lady fern asplenium filixfmina fig 70 h the
spores of most ferns retain their vitality for many months and hence
can be kept dry until wanted
  the first stages of germination may be readily seen by sowing the
  spores in water where under favorable circumstances they will
  begin to grow within three or four days the outer dry brown coat
  of the spore is first ruptured and often completely thrown off by
  the swelling of the spore contents below this is a second colorless
  membrane which is also ruptured but remains attached to the spore
  through the orifice in the second coat the inner delicate membrane
  protrudes in the form of a nearly colorless papilla which rapidly
  elongates and becomes separated from the body of the spore by a
  partition constituting the first root hair fig 66 b c
  r the body of the spore containing most of the chlorophyll
  elongates more slowly and divides by a series of transverse walls
  so as to form a short row of cells resembling in structure some of
  the simpler alg c
  in order to follow the development further spores must be sown upon
  earth as they do not develop normally in water beyond this stage
  in studying plants grown on earth they should be carefully removed
  and washed in a drop of water so as to remove as far as possible
  any adherent particles and then may be mounted in water for
  microscopic examination
  in most cases after three or four crosswalls are formed two walls
  arise in the end cell so inclined as to enclose a wedgeshaped cell
  a from which are cut off two series of segments by walls
  directed alternately right and left fig 66 d e a the
  apical cell growing to its original dimensions after each pair of
  segments is cut off the segments divide by vertical walls in
  various directions so that the young plant rapidly assumes the form
  of a flat plate of cells attached to the ground by root hairs
  developed from the lower surfaces of the cells and sometimes from
  the marginal ones as the division walls are all vertical the plant
  is nowhere more than one cell thick the marginal cells of the young
  segments divide more rapidly than the inner ones and soon project
  beyond the apical cell which thus comes to lie at the bottom of a
  cleft in the front of the plant which in consequence becomes
  heartshaped e f sooner or later the apical cell ceases to
  form regular segments and becomes indistinguishable from the other
  cells
  in the ostrich fern and lady fern the plants are dicious the male
  plants fig 66 j are very small often barely visible to the
  naked eye and when growing thickly form dense mosslike patches
  they are variable in form some irregularly shaped others simple
  rows of cells and some have the heart shape of the larger plants
the female plants fig 66 f are always comparatively large and
regularly heartshaped occasionally reaching a diameter of nearly or
quite one centimetre so that they are easily recognizable without
microscopical examination
  all the cells of the plant except the root hairs contain large and
  distinct chloroplasts much like those in the leaves of the moss and
  like them usually to be found in process of division
  the archegonia arise from cells of the lower surface just behind
  the notch in front fig 66 f ar previous to their
  formation the cells at this point divide by walls parallel to the
  surface of the plant so as to form several layers of cells and
  from the lowest layer of cells the archegonia arise they resemble
  those of the liverworts but are shorter and the lower part is
  completely sunk within the tissues of the plant fig 66 g i
  they arise as single surface cells this first dividing into three
  by walls parallel to the outer surface the lower cell undergoes one
  or two divisions but undergoes no further change the second cell
  c o becomes the egg cell and from it is cut off another
  cell c the canal cell of the neck the uppermost of the three
  becomes the neck there are four rows of neck cells the two forward
  ones being longer than the others so that the neck is bent
  backward in the fullgrown archegonium there are two canal cells
  the lower one h b called the ventral canal cell being
  smaller than the other
  shortly before the archegonium opens the canal cells become
  disorganized in the same way as in the bryophytes and the
  protoplasm of the central cell contracts to form the egg cell which
  shows a large central nucleus and in favorable cases a clear
  space at the top called the receptive spot as it is here that the
  spermatozoid enters when ripe if placed in water the neck cells
  become very much distended and finally open widely at the top the
  upper ones not infrequently being detached and the remains of the
  neck cells are forced out fig 66 i
  the antheridia fig 66 j m arise as simple hemispherical
  cells in which two walls are formed k i ii the lower
  funnelshaped the upper hemispherical and meeting the lower one so
  as to enclose a central cell shaded in the figure from which the
  sperm cells arise finally a ringshaped wall l iii is formed
  cutting off a sort of cap cell so that the antheridium at this
  stage consists of a central cell surrounded by three other cells
  the two lower ringshaped the upper discshaped the central cell
  which contains dense glistening protoplasm is destitute of
  chlorophyll but the outer cells have a few small chloroplasts the
  former divides repeatedly until a mass of about thirtytwo sperm
  cells is formed each giving rise to a large spirallycoiled
  spermatozoid when ripe the mass of sperm cells crowds so upon the
  outer cells as to render them almost invisible and as they ripen
  they separate by a partial dissolving of the division walls when
  brought into water the outer cells of the antheridium swell
  strongly and the matter derived from the dissolved walls of the
  sperm cells also absorbs water so that finally the pressure becomes
  so great that the wall of the antheridium breaks and the sperm
  cells are forced out by the swelling up of the wall cells n
  o after lying a few moments in the water the wall of each sperm
  cell becomes completely dissolved and the spermatozoids are
  released and swim rapidly away with a twisting movement they may
  be killed with a little iodine when each is seen to be a somewhat
  flattened band coiled several times at the forward end the coils
  are smaller and there are numerous very long and delicate cilia at
  the hinder end may generally be seen a delicate sac p v
  containing a few small granules some of which usually show the
  reaction of starch turning blue when iodine is applied
  in studying the development of the antheridia it is only necessary
  to mount the plants in water and examine them directly but the
  study of the archegonia requires careful longitudinal sections of
  the prothallium to make these the prothallium should be placed
  between small pieces of pith and the razor must be very sharp it
  may be necessary to use a little potash to make the sections
  transparent enough to see the structure but this must be used
  cautiously on account of the great delicacy of the tissues
  if a plant with ripe archegonia is placed in a drop of water with
  the lower surface uppermost and at the same time male plants are
  put with it and the whole covered with a cover glass the
  archegonia and antheridia will open simultaneously and if examined
  with the microscope we shall see the spermatozoids collect about
  the open archegonia to which they are attracted by the substance
  forced out when it opens with a little patience one or more may be
  seen to enter the open neck through which it forces itself by a
  slow twisting movement down to the egg cell in order to make the
  experiment successful the plants should be allowed to become a
  little dry care being taken that no water is poured over them for a
  day or two beforehand
  the first divisions of the fertilized egg cell resemble those in the
  moss embryo except that the first wall is parallel with the
  archegonium axis instead of at right angles to it very soon
  however the embryo becomes very different four growing points
  being established instead of the single one found in the moss
  embryo the two growing points on the side of the embryo nearest the
  archegonium neck grow faster than the others one of these
  outstripping the other and soon becoming recognizable as the first
  leaf of the embryo fig 67 a l the other r is peculiar
  in having its growing point covered by several layers of cells cut
  off from its outer face a peculiarity which we shall find is
  characteristic of the roots of all the higher plants and indeed
  this is the first root of the young fern of the other two growing
  points the one next the leaf grows slowly forming a blunt cone
  st and is the apex of the stem the other f has no
  definite form and serves merely as an organ of absorption by means
  of which nourishment is supplied to the embryo from the prothallium
  it is known as the foot

  up to this point all the cells of the embryo are much alike and
  the embryo like that of the bryophytes is completely surrounded by
  the enlarged base of the archegonium compare fig 67 a with
  fig 55 but before the embryo breaks through the overlying cells a
  differentiation of the tissues begins in the axis of each of the
  four divisions the cells divide lengthwise so as to form a
  cylindrical mass of narrow cells not unlike those in the stem of a
  moss here however some of the cells undergo a further change the
  walls thicken in places and the cells lose their contents forming
  a peculiar conducting tissue tracheary tissue found only in the
  two highest subkingdoms the whole central cylinder is called a
  fibrovascular bundle and in its perfect form at least is found
  in no plants below the ferns which are also the first to develop
  true roots
the young root and leaf now rapidly elongate and burst through the
overlying cells the former growing downward and becoming fastened in
the ground the latter growing upward through the notch in the front
of the prothallium and increasing rapidly in size fig 67 b the
leaf is more or less deeply cleft and traversed by veins which are
continuations of the fibrovascular bundle of the stalk and
themselves fork once or twice the surface of the leaf is covered with
a welldeveloped epidermis and the cells occupying the space between
the veins contain numerous chloroplasts so that the little plant is
now quite independent of the prothallium which has hitherto supported
it as soon as the fern is firmly established the prothallium withers
away
comparing this now with the development of the sporogonium in the
bryophytes it is evident that the young fern is the equivalent of the
sporogonium or spore fruit of the former being like it the direct
product of the fertilized egg cell and the prothallium represents the
moss or liverwort upon which are borne the sexual organs in the
fern however the sporogonium becomes entirely independent of the
sexual plant and does not produce spores until it has reached a large
size living many years the sexual stage on the other hand is very
much reduced as we have seen being so small as to be ordinarily
completely overlooked but its resemblance to the lower liverworts
like riccia or the horned liverworts is obvious the terms
ophyte eggbearing plant and sporophyte sporebearing plant or
sporogonium are sometimes used to distinguish between the sexual
plant and the sporebearing one produced from it
the common maidenhair fern adiantum pedatum has been selected
here for studying the structure of the fullgrown sporophyte but
almost any other common fern will answer the maidenhair fern is
common in rich woods and may be at once recognized by the form of its
leaves these arise from a creeping underground stem fig 67 c
which is covered with brownish scales and each leaf consists of a
slender stalk reddish brown or nearly black in color which divides
into two equal branches at the top each of these main branches bears
a row of smaller ones on the outside and these have a row of delicate
leaflets on each side fig 67 e the stem of the plant is
fastened to the ground by means of numerous stout roots the youngest
of these near the growing point of the stem are unbranched but the
older ones branch extensively c
on breaking the stem across it is seen to be darkcolored except in
the centre which is traversed by a woody cylinder fibrovascular
bundle of a lighter color this is sometimes circular in sections
sometimes horseshoe shaped where the stem branches the bundle of
the branch may be traced back to where it joins that of the main stem
  a thin crosssection of the stem shows when magnified three
  regions first an outer row of cells often absent in the older
  portions this is the epidermis second within the epidermis are
  several rows of cells similar to the epidermal cells but somewhat
  larger and like them having darkbrown walls these merge gradually
  into larger cells with thicker golden brown walls fig 67 i
  the latter if sufficiently magnified show distinct striation of
  the walls which are often penetrated by deep narrow depressions or
  pits this thickwalled tissue is called stony tissue
  schlerenchyma all the cells contain numerous granules which the
  iodine test shows to be starch all of this second region lying
  between the epidermis and the fibrovascular bundle is known as the
  ground tissue the third region fibrovascular is as we have seen
  without the microscope circular or horseshoe shaped it is sharply
  separated from the ground tissue by a row of small cells called the
  bundle sheath the crosssection of the bundle of the leaf stalk
  resembles almost exactly that of the stem and as it is much
  easier to cut it is to be preferred in studying the arrangement of
  the tissues of the bundle fig 67 g within the bundle sheath
  sh there are two wellmarked regions a central band x of
  large empty cells with somewhat angular outlines and distinctly
  separated walls and an outer portion y filling up the space
  between these central cells and the bundle sheath the central
  tissue x is called the woody tissue xylem the outer the bast
  phloem the latter is composed of smaller cells of variable form
  and with softer walls than the wood cells
  a longitudinal section of either the stem or leaf stalk shows that
  all the cells are decidedly elongated especially those of the
  fibrovascular bundle the xylem fig 68 c x is made up
  principally of large empty cells with pointed ends whose walls are
  marked with closely set narrow transverse pits giving them the
  appearance of little ladders whence they are called scalariform
  or laddershaped markings these empty cells are known as
  tracheids and tissue composed of such empty cells tracheary
  tissue besides the tracheids there are a few small cells with
  oblique ends and with some granular contents
  the phloem is composed of cells similar to the latter but there may
  also be found especially in the stem other larger ones fig 67
  j whose walls are marked with shallow depressions whose bottoms
  are finely pitted these are the socalled sieve tubes
  for microscopical examination either fresh or alcoholic material
  may be used the sections being mounted in water potash will be
  found useful in rendering opaque sections transparent
the leaves when young are coiled up fig 67 c owing to growth
in the earlier stages being greater on the lower than on the upper
side as the leaf unfolds the stalk straightens and the upper
portion blade becomes flat
the general structure of the leaf stalk may be understood by making a
series of crosssections at different heights and examining them with
a hand lens the arrangement is essentially the same as in the stem
the epidermis and immediately underlying ground tissue are
darkcolored but the inner ground tissue is lightcolored and much
softer than the corresponding part of the stem and some of the outer
cells show a greenish color due to the presence of chlorophyll
the section of the fibrovascular bundle differs at different heights
near the base of the stalk fig d i it is horseshoeshaped but
if examined higher up it is found to divide ii iii one part going
to each of the main branches of the leaf these secondary bundles
divide further forming the veins of the leaflets
the leaflets e f are onesided the principal vein running
close to the lower edge and the others branching from it and forking
as they approach the upper margin which is deeply lobed the lobes
being again divided into teeth the leaflets are very thin and
delicate with extremely smooth surface which sheds water perfectly
if the plant is a large one some of the leaves will probably bear
spores the sporebearing leaves are at once distinguished by having
the middle of each lobe of the leaflets folded over upon the lower
side f on lifting one of these flaps numerous little rounded
bodies spore cases are seen whitish when young but becoming brown
as they ripen if a leaf with ripe spore cases is placed upon a piece
of paper as it dries the spores are discharged covering the paper
with the spores which look like fine brown powder

  a microscopical examination of the leaf stalk shows the tissues to
  be almost exactly like those of the stem except the inner ground
  tissue whose cells are thinwalled and colorless soft tissue or
  parenchyma instead of stony tissue the structure of the blade of
  the leaf however shows a number of peculiarities stripping off a
  little of the epidermis with a needle or shaving off a thin slice
  with a razor it may be examined in water removing the air if
  necessary with alcohol it is composed of a single layer of cells
  of very irregular outline except where it overlies a vein fig 68
  b f here the cells are long and narrow with heavy walls the
  epidermal cells contain numerous chloroplasts and on the under
  surface of the leaf breathing pores stomata sing stoma not
  unlike those on the capsules of some of the bryophytes each
  breathing pore consists of two special crescentshaped epidermal
  cells guard cells enclosing a central opening or pore
  communicating with an air space below they arise from cells of the
  young epidermis that divide by a longitudinal wall that separates
  in the middle leaving the space between

  by holding a leaflet between two pieces of pith and using a very
  sharp razor crosssections can be made such a section is shown in
  fig 68 a the epidermis e bounds the upper and lower
  surfaces and if a vein fb is cut across its structure is
  found to be like that of the fibrovascular bundle of the leaf
  stalk but much simplified
  the ground tissue of the leaf is composed of very loose thinwalled
  cells containing numerous chloroplasts between them are large and
  numerous intercellular spaces filled with air and communicating
  with the breathing pores these are the principal assimilating cells
  of the plant ie they are principally concerned in the
  absorption and decomposition of carbonic acid from the atmosphere
  and the manufacture of starch
  the spore cases or sporangia fig 69 are at first little papill
  a arising from the epidermal cells from which they are early
  cut off by a crosswall in the upper cell several walls next arise
  forming a short stalk composed of three rows of cells and an upper
  nearly spherical cellthe sporangium proper the latter now divides
  by four walls b c iiv into a central tetrahedral cell and
  four outer ones the central cell whose contents are much denser
  than the outer ones divides again by walls parallel to those first
  formed so that the young sporangium now consists of a central cell
  surrounded by two outer layers of cells from the central cell a
  group of cells is formed by further divisions d which finally
  become entirely separated from each other the outer cells of the
  spore case divide only by walls at right angles to their outer
  surface so that the wall is never more than two cells thick later
  the inner of these two layers becomes disorganized so that the
  central mass of cells floats free in the cavity of the sporangium
  which is now surrounded by but a single layer of cells e
  each of the central cells divides into four spores precisely as in
  the bryophytes the young spores g h are nearly colorless and
  are tetrahedral like a threesided pyramid in form as they ripen
  chlorophyll is formed in them and some oil the wall becomes
  differentiated into three layers the outer opaque and brown the
  two inner more delicate and colorless
  running around the outside of the ripe spore case is a single row of
  cells an differing from the others in shape and having their
  inner walls thickened near the bottom two sometimes four of
  these cells are wider than the others and their walls are more
  strongly thickened it is at this place st that the spore case
  opens when the ripe sporangium becomes dry the ring of thickened
  cells an contracts more strongly than the others and acts like
  a spring pulling the sporangium open and shaking out the spores
  which germinate readily under favorable conditions and form after a
  time the sexual plants prothallia
the roots of the sporophyte arise in large numbers the youngest being
always nearest the growing point of the stem or larger roots fig 67
c the growing roots are pointed at the end which is also
lightcolored the older parts becoming dark brown a crosssection of
the older portions shows a darkbrown ground tissue with a central
lightcolored circular fibrovascular bundle fig 68 f growing
from its outer surface are numerous brown root hairs r
  when magnified the walls of all the outer cells epidermis and
  ground tissue are found to be darkcolored but not very thick and
  the cells are usually filled with starch there is a bundle sheath
  of muchflattened cells separating the fibrovascular bundle from
  the ground tissue the bundle fig 68 g shows a band of
  tracheary tissue in the centre surrounded by colorless cells all
  about alike
  all of the organs of the fern grow from a definite apical cell but
  it is difficult to study except in the root
  selecting a fresh pretty large root a series of thin longitudinal
  sections should be made either holding the root directly in the
  fingers or placing it between pieces of pith in order to avoid
  drying of the sections as is indeed true in cutting any delicate
  tissue it is a good plan to wet the blade of the razor if the
  section has passed through the apex it will show the structure
  shown in figure 68 d the apical cell a is large and
  distinct irregularly triangular in outline it is really a
  triangular pyramid tetrahedron with the base upward which is
  shown by making a series of crosssections through the root tip and
  comparing them with the longitudinal sections the crosssection of
  the apical cell fig l appears also triangular showing all its
  faces to be triangles regular series of segments are cut off in
  succession from each of the four faces of the apical cell these
  segments undergo regular divisions also so that very early a
  differentiation of the tissues is evident and the three tissue
  systems epidermal ground and fibrovascular may be traced
  almost to the apex of the root 68 d from the outer series of
  segments is derived the peculiar structure root cap covering the
  delicate growing point and protecting it from injury
  the apices of the stem and leaves being otherwise protected
  develop segments only from the sides of the apical cell the outer
  face never having segments cut off from it
chapter xiii
classification of the pteridophytes
there are three wellmarked classes of the pteridophytes the ferns
filicin horsetails equisetin and the club mosses
lycopodin
class iferns filicin
the ferns constitute by far the greater number of pteridophytes and
their general structure corresponds with that of the maidenhair fern
described there are three orders of which two the true ferns
filices and the addertongues ophioglossace are represented
in the united states a third order intermediate in some respects
between these two and called the ringless ferns marattiace has
no representatives within our territory
the classification is at present based largely upon the characters of
the sporophyte the sexual plants being still very imperfectly known
in many forms
the addertongues ophioglossace are mostly plants of rather small
size ranging from about ten to fifty centimetres in height there are
two genera in the united states the true addertongues
ophioglossum and the grape ferns botrychium they send up but
one leaf each year and this in fruiting specimens fig 70 a is
divided into two portions the spore bearing x and the green
vegetative part in botrychium the leaves are more or less deeply
divided and the sporangia distinct fig 71 b in ophioglossum
the sterile division of the leaf is usually smooth and undivided and
the sporebearing division forms a sort of spike and the sporangia
are much less distinct the sporangia in both differ essentially from
those of the true ferns in not being derived from a single epidermal
cell but are developed in part from the ground tissue of the leaf

in the true ferns filices the sporangia resemble those already
described arising in all unless possibly osmunda from a single
epidermal cell
one group the water ferns rhizocarpe produce two kinds of
spores large and small the former produce male the latter female
prothallia in both cases the prothallium is small and often scarcely
protrudes beyond the spore and may be reduced to a single archegonium
or antheridium fig 71 b c with only one or two cells
representing the vegetative cells of the prothallium v the water
ferns are all aquatic or semiaquatic plants few in number and scarce
or local in their distribution the commonest are those of the genus
marsilia fig 71 a looking like a fourleaved clover others
salvinia azolla are floating forms fig 71 d

of the true ferns there are a number of families distinguished mainly
by the position of the sporangia as well as by some differences in
their structure of our common ferns those differing most widely from
the types are the flowering ferns osmunda shown in figure 70
c d in these the sporangia are large and the ring r
rudimentary the leaflets bearing the sporangia are more or less
contracted and covered completely with the sporangia sometimes all
the leaflets of the sporebearing leaf being thus changed sometimes
only a few of them as in the species figured
our other common ferns have the sporangia in groups sori sing
sorus on the backs of the leaves these sori are of different shape
in different genera and are usually protected by a delicate
membranous covering indusium illustrations of some of the commonest
genera are shown in figure 70 e j
class iihorsetails equisetin
the second class of the pteridophytes includes the horsetails
equisetin of which all living forms belong to a single genus
equisetum formerly they were much more numerous than at present
remains of many different forms being especially abundant in the coal
formations

one of the commonest forms is the field horsetail equisetum
arvense a very abundant and widely distributed species it grows in
low moist ground and is often found in great abundance growing in
the sand or gravel used as ballast for railway tracks
the plant sends up branches of two kinds from a creeping underground
stem that may reach a length of a metre or more this stem fig 72
c is distinctly jointed bearing at each joint a toothed sheath
best seen in the younger portions as they are apt to be destroyed in
the older parts sometimes attached to this are small tubers o
which are muchshortened branches and under favorable circumstances
give rise to new stems they have a hard brown rind and are composed
within mainly of a firm white tissue filled with starch
the surface of the stem is marked with furrows and a section across
it shows that corresponding to these are as many large air spaces that
traverse the stem from joint to joint from the joints numerous roots
quite like those of the ferns arise
if the stem is dug up in the late fall or winter numerous short
branches of a lighter color will be found growing from the joints
these later grow up above ground into branches of two sorts those
produced first fig 72 a in april or may are stouter than the
others and nearly destitute of chlorophyll they are usually twenty
to thirty centimetres in height of a light reddish brown color and
like all the stems distinctly jointed the sheaths about the joints
l are much larger than in the others and have from ten to twelve
large black teeth at the top these sheaths are the leaves at the top
of the branch the joints are very close together and the leaves of
different form and closely set so as to form a compact cone x
a crosssection of the stem d shows much the same structure as the
underground stem but the number of air spaces is larger and in
addition there is a large central cavity the fibrovascular bundles
fb are arranged in a circle alternating with the air channels
and each one has running through it a small air passage
the cone at the top of the branch is made up of closely set
shieldshaped leaves which are mostly sixsided on account of the
pressure these leaves f g have short stalks and are arranged
in circles about the stem each one has a number of spore cases
hanging down from the edge and opening by a cleft on the inner side
g sp they are filled with a mass of greenish spores that
shake out at the slightest jar when ripe
the sterile branches b are more slender than the sporebearing
ones and the sheaths shorter surrounding the joints apparently just
below the sheaths but really breaking through their bases are
circles of slender branches resembling the main branch but more
slender the sterile branches grow to a height of forty to fifty
centimetres and from their bushy form the popular name of the plant
horsetail is taken the surface of the plant is hard and rough
due to the presence of great quantities of flint in the epidermisa
peculiarity common to all the species
  the stem is mainly composed of large thinwalled cells becoming
  smaller as they approach the epidermis the outer cells of the
  ground tissue in the green branches contain chlorophyll and the
  walls of some of them are thickened the fibrovascular bundles
  differ entirely from those of the ferns each bundle is nearly
  triangular in section e with the point inward and the inner
  end occupied by a large air space the tracheary tissue is only
  slightly developed being represented by a few vessels9 tr at
  the outer angles of the bundle and one or two smaller ones close to
  the air channel the rest of the bundle is made up of nearly
  uniform rather thinwalled colorless cells some of which
  however are larger and have perforated crosswalls representing
  the sieve tubes of the fern bundle there is no individual bundle
  sheath but the whole circle of bundles has a common outer sheath
9 a vessel differs from a tracheid in being composed of several
cells placed end to end the partitions being wholly or partially
absorbed so as to throw the cells into close communication
  the epidermis is composed of elongated cells whose walls present a
  peculiar beaded appearance due to the deposition of flint within
  them the breathing pores are arranged in vertical lines and
  resemble in general appearance those of the ferns though differing
  in some minor details like the other epidermal cells the guard
  cells have heavy deposits of flint which here are in the form of
  thick transverse bars
  the spore cases have thin walls whose cells shortly before
  maturity develop thickenings upon their walls which have to do
  with the opening of the spore case the spores h i are round
  cells containing much chlorophyll and provided with four peculiar
  appendages called elaters the elaters are extremely sensitive to
  changes in moisture coiling up tightly when moistened i but
  quickly springing out again when dry h by dusting a few dry
  spores upon a slide and putting it under the microscope without any
  water the movement may be easily examined lightly breathing upon
  them will cause the elaters to contract but in a moment as soon as
  the moisture of the breath has evaporated they will uncoil with a
  quick jerk causing the spores to move about considerably
  the fresh spores begin to germinate within about twentyfour hours
  and the early stages which closely resemble those of the ferns may
  be easily followed by sowing the spores in water with care it is
  possible to get the mature prothallia which should be treated as
  described for the fern prothallia under favorable conditions the
  first antheridia are ripe in about five weeks the archegonia which
  are borne on separate plants a few weeks later the antheridia
  fig 72 j an are larger than those of the ferns and the
  spermatozoids k are thicker and with fewer coils but otherwise
  much like fern spermatozoids
  the archegonia have a shorter neck than those of the ferns and the
  neck is straight
  both male and female prothallia are much branched and very irregular
  in shape
there are a number of common species of equisetum some of them
like the common scouring rush e hiemale are unbranched and the
spores borne at the top of ordinary green branches others have all
the stems branching like the sterile stems of the field horsetail
but produce a sporebearing cone at the top of some of them
class iiithe club mosses lycopodin
the last class of the pteridophytes includes the ground pines club
mosses etc and among cultivated plants numerous species of the
smaller club mosses selaginella
two orders are generally recognized although there is some doubt as
to the relationship of the members of the second order the first
order the larger club mosses lycopodiace is represented in the
northern states by a single genus lycopodium of which the common
ground pine l dendroideum fig 73 is a familiar species the
plant grows in the evergreen forests of the northern united states as
well as in the mountains further south and in the larger northern
cities is often sold in large quantities at the holidays for
decorating it sends up from a creeping woody subterranean stem
numerous smaller stems which branch extensively and are thickly set
with small mosslike leaves the whole looking much like a little
tree at the ends of some of the branches are small cones a x
b composed of closely overlapping scalelike leaves much as in a
fir cone near the base on the inner surface of each of these scales
is a kidneyshaped capsule c sp opening by a cleft along the
upper edge and filled with a mass of fine yellow powder these
capsules are the spore cases
the bases of the upright stems are almost bare but become covered
with leaves higher up the leaves are in shape like those of a moss
but are thicker the sporebearing leaves are broader and when
slightly magnified show a toothed margin
the stem is traversed by a central fibrovascular cylinder that
separates easily from the surrounding tissue owing to the rupture of
the cells of the bundle sheath this being particularly frequent in
dried specimens when slightly magnified the arrangement of the
tissues may be seen fig 73 e within the epidermis is a mass of
ground tissue of firm woody texture surrounding the central oval or
circular fibrovascular cylinder this shows a number of white bars
xylem surrounded by a more delicate tissue phloem
  on magnifying the section more strongly the cells of the ground
  tissue g are seen to be oval in outline with thick striated
  walls and small intercellular spaces examined in longitudinal
  sections they are long and pointed belonging to the class of cells
  known as fibres

  the xylem f xy of the fibrovascular bundle is composed of

  the spores d are destitute of chlorophyll and have upon the
  outside a network of ridges except on one side where three straight
  lines converge the spore being slightly flattened between them
  almost nothing is known of the prothallia of our native species
the second order ligulat is represented by two very distinct
families the smaller club mosses selaginelle and the quillworts
isoete of the former the majority are tropical but are common
in greenhouses where they are prized for their delicate mosslike
foliage fig 74 a

the leaves in most species are like those of the larger club mosses
but more delicate they are arranged in four rows on the upper side of
the stem two being larger than the others the smaller branches grow
out sideways so that the whole branch appears flattened reminding one
of the habit of the higher liverworts special leafless branches b
r often grow downward from the lower side of the main branches and
on touching the ground develop roots which fork regularly
the sporangia are much like those of the ground pines and produced
singly at the bases of scale leaves arranged in a spike or cone a
sp but two kinds of spores large and small are formed in the
species figured the lower sporangium produces four large spores
macrospores the others numerous small spores microspores
even before the spores are ripe the development of the prothallium
begins and this is significant as it shows an undoubted
relationship between these plants and the lowest of the seed plants
as we shall see when we study that group
  if ripe spores can be obtained by sowing them upon moist earth the
  young plants will appear in about a month the microspore fig 74
  k produces a prothallium not unlike that of some of the water
  ferns there being a single vegetative cell x and the rest of
  the prothallium forming a single antheridium the spermatozoids are
  excessively small and resemble those of the bryophytes
  the macrospore divides into two cells a large lower one and a
  smaller upper one the latter gives rise to a flat disc of cells
  producing a number of small archegonia of simple structure fig 74
  i j the lower cell produces later a tissue that serves to
  nourish the young embryo
  the development of the embryo recalls in some particulars that of
  the seed plants and this in connection with the peculiarities of
  the sporangia warrants us in regarding the ligulat as the highest
  of existing pteridophytes and to a certain extent connecting them
  with the lowest of the spermaphytes
resembling the smaller club mosses in their development but differing
in some important points are the quillworts isoete they are
mostly aquatic forms growing partially or completely submerged and
look like grasses or rushes they vary from a few centimetres to half
a metre in height the stem is very short and the long cylindrical
leaves closely crowded together the leaves which are narrow above are
widely expanded and overlapping at the base the spores are of two
kinds as in selaginella but the macrosporangia contain numerous
macrospores the very large sporangia m sp are in cavities at
the bases of the leaves and above each sporangium is a little pointed
outgrowth ligula which is also found in the leaves of
selaginella the quillworts are not common plants and owing to
their habits of growth and resemblance to other plants are likely to
be overlooked unless careful search is made
chapter xiv
subkingdom vi
spermaphytes phnogams
the last and highest great division of the vegetable kingdom has been
named spermaphyta seed plants from the fact that the structures
known as seeds are peculiar to them they are also commonly called
flowering plants though this name might be also appropriately given
to certain of the higher pteridophytes
in the seed plants the macrosporangia remain attached to the parent
plant in nearly all cases until the archegonia are fertilized and
the embryo plant formed the outer walls of the sporangium now become
hard and the whole falls off as a seed
in the higher spermaphytes the sporebearing leaves sporophylls
become much modified and receive special names those bearing the
microspores being commonly known as stamens those bearing the
macrospores carpels or carpophylls the macrosporangia are also
ordinarily known as ovules a name given before it was known that
these were the same as the macrosporangia of the higher pteridophytes
in addition to the sporebearing leaves those surrounding them may be
much changed in form and brilliantly colored forming with the
enclosed sporophylls the flower of the higher spermaphytes
as might be expected the tissues of the higher spermaphytes are the
most highly developed of all plants though some of them are very
simple the plants vary extremely in size the smallest being little
floating plants less than a millimetre in diameter while others are
gigantic trees a hundred metres and more in height
there are two classes of the spermaphytes i the gymnosperms or
nakedseeded ones in which the ovules macrosporangia are borne upon
open carpophylls and ii angiosperms coveredseeded plants in
which the carpophylls form a closed cavity ovary containing the
ovules
class igymnosperms gymnosperm
the most familiar of these plants are the common evergreen trees
conifers pines spruces cedars etc a careful study of one of
these will give a good idea of the most important characteristics of
the class and one of the best for this purpose is the scotch pine
pinus sylvestris which though a native of europe is not
infrequently met with in cultivation in america if this species
cannot be had by the student other pines or indeed almost any other
conifer will answer the scotch pine is a tree of moderate size
symmetrical in growth when young with a central main shaft and
circles of branches at regular intervals but as it grows older its
growth becomes irregular and the crown is divided into several main
branches10 the trunk and branches are covered with a rough scaly
bark of a reddish brown color where it is exposed by the scaling off
of the outer layers covering the younger branches but becoming
thinner on the older ones are numerous needleshaped leaves these
are in pairs and the base of each pair is surrounded by several dry
blackish scales each pair of leaves is really attached to a very
short side branch but this is so short as to make the leaves appear
to grow directly from the main branch each leaf is about ten
centimetres in length and two millimetres broad where the leaves are
in contact they are flattened but the outer side is rounded so that
a crosssection is nearly semicircular in outline with a lens it is
seen that there are five longitudinal lines upon the surface of the
leaf and careful examination shows rows of small dots corresponding
to these these dots are the breathing pores if a crosssection is
even slightly magnified it shows three distinct partsa whitish
outer border a bright green zone and a central oval colorless area
in which with a little care may be seen the sections of two
fibrovascular bundles in the green zone are sometimes to be seen
colorless spots sections of resin ducts containing the resin so
characteristic of the tissues of the conifers
10 in most conifers the symmetrical form of the young tree is
maintained as long as the tree lives
the general structure of the stem may be understood by making a series
of crosssections through branches of different ages in all three
regions are distinguishable viz an outer region bark or cortex
fig 76 a c composed in part of green cells and if the
section has been made with a sharp knife showing a circle of little
openings from each of which oozes a clear drop of resin these are
large resin ducts r the centre is occupied by a soft white tissue
pith and the space between the pith and bark is filled by a mass of
woody tissue traversing the wood are numerous radiating lines some
of which run from the bark to the pith others only part way these
are called the medullary rays while in sections from branches of any
age these three regions are recognizable their relative size varies
extremely in a section of a twig of the present year the bark and
pith make up a considerable part of the section but as older branches
are examined we find a rapid increase in the quantity of wood while
the thickness of the bark increases but slowly and the pith scarcely
at all in the wood too each years growth is marked by a distinct
ring a i ii as the branches grow in diameter the outer bark
becomes split and irregular and portions die becoming brown and
hard
the tree has a very perfect root system but different from that of
any pteridophytes the first root of the embryo persists as the main
or tap root of the fullgrown tree and from it branch off the
secondary roots which in turn give rise to others
the sporangia are borne on special scalelike leaves and arranged
very much as in certain pteridophytes notably the club mosses but
instead of large and small spores being produced near together the
two kinds are borne on special branches or even on distinct trees
eg red cedar in the scotch pine the microspores are ripe about
the end of may the leaves bearing them are aggregated in small cones
flowers crowded about the base of a growing shoot terminating the
branches fig 77 a  the individual leaves sporophylls are
nearly triangular in shape and attached by the smaller end on the
lower side of each are borne two sporangia pollen sacs c sp
opening by a longitudinal slit and filled with innumerable yellow
microspores pollen spores which fall out as a shower of yellow dust
if the branch is shaken
the macrosporangia ovules are borne on similar leaves known as
carpels and like the pollen sacs borne in pairs but on the upper
side of the sporophyll instead of the lower the female flowers appear
when the pollen is ripe the leaves of which they are composed are
thicker than those of the male flowers and of a pinkish color at the
base on the upper side are borne the two ovules macrosporangia
fig 77 e o and running through the centre is a ridge that
ends in a little spine or point
the ovulebearing leaf has on the back a scale with fringed edge f
sc quite conspicuous when the flower is young but scarcely to be
detected in the older cone from the female flower is developed the
cone fig 75 a but the process is a slow one occupying two
years shortly after the pollen is shed the female flowers which are
at first upright bend downward and assume a brownish color growing
considerably in size for a short time and then ceasing to grow for
several months

in figure 75 b is shown such a flower as it appears in the winter
and early spring following the leaves are thick and fleshy closely
pressed together as is seen by dividing the flower lengthwise and
each leaf ends in a long point d the ovules are still very small
as the growth of the tree is resumed in the spring the flower cone
increases rapidly in size and becomes decidedly green in color the
ovules increasing also very much in size if a scale from such a cone
is examined about the first of june the ovules will probably be
nearly fullgrown oval whitish bodies two to three millimetres in
length a careful longitudinal section of the scale through the ovule
will show the general structure such a section is shown in figure 77
g comparing this with the sporangia of the pteridophytes the first
difference that strikes us is the presence of an outer coat or
integument in which is absent in the latter the single
macrospore sp is very large and does not lie free in the cavity
of the sporangium but is in close contact with its wall it is filled
with a colorless tissue the prothallium and if mature with care it
is possible to see even with a hand lens two or more denser oval
bodies ar the egg cells of the archegonia which here are very
large the integument is not entirely closed at the top but leaves a
little opening through which the pollen spores entered when the flower
was first formed
after the archegonia are fertilized the outer parts of the ovule
become hard and brown and serve to protect the embryo plant which
reaches a considerable size before the sporangium falls off as the
walls of the ovule harden the carpel or leaf bearing it undergoes a
similar change becoming extremely hard and woody and as each one
ends in a sharp spine and they are tightly packed together it is
almost impossible to separate them the ripe cone fig 75 a
remains closed during the winter but in the spring about the time
the flowers are mature the scales open spontaneously and discharge
the ripened ovules now called seeds each seed e s is
surrounded by a membranous envelope derived from the scale to which it
is attached which becomes easily separated from the seed the opening
of the cones is caused by drying and if a number of ripe cones are
gathered in the winter or early spring and allowed to dry in an
ordinary room they will in a day or two open often with a sharp
crackling sound and scatter the ripe seeds
a section of a ripe seed f shows the embryo em surrounded by
a dense white starchbearing tissue derived from the prothallium
cells and called the endosperm this fills up the whole seed which
is surrounded by the hardened shell derived from the integument and
wall of the ovule the embryo is elongated with a circle of small
leaves at the end away from the opening of the ovule toward which is
directed the root of the embryo
the seed may remain unchanged for months or even years without
losing its vitality but if the proper conditions are provided the
embryo will develop into a new plant to follow the further growth of
the embryo the ripe seeds should be planted in good soil and kept
moderately warm and moist at the end of a week or two some of the
seeds will probably have sprouted the seed absorbs water and the
protoplasm of the embryo renews its activity beginning to feed upon
the nourishing substances in the cells of the endosperm the embryo
rapidly increases in length and the root pushes out of the seed
growing rapidly downward and fastening itself in the soil g r
cutting the seed lengthwise we find that the leaves have increased
much in length and become green one of the few cases where
chlorophyll is formed in the absence of light as these leaves
called cotyledons or seed leaves increase in length they
gradually withdraw from the seed whose contents they have exhausted
and the young plant enters upon an independent existence
the young plant has a circle of leaves about six in number
surrounding a bud which is the growing point of the stem and in many
conifers persists as long as the stem grows fig 75 k b a
crosssection of the young stem shows about six separate
fibrovascular bundles arranged in a circle s fb the root
shows a central fibrovascular cylinder surrounded by a darkcolored
ground tissue growing from its surface are numerous root hairs

  for examining the microscopic structure of the pine fresh material
  is for most purposes to be preferred but alcoholic material will
  answer and as the alcohol hardens the resin it is for that reason
  preferable
  crosssections of the leaf when sufficiently magnified show that
  the outer colorless border of the section is composed of two parts
  the epidermis of a single row of regular cells with very thick outer
  walls and irregular groups of cells lying below them these latter
  have thick walls appearing silvery and clearer than the epidermal
  cells they vary a good deal in some leaves being reduced to a
  single row in others forming very conspicuous groups of some size
  the green tissue of the leaf is much more compact than in the fern
  we examined and the cells are more nearly round and the
  intercellular spaces smaller the chloroplasts are numerous and
  nearly round in shape
  scattered through the green tissue are several resin passages r
  each surrounded by a circle of colorless thickwalled cells like
  those under the epidermis at intervals in the latter are
  openingsbreathing poresfig 76 j below each of which is an
  intercellular space i they are in structure like those of the
  ferns but the walls of the guard cells are much thickened like the
  other epidermal cells
  each leaf is traversed by two fibrovascular bundles of entirely
  different structure from those of the ferns each is divided into
  two nearly equal parts the wood x lying toward the inner flat
  side of the leaf the bast t toward the outer convex side this
  type of bundle called collateral is the common form found in the
  stems and leaves of seed plants the cells of the wood or xylem are
  rather larger than those of the bast or phloem and have thicker
  walls than any of the phloem cells except the outermost ones which
  are thickwalled fibres like those under the epidermis lying
  between the bundles are comparatively large colorless cells and
  surrounding the whole central area is a single line of cells that
  separates it sharply from the surrounding green tissue
  in longitudinal sections the cells except of the mesophyll green
  tissue are much elongated the mesophyll cells however are short
  and the intercellular spaces much more evident than in the
  crosssection the colorless cells have frequently rounded
  depressions or pits upon their walls and in the fibrovascular
  bundle the difference between the two portions becomes more obvious
  the wood is distinguished by the presence of vessels with close
  spiral or ringshaped thickenings while in the phloem are found
  sieve tubes not unlike those in the ferns
  the fibrovascular bundles of the stem of the seedling plant show a
  structure quite similar to that of the leaf but very soon a
  difference is manifested between the two parts of the bundle the
  cells continue to divide and add constantly to the size of the
  bundle and at the same time the bundles become connected by a line
  of similar growing cells so that very early we find a ring of
  growing cells extending completely around the stem as the cells in
  this ring increase in number owing to their rapid division those
  on the borders of the ring lose the power of dividing and gradually
  assume the character of the cells on which they border fig 76
  b cam the growth on the inside of the ring is more rapid
  than on the outer border and the ring continues comparatively near
  the surface of the stem fig 76 a cam the spaces between
  the bundles do not increase materially in breadth and as the
  bundles increase in size become in comparison very small appearing
  in older stems as mere lines between the solid masses of wood that
  make up the inner portion of the bundles these are the primary
  medullary rays and connect the pith in the centre of the stem with
  the bark later similar plates of cells are formed often only a
  single cell thick and appearing when seen in crosssection as a
  single row of elongated cells c m
  as the stem increases in diameter the bundles become broader and
  broader toward the outside and taper to a point toward the centre
  appearing wedgeshaped the inner ends projecting into the pith the
  outer limits of the bundles are not nearly so distinct and it is
  not easy to tell when the phloem of the bundles ends and the ground
  tissue of the bark begins
  a careful examination of a crosssection of the bark shows first if
  taken from a branch not more than two or three years old the
  epidermis composed of cells not unlike those of the leaf but whose
  walls are usually browner underneath are cells with brownish walls
  and often more or less dry and dead these cells give the brown
  color to the bark and later both epidermis and outer ground tissue
  become entirely dead and disappear the bulk of the ground tissue is
  made up of rather large loose cells the outer ones containing a
  good deal of chlorophyll here and there are large resin ducts
  fig 76 h appearing in crosssection as oval openings
  surrounded by several concentric rows of cells the innermost
  smaller and with denser contents these secrete the resin that fills
  the duct and oozes out when the stem is cut all of the cells of the
  bark contain more or less starch
  the phloem when strongly magnified is seen to be made up of cells
  arranged in nearly regular radiating rows their walls are not very
  thick and the cells are usually somewhat flattened in a radial
  direction
  some of the cells are larger than the others and these are found to
  be when examined in longitudinal section sieve tubes fig 76
  e with numerous lateral sieve plates quite similar to those found
  in the stems of ferns

  the growing tissue cambium separating the phloem from the wood
  is made up of cells quite like those of the phloem into which they
  insensibly merge except that their walls are much thinner as is
  always the case with rapidly growing cells these cells b
  cam are arranged in radial rows and divide mainly by walls at
  right angles to the radii of the stem if we examine the inner side
  of the ring the change the cells undergo is more marked they
  become of nearly equal diameter in all directions and the walls
  become woody showing at the same time distinct stratification b
  x
  on examining the xylem where two growth rings are in contact the
  reason of the sharply marked line seen when the stem is examined
  with the naked eye is obvious on the inner side of this line i
  the wood cells are comparatively small and much flattened while the
  walls are quite as heavy as those of the much larger cells ii
  lying on the outer side of the line the small cells show the point
  where growth ceased at the end of the season the cells becoming
  smaller as growth was feebler the following year when growth
  commenced again the first wood cells formed by the cambium were
  much larger as growth is most vigorous at this time and the wood
  formed of these larger cells is softer and lighter colored than that
  formed of the smaller cells of the autumn growth
  the wood is mainly composed of tracheids there being no vessels
  formed except the first year these tracheids are characterized by
  the presence of peculiar pits upon their walls best seen when thin
  longitudinal sections are made in a radial direction these pits
  fig 76 d p appear in this view as double circles but if
  cut across as often happens in a crosssection of the stem or in a
  longitudinal section at right angles to the radius tangential
  they are seen to be in shape something like an inverted saucer with
  a hole through the bottom they are formed in pairs one on each
  side of the wall of adjacent tracheids and are separated by a very
  delicate membrane f p g y these bordered pits are
  very characteristic of the wood of all conifers
  the structure of the root is best studied in the seedling plant or
  in a rootlet of an older one the general plan of the root is much
  like that of the pteridophytes the fibrovascular bundle fig 75
  m fb is of the socalled radial type there being three xylem
  masses x alternating with as many phloem masses ph in the
  root of the seedling this regularity becomes destroyed as the root
  grows older by the formation of a cambium ring something like that
  in the stem
  the development of the sporangia is on the whole much like that of
  the club mosses and will not be examined here in detail the
  microspores pollen spores are formed in groups of four in
  precisely the same way as the spores of the bryophytes and
  pteridophytes and by collecting the male flowers as they begin to
  appear in the spring and crushing the sporangia in water the
  process of division may be seen for more careful examination they
  may be crushed in a mixture of water and acetic acid to which is
  added a little gentian violet this mixture fixes and stains the
  nuclei of the spores and very instructive preparations may thus be
  made11

  x these pollen spores are carried by the wind to the ovules
  where they germinate
  the wall of the ripe sporangium or pollen sac is composed of a
  single layer of cells in most places and these cells are provided
  with thickened ridges which have to do with opening the pollen sac
  we have already examined in some detail the structure of the
  macrosporangium or ovule in the fullgrown ovule the macrospore
  which in the seed plants is generally known as the embryo sac is
  completely filled with the prothallium or endosperm in the upper
  part of the prothallium several large archegonia are formed in much
  the same way as in the pteridophytes the egg cell is very large
  and appears of a yellowish color and filled with large drops that
  give it a peculiar aspect there is a large nucleus but it is not
  always readily distinguished from the other contents of the egg
  cell the neck of the archegonium is quite long but does not
  project above the surface of the prothallium fig 77 h
the pollen spores are produced in great numbers and many of them fall
upon the female flowers which when ready for pollination have the
scales somewhat separated the pollen spores now sift down to the base
of the scales and finally reach the opening of the ovule where they
germinate no spermatozoids are produced the seed plants differing in
this respect from all pteridophytes the pollen spore bursts its
outer coat and sends out a tube which penetrates for some distance
into the tissue of the ovule acting very much as a parasitic fungus
would do and growing at the expense of the tissue through which it
grows after a time growth ceases and is not resumed until the
development of the female prothallium and archegonia is nearly
complete which does not occur until more than a year from the time
the pollen spore first reaches the ovule finally the pollen tube
penetrates down to and through the open neck of the archegonium until
it comes in contact with the egg cell these stages can only be seen
by careful sections through a number of ripe ovules but the track of
the pollen tube is usually easy to follow as the cells along it are
often brown and apparently dead fig 77 g
classification of the gymnosperms
there are three classes of the gymnosperms i cycads cycade
ii conifers conifer iii joint firs gnetace all of the
gymnosperms of the northern united states belong to the second order
but representatives of the others are found in the southern and
southwestern states
the cycads are palmlike forms having a single trunk crowned by a
circle of compound leaves several species are grown for ornament in
conservatories and a few species occur native in florida but
otherwise do not occur within our limits

leaf of a cycad cycas with macrosporangia ovules ov  
b leaf of gingko   c branch of hemlock tsuga with a
ripe cone  1 d red cedar juniperus  1 e arborvit
thuja  1
the sporebearing leaves usually form cones recalling somewhat in
structure those of the horsetails but one of the commonest
cultivated species cycas revoluta bears the ovules which are very
large upon leaves that are in shape much like the ordinary ones
fig 78 a
of the conifers there are numerous familiar forms including all our
common evergreen trees there are two subordersthe true conifers
and the yews in the latter there is no true cone but the ovules are
borne singly at the end of a branch and the seed in the yew taxus
is surrounded by a bright red fleshy integument one species of yew
a low straggling shrub occurs sparingly in the northern states and
is the only representative of the group at the north the european yew
and the curious japanese gingko fig 78 b are sometimes met
with in cultivation
of the true conifers there are a number of families based on
peculiarities in the leaves and cones some have needleshaped leaves
and dry cones like the firs spruces hemlock fig 78 c others
have flattened scalelike leaves and more or less fleshy cones like
the red cedar fig 78 d and arborvit e
a few of the conifers such as the tamarack or larch larix and
cypress taxodium lose their leaves in the autumn and are not
therefore properly evergreen
the conifers include some of the most valuable as well as the largest
of trees their timber especially that of some of the pines is
particularly valuable and the resin of some of them is also of much
commercial importance here belong the giant redwoods sequoia of
california the largest of all american trees
the joint firs are comparatively small plants rarely if ever reaching
the dimensions of trees they are found in various parts of the world
but are few in number and not at all likely to be met with by the
ordinary student their flowers are rather more highly differentiated
than those of the other gymnosperms and are said to show some
approach in structure to those of the angiosperms
chapter xv
spermaphytes
class iiangiosperms
the angiosperms include an enormous assemblage of plants all those
ordinarily called flowering plants belonging here there is almost
infinite variety shown in the form and structure of the tissues and
organs this being particularly the case with the flowers as already
stated the ovules instead of being borne on open carpels are
enclosed in a cavity formed by a single closed carpel or several
united carpels to the organ so formed the name pistil is usually
applied and this is known as simple or compound as it is
composed of one or of two or more carpels the leaves bearing the
pollen spores are also much modified and form the socalled
stamens in addition to the sporebearing leaves there are usually
other modified leaves surrounding them these being often brilliantly
colored and rendering the flower very conspicuous to these leaves
surrounding the sporophylls the general name of perianth or
perigone is given the perigone has a twofold purpose serving both
to protect the sporophylls and at least in brightcolored flowers
to attract insects which as we shall see are important agents in
transferring pollen from one flower to another
when we compare the embryo sac macrospore of the angiosperms with
that of the gymnosperms a great difference is noticed there being
much more difference than between the latter and the higher
pteridophytes unfortunately there are very few plants where the
structure of the embryo sac can be readily seen without very skilful
manipulation
  there are however a few plants in which the ovules are very small
  and transparent so that they may be mounted whole and examined
  alive the best plant for this purpose is probably the indian pipe
  or ghost flower a curious plant growing in rich woods blossoming
  in late summer it is a parasite or saprophyte and entirely
  destitute of chlorophyll being pure white throughout it bears a
  single nodding flower at the summit of the stem another species
  much like it but having several brownish flowers is shown in
  figure 115 l
  if this plant can be had the structure of the ovule and embryo sac
  may be easily studied by simply stripping away the tissue bearing
  the numerous minute ovules and mounting a few of them in water or
  water to which a little sugar has been added
illustration fig 79a ripe ovule of monotropa uniflora in
optical section  100 m micropyle e embryo sac b the
embryo sac  300 at the top is the egg apparatus consisting of the
two synergid s and the egg cell o in the centre is the
endosperm nucleus k at the bottom the antipodal cells g
  the ovules are attached to a stalk and each consists of about two
  layers of colorless cells enclosing a central large oblong cell
  fig 79 a e the embryo sac or macrospore if the ovule is
  from a flower that has been open for some time we shall find in the
  centre of the embryo sac a large nucleus k or possibly two
  which afterward unite into one and at each end three cells those
  at the base g probably represent the prothallium and those at
  the upper end a very rudimentary archegonium here generally called
  the egg apparatus
  of the three cells of the egg apparatus the lower o one is the
  egg cell the others are called synergid the structure of the
  embryo sac and ovules is quite constant among the angiosperms the
  differences being mainly in the shape of the ovules and the degree
  to which its coverings or integuments are developed
  the pollen spores of many angiosperms will germinate very easily in
  a solution of common sugar in water about fifteen per cent of sugar
  is the best a very good plant for this purpose is the sweet pea
  whose pollen germinates very rapidly especially in warm weather
  the spores may be sown in a little of the sugar solution in any
  convenient vessel or in a hanging drop suspended in a moist
  chamber as described for germinating the spores of the slime
  moulds the tube begins to develop within a few minutes after the
  spores are placed in the solution and within an hour or so will
  have reached a considerable length each spore has two nuclei but
  they are less evident here than in some other forms fig 79
illustration fig 80germinating pollen spores of the sweet pea
 200
the upper part of the pistil is variously modified having either
little papill which hold the pollen spores or are viscid in either
case the spores germinate when placed upon this receptive part
stigma of the pistil and send their tubes down through the tissues
of the pistil until they reach the ovules which are fertilized much
as in the gymnosperms
the effect of fertilization extends beyond the ovule the ovary and
often other parts of the flower being affected enlarging and often
becoming brightcolored and juicy forming the various fruits of the
angiosperms these fruits when ripe may be either dry as in the case
of grains of various kinds beans peas etc or the ripe fruit may
be juicy serving in this way to attract animals of many kinds which
feed on the juicy pulp and leave the hard seeds uninjured thus
helping to distribute them common examples of these fleshy fruits are
offered by the berries of many plants apples melons cherries etc
are also familiar examples
the seeds differ a good deal both in regard to size and the degree to
which the embryo is developed at the time the seed ripens
classification of the angiosperms
the angiosperms are divided into two subclasses i monocotyledons
and ii dicotyledons
the monocotyledons comprise many familiar plants both ornamental and
useful they have for the most part elongated smoothedged leaves
with parallel veins and the parts of the flower are in threes in the
majority of them as their name indicates there is but one cotyledon
or seed leaf and the leaves from the first are alternate as a rule
the embryo is very small and surrounded by abundant endosperm
the most thoroughly typical members of the subclass are the lilies
and their relatives the one selected for special study here the
yellow addertongue is very common in the spring but if not
accessible almost any liliaceous plant will answer of garden
flowers the tulip hyacinth narcissus or one of the common lilies
may be used of wild flowers the various species of trillium
fig 83 a are common and easily studied forms but the leaves are
not of the type common to most monocotyledons
the yellow addertongue erythronium americanum fig 81 is one of
the commonest and widespread of wild flowers blossoming in the
northern states from about the middle of april till the middle of may
most of the plants found will not be in flower and these send up but
a single oblong pointed leaf the flowering plant has two similar
leaves one of which is usually larger than the other they seem to
come directly from the ground but closer examination shows that they
are attached to a stem of considerable length entirely buried in the
ground this arises from a small bulb b to whose base numerous
roots r are attached rising from between the leaves is a slender
leafless stalk bearing a single nodding flower at the top
the leaves are perfectly smooth dull purplish red on the lower side
and pale green with purplish blotches above the epidermis may be very
easily removed and is perfectly colorless examined closely
longitudinal rows of whitish spots may be detected these are the
breathing pores

a crosssection of the stem shows numerous whitish areas scattered
through it these are the fibrovascular bundles which in the
monocotyledons are of a simple type the bulb is composed of thick
scales which are modified leaves and on cutting it lengthwise we
shall probably find the young bulb of next year fig c b
already forming inside it the young bulb arising as a bud at the
base of the stem of the present year
the flower is made up of five circles of very much modified leaves
three leaves in each set the two outer circles are much alike but
the three outermost leaves are slightly narrower and strongly tinged
with red on the back completely concealing the three inner ones
before the flower expands the latter are pure yellow except for a
ridge along the back and a few red specks near the base inside these
six leaves constitute the perigone of the flower the three outer are
called sepals the inner ones petals
the next two circles are composed of the sporophylls bearing the
pollen spores12 these are the stamens and taken collectively are
known as the andrcium each leaf or stamen consists of two
distinct portions a delicate stalk or filament d f and the
upper sporebearing part the anther an the anther in the
freshly opened flower has a smooth red surface but shortly after
the flower opens splits along each side and discharges the pollen
spores a section across the anther shows it to be composed of four
sporangia or pollen sacs attached to a common central axis
connective fig h
12 the three outer stamens are shorter than the inner set
the central circle of leaves the carpels collectively the
gyncium are completely united to form a compound pistil fig 81
e this shows three distinct portions the ovulebearing portion
below o the ovary a stalk above st the style and the
receptive portion z at the top the stigma both stigma and
ovary show plainly their compound nature the former being divided
into three lobes the latter completely divided into three chambers
as well as being flattened at the sides with a more or less decided
seam at the three angles the ovules which are quite large are
arranged in two rows in each chamber of the ovary attached to the
central column placenta
the flowers open for several days in succession but only when the sun
is shining they are visited by numerous insects which carry the
pollen from one flower to another and deposit it upon the stigma
where it germinates and the tube growing down through the long
style finally reaches the ovules and fertilizes them usually only a
comparatively small number of the seeds mature there being almost
always a number of imperfect ones in each pod the pod or fruit f
is fullgrown about a month after the flower opens and finally
separates into three parts and discharges the seeds these are quite
large fig 81 j and covered with a yellowish brown outer coat
and provided with a peculiar whitish spongy appendage attaching it
to the placenta a longitudinal section of a ripe seed k shows the
very small nearly triangular embryo em while the rest of the
cavity of the seed is filled with a white starchbearing tissue the

  a microscopical examination of the tissues of the plant shows them
  to be comparatively simple this being especially the case with the
  fibrovascular system
  the epidermis of the leaf is readily removed and examination shows
  it to be made up of oblong cells with large breathing pores in
  rows the breathing pores are much larger than any we have yet
  seen and are of the type common to most angiosperms the ordinary
  epidermal cells are quite destitute of chlorophyll but the two
  cells guard cells enclosing the breathing pore contain numerous
  chloroplasts and the oblong nuclei of these cells are usually
  conspicuous fig 82 g by placing a piece of the leaf between
  pieces of pith and making a number of thin crosssections at right
  angles to the longer axis of the leaf some of the breathing pores
  will probably be cut across and their structure may be then better
  understood such a section is shown in figure 82 i
  the body of the leaf is made up of chlorophyllbearing cells of
  irregular shape and with large air spaces between h m the
  veins traversing this tissue are fibrovascular bundles of a type
  structure similar to that of the stem which will be described
  presently
  the stem is made up principally of large cells with thin walls
  which in crosssection show numerous small triangular
  intercellular spaces i at the angles these cells contain
  usually more or less starch the fibrovascular bundles c are
  nearly triangular in section and resemble considerably those of the
  field horsetail but they are not penetrated by the air channel
  found in the latter the xylem as in the pine is toward the
  outside of the stem but the boundary between xylem and phloem is
  not well defined there being no cambium present in the xylem are a
  number of vessels c tr at once distinguishable from the
  other cells by their definite form firm walls and empty cavity
  the vessels in longitudinal sections show spiral and ringed
  thickenings the rest of the xylem cells as well as those of the
  phloem are not noticeably different from the cells of the ground
  tissue except for their much smaller size and absence of
  intercellular spaces
  the structure of the leaves of the perigone is much like that of the
  green leaves but the tissues are somewhat reduced the epidermis of
  the outer side of the sepals has breathing pores but these are
  absent from their inner surface and from both sides of the petals
  the walls of the epidermal cells of the petals are peculiarly
  thickened by apparent infoldings of the wall b and these cells
  as well as those below them contain small yellow bodies
  chromoplasts to which the bright color of the flower is due the
  red specks on the base of the perigone leaves as well as the red
  color of the back of the sepals the stalk and leaves are due to a
  purplish red cell sap filling the cells at these points
  the filaments or stalks of the stamens are made up of very delicate
  colorless cells and the centre is traversed by a single
  fibrovascular bundle which is continued up through the centre of
  the anther to study the latter thin crosssections should be made
  and mounted in water each of the four sporangia or pollen sacs is
  surrounded on the outside by a wall consisting of two layers of
  cells becoming thicker in the middle of the section where the
  single fibrovascular bundle is seen fig 81 h on opening the
  cavities of the adjacent sporangia are thrown together the inner
  cells of the wall are marked by thickened bars much as we saw in
  the pine fig 82 a and which like these are formed shortly
  before the pollen sacs open the pollen spores fig 81 i are
  large oval cells having a double wall the outer one somewhat
  heavier than the inner one but sufficiently transparent to allow a
  clear view of the interior which is filled with very dense
  granular protoplasm in which may be dimly seen two nuclei n
  ni showing that here also there is a division of the spore
  contents although no wall is present the spores do not germinate
  very readily and are less favorable for this purpose than those of
  some other monocotyledons among the best for this purpose are the
  spiderwort tradescantia and scilla
  owing to the large size and consequent opacity of the ovules as
  well as to the difficulty of getting the early stages the
  development and finer structure of the ovule will not be discussed
  here the fullgrown ovule may be readily sectioned and a general
  idea of its structure obtained a little potash may be used to
  advantage in this study carefully washing it away when the section
  is sufficiently cleared we find now that the ovule is attached to a
  stalk funiculus fig 81 g f the body of the ovule being
  bent up so as to lie against the stalk such an inverted ovule is
  called technically anatropous the ovule is much enlarged where
  the stalk bends the upper part of the ovule is on the whole like
  that of the pine but there are two integuments i ii instead of
  the single one found in the pine
  as the seed develops the embryo sac g sp enlarges so as to
  occupy pretty much the whole space of the seed at first it is
  nearly filled with a fluid but a layer of cells is formed lining
  the walls and this thickens until the whole space except what is
  occupied by the small embryo is filled with them these are called
  the endosperm cells but differ from the endosperm cells of the
  gymnosperms in the fact that they are not developed until after
  fertilization and can hardly therefore be regarded as
  representing the prothallium of the gymnosperms and pteridophytes
  these cells finally form a firm tissue whose cells are filled with
  starch that forms a reserve supply of food for the embryo plant when
  the seed germinates the embryo fig 81 k em fig 82 j
  even when the seed is ripe remains very small and shows scarcely
  any differentiation it is a small pearshaped mass of cells the
  smaller end directed toward the upper end of the embryo sac
the integuments grow with the embryo sac and become brown and hard
forming the shell of the seed the stalk of the ovule also enlarges
and finally forms the peculiar spongy appendage of the seeds already
noticed fig 81 j k
chapter xvi
classification of the monocotyledons
in the following chapter no attempt will be made to give an exhaustive
account of the characteristics of each division of the monocotyledons
but only such of the most important ones as may serve to supplement
our study of the special one already examined the classification
here and this is the case throughout the spermaphytes is based
mainly upon the characters of the flowers and fruits
the classification adopted here is that of the german botanist
eichler and seems to the author to accord better with our present
knowledge of the relationships of the groups than do the systems that
are more general in this country according to eichlers
classification the monocotyledons may be divided into seven groups
viz i liliiflor ii enantioblast iii spadiciflor
iv glumace v scitamine vi gynandr vii helobi
order ililiiflor
the plants of this group agree in their general structure with the
adderstongue which is a thoroughly typical representative of the
group but nevertheless there is much variation among them in the
details of structure while most of them are herbaceous forms dying
down to the ground each year a few among which may be mentioned the
yuccas bear grass spanish bayonet of our southern states
develop a creeping or upright woody stem increasing in size from year
to year the herbaceous forms send up their stems yearly from
underground bulbs tubers eg trillium fig 83 a or
thickened creeping stems or root stocks rhizomes good examples of
the last are the solomonsseal fig 83 b medeola c d
and iris fig 84 a one family the yams dioscore of which
we have one common native species the wild yam dioscorea villosa
have broad nettedveined leaves and are twining plants while another
somewhat similar family smilace climb by means of tendrils at the
bases of the leaves of the latter the catbrier or greenbrier is
a familiar representative

the flowers are for the most part conspicuous and in plan like that
of the adderstongue but some like the rushes fig 83 e have
small inconspicuous flowers and others like the yams and smilaxes
have flowers of two kinds male and female

the principal family of the liliiflor is the liliace including
some of the most beautiful of all flowers all of the true lilies
lilium as well as the day lilies funkia hemerocallis of
the gardens tulips hyacinths lilyofthevalley etc belong here
as well as a number of showy wild flowers including several species of
tigerlilies lilium various species of trillium fig 83 a
solomonsseal polygonatum fig 83 b bellwort uvularia
and others in all of these except trillium the perigone leaves
are colored alike and the leaves parallelveined but in the latter
the sepals are green and the leaves broad and nettedveined the fruit
of the liliace may be either a pod like that of the
adderstongue or a berry like that of asparagus or solomonsseal
differing from the true lilies in having the bases of the perigone
leaves adherent to the surface of the ovary so that the latter is
apparently below the flower inferior and lacking the inner circle
of stamens is the iris family iridace represented by the wild
blueflag iris versicolor fig 84 a e as well as by
numerous cultivated species in iris the carpels are free above and
colored like the petals b with the stigma on the under side of
garden flowers the gladiolus and crocus are the most familiar
examples besides the various species of iris and of wild flowers the
little blueeyed grass sisyrinchium

the blue pickerelweed pontederia is the type of a family of which
there are few common representatives fig 84 i k
the last family of the order is the bromeliace all inhabitants of
the warmer parts of the globe but represented in the southern states
by several forms the commonest of which is the socalled gray moss
tillandsia fig 84 f h of cultivated plants the pineapple
whose fruit consists of a fleshy mass made up of the crowded fruits
and the fleshy flower stalks is the best known
order iienantioblast
the second order of the monocotyledons enantioblast includes very
few common plants the most familiar examples are the various species
of tradescantia fig 88 some of which are native others exotic
of the cultivated forms the commonest is one sometimes called
wanderingjew a trailing plant with zigzag stems and oval pointed
leaves forming a sheath about each joint another common one is the
spiderwort already referred to in this the leaves are long and
pointed but also sheathing at the base when the flowers are showy
as in these the sepals and petals are different the former being
green the flowers usually open but once and the petals shrivel up as
the flower fades there are four families of the order the spiderwort
belonging to the highest one commelyne
order iiispadiciflor
the third order of the monocotyledons spadiciflor is a very large
one and includes the largest and the smallest plants of the whole
subclass in all of them the flowers are small and often very
inconspicuous usually though not always the male and female flowers
are separate and often on different plants the smallest members of
the group are little aquatics scarcely visible to the naked eye and
of extremely simple structure but nevertheless these little plants
produce true flowers in marked contrast to these are the palms some
of which reach a height of thirty metres or more
the flowers in most of the order are small and inconspicuous but
aggregated on a spike spadix which may be of very large size good
types of the order are the various aroids aroide of which the
calla richardia is a very familiar cultivated example of wild
forms the sweetflag acorus jackinthepulpit arisma
fig 86 a d skunkcabbage symplocarpus and wild calla
may be noted in arisma fig 86 a the flowers are borne only
on the base of the spadix and the plant is dicious the flowers are
of the simplest structure the female consisting of a single carpel
and the male of four stamens c d while the individual flowers
are destitute of a perigone the whole inflorescence cluster of
flowers is surrounded by a large leaf spathe which sometimes is
brilliantly colored this serving to attract insects the leaves of
the aroids are generally large and sometimes compound the only
instance of true compound leaves among the monocotyledons fig 86

probably to be regarded as reduced aroids are the duckweeds
lemnace fig 86 f h minute floating plants without any
differentiation of the plant body into stem and leaves they are
globular or discoid masses of cells most of them having roots but
one genus wolffia has no roots nor any trace of fibrovascular
bundles the flowers are reduced to a single stamen or carpel figs
e g h
the cattail typha and burreed sparganium fig 86 i l
are common representatives of the family typhace and the
pondweeds naias and potomogeton are common examples of the
family naiade these are aquatic plants completely submerged
naias or sometimes partially floating potomogeton the latter
genus includes a number of species with leaves varying from linear
very narrow and pointed to broadly oval and are everywhere common
in slow streams
the largest members of the group are the screwpines pandane and
the palms palm these are represented in the united states by
only a few species of the latter family confined to the southern and
southwestern portions the palmettoes sabal and chamrops are
the best known
both the palms and screwpines are often cultivated for ornament and
as is well known in the warmer parts of the world the palms are among
the most valuable of all plants the date palm phnix dactylifera
and the cocoanut cocos nucifera are the best known the apparently
compound pinnate or feathershaped leaves of many palms are not
strictly compound that is they do not arise from the branching of an
originally single leaf but are really broad undivided leaves which
are closely folded like a fan in the bud and tear apart along the
folds as the leaf opens
although these plants reach such a great size an examination of the
stem shows that it is built on much the same plan as that of the other
monocotyledons that is the stem is composed of a mass of soft
ground tissue through which run many small isolated fibrovascular
bundles a good idea of this structure may be had by cutting across a
cornstalk which is built on precisely the same pattern
order ivglumace
the plants of this order resemble each other closely in their habit
all having long narrow leaves with sheathing bases that surround the
slender distinctly jointed stem which frequently has a hard polished
surface the flowers are inconspicuous borne usually in close spikes
and destitute of a perigone or having this reduced to small scales or
hairs the flowers are usually surrounded by more or less dry leaves
glumes pale which are closely set so as to nearly conceal the
flowers the flowers are either hermaphrodite or unisexual

there are two wellmarked families the sedges cyperace and the
grasses gramine the former have solid often triangular stems
and the sheath at the base of the leaves is not split the commonest
genera are carex fig 87 a g and cyperus of which there
are many common species differing very little and hard to
distinguish there are several common species of carex which blossom
early in the spring the male flowers being quite conspicuous on
account of the large yellow anthers the female flowers are in
similar spikes lower down where the pollen readily falls upon them
and is caught by the long stigmas in some other genera eg the
bulrushes scirpus fig 87 h the flowers are hermaphrodite
ie contain both stamens and pistils the fruit fig 87 f is
seedlike but really includes the wall of the ovary as well which is
grown closely to the enclosed seed the embryo is small surrounded by
abundant endosperm fig 87 g very few of the sedges are of any
economic importance though one the papyrus of egypt was formerly
much valued for its pith which was manufactured into paper
the second family the grasses on the contrary includes the most
important of all food plants all of the grains belonging here they
differ mainly from the sedges in having generally hollow
cylindrical stems and the sheath of the leaves split down one side
the leaves are in two rows while those of the sedges are in three
the flowers fig 87 l are usually perfect the stigmas two in
number and like plumes so that they readily catch the pollen which is
blown upon them a few like the indian corn have the flowers
unisexual the male flowers are at the top of the stem forming the
tassel and the female flowers lower down forming the ear the
silk is composed of the enormously lengthened stigmas the fruits
resemble those of the sedges but the embryo is usually larger and
placed at one side of the endosperm n em
while most of the grasses are comparatively small plants a few of
them are almost treelike in their proportions the species of bamboo
bambusa sometimes reaching a height of twenty to thirty metres
with stems thirty to forty centimetres in diameter

the plants of this order are all inhabitants of the warmer parts of
the earth and only a very few occur within the limits of the united
states and these confined to the extreme south they are extremely
showy plants owing to their large leaves and brilliant flowers and
for this reason are cultivated extensively various species of canna
fig 88 are common in gardens where they are prized for their
large richlycolored leaves and clusters of scarlet orange or
yellow flowers the leafy stems arise from thick tubers or root
stocks and grow rapidly to a height of two metres or more in the
larger species the leaves as in all the order are very large and
have a thick midrib with lateral veins running to the margin the
young leaves are folded up like a trumpet the flowers are irregular
in form and in canna only a single stamen is found or if more are
present they are reduced to petallike rudiments the single perfect
stamen fig 88 c an has the filament broad and colored like
the petals and the anther attached to one side the pistil gy is
also petallike there are three circles of leaves forming the
perigone the two outer being more or less membranaceous and only the
three inner petallike in texture the ovary o is inferior and
covered on the outside with little papill that afterward form short
spines on the outside of the fruit f
the seeds are large but the embryo is very small a section of a
nearly ripe seed shows the embryo em occupying the upper part of
the embryo sac which does not nearly fill the seed and contains no
endosperm the bulk of the seed is derived from the tissue of the body
of the ovule which in most seeds becomes entirely obliterated by the
growth of the embryo sac the cells of this tissue become filled with
starch and serve the same purpose as the endosperm of other seeds
this tissue is called perisperm
of food plants belonging to this order the banana musa is much
the most important others of more or less value are species of
arrowroot maranta and ginger zingiber
there are three families i musace banana family
ii zingiberace ginger family and iii cannace canna
maranta
order vigynandr
by far the greater number of the plants of this order belong to the
orchis family orchide the second family of the order
apostasie being a small one and unrepresented in the united
states the orchids are in some respects the most highly specialized
of all flowers and exhibit wonderful variety in the shape and color
of the flowers which are often of extraordinary beauty and show
special contrivances for crossfertilization that are without parallel
among flowering plants

diagram of the flower the position of the missing stamens indicated

the flowers are always more or less bilaterally symmetrical
zygomorphic the ovary is inferior and usually twisted so as to
turn the flower completely around there are two sets of perigone
leaves three in each and these are usually much alike except the
lower through the twisting of the ovary of the inner set this
petal known as the lip or labellum is usually larger than the
others and different in color as well as being frequently of
peculiar shape in many of them it is also prolonged backward in a
hollow spur see fig 89 b in all of the orchids except the
ladysslippers cypripedium fig 90 b only one perfect
stamen is developed and this is united with the three styles to form
a special structure known as the column or gynostemium fig 89
b c the pollen spores are usually aggregated into two or four
waxy masses pollinia sing pollinium which usually can only be
removed by the agency of insects upon which all but a very few orchids
are absolutely dependent for the pollination of the flowers

in the ladyslippers there are two fertile stamens and a third
sterile one has the form of a large triangular shield terminating the
column fig 90 c st
the ovules of the orchids are extremely small and are only partly
developed at the time the flower opens the pollen tube growing very
slowly and the ovules maturing as it grows down through the tissues of
the column the ripe seeds are excessively numerous but so fine as to
look like dust
the orchids are mostly small or moderatesized plants few of them
being more than a metre or so in height all of our native species
with the exception of a few from the extreme south grow from fibrous
roots or tubers but many tropical orchids as is well known are
epiphytes that is they grow upon the trunks and branches of trees
one genus vanilla is a twining epiphyte the fruit of this plant
furnishes the vanilla of commerce aside from this plant the
economical value of the orchids is small although a few of them are
used medicinally but are not specially valuable
of the five thousand species known the great majority are inhabitants
of the tropics but nevertheless there are within the united states a
number of very beautiful forms the largest and showiest are the
ladysslippers of which we have six species at the north the most
beautiful is the showy ladysslipper cypripedium spectabile
whose large pink and white flowers rival in beauty many of the
choicest tropical orchids many of the habenarias including the
yellow and purple fringed orchids are strikingly beautiful as are the
arethuse arethusa pogonia calopogon the last of these
fig 90 h differs from all our other native orchids in having the
ovary untwisted so that the labellum lies on the upper side of the
flower
a number of the orchids are saprophytic growing in soil rich in
decaying vegetable matter and these forms are often nearly or quite
destitute of chlorophyll being brownish or yellowish in color and
with rudimentary leaves the coral roots corallorhiza of which
there are several species are examples of these and another closely
related form the puttyroot aplectrum fig 90 a has the
flowering stems like those of corallorhiza but there is a single
large plaited leaf sent up later
order viihelobi
the last order of the monocotyledons is composed of marsh or water
plants some of which recall certain of the dicotyledons of the three
families the first juncagine includes a few inconspicuous plants
with grasslike or rushlike leaves and small greenish or yellowish
flowers eg arrowgrass triglochin
the second family alismace contains several large and showy
species inhabitants of marshes of these the waterplantain
alisma a plant with longstalked oval ribbed leaves and a
muchbranched panicle of small white flowers is very common in
marshes and ditches and the various species of arrowhead
sagittaria are among the most characteristic of our marsh plants
the flowers are unisexual the female flowers are usually borne at the
base of the inflorescence and the male flowers above the gyncium
fig 91 b consists of numerous separate carpels attached to a
globular receptacle the sepals are green and much smaller than the
white petals the leaves f are broad and besides the thickened
parallel veins have numerous smaller ones connecting these

or a few of them with longstalked floating leaves two forms the
ditchmoss elodea fig 91 g i and eelgrass
vallisneria are very common in stagnant or slowrunning water in
both of these the plants are completely submersed but there is a
special arrangement for bringing the flowers to the surface of the
water like the arrowhead the flowers are unisexual but borne on
different plants the female flowers h l are comparatively
large especially in vallisneria and are borne on long stalks by
means of which they reach the surface of the water where they expand
and are ready for pollination the male flowers fig 91 j k
are extremely small and borne many together surrounded by a
membranous envelope the whole inflorescence attached by a short
stalk when the flowers are ready to open they break away from their
attachment and the envelope opens allowing them to escape and they
immediately rise to the surface where they expand and collect in great
numbers about the open female flowers sometimes these are so abundant
during the flowering period late in summer that the surface of the
water looks as if flour had been scattered over it after pollination
is effected the stem of the female flower coils up like a spring
drawing the flower beneath the water where the fruit ripens
the cells of these plants show very beautifully the circulation of the
protoplasm the movement being very marked and continuing for a long
time under the microscope to see this the whole leaf of elodea or
a section of that of vallisneria may be used
chapter xvii
dicotyledons
the second subclass of the angiosperms the dicotyledons receive
their name from the two opposite seed leaves or cotyledons with which
the young plant is furnished these leaves are usually quite different
in shape from the other leaves and not infrequently are very thick
and fleshy filling nearly the whole seed as may be seen in a bean or
pea the number of the dicotyledons is very large and very much the
greater number of living spermaphytes belong to this group they
exhibit much greater variety in the structure of the flowers than the
monocotyledons and the leaves which in the latter are with few
exceptions quite uniform in structure show here almost infinite
variety thus the leaves may be simple undivided eg oak apple
or compound as in clover locust rose columbine etc the leaves
may be stalked or sessile attached directly to the stem or even
grown around the stem as in some honeysuckles the edges of the
leaves may be perfectly smooth entire or they may be variously
lobed notched or wavy in many ways as many of the dicotyledons are
trees or shrubs that lose their leaves annually special leaves are
developed for the protection of the young leaves during the winter
these have the form of thick scales and often are provided with
glands secreting a gummy substance which helps render them
waterproof these scales are best studied in trees with large winter
buds such as the horsechestnut fig 92 hickory lilac etc on
removing the hard scale leaves the delicate young leaves and often
the flowers may be found within the bud if we examine a young shoot
of lilac or buckeye just as the leaves are expanding in the spring a
complete series of forms may be seen from the simple external scales
through immediate forms to the complete foliage leaf the veins of
the leaves are almost always muchbranched the veins either being
given off from one main vein or midrib featherveined or
pinnateveined as in an apple leaf or there may be a number of
large veins radiating from the base of the leaf as in the scarlet
geranium or mallow such leaves are said to be palmately veined
illustration fig 92end of a branch of a horsechestnut in winter
showing the buds covered by the thick brown scale leaves  1
some of them are small herbaceous plants either upright or prostrate
upon the ground over which they may creep extensively becoming
rooted at intervals as in the white clover or sending out special
runners as is seen in the strawberry others are woody stemmed
plants persisting from year to year and often becoming great trees
that live for hundreds of years still others are climbing plants
either twining their stems about the support like the morningglory
hop honeysuckle and many others or having special organs tendrils
by which they fasten themselves to the support these tendrils
originate in different ways sometimes as in the grape and virginia
creeper they are reduced branches either coiling about the support
or producing little suckers at their tips by which they cling to walls
or the trunks of trees other tendrils as in the poison ivy and the
true ivy are short roots that fasten themselves firmly in the
crevices of bark or stones still other tendrils as those of the
sweetpea and clematis are parts of the leaf
the stems may be modified into thorns for protection as we see in
many trees and shrubs and parts of leaves may be similarly changed
as in the thistle the underground stems often become much changed
forming bulbs tubers root stocks etc much as in the
monocotyledons these structures are especially found in plants which
die down to the ground each year and contain supplies of nourishment
for the rapid growth of the annual shoots

the structure of the tissues and the peculiarities of the flower and
fruit will be better understood by a somewhat careful examination of
a typical dicotyledon and a comparison with this of examples of the
principal orders and families
one of the commonest of weeds and at the same time one of the most
convenient plants for studying the characteristics of the
dicotyledons is the common shepherdspurse capsella
bursapastoris figs 9395
the plant grows abundantly in waste places and is in flower nearly
the year round sometimes being found in flower in midwinter after a
week or two of warm weather it is however in best condition for
study in the spring and early summer the plant may at once be
recognized by the heartshaped pods and small white fourpetaled
flowers the plant begins to flower when very small but continues to
grow until it forms a muchbranching plant half a metre or more in
height on pulling up the plant a large taproot fig 93 a r
is seen continuous with the main stem above ground the first root of
the seedling plant continues here as the main root of the plant as
was the case with the gymnosperms but not with the monocotyledons
from this taproot other small ones branch off and these divide
repeatedly forming a complex root system the main root is very tough
and hard owing to the formation of woody tissue in it a
crosssection slightly magnified fig 93 m shows a round
opaque white central area x the wood surrounded by a more
transparent irregular ring ph the phloem or bast and outside
of this is the ground tissue and epidermis
the lower leaves are crowded into a rosette and are larger than those
higher up from which they differ also in having a stalk petiole
while the upper leaves are sessile the outline of the leaves varies
much in different plants and in different parts of the same plant
being sometimes almost entire sometimes divided into lobes almost to
the midrib and between these extremes all gradations are found the
larger leaves are traversed by a strong midrib projecting strongly on
the lower side of the leaf and from this the smaller veins branch
the upper leaves have frequently two smaller veins starting from the
base of the leaf and nearly parallel with the midrib c i the
surface of the leaves is somewhat roughened with hairs some of which
if slightly magnified look like little white stars
magnifying slightly a thin crosssection of the stem it shows a
central ground tissue pith whose cells are large enough to be seen
even when very slightly enlarged surrounding this is a ring of
fibrovascular bundles l fb appearing white and opaque and
connected by a more transparent tissue outside of the ring of
fibrovascular bundles is the green ground tissue and epidermis
comparing this with the section of the seedling pine stem a
resemblance is at once evident and this arrangement was also noticed
in the stem of the horsetail
branches are given off from the main stem arising at the point where
the leaves join the stem axils of the leaves and these may in turn
branch all the branches terminate finally in an elongated
inflorescence and the separate flowers are attached to the main axis
of the inflorescence by short stalks this form of inflorescence is
known technically as a raceme each flower is really a short branch
from which the floral leaves arise in precisely the same way as the
foliage leaves do from the ordinary branches there are five sets of
floral leaves i four outer perigone leaves sepals f small
green pointed leaves traversed by three simple veins and together
forming the calyx ii four larger white inner perigone leaves
petals g broad and slightly notched at the end and tapering to
the point of attachment the petals collectively are known as the
corolla the veins of the petals fork once iii and iv two sets of
stamens e the outer containing two short and the inner four
longer ones arranged in pairs each stamen has a slender filament
h f and a twolobed anther an the innermost set consists
of two carpels united into a compound pistil the ovary is oblong
slightly flattened so as to be oval in section and divided into two
chambers the style is very short and tipped by a round flattened
stigma
the raceme continues to grow for a long time forming new flowers at
the end so that all stages of flowers and fruit may often be found in
the same inflorescence
the flowers are probably quite independent of insect aid in
pollination as the stamens are so placed as to almost infallibly shed
their pollen upon the stigma this fact probably accounts for the
inconspicuous character of the flowers
after fertilization is effected and the outer floral leaves fall off
the ovary rapidly enlarges and becomes heartshaped and much
flattened at right angles to the partition when ripe each half falls
away leaving the seeds attached by delicate stalks funiculi sing
funiculus to the edges of the membranous partition the seeds are
small oval bodies with a shining yellowbrown shell and with a
little dent at the end where the stalk is attached carefully dividing
the seed lengthwise or crushing it in water so as to remove the
embryo we find it occupies the whole cavity of the seed the young
stalk st being bent down against the back of one of the
cotyledons f

  large loose cells which in the older roots are often ruptured and
  partly dried up the epidermis is usually indistinguishable in the
  older roots to understand the early structure of the roots the
  smallest rootlets obtainable should be selected the smallest are so
  transparent that the tips may be mounted whole in water and will
  show very satisfactorily the arrangement of the young tissues the
  tissues do not here arise from a single apical cell as we found in
  the pteridophytes but from a group of cells the shaded cells in
  fig 94 b the end of the root as in the fern is covered with
  a root cap r composed of successive layers of cells cut off from
  the growing point the rest of the root shows the same division of
  the tissues into the primary epidermis dermatogen d young
  fibrovascular cylinder plerome pl and young ground tissue
  periblem pb the structure of the older portions of such
  a root is not very easy to study owing to difficulty in making
  good crosssections of so small an object by using a very
  sharp razor and holding perfectly straight between pieces of pith
  however satisfactory sections can be made the cells contain so
  much starch as to make them almost opaque and potash should be used
  to clear them the fibrovascular bundle is of the radial type
  there being two masses of xylem xy joined in the middle and
  separating the two phloem masses ph some of whose cells are
  rather thicker walled than the others the bundle sheath is not so
  plain here as in the fern the ground tissue is composed of
  comparatively large cells with thickish soft walls that contain
  much starch the epidermis usually dies while the root is still
  young in the larger roots the early formation of the cambium ring
  and the irregular arrangement of the tissues derived from its
  growth soon obliterate all traces of the primitive arrangement of
  the tissues making a thin crosssection of the stem and magnifying
  strongly we find bounding the section a single row of epidermal
  cells fig 94 a ep whose walls especially the outer ones
  are strongly thickened within these are several rows of thinwalled
  groundtissue cells containing numerous small round chloroplasts
  the innermost row of these cells sh are larger and have but
  little chlorophyll this row of cells forms a sheath around the ring
  of fibrovascular bundles very much as is the case in the
  horsetail the separate bundles are nearly triangular in outline
  the point turned inward and are connected with each other by masses
  of fibrous tissue f whose thickened walls have a peculiar
  silvery lustre just inside of the bundle sheath there is a row of
  similar fibres marking the outer limit of the phloem ph the
  rest of the phloem is composed of very small cells the xylem is
  composed of fibrous cells with yellowish walls and numerous large
  vessels tr the central ground tissue pith has large
  thinwalled cells with numerous intercellular spaces as in the stem
  of erythronium some of these cells contain a few scattered
  chloroplasts in the very thin protoplasmic layer lining their
  walls but the cells are almost completely filled with colorless
  cell sap
  a longitudinal section shows that the epidermal cells are much
  elongated the cells of the ground tissue less so and in both the
  partition walls are straight in the fibrous cells both of the
  fibrovascular bundle and those lying between the end walls are
  strongly oblique the tracheary tissue of the xylem is made up of
  small spirallymarked vessels and larger ones with thickened
  rings or with pits in the walls the small spirallymarked vessels
  are nearest the centre and are the first to be formed in the young
  bundle
  the epidermis of the leaves is composed of irregular cells with wavy
  outlines like those of the ferns breathing pores of the same type
  as those in the ferns and monocotyledons are found on both
  surfaces but more abundant and more perfectly developed on the
  lower surface of the leaf owing to their small size they are not
  specially favorable for study the epidermis is sparingly covered
  with unicellular hairs some of which are curiously branched being
  irregularly starshaped the walls of these cells are very thick
  and have little protuberances upon the outer surface fig 93 e
  crosssections of the leaf may be made between pith as already
  directed or by folding the leaf carefully several times the whole
  can be easily sectioned the structure is essentially as in the
  addertongue but the epidermal cells appear more irregular and the
  fibrovascular bundles are better developed they are like those of
  the stem but somewhat simpler the xylem lies on the upper side
  the ground tissue is composed as in the leaves we have studied of
  chlorophyllbearing loose cells rather more compact upon the upper
  side in the majority of dicotyledons the upper surface of the
  leaves is nearly or quite destitute of breathing pores and the
  cells of the ground tissue below the upper epidermis are closely
  packed forming what is called the palisadeparenchyma of the
  leaf

  the shepherdspurse is an admirable plant for the study of the
  development of the flower which is much the same in other
  angiosperms to study this it is only necessary to teaze out in a
  drop of water the tip of a raceme and putting on a cover glass
  examine with a power of from fifty to a hundred diameters in the
  older stages it is best to treat with potash which will render the
  young flowers quite transparent the young flower fig 95 a is
  at first a little protuberance composed of perfectly similar small
  cells filled with dense protoplasm the first of the floral leaves
  to appear are the sepals which very early arise as four little buds
  surrounding the young flower axis fig 95 a b the stamens
  c an next appear being at first entirely similar to the
  young sepals the petals do not appear until the other parts of the
  flower have reached some size and the first tracheary tissue
  appears in the fibrovascular bundle of the flower stalk d the
  carpels are more or less united from the first and form at first a
  sort of shallow cup with the edges turned in d gy this cup
  rapidly elongates and the cavity enlarges becoming completely
  closed at the top where the short style and stigma develop the
  ovules arise in two lines on the inner face of each carpel and the
  tissue which bears them placenta grows out into the cavity of the
  ovary until the two placent meet in the middle and form a partition
  completely across the ovary fig 95 h
  the stamens soon show the differentiation into filament and anther
  but the former remains very short until immediately before the
  flowers are ready to open the anther develops four sporangia
  pollen sacs the process being very similar to that in such
  pteridophytes as the club mosses each sporangium fig e f
  contains a central mass of spore mother cells and a wall of three
  layers of cells the spore mother cells finally separate and the
  inner layer of the wall cells becomes absorbed much as we saw in
  the fern and the mass of mother cells thus floats free in the
  cavity of the sporangium each one now divides in precisely the same
  way as in the ferns and gymnosperms into four pollen spores the
  anther opens as described for erythronium
  by carefully picking to pieces the young ovaries ovules in all
  stages of development may be found and on account of their small
  size and transparency show beautifully their structure being
  perfectly transparent it is only necessary to mount them in water
  and cover
  the young ovule i j consists of a central elongated body
  nucellus having a single layer of cells enclosing a large central
  cell the macrospore or embryo sac sp the base of the
  nucellus is surrounded by two circular ridges i ii of which the
  inner is at first higher than the outer one but later k l
  the latter grows up above it and completely conceals it as well as
  the nucellus one side of the ovule grows much faster than the
  other so that it is completely bent upon itself and the opening
  between the integuments is brought close to the base of the ovule
  fig 95 l this opening is called the micropyle and allows
  the pollen tube to enter
  the fullgrown embryo sac shows the same structure as that already
  described in monotropa page 276 but as the walls of the
  fullgrown ovule are thicker here its structure is rather difficult
  to make out the ripe stigma is covered with little papill
  fig 95 f that hold the pollen spores which may be found here
  sending out the pollen tube by carefully opening the ovary and
  slightly crushing it in a drop of water the pollen tube may
  sometimes be seen growing along the stalk of the ovule until it
  reaches and enters the micropyle
  to study the embryo a series of young fruits should be selected and
  the ovules carefully dissected out and mounted in water to which a
  little caustic potash has been added the ovule will be thus
  rendered transparent and by pressing gently on the cover glass with
  a needle so as to flatten the ovule slightly there is usually no
  trouble in seeing the embryo lying in the upper part of the embryo
  sac and by pressing more firmly it can often be forced out upon the
  slide the potash should now be removed as completely as possible
  with blotting paper and pure water run under the cover glass
  the fertilized egg cell first secretes a membrane and then divides
  into a row of cells n of which the one nearest the micropyle is
  often much enlarged the cell at the other end next enlarges and
  becomes divided by walls at right angles to each other into eight
  cells this globular mass of cells together with the cell next to
  it is the embryo plant the row of cells to which it is attached
  taking no further part in the process and being known as the
  suspensor later the embryo becomes indented above and forms two
  lobes q which are the beginnings of the cotyledons the first
  root and the stem arise from the cells next the suspensor
chapter xviii
classification of dicotyledons
division ichoripetal
nearly all of the dicotyledons may be placed in one of two great
divisions distinguished by the character of the petals in the first
group called choripetal the petals are separate or in some
degenerate forms entirely absent as familiar examples of this group
we may select the buttercup rose pink and many others
the second group sympetal or gamopetal comprises those
dicotyledons whose flowers have the petals more or less completely
united into a tube the honeysuckles mints huckleberry lilac etc
are familiar representatives of the sympetal which includes the
highest of all plants

appendage  2
the choripetal may be divided into six groups including twentytwo
orders the first group is called iuliflor and contains numerous
familiar plants mostly trees in these plants the flowers are small
and inconspicuous and usually crowded into dense catkins as in
willows fig 96 and poplars or in spikes or heads as in the
lizardtail fig 97 g or hop fig 97 i the individual
flowers are very small and simple in structure being often reduced to
the gyncium or andrcium carpels and stamens being almost always in
separate flowers the outer leaves of the flower sepals and petals
are either entirely wanting or much reduced and never differentiated
into calyx and corolla

in the willows fig 96 the stamens are brightcolored so that the
flowers are quite showy and attract numerous insects which visit them
for pollen and nectar and serve to carry the pollen to the pistillate
flowers thus insuring their fertilization in the majority of the
group however the flowers are windfertilized an excellent example
of this is seen in the common hazel fig 97 a the male flowers
are produced in great numbers in drooping catkins at the ends of the
branches shedding the pollen in early spring before the leaves
unfold the female flowers are produced on the same branches but
lower down and in much smaller numbers the stigmas are long and
covered with minute hairs that catch the pollen which is shaken out
in clouds every time the plant is shaken by the wind and falls in a
shower over the stigmas a similar arrangement is seen in the oaks
hickories and walnuts
there are three orders of the iuliflor amentace piperine
and urticin the first contains the birches betulace oaks
beeches hazels etc cupulifer walnuts and hickories
juglande willows and poplars salicace they are all trees
or shrubs the fruit is often a nut and the embryo is very large
completely filling it
the piperine are mostly tropical plants and include the pepper
plant piper as well as other plants with similar properties of
our native forms the only common one is the lizardtail saururus
not uncommon in swampy ground in these plants the calyx and corolla
are entirely absent but the flowers have both carpels and stamens
fig 97 h
the urticin include among our common plants the nettle family
urticace plane family platane represented by the sycamore
or buttonwood platanus the hemp family cannabine and the
elm family ulmace the flowers usually have a calyx and may
have only stamens or carpels or both sometimes the part of the stem
bearing the flowers may become enlarged and juicy forming a
fruitlike structure wellknown examples of this are the fig and
mulberry
the second group of the choripetal is called centrosperm and
includes but a single order comprising seven families all of which
except one nyctagine are represented by numerous native species
the latter comprises mostly tropical plants and is represented in our
gardens by the showy fouroclock mirabilis in this plant as
in most of the order the corolla is absent but here the calyx is
large and brightly colored resembling closely the corolla of a
morningglory or petunia the stamens are usually more numerous than
the sepals and the pistil though composed of several carpels has
as a rule but a single cavity with the ovules arising from the base
though sometimes the ovary is several celled

the first family polygone is represented by the various species
of polygonum knotgrass smartweed etc and among cultivated
plants by the buckwheat fagopyrum the goosefoot or pigweed
chenopodium among native plants and the beet and spinach of the
gardens are examples of the family chenopodiace nearly resembling
the last is the amaranth family amarantace of which the showy
amaranths and coxcombs of the gardens and the coarse green amaranth
or pigweed are representatives
the pokeweed phytolacca fig 98 k so conspicuous in autumn
on account of its darkpurple clusters of berries and crimson stalks
is our only representative of the family phytolaccace the two
highest families are the purslane family portulacace and pink
family caryophylle these are mostly plants with showy flowers in
which the petals are large and conspicuous though some of the pink
family eg some chickweeds have no petals of the purslane
family the portulacas of the gardens and the common purslane or
pusley and the springbeauty claytonia fig 98 a are the
commonest examples the pink family is represented by many common and
often showy plants the carnation japanese pinks and sweetwilliam
all belonging to the genus dianthus of which there are also two or
three native species are among the showiest of the family the genera
lychnis and silene fig 98 l also contain very showy species
of the less conspicuous genera the chickweeds cerastium and
stellaria are the most familiar
the third group of the choripetal the aphanocycl is a very
large one and includes many common plants distributed among five
orders the lower ones have all the parts of the flower entirely
separate and often indefinite in number the higher have the gyncium
composed of two or more carpels united to form a compound pistil
the first order polycarp includes ten families of which the
buttercup family ranunculace is the most familiar the plants of
this family show much variation in the details of the flowers which
are usually showy but the general plan is much the same in some of
them like the anemones fig 99 a clematis and others the
corolla is absent but the sepals are large and brightly colored so as
to appear like petals in the columbine aquilegia fig 99 f
the petals are tubular forming nectaries and in the larkspur
fig 99 t one of the sepals is similarly changed
representing the custardapple family anonace is the curious
papaw asimina common in many parts of the united states
fig 100 a the family is mainly a tropical one but this species
extends as far north as southern michigan

the magnolia family magnoliace has several common members the
most widely distributed being perhaps the tuliptree liriodendron
fig 100 c much valued for its timber besides this there are
several species of magnolia the most northerly species being the
sweetbay magnolia glauca of the atlantic states and the
cucumbertree m acuminata the great magnolia m grandiflora
is not hardy in the northern states
the sweetscented shrub calycanthus fig 100 g is the only
member of the family calycanthace found within our limits it grows
wild in the southern states and is cultivated for its sweetscented
dull reddish flowers

the barberry berberis fig 101 a is the type of the family
berberide which also includes the curious mandrake or mayapple
podophyllum fig 101 d and the twinleaf or rheumatismroot
jeffersonia whose curious seed vessel is shown in figure 101
g the fruit of the barberry and mayapple are edible but the root
of the latter is poisonous
the curious woody twiner moonseed menispermum fig 101 i
is the sole example in the northern states of the family menisperme
to which it belongs the flowers are dicious and the pistillate
flowers are succeeded by black fruits looking like grapes the
flattened bony seed is curiously sculptured and has the embryo
curled up within it

the last two families of the order the laurel family laurine and
the nutmeg family myristicine are mostly tropical plants
characterized by the fragrance of the bark leaves and fruit the
former is represented by the sassafras and spicebush common
throughout the eastern united states the latter has no members within
our borders but is familiar to all through the common nutmeg which
is the seed of myristica fragrans of the east indies mace is the
aril or covering of the seed of the same plant
the second order of the aphanocycl comprises a number of aquatic
plants mostly of large size and is known as the hydropeltidin
the flowers and leaves are usually very large the latter usually
nearly round in outline and frequently with the stalk inserted near
the middle the leaves of the perigone are numerous and sometimes
merge gradually into the stamens as we find in the common white
waterlily castalia

there are three families all represented within the united states
the first nelumbie has but a single species the yellow lotus or
nelumbo nelumbo lutea common in the waters of the west and
southwest but rare eastward fig 101 f in this flower the end
of the flower axis is much enlarged looking like the rose of a
wateringpot and has the large separate carpels embedded in its
upper surface when ripe each forms a nutlike fruit which is edible
there are but two species of nelumbo known the second one
n speciosa being a native of southeastern asia and probably
found in ancient times in egypt as it is represented frequently in
the pictures and carvings of the ancient egyptians it differs mainly
from our species in the color of its flowers which are red instead of
yellow it has recently been introduced into new jersey where it has
become well established in several localities
the second family cabombe is also represented at the north by but
one species the water shield brasenia not uncommon in marshes
its flowers are quite small of a dullpurple color and the leaves
oval in outline and centrally peltate ie the leaf stalk inserted
in the centre the whole plant is covered with a transparent
gelatinous coat
the third family nymphace includes the common white waterlilies
castalia and the yellow waterlilies nympha fig 102 a
in the latter the petals are small and inconspicuous fig 102 c
p but the sepals are large and showy in this family the carpels
instead of being separate are united into a large compound pistil
the waterlilies reach their greatest perfection in the tropics where
they attain an enormous size the white blue or red flowers of some
species being thirty centimetres or more in diameter and the leaves
of the great victoria regia of the amazon reaching two metres or
more in width
the third order of the aphanocycl rhadin or cruciflor
comprises a number of common plants principally characterized by
having the parts of the flowers in twos or fours so that they are
more or less distinctly crossshaped whence the name cruciflor
there are four families of which the first is the poppy family
papaverace including the poppies eschscholtzias mexican or
prickly poppy argemone etc of the gardens and the bloodroot
sanguinaria celandine poppy stylophorum and a few other wild
plants see fig 103 ai most of the family have a colored juice
latex which is white in the poppy yellow in celandine and
argemone and orangered in the bloodroot from the latex of the
opium poppy the opium of commerce is extracted

the second family the fumitories fumariace are delicate smooth
plants with curious flowers and compound leaves the garden
bleedingheart dicentra spectabilis and the pretty wild
dicentras fig 103 f are familiar to nearly every one
other examples are the mountain fringe adlumia a climbing
species and several species of corydalis differing mainly from
dicentra in having the corolla onesided
the mustard family crucifer comprises by far the greater part of
the order the shepherdspurse already studied belongs here and
may be taken as a type of the family there is great uniformity in all
as regards the flowers so that the classification is based mainly on
differences in the fruit and seeds many of the most valuable garden
vegetables as well as a few more or less valuable wild plants are
members of the family which however includes some troublesome
weeds cabbages turnips radishes with all their varieties belong
here as well as numerous species of wild cresses a few like the
wallflower cheiranthus and stock matthiola are cultivated for
ornament
the last family is the caper family capparide represented by
only a few not common plants the type of the order is capparis
whose pickled flowerbuds constitute capers
the fourth order cistiflor of the aphanocycl is a very large
one but the majority of the sixteen families included in it are not
represented within our limits the flowers have the sepals and petals
in fives the stamens either the same or more numerous

among the commoner members of the order are the mignonettes
resedace and the violets violace of which the various wild
and cultivated species are familiar plants fig 104 a m the
sundews droserace are most extraordinary plants growing in boggy
land over pretty much the whole world they are represented in
the united states by several species of sundew drosera and the
still more curious venussflytrap diona of north carolina the
leaves of the latter are sensitive and composed of two parts which
snap together like a steel trap if an insect lights upon the leaf
and touches certain hairs upon its upper surface the two parts snap
together holding the insect tightly a digestive fluid is secreted by
glands upon the inner surface of the leaf and in a short time the
captured insect is actually digested and absorbed by the leaves the
same process takes place in the sundew fig 104 n where however
the mechanism is somewhat different here the tentacles with which
the leaf is studded secrete a sticky fluid which holds any small
insect that may light upon it the tentacles now slowly bend inward
and finally the edges of the leaf as well until the captured insect
is firmly held when a digestive process similar to that in diona
takes place this curious habit is probably to be explained from the
position where the plant grows the roots being in water where there
does not seem to be a sufficient supply of nitrogenous matter for the
wants of the plant which supplements the supply from the bodies of
the captured insects

similar in their habits but differing much in appearance from the
sundews are the pitcherplants sarraceniace of which one
species sarracenia purpurea is very common in peat bogs throughout
the northern united states in this species fig 105 a b the
leaves form a rosette from the centre of which arises in early summer
a tall stalk bearing a single large nodding darkreddish flower
with a curious umbrellashaped pistil the leaf stalk is hollow and
swollen with a broad wing on one side and the blade of the leaf
forms a sort of hood at the top the interior of the pitcher is
covered above with stiff downwardpointing hairs while below it is
very smooth insects readily enter the pitcher but on attempting to
get out the smooth slippery wall at the bottom and the stiff
downwarddirected hairs above prevent their escape and they fall
into the fluid which fills the bottom of the cup and are drowned the
leaf absorbing the nitrogenous compounds given off during the process
of decomposition there are other species common in the southern
states and a california pitcherplant darlingtonia has a colored
appendage at the mouth of the pitcher which serves to lure insects
into the trap
another family of pitcherplants nepenthe is found in the warmer
parts of the old world and some of them are occasionally cultivated
in greenhouses in these the pitchers are borne at the tips of the
leaves attached to a long tendril
two other families of the order contain familiar native plants the
rockrose family cistace and the st johnsworts
hypericace the latter particularly are common plants with
numerous showy yellow flowers the petals usually marked with black
specks and the leaves having clear dots scattered through them the
stamens are numerous and often in several distinct groups fig 105
c d
the last order of the aphanocycl the columnifer has three
families of which two the mallows malvace and the lindens
tiliace include wellknown species of the former the various
species of mallows fig 106 a belonging to the genus malva are
common as well as some species of hibiscus including the showy
swamp hibiscus or rosemallow h moscheutos common in salt
marshes and in the freshwater marshes of the great lake region the
hollyhock and shrubby altha are familiar cultivated plants of this
order and the cottonplant gossypium also belongs here in all of
these the stamens are much branched and united into a tube enclosing
the style most of them are characterized also by the development of
great quantities of a mucilaginous matter within their tissues
the common basswood tilia is the commonest representative of the
family tiliace fig 106 g the nearly related european linden
or limetree is sometimes planted its leaves are ordinarily somewhat
smaller than our native species which it however closely resembles

most commonly have the parts in fives and the stamens are never more
than twice as many as the sepals the carpels are usually more or less
completely united into a compound pistil there are four orders
comprising twentyfive families

the first order gruinales includes six families consisting for
the most part of plants with conspicuous flowers here belong the
geraniums fig 107 a represented by the wild geraniums and
cranesbill and the very showy geraniums pelargonium of the
gardens the nasturtiums tropolum represent another family
mostly tropical and the woodsorrels oxalis fig 107 i are
common both wild and cultivated the most useful member of the order
is unquestionably the common flax linum of which there are also
several native species fig 107 f these are types of the flax
family linace linen is the product of the tough fibrous inner
bark of l usitatissimum which has been cultivated for its fibre
from time immemorial the last family is the balsam family
balsamine the jewelweed or touchmenot impatiens so
called from the sensitive pods which spring open on being touched is
very common in moist ground everywhere fig 107 lp the garden
balsam or ladys slipper is a related species i balsamina

the second order terebinthin contains but few common plants
there are six families mostly inhabitants of the warmer parts of
the world the bestknown members of the order are the orange lemon
citron and their allies of our native plants the prickly ash
zanthoxylum and the various species of sumach rhus are
the best known in the latter genus belong the poison ivy
r toxicodendron and the poison dogwood r venenata the
venetian sumach or smoketree r cotinus is commonly planted for
ornament
the third order of the eucycl the sculin embraces six
families of which three the horsechestnuts etc sapindace the
maples acerace and the milkworts polygalace have several
representatives in the northern united states of the first the
buckeye sculus fig 108 j and the bladdernut staphylea
fig 108 g are the commonest native genera while the
horsechestnut sculus hippocastanum is everywhere planted
the various species of maple acer are familiar examples of the
acerace see fig 106 a f
the fourth and last order of the eucycl the frangulin is
composed mainly of plants with inconspicuous flowers the stamens as
many as the petals not infrequently they are dicious or in some
like the grape some of the flowers may be unisexual while others are
hermaphrodite ie have both stamens and pistil among the
commoner plants of the order may be mentioned the spindletree or
burningbush as it is sometimes called euonymus fig 109 a
and the climbing bittersweet celastrus fig 109 d belonging
to the family celastrace the holly and black alder species of
ilex are examples of the family aquifoliace the various species
of grape vitis the virginia creeper ampelopsis quinquefolia
and one or two other cultivated species of the latter represent the
vine family vitace or ampelid and the buckthorn rhamnus
is the type of the rhamnace

the fifth group of the choripetal is a small one comprising but a
single order tricocc the flowers are small and inconspicuous
though sometimes as in some euphorbias and the showy poinsettia
of the greenhouses the leaves or bracts surrounding the inflorescence
are conspicuously colored giving the whole the appearance of a large
showy single flower in northern countries the plants are mostly
small weeds of which the various spurges or euphorbias are the most
familiar these plants fig 109 k have the small flowers
surrounded by a cupshaped involucre l m so that the whole
inflorescence looks like a single flower in the spurges as in the
other members of the order the flowers are very simple being often
reduced to a single stamen or pistil fig 109 m n the plants
generally abound in a milky juice which is often poisonous this juice
in a number of tropical genera is the source of indiarubber some
genera like the castorbean ricinus and croton are cultivated
for their large showy leaves
the water starworts callitriche not uncommon in stagnant water
represent the family callitrichace and the box buxus is the
type of the buxace

the last and highest group of the choripetal the calyciflor
embraces a very large assemblage of familiar plants divided into
eight orders and thirtytwo families with few exceptions the floral
axis grows up around the ovary carrying the outer floral leaves above
it and the ovary appears at the bottom of a cup around whose edge the
other parts of the flower are arranged sometimes as in the fuchsia
the ovary is grown to the base of the cup or tube and thus looks as
if it were outside the flower such an ovary is said to be inferior
in distinction from one that is entirely free from the tube and thus
is evidently within the flower the latter is the socalled superior
ovary the carpels are usually united into a compound pistil but may
be separate as in the stonecrop fig 111 e or strawberry
fig 114 c
the first order of the calyciflor umbelliflor has the flowers
small and usually arranged in umbels ie several stalked flowers
growing from a common point the ovary is inferior and there is a
nectarsecreting disc between the styles and the stamens of the three
families the umbelworts or umbellifer is the commonest the
flowers are much alike in all fig 110 a b and nearly all
have large compound leaves with broad sheathing bases the stems are
generally hollow so great is the uniformity of the flowers and plant
that the fruit fig 110 d is generally necessary before the plant
can be certainly recognized this is twoseeded in all but differs
very much in shape and in the development of oil channels which
secrete the peculiar oil that gives the characteristic taste to the
fruits of such forms as caraway coriander etc some of them like
the wild parsnip poison hemlock etc are violent poisons while
others like the carrot are perfectly wholesome
the wild spikenard aralia fig 110 f ginseng and the true
ivy hedera are examples of the araliace and the various
species of dogwood cornus fig 110 jn represent the dogwood
family corne
the second order saxifragin contains eight families including a
number of common wild and cultivated plants the true saxifrages are
represented by several wild and cultivated species of saxifraga the
little bishops cap or mitrewort mitella fig 111 d and
others the wild hydrangea fig 111 f and the showy garden
species represent the family hydrange in these some of the flowers
are large and showy but with neither stamens nor pistils neutral
while the small inconspicuous flowers of the central part of the
inflorescence are perfect in the garden varieties all of the flowers
are changed by selection into the showy neutral ones the syringa
or mock orange philadelphus fig 111 i the gooseberry and
currants ribes fig 111 a and the stonecrop sedum
fig 111 e are types of the families philadelphe ribesie

the third order opuntie has but a single family the cacti
cactace these are strictly american in their distribution and
inhabit especially the dry plains of the southwest where they reach
an extraordinary development they are nearly or quite leafless and
the fleshy cylindrical or flattened stems are usually beset with
stout spines the flowers fig 112 a are often very showy so
that many species are cultivated for ornament and are familiar to
every one the beautiful nightblooming cereus of which there are
several species is one of these a few species of pricklypear
opuntia occur as far north as new york but most are confined to
the hot dry plains of the south and southwest

the fourth order passiflorin are almost without exception
tropical plants only a very few extending into the southern united
states the type of the order is the passionflower passiflora
fig 112 b whose numerous species are mostly inhabitants of
tropical america but a few reach into the united states the only
other members of the order likely to be met with by the student are
the begonias of which a great many are commonly cultivated as house
plants on account of their fine foliage and flowers the leaves are
always onesided and the flowers moncious13 whether the begonias
properly belong with the passiflorin has been questioned
13 moncious having stamens and carpels in different flowers but
on the same plant

the fifth order myrtiflor have regular fourparted flowers with
usually eight stamens but sometimes through branching of the
stamens these appear very numerous the myrtle family the members of
which are all tropical or subtropical gives name to the order the
true myrtle myrtus is sometimes cultivated for its pretty glossy
green leaves and white flowers as is also the pomegranate whose
brilliant scarlet flowers are extremely ornamental cloves are the
dried flowerbuds of an eastindian myrtaceous tree caryophyllus
in australia the order includes the giant gumtrees eucalyptus
the largest of all known trees exceeding in size even the giant trees
of california
among the commoner myrtiflor the majority belong to the two
families onagrace and lythrace the former includes the evening
primroses nothera willowherb epilobium fig 113 d
and fuchsia the latter the purple loosestrife lythrum and swamp
loosestrife nesa the watermilfoil myriophyllum fig 113
j is an example of the family haloragidace and the rhexias of
the eastern united states represent with us the family melastomace
the sixth order of the calyciflor is a small one thymelin
represented in the united states by very few species the flowers are
fourparted the calyx resembling a corolla which is usually absent
the commonest member of the order is the moosewood dirca
fig 113 a belonging to the first of the three families
thymelace of the second family elagnace the commonest
example is shepherdia a low shrub having the leaves covered with
curious scurfy hairs that give them a silvery appearance the third
family proteace has no familiar representatives
the seventh order rosiflor includes many wellknown plants all
of which may be united in one family rosace with several
subfamilies the flowers are usually fiveparted with from five to
thirty stamens and usually numerous distinct carpels in the apple
and pear fig 114 i however the carpels are more or less grown
together and in the cherry peach etc there is but a single carpel
giving rise to a singleseeded stonefruit drupe fig 114 e
h in the strawberry fig 114 a rose g cinquefoil
potentilla etc there are numerous distinct oneseeded carpels
and in spira fig 114 f there are five severalseeded carpels
forming as many dry pods when ripe the socalled berry of the
strawberry is really the much enlarged flower axis or receptacle
in which the little oneseeded fruits are embedded the latter being
what are ordinarily called the seeds

from the examples given it will be seen that the order includes not
only some of the most ornamental cultivated plants but the majority
of our best fruits in addition to those already given may be
mentioned the raspberry blackberry quince plum and apricot

the last order of the calyciflor and the highest of the
choripetal is the order leguminos of which the bean pea
clover and many other common plants are examples in most of our
common forms the flowers are peculiar in shape one of the petals
being larger than the others and covering them in the bud this
petal is known as the standard the two lateral petals are known as
the wings and the two lower and inner are generally grown together
forming what is called the keel fig 115 a b the stamens
ten in number are sometimes all grown together into a tube but
generally the upper one is free from the others fig 115 c there
is but one carpel which forms a pod with two valves when ripe
fig 115 d the seeds are large and the embryo fills the seed
completely from the peculiar form of the flower they are known as
papilionace papilio a butterfly many of the papilionace
are climbers either having twining stems as in the common beans or
else with part of the leaf changed into a tendril as in the pea
fig 115 a vetch etc the leaves are usually compound
of the second family csalpine mainly tropical the honey locust
gleditschia and redbud cercis fig 115 g are the
commonest examples the flowers differ mainly from the papilionace
in being less perfectly papilionaceous and the stamens are almost
entirely distinct fig 115 h the last family mimosace is
also mainly tropical the acacias sensitiveplant mimosa and the
sensitivebrier of the southern united states schrankia fig 115
i represent this family the flowers are quite different from the
others of the order being tubular and the petals united thus
resembling the flowers of the sympetal the leaves of mimosa and
schrankia are extraordinarily sensitive folding up if irritated
chapter xix
classification of dicotyledons continued
division iisympetal
the sympetal or gamopetal are at once distinguished from the
choripetal by having the petals more or less united so that the
corolla is to some extent tubular in the last order of the
choripetal we found a few examples mimosace where the same
thing is true and these form a transition from the choripetal to
the sympetal
there are two great divisions isocarp and anisocarp in the
first the carpels are of the same number as the petals and sepals in
the second fewer in both cases the carpels are completely united
forming a single compound pistil in the isocarp there are usually
twice as many stamens as petals occasionally the same number
there are three orders of the isocarp viz bicornes
primulin and diospyrin the first is a large order with six
families including many very beautiful plants and a few of some
economic value of the six families all but one epacride are
represented in the united states of these the pyrolace includes
the pretty little pyrolas and princespine chimaphila fig 116
j the monotrope has as its commonest examples the curious
indianpipe monotropa uniflora and pinesap m hypopitys
fig 116 l these grow on decaying vegetable matter and are
quite devoid of chlorophyll the former species being pure white
throughout hence a popular name ghost flower the latter is
yellowish the magnificent rhododendrons and azaleas fig 116 f
and the mountain laurel kalmia fig 116 i belong to the
rhodorace the heath family ericace besides the true heaths
erica calluna includes the pretty trailingarbutus or
mayflower epiga andromeda oxydendrum fig 116 e
wintergreen gaultheria etc the last family is represented by the
cranberry vaccinium and huckleberry gaylussacia

the second order the primroses primulin is principally
represented in the cooler parts of the world by the true primrose
family primulace of which several familiar plants may be
mentioned the genus primula includes the european primrose and
cowslip as well as two or three small american species and the
commonly cultivated chinese primrose other genera are dodecatheon
of which the beautiful shootingstar d meadia fig 117 a is
the best known something like this is cyclamen sometimes
cultivated as a house plant the moneywort lysimachia nummularia
fig 117 d as well as other species also belongs here

not represented by any common plants
the third and last order of the isocarpous sympetal has but a
single common representative in the united states viz the persimmon
diospyros fig 117 e this belongs to the family ebenace
to which also belongs the ebony a member of the same genus as the
persimmon and found in africa and asia
the second division of the sympetal the anisocarp has usually
but two or three carpels never as many as the petals the stamens are
also never more than five and very often one or more are abortive

the first order tubiflor has as the name indicates tubular
flowers which show usually perfect radial symmetry actinomorphism
there are five families all represented by familiar plants the first
convolvulace has as its type the morningglory convolvulus
fig 118 g and the nearly related ipomas of the gardens the
curious dodder cuscuta whose leafless yellow stems are sometimes
very conspicuous twining over various plants is a member of this
family which has lost its chlorophyll through parasitic habits the
sweet potato batatas is also a member of the morningglory family
the numerous species wild and cultivated of phlox fig 118 a
and the blue valerian polemonium fig 118 d are examples of
the family polemoniace

the third family hydrophyllace includes several species of
waterleaf hydrophyllum fig 118 e and phacelia among our
wild flowers and species of nemophila whitlavia and others from
the western states but now common in gardens
the borage family borragine includes the forgetmenot
myosotis and a few pretty wild flowers eg the orangeflowered
puccoons lithospermum but it also embraces a number of the most
troublesome weeds among which are the houndstongue cynoglossum
fig 119 a and the beggarsticks echinospermum whose
prickly fruits fig 119 c become detached on the slightest
provocation and adhere to whatever they touch with great tenacity
the flowers in this family are arranged in onesided inflorescences
which are coiled up at first and straighten as the flowers expand
the last family solane includes the nightshades solanum
fig 119 d to which genus the potato s tuberosum and the
eggplant s melongena also belong many of the family contain a
poisonous principle eg the deadly nightshade atropa tobacco
nicotiana stramonium datura and others of the cultivated
plants besides those already mentioned the tomato lycopersicum
and various species of petunia fig 119 h solanum and
datura are the commonest
the second order of the anisocarp consists of plants whose flowers
usually exhibit very marked bilateral symmetry zygomorphism from
the flower often being twolipped see fig 120 the name of the
order labiatiflor is derived
of the nine families constituting the order all but one are
represented within our limits but the great majority belong to two
families the mints labiat and the figworts scrophularine
the mints are very common and easily recognizable on account of their
square stems opposite leaves strongly bilabiate flowers and the
ovary splitting into four seedlike fruits fig 120 d f
  the great majority of them too have the surface covered with
  glandular hairs secreting a strongscented volatile oil giving the
  peculiar odor to these plants the dead nettle lamium fig 120
  a is a thoroughly typical example the sage mints catnip
  thyme lavender etc will recall the peculiarities of the family
the stamens are usually four in number through the abortion of one of
them but sometimes only two perfect stamens are present

the scrophularine differ mainly from the labiat in having round
stems and the ovary not splitting into separate oneseeded fruits
the leaves are also sometimes alternate there are generally four
stamens two long and two short as in the labiates but in the
mullein verbascum fig 120 m where the flower is only
slightly zygomorphic there is a fifth rudimentary stamen while in
others eg veronica fig 120 j there are but two stamens
many have large showy flowers as in the cultivated foxglove
digitalis and the native species of gerardia mullein
mimulus etc while a few like the figwort scrophularia
fig 120 h and speedwells veronica have dullercolored or
smaller flowers

the curious bladderweed utricularia is the type of the family
lentibulariace aquatic or semiaquatic plants which possess
special contrivances for capturing insects or small water animals
these in the bladderweed are little sacs fig 120 p which act as
traps from which the animals cannot escape after being captured there
does not appear to be here any actual digestion but simply an
absorption of the products of decomposition as in the pitcherplant
in the nearly related land form pinguicula however there is much
the same arrangement as in the sundew
the family gesnerace is mainly a tropical one represented in the
greenhouses by the magnificent gloxinia and achimenes but of
native plants there are only a few parasitic forms destitute of
chlorophyll and with small inconspicuous flowers the commonest of
these is epiphegus a muchbranched brownish plant common in
autumn about the roots of beechtrees upon which it is parasitic and
whence it derives its common name beechdrops
the bignonia family bignoniace is mainly tropical but in our
southern states is represented by the showy trumpetcreeper tecoma
fig 121 a the catalpa and martynia
the other plants likely to be met with by the student belong either to
the verbenace represented by the showy verbenas of the gardens
and our much less showy wild vervains also belonging to the genus
verbena fig 121 e or to the plantain family plantagine
of which the various species of plantain plantago are familiar to
every one fig 121 g i the latter seem to be forms in which
the flowers have become inconspicuous and are wind fertilized while
probably all of its showyflowered relatives are dependent on insects
for fertilization
the third order contort of the anisocarp includes five
families all represented by familiar forms the first the olive
family oleace besides the olive contains the lilac and jasmine
among cultivated plants and the various species of ash fraxinus
and the pretty fringetree chionanthus fig 122 a often
cultivated for its abundant white flowers the other families are the
gentianace including the true gentians gentiana fig 122
f the buckbean menyanthes the centauries erythra and
sabbatia and several other less familiar genera loganiace
with the pinkroot spigelia fig 122 d as the bestknown
example apocynace including the dogbane apocynum fig 122
h and in the gardens the oleander and periwinkle vinca

the last family is the milkweeds asclepiadace which have
extremely complicated flowers our numerous milkweeds fig 122 k
are familiar representatives and exhibit perfectly the peculiarities
of the family like the dogbanes the plants contain a milky juice
which is often poisonous besides the true milkweeds asclepias
there are several other genera within the united states but mostly
southern in their distribution many of them are twining plants and
occasionally cultivated for their showy flowers of the cultivated
forms the waxplant hoya and physianthus are the commonest

the last and highest order of the sympetal and hence of the
dicotyledons is known as aggregat from the tendency to have the
flowers densely crowded into a head which not infrequently is closely
surrounded by bracts so that the whole inflorescence resembles a
single flower there are six families five of which have common
representatives but the last family calycere has no members
within our limits
the lower members of the order eg various rubiace fig 124
a e have the flowers in loose inflorescences but as we examine
the higher families the tendency for the flowers to become crowded
becomes more and more evident and in the highest of our native forms
dipsace fig 124 p and composit fig 125 this is very
marked indeed in the latter family which is by far the largest of
all the angiosperms including about ten thousand species the
differentiation is carried still further among our native composit
there are three wellmarked types the first of these may be
represented by the thistles fig 125 a the socalled flower of
the thistle is in reality a close head of small tubular flowers
fig 125 c each perfect in all respects having an inferior
onecelled ovary five stamens with the anthers united and a
fiveparted corolla the sepals here called the pappus p have
the form of fine hairs these little flowers are attached to the
enlarged upper end of the flower stalk receptacle r and are
surrounded by closely overlapping bracts or scale leaves which look
like a calyx the flowers on superficial examination appear as
single petals in other forms like the daisy and mayweed fig 125
f only the central flowers are perfect and the edge of the
inflorescence is composed of flowers whose corollas are split and
flattened out but the stamens and sometimes the pistils are wanting
in these socalled rayflowers in the third group of which the
dandelion fig 125 h chicory lettuce etc are examples all
of the flowers have strapshaped split corollas and contain both
stamens and pistils
the families of the aggregat are the following i rubiace of

besides the groups already mentioned there are several families of
dicotyledons whose affinities are very doubtful they are largely
parasitic eg mistletoe or water plants as the horned pondweed

the curious dutchmans pipe aristolochia sipho a woody twiner
with very large leaves and the common wild ginger asarum
fig 126 do not appear to be in any wise parasitic but the
structure of their curious flowers differs widely from any other group
of plants
chapter xx
fertilization of flowers
if we compare the flowers of different plants we shall find almost
infinite variety in structure and this variation at first appears to
follow no fixed laws but as we study the matter more thoroughly we
find that these variations have a deep significance and almost
without exception have to do with the fertilization of the flower
in the simpler flowers such as those of a grass sedge or rush among
the monocotyledons or an oak hazel or plantain among dicotyledons
the flowers are extremely inconspicuous and often reduced to the
simplest form in such plants the pollen is conveyed from the male
flowers to the female by the wind and to this end the former are
usually placed above the latter so that these are dusted with the
pollen whenever the plant is shaken by the wind in these plants the
male flowers often outnumber the female enormously and the pollen is
produced in great quantities and the stigmas are long and often
feathery so as to catch the pollen readily this is very beautifully
shown in many grasses
if however we examine the higher groups of flowering plants we see
that the outer leaves of the flower become more conspicuous and that
this is often correlated with the development of a sweet fluid
nectar in certain parts of the flower while the windfertilized
flowers are destitute of this as well as of odor
if we watch any brightcolored or sweetscented flower for any length
of time we shall hardly fail to observe the visits of insects to it
in search of pollen or honey and attracted to the flower by its
bright color or sweet perfume in its visits from flower to flower
the insect is almost certain to transfer part of the pollen carried
off from one flower to the stigma of another of the same kind thus
effecting pollination
that the fertilization of a flower by pollen from another is
beneficial has been shown by many careful experiments which show that
nearly alwaysat least in flowers where there are special
contrivances for crossfertilizationthe number of seeds is greater
and the quality better where crossfertilization has taken place than
where the flower is fertilized by its own pollen from these
experiments as well as from very numerous studies on the structure of
the flower with reference to insect aid in fertilization we are
justified in the conclusion that all brightcolored flowers are to a
great extent dependent upon insect aid for transferring the pollen
from one flower to another and that many especially those with
tubular or zygomorphic bilateral flowers are perfectly incapable of
selffertilization in a few cases snails have been known to be the
conveyers of pollen and the hummingbirds are known in some cases as
for instance the trumpetcreeper fig 121 a to take the place of
insects14
14 in a number of plants with showy flowers eg violets
jewelweed small inconspicuous flowers are also formed which are
selffertilizing these inconspicuous flowers are called
cleistogamous
at first sight it would appear that most flowers are especially
adapted for selffertilization but in fact although stamens and
pistils are in the same flower there are usually effective
preventives for avoiding selffertilization in a few cases
investigated it has been found that the pollen from the flower will
not germinate upon its own stigma and in others it seems to act
injuriously one of the commonest means of avoiding selffertilization
is the maturing of stamens and pistils at different times usually the
stamens ripen first discharging the pollen and withering before the
stigma is ready to receive it eg willowherb fig 113 d
campanula fig 123 a d and pea in the two latter the pollen
is often shed before the flower opens not so frequently the stigmas
mature first as in the plantain fig 121 g
in many flowers the stamens as they ripen move so as to place
themselves directly before the entrance to the nectary where they are
necessarily struck by any insect searching for honey after the pollen
is shed they move aside or bend downward and their place is taken by
the pistil so that an insect which has come from a younger flower
will strike the part of the body previously dusted with pollen against
the stigma and deposit the pollen upon it this arrangement is very
beautifully seen in the nasturtium and larkspur fig 99 j
the tubular flowers of the sympetal are especially adapted for
pollination by insects with long tongues like the bees and
butterflies and in most of these flowers the relative position of the
stamens and pistil is such as to ensure crossfertilization which in
the majority of them appears to be absolutely dependent upon insect
aid
the great orchid family is well known on account of the singular form
and brilliant colors of the flowers which have no equals in these
respects in the whole vegetable kingdom as might be expected there
are numerous contrivances for crossfertilization among them some of
which are so extraordinary as to be scarcely credible with few
exceptions the pollen is so placed as to render its removal by insects
necessary one of the simpler contrivances is readily studied in the
little springorchis fig 89 or one of the habenarias fig 90
g in the first the two pollen masses taper below where each is
attached to a viscid disc which is covered by a delicate membrane
these discs are so placed that when an insect enters the flower and
thrusts its tongue into the spur of the flower its head is brought
against the membrane covering the discs rupturing it so as to expose
the disc which adheres firmly to the head or tongue of the insect
the substance composing the disc hardening like cement on exposure to
the air as the insect withdraws its tongue one or both of the pollen
masses are dragged out and carried away the action of the insect may
be imitated by thrusting a small grassstalk or some similar body into
the spur of the flower when on withdrawing it the two pollen masses
will be removed from the flower if we now examine these carefully we
shall see that they change position being nearly upright at first
but quickly bending downward and forward fig 89 d ii iii so
that on thrusting the stem into another flower the pollen masses
strike against the sticky stigmatic surfaces and a part of the pollen
is left adhering to them
the last arrangement that will be mentioned here is one discovered by
darwin in a number of very widely separated plants and to which he
gave the name heterostylism examples of this are the primroses
primula loosestrife lythrum partridgeberry mitchella
pickerelweed pontederia fig 84 i and others in these
there are two sometimes three sets of flowers differing very much in
the relative lengths of stamens and pistil those with long pistils
having short stamens and vice versa when an insect visits a flower
with short stamens that part is covered with pollen which in the
shortstyled but longstamened flower will strike the stigma as the
pistil in one flower is almost exactly of the length of the stamens in
the other form in such flowers as have three forms eg
pontederia each flower has two different lengths of stamens both
differing from the style of the same flower microscopic examination
has shown that there is great variation in the size of the pollen
spores in these plants the large pollen from the long stamens being
adapted to the long style of the proper flower
it will be found that the character of the color of the flower is
related to the insects visiting it brilliantly colored flowers are
usually visited by butterflies bees and similar dayflying insects
flowers opening at night are usually white or pale yellow colors best
seen at night and in addition usually are very strongly scented so
as to attract the nightflying moths which usually fertilize them
sometimes dullcolored flowers which frequently have a very offensive
odor are visited by flies and other carrionloving insects which
serve to convey pollen to them
occasionally flowers in themselves inconspicuous are surrounded by
showy leaves or bracts which take the place of the petals of the
showier flowers in attracting insect visitors the large dogwood

histological methods
in the more exact investigations of the tissues it is often necessary
to have recourse to other reagents than those we have used hitherto
in order to bring out plainly the more obscure points of structure
this is especially the case in studies in cell division in the higher
plants where the changes in the dividing nucleus are very
complicated
  for studying these the most favorable examples for ready
  demonstration are found in the final division of the pollen spores
  especially of some monocotyledons an extremely good subject is
  offered by the common wild onion allium canadense which flowers
  about the last of may the buds which are generally partially
  replaced by small bulbs are enclosed in a spathe or sheath which
  entirely conceals them buds two to three millimetres in length
  should be selected and these opened so as to expose the anthers
  the latter should now be removed to a slide and carefully crushed
  in a drop of dilute acetic acid onehalf acid to onehalf
  distilled water this at once fixes the nuclei and by examining
  with a low power we can determine at once whether or not we have
  the right stages the spore mother cells are recognizable by their
  thick transparent walls and if the desired dividing stages are
  present a drop of staining fluid should be added and allowed to act
  for about a minute the preparation being covered with a cover
  glass after the stain is sufficiently deep it should be carefully
  withdrawn with blotting paper and pure water run under the cover
  glass
  the best stain for acetic acid preparations is perhaps gentian
  violet this is an aniline dye readily soluble in water for our
  purpose however it is best to make a concentrated alcoholic
  solution from the dry powder and dilute this as it is wanted a
  drop of the alcoholic solution is diluted with several times its
  volume of weak acetic acid about two parts of distilled water to
  one of the acid and a drop of this mixture added to the
  preparation in this way the nucleus alone is stained and is
  rendered very distinct appearing of a beautiful violetblue color
  if the preparation is to be kept permanently the acid must all be
  washed out and dilute glycerine run under the cover glass the
  preparation should then be sealed with canada balsam or some other
  cement but previously all trace of glycerine must be removed from
  the slide and upper surface of the cover glass it is generally best
  to gently wipe the edge of the cover glass with a small brush
  moistened with alcohol before applying the cement
illustration fig 127a pollen mother cell of the wild onion
n nucleus bf early stages in the division of the nucleus
par nucleolus acetic acid gentian violet  350
  if the spore mother cells are still quite young we shall find the
  nucleus fig 127 a n comparatively small and presenting a
  granular appearance when strongly magnified these granules which
  appear isolated are really parts of filaments or segments which
  are closely twisted together but scarcely visible in the resting
  nucleus on one side of the nucleus may usually be seen a large
  nucleolus called here from its lateral position paranucleus and
  the whole nucleus is sharply separated from the surrounding
  protoplasm by a thin but evident membrane
  the first indication of the approaching division of the nucleus is
  an evident increase in size b and at the same time the colored
  granules become larger and show more clearly that they are in lines
  indicating the form of the segments these granules next become more
  or less confluent and the segments become very evident appearing
  as deeply stained muchtwisted threads filling the nuclear cavity
  fig 127 c and about this time the nucleolus disappears
  the next step is the disappearance of the nuclear membrane so that
  the segments lie apparently free in the protoplasm of the cell they
  arrange themselves in a flat plate in the middle of the cell this
  plate appearing when seen from the side as a band running across
  the middle of the cell fig 127 d shows this plate as seen
  from the side e seen from above
  about the time the nuclear plate is complete delicate lines may be
  detected in the protoplasm converging at two points on opposite
  sides of the cell and forming a spindleshaped figure with the
  nuclear plate occupying its equator this stage d is known as
  the nuclear spindle the segments of the nuclear plate next divide
  lengthwise into two similar daughter segments f and these then
  separate one going to each of the new nuclei this stage is not
  always to be met with as it seems to be rapidly passed over but
  patient search will generally reveal some nuclei in this condition
illustration fig 128later stages of nuclear divisions in the
pollen mother cell of wild onion  350 all the figures are seen from
the side except b ii which is viewed from the pole
  although this is almost impossible to demonstrate there are
  probably as many filaments in the nuclear spindle as there are
  segments in this case about sixteen and along these the nuclear
  segments travel slowly toward the two poles of the spindle
  fig 128 a b as the two sets of segments separate they are
  seen to be connected by very numerous delicate threads and about
  the time the young nuclei reach the poles of the nuclear spindle
  the first trace of the division wall appears in the form of isolated
  particles microsomes which arise first as thickenings of these
  threads in the middle of the cell and appear in profile as a line
  of small granules not at first extending across the cell but later
  reaching completely across it fig 128 c e these granules
  constitute the young cell wall or cell plate and finally coalesce
  to form a continuous membrane fig 128 f
  the two daughter nuclei pass through the same changes but in
  reverse order that we saw in the mother nucleus previous to the
  formation of the nuclear plate and by the time the partition wall
  is complete the nuclei have practically the same structure as the
  first stages we examined fig 128 f15
15 the division is repeated in the same way in each cell so that
ultimately four pollen spores are formed from each of the original
mother cells
  this complicated process of nuclear division is known technically as
  karyokinesis and is found throughout the higher animals as well
  as plants
the simple method of fixing and staining just described while giving
excellent results in many cases is not always applicable nor as a
rule are the permanent preparations so made satisfactory for
permanent preparations strong alcohol for very delicate tissues
absolute alcohol when procurable is best is the most convenient
fixing agent and generally very satisfactory specimens may be put
directly into the alcohol and allowed to stay two or three days or
indefinitely if not wanted immediately when alcohol does not give
good results specimens fixed with chromic or picric acid may
generally be used and there are other fixing agents which will not be
described here as they will hardly be used by any except the
professional botanist chromic acid is best used in a watery solution
five per cent chromic acid ninetyfive per cent distilled water
for most purposes a one per cent solution is best in this the objects
remain from three or four to twentyfour hours depending on size but
are not injured by remaining longer picric acid is used as a
saturated solution in distilled water and the specimen may remain for
about the same length of time as in the chromic acid after the
specimen is properly fixed it must be thoroughly washed in several
waters allowing it to remain in the last for twentyfour hours or
more until all trace of the acid has been removed otherwise there is
usually difficulty in staining
as staining agents many colors are used the most useful are
hmatoxylin carmine and various aniline colors among which may be
mentioned besides gentian violet safranine bismarck brown methyl
violet hmatoxylin and carmine are prepared in various ways but are
best purchased ready for use all dealers in microscopic supplies
having them in stock the aniline colors may be used either dissolved
in alcohol or water and with all the best stain especially of the
nucleus is obtained by using a very dilute watery solution and
allowing the sections to remain for twentyfour hours or so in the
staining mixture
hmatoxylin and carmine preparations may be mounted either in
glycerine or balsam canada balsam dissolved in chloroform is the
ordinary mounting medium in using glycerine it is sometimes
necessary to add the glycerine gradually allowing the water to slowly
evaporate as otherwise the specimens will sometimes collapse owing to
the too rapid extraction of the water from the cells aniline colors
as a rule will not keep in glycerine the color spreading and finally
fading entirely so that with most of them the specimens must be
mounted in balsam
glycerine mounts must be closed which may be done with canada balsam
as already described the balsam is best kept in a widemouthed
bottle specially made for the purpose which has a glass cap covering
the neck and contains a glass rod for applying the balsam
before mounting in balsam the specimen must be completely freed from
water by means of absolute alcohol sometimes care must be taken to
bring it gradually into the alcohol to avoid collapsing16 if an
aniline stain has been used it will not do to let it stay more than a
minute or so in the alcohol as the latter quickly extracts the stain
after dehydrating the specimen should be placed on a clean slide in a
drop of clove oil bergamot or origanum oil is equally good which
renders it perfectly transparent when a drop of balsam should be
dropped upon it and a perfectly clean cover glass placed over the
preparation the chloroform in which the balsam is dissolved will soon
evaporate leaving the object embedded in a transparent film of balsam
between the slide and cover glass no further treatment is necessary
for the finer details of nuclear division or similar studies balsam
mounts are usually preferable
16 for gradual dehydrating the specimens may be placed
successively in 30 per cent 50 per cent 70 per cent 90 per cent
and absolute alcohol
it is sometimes found necessary in sectioning very small and delicate
organs to embed them in some firm substance which will permit
sectioning but these processes are too difficult and complicated to
be described here

elements of physics
  a textbook for high schools and academies by alfred p gage am
  instructor in physics in the english high school boston 12mo
  424 pages mailing price 125 introduction 112 allowance for
  old book 35 cents
this treatise is based upon the doctrine of the conservation of
energy which is made prominent throughout the work but the leading
feature of the bookone that distinguishes it from all othersis
that it is strictly experimentteaching in its method ie it
leads the pupil to read nature in the language of experiment so far
as practicable the following plan is adopted the pupil is expected
to accept as fact only that which he has seen or learned by personal
investigation he himself performs the larger portion of the
experiments with simple and inexpensive apparatus such as in a
majority of cases is in his power to construct with the aid of
directions given in the book the experiments given are rather of the
nature of questions than of illustrations and precede the
statements of principles and laws definitions and laws are not given
until the pupil has acquired a knowledge of his subject sufficient to
enable him to construct them for himself the aim of the book is to
lead the pupil to observe and to think
c f emerson prof of physics dartmouth college it takes up the
subject on the right plan and presents it in a clear yet scientific
way
wm noetling prof of rhetoric theory and practice of teaching
state normal school bloomsburg pa every page of the book shows
that the author is a real teacher and that he knows how to make
pupils think i know of no other work on the subject of which this
treats that i can so unreservedly recommend to all wideawake teachers
as this
b f wright supt of public schools st paul minn i like it

  price 110 for introduction 100 allowance for an old book in
  exchange 30 cents
the great and constantly increasing popularity of gages elements of
physics has created a demand for an equally good but easier book on
the same plan suitable for schools that can give but a limited time
to the study the introduction to physical science has been prepared
to supply this demand
accuracy is the prime requisite in scientific textbooks a false
statement is not less false because it is plausible nor an
inconclusive experiment more satisfactory because it is diverting in
books of entertainment such things may be permissible but in a
textbook the first essentials are correctness and accuracy it is
believed that the introduction will stand the closest expert
scrutiny especial care has been taken to restrict the use of
scientific terms such as force energy power etc to their
proper significations terms like sound light color etc
which have commonly been applied to both the effect and the agent
producing the effect have been rescued from this ambiguity
recent advances in physics have been faithfully recorded and the
relative practical importance of the various topics has been taken
into account among the new features are a full treatment of electric
lighting and descriptions of storage batteries methods of
transmitting electric energy simple and easy methods of making
electrical measurements with inexpensive apparatus the compound
steamengine etc static electricity which is now generally regarded
as of comparatively little importance is treated briefly while
dynamic electricity the most potent and promising physical element of
our modern civilization is placed in the clearest light of our
present knowledge
in interest and availability the introduction will it is believed
be found no less satisfactory the wide use of the elements under
the most varied conditions and in particular the authors own
experience in teaching it have shown how to improve where improvement
was possible the style will be found suited to the grades that will
use the book the experiments are varied interesting clear and of
practical significance as well as simple in manipulation and ample in
number certain subjects that are justly considered difficult and
obscure have been omitted as for instance certain laws relating to
the pressure of gases and the polarization of light the
introduction is even more fully illustrated than the elements
in general the introduction like the elements has this distinct
and distinctive aimto elucidate science instead of popularizing
it to make it liked for its own sake rather than for its gilding and
coating and while teaching the facts to impart the spirit of
sciencethat is to say the spirit of our civilization and progress

introduction to chemical science
  by r p williams instructor in chemistry in the english high
  school boston 12mo cloth 216 pages mailing price 90 cents for
  introduction 80 cents allowance for old book in exchange
  25 cents
in a word this is a working chemistrybrief but adequate attention
is invited to a few special features
1 this book is characterized by directness of treatment by the
selection so far as possible of the most interesting and practical
matter and by the omission of what is unessential
2 great care has been exercised to combine clearness with accuracy of
statement both of theories and of facts and to make the explanations
both lucid and concise
3 the three great classes of chemical compoundsacids bases and
saltsare given more than usual prominence and the arrangement and
treatment of the subjectmatter relating to them is believed to be a
feature of special merit
4 the most important experiments and those best illustrating the
subjects to which they relate have been selected but the modes of
experimentation are so simple that most of them can be performed by
the average pupil without assistance from the teacher
5 the necessary apparatus and chemicals are less expensive than those
required for any other textbook equally comprehensive
6 the special inductive feature of the work consists in calling
attention by query and suggestion to the most important phenomena
and inferences this plan is consistently adhered to
7 though the method is an advanced one it has been so simplified
that pupils experience no difficulty but rather an added interest in
following it the author himself has successfully employed it in
classes so large that the simplest and most practical plan has been a
necessity
8 the book is thought to be comprehensive enough for high schools and
academies and for a preparatory course in colleges and professional
schools
9 those teachers in particular who have little time to prepare
experiments for pupils or whose experience in the laboratory has been
limited will find the simplicity of treatment and of experimentation
well worth their careful consideration
those who try the book find its merits have not been overstated
a b aubert prof of chemistry maine state college orono me
all the salient points are well explained the theories are treated of
with great simplicity it seems as if every student might thoroughly
understand the science of chemistry when taught from such a work
h t fuller pres of polytechnic institute worcester mass it
is clear concise and suggests the most important and most
significant experiments for illustration of general principles
alfred s roe prin of high school worcester mass i am very
much pleased with it i think it the most practical book for actual

frank m gilley science teacher high school chelsea mass i
have examined the proofsheets in connection with my class work and
after comparison with a large number of textbooks feel convinced
that it is superior to any yet published
g s fellows teacher of chemistry high school washington dc
the authors method seems to us the ideal one not only are the
theoretical parts rendered clear by experiments performed by the
student himself but there is a happy blending of theoretical and
applied chemistry as commendable as it is unusual
j i d hines prof of chemistry cumberland university lebanon
tenn i am very much pleased with it and think it will give the
student an admirable introduction to the science of chemistry
horace phillips prin of high school elkhart ind my class has
now used it three months it proves the most satisfactory textbook in

youngs general astronomy
  a textbook for colleges and technical schools by charles a young
  phd lld professor of astronomy in the college of new jersey
  and author of the sun etc 8vo viii  551 pages halfmorocco
  illustrated with over 250 cuts and diagrams and supplemented with
  the necessary tables introduction price 225 allowance for an
  old book in exchange 40 cents
the object of the author has been twofold first and chiefly to make
a book adapted for use in the college classroom and secondly to
make one valuable as a permanent storehouse and directory of
information for the students use after he has finished his prescribed
course
the method of treatment corresponds with the object of the book
truth accuracy and order have been aimed at first with clearness
and freedom from ambiguity
in amount the work has been adjusted as closely as possible to the
prevailing courses of study in our colleges the fine print may be
omitted from the regular lessons and used as collateral reading it is
important to anything like a complete view of the subject but not
essential to a course some entire chapters can be omitted if
necessary
new topics as indicated above have received a full share of
attention and while the book makes no claims to novelty the name of
the author is a guarantee of much originality both of matter and
manner
the book will be found especially well adapted for high school and
academy teachers who desire a work for reference in supplementing
their brief courses the illustrations are mostly new and prepared
expressly for this work the tables in the appendix are from the
latest and most trustworthy sources a very full and carefully
prepared index will be found at the end
the eminence of professor young as an original investigator in
astronomy a lecturer and writer on the subject and an instructor of
college classes and his scrupulous care in preparing this volume led
the publishers to present the work with the highest confidence and
this confidence has been fully justified by the event more than one
hundred colleges adopted the work within a year from its publication

  30 cents
this volume is a new work and not a mere abridgment of the authors
general astronomy much of the material of the larger book has
naturally been incorporated in this and many of its illustrations are
used but everything has been worked over with reference to the high
school course
special attention has been paid to making all statements correct and
accurate as far as they go many of them are necessarily incomplete
on account of the elementary character of the work but it is hoped
that this incompleteness has never been allowed to become untruth and
that the pupil will not afterwards have to unlearn anything the book
has taught him
in the text no mathematics higher than elementary algebra and geometry
is introduced in the footnotes and in the appendix an occasional
trigonometric formula appears for the benefit of the very
considerable number of high school students who understand such
expressions this fact should be particularly noted for it is a
special aim of the book to teach astronomy scientifically without
requiring more knowledge and skill in mathematics than can be expected
of high school pupils
many things of real but secondary importance have been treated of in
fine print and others which while they certainly ought to be found
within the covers of a high school textbook of astronomy are not
essential to the course are relegated to the appendix
a brief uranography is also presented covering the constellations
visible in the united states with maps on a scale sufficient for the
easy identification of all the principal stars it includes also a
list of such telescopic objects in each constellation as are easily
found and lie within the power of a small telescope
