preface
although it is now a century since lamarck published the germs of his
theory it is perhaps only within the past fifty years that the
scientific world and the general public have become familiar with the
name of lamarck and of lamarckism
the rise and rehabilitation of the lamarckian theory of organic
evolution so that it has become a rival of darwinism the prevalence of
these views in the united states germany england and especially in
france where its author is justly regarded as the real founder of
organic evolution has invested his name with a new interest and led to
a desire to learn some of the details of his life and work and of his
theory as he unfolded it in 1800 and subsequent years and finally
expounded it in 1809 the time seems ripe therefore for a more
extended sketch of lamarck and his theory as well as of his work as a
philosophical biologist than has yet appeared
but the seeker after the details of his life is baffled by the general
ignorance about the manhis antecedents his parentage the date of his
birth his early training and education his work as a professor in the
jardin des plantes the house he lived in the place of his burial and
his relations to his scientific contemporaries
except the loges of geoffroy st hilaire and cuvier and the brief
notices of martins duval bourguignat and bourguin there is no
special biography however brief except a brochure of thirtyone
pages reprinted from a few scattered articles by the distinguished
anthropologist m gabriel de mortillet in the fourth and last volume
of a littleknown journal lhomme entitled lamarck par un groupe
de transformistes ses disciples paris 1887 this exceedingly rare
pamphlet was written by the late m gabriel de mortillet with the
assistance of philippe salmon and dr a mondire who with others
under the leadership of paul nicole met in 1884 and formed a runion
lamarck and a dner lamarck to maintain and perpetuate the memory of
the great french transformist owing to their efforts the exact date of
lamarcks birth the house in which he lived during his lifetime at
paris and all that we shall ever know of his place of burial have been
established it is a lasting shame that his remains were not laid in a
grave but were allowed to be put into a trench with no headstone to
mark the site on one side of a row of graves of others better cared
for from which trench his bones with those of others unknown and
neglected were exhumed and thrown into the catacombs of paris lamarck
left behind him no letters or manuscripts nothing could be ascertained
regarding the dates of his marriages the names of his wives or of all
his children of his descendants but one is known to be living an
officer in the army but his aims in life his undying love of science
his noble character and generous disposition are constantly revealed in
his writings
the name of lamarck has been familiar to me from my youth up when a
boy i used to arrange my collection of shells by the lamarckian system
which had replaced the old linnean classification for over thirty years
the lamarckian factors of evolution have seemed to me to afford the
foundation on which natural selection rests to be the primary and
efficient causes of organic change and thus to account for the origin
of variations which darwin himself assumed as the starting point or
basis of his selection theory it is not lessening the value of darwins
labors to recognize the originality of lamarcks views the vigor with
which he asserted their truth and the heroic manner in which against
adverse and contemptuous criticism to his dying day he clung to them
during a residence in paris in the spring and summer of 1899 i spent my
leisure hours in gathering material for this biography i visited the
place of his birththe little hamlet of bazentin near amiensand
thanks to the kindness of the schoolmaster of that village m duval
was shown the house where lamarck was born the records in the old
parish register at the mairie of the birth of the father of lamarck
and of lamarck himself the jesuit seminary at amiens was also visited
in order to obtain traces of his student life there though the search
was unsuccessful
my thanks are due to professor a giard of paris for kind assistance in
the loan of rare books for copies of his own essays especially his
leon douverture des cours de lvolution des tres organiss 1888
and in facilitating the work of collecting data introduced by him to
professor hamy the learned anthropologist and archivist of the musum
dhistoire naturelle i was given by him the freest access to the
archives in the maison de buffon which among other papers contained
the ms archives du musum ie the procs verbaux des sances
tenues par les officiers du jardin des plantes from 1790 to 1830
bound in vellum in thirtyfour volumes these were all looked through
though found to contain but little of biographical interest relating to
lamarck beyond proving that he lived in that ancient edifice from 1793
until his death in 1829 dr hamys elaborate history of the last years
of the royal garden and of the foundation of the musum dhistoire
naturelle in the volume commemorating the centennial of the foundation
of the museum has been of essential service
my warmest thanks are due to m adrien de mortillet formerly secretary
of the society of anthropology of paris for most essential aid he
kindly gave me a copy of a very rare pamphlet entitled lamarck par un
groupe de transformistes ses disciples he also referred me to notices
bearing on the genealogy of lamarck and his family in the revue de
gascogne for 1876 to him also i am indebted for the privilege of
having electrotypes made of the five illustrations in the lamarck for
copies of the composite portrait of lamarck by dr gachet and also for
a photograph of the acte de naissance reproduced by the late
m salmon
i have also to acknowledge the kindness shown me by dr j deniker the
librarian of the bibliothque du musum dhistoire naturelle
i had begun in the museum library which contains nearly if not every
one of lamarcks publications to prepare a bibliography of all of
lamarcks writings when to my surprise and pleasure i was presented
with a very full and elaborate one by the assistantlibrarian
m godefroy malloisel
to professor edmond perrier i am indebted for a copy of his valuable
lamarck et le transformisme actuel reprinted from the noble volume
commemorative of the centennial of the foundation of the musum
dhistoire naturelle which has proved of much use
other sources from which biographical details have been taken are
cuviers loge and the notice of lamarck with a list of many of his
writings in the revue biographique de la socit malacologique de
france 1886 this notice which is illustrated by three portraits of
lamarck one of which has been reproduced i was informed by m paul
kleinsieck was prepared by the late j r bourguignat the eminent
malacologist and anthropologist the notices by professor mathias duval
and by l a bourguin have been of essential service
as regards the account of lamarcks speculative and theoretical views i
have so far as possible preferred by abstracts and translations to
let him tell his own story rather than to comment at much length myself
on points about which the ablest thinkers and students differ so much
it is hoped that lamarcks writings referring to the evolution theory
may at no distant date be reprinted in the original as they are not
bulky and could be comprised in a single volume
this life is offered with much diffidence though the pleasure of
collecting the materials and of putting them together has been very
great

lamarck the founder of evolution his life and work
chapter i
birth family youth and military career
the life of lamarck is the old old story of a man of genius who lived
far in advance of his age and who died comparatively unappreciated and
neglected but his original and philosophic views based as they were on
broad conceptions of nature and touching on the burning questions of
our day have after the lapse of a hundred years gained fresh interest
and appreciation and give promise of permanent acceptance
the author of the flore franaise will never be forgotten by his
countrymen who called him the french linn and he who wrote the
animaux sans vertbres at once took the highest rank as the leading
zologist of his period but lamarck was more than a systematic
biologist of the first order besides rare experience and judgment in
the classification of plants and of animals he had an unusually active
inquiring and philosophical mind with an originality and boldness in
speculation and soundness in reasoning and in dealing with such
biological facts as were known in his time which have caused his views
as to the method of organic evolution to again come to the front
as a zological philosopher no one of his time approached lamarck the
period however in which he lived was not ripe for the hearty and
general adoption of the theory of descent as in the organic world we
behold here and there prophetic types anticipating in their
generalized synthetic nature the incoming ages after of more
specialized types so lamarck anticipated by more than half a century
the principles underlying the present evolutionary theories
so numerous are now the adherents in some form of lamarcks views
that at the present time evolutionists are divided into darwinians and
lamarckians or neolamarckians the factors of organic evolution as
stated by lamarck it is now claimed by many really comprise the
primary or foundation principles or initiative causes of the origin of
lifeforms hence not only do many of the leading biologists of his
native country but some of those of germany of the united states and
of england justly regard him as the founder of the theory of organic
evolution
besides this lamarck lived in a transition period he prepared the way
for the scientific renascence in france moreover his simple unselfish
character was a rare one he led a retired life his youth was tinged
with romance and during the last decade of his life he was blind he
manfully and patiently bore adverse criticisms ridicule
forgetfulness and inappreciation while so far from renouncing his
theoretical views he tenaciously clung to them to his dying day
the biography of such a character is replete with interest and the
memory of his unselfish and fruitful devotion to science should be
forever cherished his life was also notable for the fact that after his
fiftieth year he took up and mastered a new science and at a period
when many students of literature and science cease to be productive and
rest from their labors he accomplished the best work of his lifework
which has given him lasting fame as a systematist and as a philosophic
biologist moreover lamarckism comprises the fundamental principles of
evolution and will always have to be taken into consideration in
accounting for the origin not only of species but especially of the
higher groups such as orders classes and phyla
this striking personage in the history of biological science who has
made such an ineffaceable impression on the philosophy of biology
certainly demands more than a brief loge to keep alive his memory
                                   
jeanbaptistepierreantoine de monet chevalier de lamarck was born
august 1 1744 at bazentinlepetit this little village is situated in
picardy or what is now the department of the somme in the
arrondissement de pronne canton dalbert a little more than four
miles from albert between this town and bapaume and near longueval
the nearest postoffice to bazentin the village of bazentinlegrand
composed of a few more houses than its sister hamlet is seen half a
mile to the southeast shaded by the little forest such as borders
nearly every town and village in this region the two hamlets are
pleasantly situated in a richly cultivated country on the chalk uplands
or downs of picardy amid broad acres of wheat and barley variegated
with poppies and the purple cornflower and with roadsides shaded by
tall poplars
the peasants to the number of 251 compose the diminishing population
there were 356 in 1880 or about that date the silence of the single
little street with its onestoried thatched or tiled cottages is at
infrequent intervals broken by an elderly dame in her sabots or by a
creaking rickety village cart driven by a farmerboy in blouse and
hobnailed shoes the largest inhabited building is the mairie a
modern structure at one end of which is the village school where
fifteen or twenty urchins enjoy the instructions of the worthy teacher
a stone church built in 1774 and somewhat larger than the needs of the
hamlet at present require raises its tower over the quiet scene
our pilgrimage to bazentin had for its object the discovery of the
birthplace of lamarck of which we could obtain no information in paris
our guide from albert took us to the mairie and it was with no little
satisfaction that we learned from the excellent village teacher
m duval that the house in which the great naturalist was born was
still standing and but a few steps away in the rear of the church and
of the mairie with much kindness he left his duties in the
schoolroom and accompanied us to the ancient structure
illustration birthplace of lamarck front view
illustration birthplace of lamarck
the modest chteau stands a few rods to the westward of the little
village and was evidently the seat of the leading family of the place
it faces east and is a twostoried house of the shape seen everywhere in
france with its high incurved roof the walls nearly a foot and a
half thick built of brick the corners and windows of blocks of white
limestone it is about fifty feet long and twentyfive feet wide above
the roof formerly rose a small tower there is no porch over the front
door within a rather narrow hall passes through the centre and opens
into a large room on each side what was evidently the drawingroom or
salon was a spacious apartment with a low white wainscot and a heavy
cornice over the large roomy fireplace is a painting on the wood
panel representing a rural scene in which a shepherdess and her lover
are engaged in other occupations than the care of the flock of sheep
visible in the distance over the doorway is a smaller but quaint
painting of the same description the house is uninhabited and perhaps
uninhabitableindeed almost a ruinand is used as a storeroom for wood
and rubbish by the peasants in the adjoining house to the left on the
south
the ground in front was cultivated with vegetables not laid down to a
lawn and the land stretched back for perhaps three hundred to four
hundred feet between the old garden walls
here amid these rural scenes even now so beautiful and tranquil the
subject of our sketch was born and lived through his infancy and early
boyhood1
if his parents did not possess an ample fortune they were blessed with
a numerous progeny for lamarck was the eleventh and youngest child and
seems to have survived all the others biographers have differed as to
the date of the birth of lamarck2 happily the exact date had been
ascertained through the researches of m philippe salmon and m duval
kindly showed us in the thin volume of records with its tattered and
torn leaves the register of the acte de naissance and made a copy of
it as follows

of lamarcks parentage and ancestry there are fortunately some traces
in the registre aux actes de baptme pour lanne 1702 still
preserved in the mairie of bazentinlepetit the record shows that
his father was born in february 1702 at bazentin the infant was
baptised february 16 1702 the permission to the cur by henry
bishop of amiens having been signed february 3 1702 lamarcks
grandparents were according to this certificate of baptism messire
philippe de monet de lamarck ecuyer seigneur des bazentin and dame
magdeleine de lyonne
the family of lamarck as stated by h masson3 notwithstanding his
northern and almost germanic name of chevalier de lamarck originated in
the southwest of france though born at bazentin in old picardy it is
not less true that he descended on the paternal side from an ancient
house of barn whose patrimony was very modest this house was that of
monet
another genealogist baron c de cauna4 tells us that there is no
doubt that the family of monet in bigorre5 was divided one of its
representatives formed a branch in picardy in the reign of louis xiv
or later
lamarcks grandfather philippe de monet seigneur de bazentin et
autres lieux was also chevalier de lordre royal et militaire de
saintlouis commandant pour le roi en la ville et chteau de dinan
pensionnaire de sa majest
the descendants of philippe de lamarck were adds de cauna thus thrown
into two branches or at least two offshoots or stems brisures near
pronne but the actual posterity of the monet of picardy was reduced to
a single family claiming back with good reason to a southern origin
one of its scions in the maternal line was a brilliant officer of the
military marine and also soninlaw of a very distinguished naval
officer
the family of monet was represented among the french nobility of 1789 by
messires de monet de caixon and de monet de saintmartin by marriage
their grandson was connected with an honorable family of montant near
saintsevercap
another authority the abb j dulac has thrown additional light on the
genealogy of the de lamarck family which it may be seen was for at
least three centuries a military one6 the family of monet seigneur
de saintmartin et de sombran was maintained as a noble one by order of
the royal council of state of june 20 1678 he descended i from
bernard de monet esquire captain of the chteau of lourdes who had as
a son ii tienne de monet esquire who by contract dated august 15
1543 married marguerite de sacaze he was the father of iii pierre
de monet esquire seigneur dast en barn guidon des gendarmes de la
compagnie du roi de navarre from him descended iv tienne de monet
esquire second of the name seigneur dast et lamarque de julos he
was a captain by rank and bought the estate of saintmartin in 1592 he
married in 1612 jeanne de lamarque daughter of william de lamarck
seigneur de lamarque et de bretaigne they had three children the
third of whom was philippe chevalier de saintlouis commandant du
chteau de dinan seigneur de bazentin en picardy who as we have
already seen was the father of the naturalist lamarck who lived from
1744 to 1829 the abb relates that philippe the father of the
naturalist was born at saintmartin in the midst of bigorre in
pleine bigorre and he very neatly adds that the bigorrais have the
right to claim for their land of flowers one of the glories of
botany7
the name was at first variously spelled de lamarque de la marck or
de lamarck he himself signed his name when acting as secretary of the
assembly of professorsadministrative of the museum of natural history
during the years of the first republic as plain lamarck
the inquiry arises how being the eleventh child he acquired the title
of chevalier which would naturally have become extinct with the death
of the oldest son the abb dulac suggests that the ten older of the
children had died or that by some family arrangement he was allowed to
add the domanial name to the patronymic one certainly he never
tarnished the family name which had it not been for him would have
remained in obscurity
as to his fathers tastes and disposition what influence his mother had
in shaping his character his home environment as the youngest of
eleven children the nature of his education in infancy and boyhood
there are no sources of information but several of his brothers entered
the army and the domestic atmosphere was apparently a military one
philippe de lamarck with his large family had endowed his firstborn
son so that he could maintain the family name and title and had found
situations for several of the others in the army jean lamarck did not
manifest any taste for the clerical profession he lived in a martial
atmosphere for centuries his ancestors had borne arms his eldest
brother had been killed in the breach at the siege of bergopzoom two
others were still in the service and in the troublous times at the
beginning of the war in 1756 a young man of high spirit and courage
would naturally not like to relinquish the prospect of renown and
promotion but yielding to the wishes of his father he entered as a
student at the college of the jesuits at amiens8
his father dying in 1760 nothing could induce the incipient abb then
seventeen years of age to longer wear his bands immediately on
returning home he bought himself a wretched horse for want of means to
buy a better one and accompanied by a poor lad of his village he
rode across the country to join the french army then campaigning in
germany

he carried with him a letter of recommendation from one of his neighbors
on an adjoining estate in the country madame de lameth to m
de lastic colonel of the regiment of beaujolais9
  we can imagine says cuvier the feelings of this officer on thus
  finding himself hampered with a boy whose puny appearance made him
  seem still younger than he was however he sent him to his
  quarters and then busied himself with his duties the period indeed
  was a critical one it was the 16th of july 1761 the marshal
  de broglie had just united his army with that of the prince
  de soubise and the next day was to attack the allied army commanded
  by the prince ferdinand of brunswick at the break of day m
  de lastic rode along the front of his corps and the first man that
  met his gaze was the new recruit who without saying anything to
  him had placed himself in the front rank of a company of
  grenadiers and nothing could induce him to quit his post
  it is a matter of history that this battle which bears the name of
  the little village of fissingshausen between ham and lippstadt in
  westphalia was lost by the french and that the two generals
  mutually accusing each other of this defeat immediately separated
  and abandoned the campaign
  during the movement of the battle de lamarcks company was
  stationed in a position exposed to the direct fire of the enemys
  artillery in the confusion of the retreat he was forgotten already
  all the officers and noncommissioned officers had been killed
  there remained only fourteen men when the oldest grenadier seeing
  that there were no more of the french troops in sight proposed to
  the young volunteer become so promptly commander to withdraw his
  little troop but we are assigned to this post said the boy and
  we should not withdraw from it until we are relieved and he made
  them remain there until the colonel seeing that the squad did not
  rally sent him an orderly who crept by all sorts of covered ways
  to reach him this bold stand having been reported to the marshal
  he promoted him on the field to the rank of an officer although his
  order had prescribed that he should be very chary of these kinds of
  promotions
his physical courage shown at this age was paralleled by his moral
courage in later years the staying power he showed in immovably
adhering to his views on evolution through many years and under the
direct and raking fire of harsh and unrelenting criticism and ridicule
from friend and foe affords a striking contrast to the moral timidity
shown by buffon when questioned by the sorbonne we can see that lamarck
was the stuff martyrs are made of and that had he been tried for heresy
he would have been another tycho brahe
soon after de lamarck was nominated to a lieutenancy but so glorious a
beginning of his military career was most unexpectedly checked a sudden
accident forced him to leave the service and entirely change his course
of life his regiment had been during peace sent into garrison first
at toulon and then at monaco while there a comrade in play lifted him
by the head this gave rise to an inflammation of the lymphatic glands
of the neck which not receiving the necessary attention on the spot
obliged him to go to paris for better treatment
  the united efforts says cuvier of several surgeons met with no
  better success and danger had become very imminent when our
  confrre the late m tenon with his usual sagacity recognized
  the trouble and put an end to it by a complicated operation of
  which m de lamarck preserved deep scars this treatment lasted for
  a year and during this time the extreme scantiness of his
  resources confined him to a solitary life when he had the leisure
  to devote himself to meditations

origin to the name of lamarck and says
the author of the history of barn considered the cradle of the race to
have been the freehold of marca parish of gou bassespyrnes a
branch of the family established in le magnoac changed its name of marca
to that of la marque it was m dossat who gave rise to this change by
addressing his letters to m de marca at the time when he was preceptor
of his nephew sometimes under the name of m marca sometimes
m la marqua or of m de la marca but more often still under that
of m de la marque with the object no doubt of making him a
frenchman dans la vue sans doute de le franciser vie du
cardinal dossat tome i p 319
to recall their origin the branch of magnoac today write their name
marquemarca if the marca of the historian belongs to barn the
lamarque of the naturalist an orthographic name in principle proceeds
from bigorre actually chosen dsigne by lamarcq pontacq or
lamarque prs barn that the lamarque of the botanist of the royal
cabinet distinguished himself from all the lamarques of barn or of
bigorre which it bears quil gise to this day in the

botanist lamarck la marck delamarque de lamarck who shall
determine their number as to the last i only explain it by a fantasy
of the man who would debigorrize himself in order to germanize himself
in the hope apparently that at the first utterance of the name people
would believe that he was from the outre rhin rather than from the
borders of gave or of adour consequently a hundred times more learned
and a hundred times more worthy of a professorship in the museum where
monet would seem entrevait much less than lamarque
it may be added that barn was an ancient province of southern france
nearly corresponding to the present department of bassespyrnes its
capital was pau
8 we have been unable to ascertain the date when young lamarck entered
the seminary on making inquiries in june 1899 at the jesuits
seminary in amiens one of the faculty after consultation with the
father superior kindly gave us in writing the following information as
to the exact date the registers of the great seminary were carried
away during the french revolution and we do not know whither they have
been transported and whether they still exist today besides it is
very doubtful whether lamarck resided here because only ecclesiastics
preparing for receiving orders were received in the seminary do you not
confound the seminary with the ancient college of rue poste de paris
college now destroyed

chapter ii
student life and botanical career
the profession of arms had not led lamarck to forget the principles of
physical science which he had received at college during his sojourn at
monaco the singular vegetation of that rocky country had attracted his
attention and chomels trait des plantes usuelles accidentally
falling into his hands had given him some smattering of botany
lodged at paris as he has himself said in a room much higher up than
he could have wished the clouds almost the only objects to be seen
from his windows interested him by their everchanging shapes and
inspired in him his first ideas of meteorology there were not wanting
other objects to excite interest in a mind which had always been
remarkably active and original he then realized to quote from his
biographer cuvier what voltaire said of condorcet that solid enduring
discoveries can shed a lustre quite different from that of a commander
of a company of infantry he resolved to study some profession this
last resolution was but little less courageous than the first reduced
to a pension pension alimentaire of only 400 francs a year he
attempted to study medicine and while waiting until he had the time to
give to the necessary studies he worked in the dreary office of a
bank
the meditations the thoughts and aspirations of a contemplative nature
like his in his hours of work or leisure in some degree consoled the
budding philosopher during this period of uncongenial labor and when he
did have an opportunity of communicating his ideas to his friends of
discussing them of defending them against objection the hardships of
his workaday life were for the time forgotten in his ardor for science
all the uncongenial experiences of his life as a bank clerk vanished
like many another rising genius in art literature or science his zeal
for knowledge and investigation in those days of grinding poverty fed
the fires of his genius and this was the light which throughout his
long povertystricken life shed a golden lustre on his toilsome
existence he did not then know that the great linn the father of the
science he was to illuminate and so greatly to expand also began life
in extreme poverty and eked out his scanty livelihood by mending over
again for his own use the castoff shoes of his fellowstudents
cuvier
bourguin10 tells us that lamarcks medical course lasted four years
and this period of severe studyfor he must have made it
suchevidently laid the best possible foundation that paris could then
afford for his after studies he seems however to have wavered in his
intentions of making medicine his life work for he possessed a decided
taste for music his eldest brother the chevalier de bazentin strongly
opposed and induced him to abandon this project though not without
difficulty
at about this time the two brothers lived in a quiet village11 near
paris and there for a year they studied together science and history
and now happened an event which proved to be the turning point or
rather gave a new and lasting impetus to lamarcks career and decided
his vocation in life in one of their walks they met the philosopher and
sentimentalist jean jacques rousseau we know little about lamarcks
acquaintance with this genius for all the details of his life both in
his early and later years are pitifully scanty lamarck however had
attended at the jardin du roi a botanical course and now having by
good fortune met rousseau he probably improved the acquaintance and
found by rousseau to be a congenial spirit he was soon invited to
accompany him in his herborizations
still more recently professor giard12 has unearthed from the works of
rousseau the following statement by him regarding species estce qu
proprement parler il nexisterait point despces dans la nature mais
seulement des individus13 in his discours sur lingalit parmi les
hommes is the following passage which shows as giard says that
rousseau perfectly understood the influence of the milieu and of wants
on the organism and this brilliant writer seems to have been the first
to suggest natural selection though only in the case of man when he
says that the weaker in sparta were eliminated in order that the
superior and stronger of the race might survive and be maintained
  accustomed from infancy to the severity of the weather and the
  rigors of the seasons trained to undergo fatigue and obliged to
  defend naked and without arms their life and their prey against
  ferocious beasts or to escape them by flight the men acquired an
  almost invariably robust temperament the infants bringing into the
  world the strong constitution of their fathers and strengthening
  themselves by the same kind of exercise as produced it have thus
  acquired all the vigor of which the human species is capable nature
  uses them precisely as did the law of sparta the children of her
  citizens she rendered strong and robust those with a good
  constitution and destroyed all the others our societies differ in
  this respect where the state in rendering the children burdensome
  to the father indirectly kills them before birth14
soon lamarck abandoned not only a military career but also music
medicine and the bank and devoted himself exclusively to science he
was now twentyfour years old and becoming a student of botany under
bernard de jussieu for ten years gave unremitting attention to this
science and especially to a study of the french flora
cuvier states that the flore franaise appeared after six months of
unremitting labor however this may be the results of over nine
preceding years of study gathered together written and printed within
the brief period of half a year was no hasty tour de force but a
wellmatured solid work which for many years remained a standard one
it brought him immediate fame it appeared at a fortunate epoch the
example of rousseau and the general enthusiasm he inspired had made the
study of flowers very popularune science  la mode as cuvier
sayseven among many ladies and in the world of fashion so that the
new work of lamarck though published in three octavo volumes had a
rapid success
the preface was written by daubenton15 buffon also took much interest
in the work opposing as it did the artificial system of linn for whom
he had for other reasons no great degree of affection he obtained the
privilege of having the work published at the royal printing office at
the expense of the government and the total proceeds of the sale of the
volumes were given to the author this elaborate work at once placed
young lamarck in the front rank of botanists and now the first and
greatest honor of his life came to him the young lieutenant
disappointed in a military advancement won his spurs in the field of
science a place in botany had become vacant at the academy of sciences
and m de lamarck having been presented in the second rank en seconde
ligne the ministry a thing almost unexampled caused him to be given
by the king in 1779 the preference over m descemet whose name was
presented before his in the first rank and who since then and during
a long life never could recover the place which he unjustly lost16
in a word the poor officer so neglected since the peace obtained at
one stroke the good fortune always very rare and especially so at that
time of being both the recipient of the favor of the court and of the
public17
illustration lamarck at the age of 35 years
the interest and affection felt for him by buffon were of advantage to
him in another way desiring to have his son whom he had planned to be
his successor as intendant of the royal garden and who had just
finished his studies enjoy the advantage of travel in foreign lands
buffon proposed to lamarck to go with him as a guide and friend and
not wishing him to appear as a mere teacher he procured for him in
1781 a commission as royal botanist charged with visiting the foreign
botanical gardens and museums and of placing them in communication with
those of paris his travels extended through portions of the years 1781
and 1782
according to his own statement18 in pursuit of this object he
collected not only rare and interesting plants which were wanting in the
royal garden but also minerals and other objects of natural history new
to the museum he went to holland germany hungary etc visiting
universities botanical gardens and museums of natural history he
examined the mines of the hartz in hanover of freyburg in saxony of
chemnitz and of cremnitz in hungary making there numerous observations
which he incorporated in his work on physics and sent collections of
ores minerals and seeds to paris he also made the acquaintance of the
botanists gleditsch at berlin jacquin at vienna and murray at
gttingen he obtained some idea of the magnificent establishments in
these countries devoted to botany and which he says ours do not
yet approach in spite of all that had been done for them during the
last thirty years19
on his return as he writes he devoted all his energies and time to
research and to carrying out his great enterprises in botany as he
stated indeed for the last ten years my works have obliged me to keep
in constant activity a great number of artists such as draughtsmen
engravers and printers20
but the favor of buffon powerful as his influence was21 together
with the aid of the minister did not avail to give lamarck a permanent
salaried position soon after his return from his travels however m
dangiviller the successor of buffon as intendant of the royal garden
who was related to lamarcks family created for him the position of
keeper of the herbarium of the royal garden with the paltry salary of
1000 francs
according to the same tat lamarck had now been attached to the royal
garden five years in 1789 he received as salary only 1000 livres or
francs in 1792 it was raised to the sum of 1800 livres

lamarcks share in the reorganization of the jardin des plantes and
museum of natural history
even in his humble position as keeper of the herbarium with its
pitiable compensation lamarck now an eminent botanist with a european
reputation was by no means appreciated or secure in his position he
was subjected to many worries and already married and with several
children suffered from a grinding poverty his friend and supporter
la billarderie was a courtier with much influence at the tuileries
but as intendant of the royal garden without the least claim to
scientific fitness for the position and in 1790 he was on the point of
discharging lamarck22 on the 20th of august the finance committee
reduced the expenses of the royal garden and cabinet and while raising
the salary of the professor of botany to make good the deficiency thus
ensuing suppressed the position of keeper of the herbarium filled by
lamarck lamarck on learning of this acted promptly and though in
this cavalier way stricken off from the rolls of the royal garden he
at once prepared printed and distributed among the members of the
national assembly an energetic claim for restoration to his office23
his defence formed two brochures in one he gave an account of his life
travels and works and in the other he showed that the place which he
filled was a pressing necessity and could not be conveniently or
usefully added to that of the professor of botany who was already
overworked
this manly and able plea in his own defence also comprised a broad
comprehensive plan for the organization and development of a great
national museum combining both vast collections and adequate means of
public instruction the paper briefly stated in courteous language
what he wished to say to public men in general animated with good
intentions but little versed in the study of the sciences and the
knowledge of their application it praised in fit terms the work of
the national assembly and gave without too much emphasis the
assurance of an entire devotion to the public business then in a very
clear and comprehensive way were given all the kinds of service which an
establishment like the royal garden should render to the sciences and
arts and especially to agriculture medicine commerce etc museums
galleries and botanical gardens public lectures and demonstrations in
the museum and school of botany an office for giving information the
distribution of seeds etcall the resources already so varied as
well as the facilities for work at the jardin passed successively in
review before the representatives of the country and the address ended
in a modest request to the assembly that its author be allowed a few
days to offer some observations regarding the future organization of
this great institution
the assembly adopting the wise views announced in the manifest which
had been presented by the officers of the jardin and cabinet sent the
address to the committee and gave a months time to the petitioners to
prepare and present a plan and regulations which should establish the
organization of their establishment24
it was in 1790 that the decisive step was taken by the officers of the
royal garden25 and cabinet of natural history which led to the
organization of the present museum of natural history as it is today
throughout the proceedings lamarck as at the outset took a prominent
part his address having led the assembly to invite the officers of the
double establishment to draw up rules for its government
the officers met together august 23d and their distrust and hostility
against the intendant were shown by their nomination of daubenton the
nestor of the french savants to the presidency although
la billarderie as representing the royal authority was present at the
meeting at the second meeting august 24th he took no part in the
proceedings and absented himself from the third held on august 27
1790 it will be seen that even while the office of intendant lasted
that official took no active part in the meetings or in the work of the
institution and from that day to this it has been solely under the
management of a director and scientific corps of professors all of them
original investigators as well as teachers certainly the most practical
and efficient sort of organization for such an establishment26
lamarck though holding a place subordinate to the other officers was
present as the records of the proceedings of the officers of the jardin
des plantes at this meeting show
during the middle of 1791 the intendant la billarderie after four
years of incapacity placed his resignation in the hands of the king
the minister of the interior instead of nominating daubenton as
intendant reserved the place for a protg and july 1 1791 sent
in the name of jacqueshenri bernardin de saintpierre the
distinguished author of paul et virginie and of tudes sur la
nature the new intendant was literary in his tastes fond of nature
but not a practical naturalist m hamy wittily states that bernardin
saintpierre contemplated and dreamed and in his solitary meditations
had imagined a system of the world which had nothing in common with that
which was to be seen in the faubourg saint victor and one can readily
imagine the welcome that the officers of the jardin gave to the singular
naturalist the tuileries had sent them27
lamarck suffered an indignity from the intermeddling of this second
intendant of the jardin in his budget of expenses28 sent to the
minister of the interior bernardin de saintpierre took occasion to
refer to lamarck in a disingenuous and blundering way which may have
both amused and disgusted him
but the last days of the jardin du roi were drawing to a close and a
new era in french natural science signalized by the reorganization of
the jardin and cabinet under the name of the musum dhistoire
naturelle was dawning on the 6th of february 1793 the national
convention at the request of lakanal29 ordered the committees of
public instruction and of finances to at once make a report on the new
organization of the administration of the jardin des plantes
lakanal consulted with daubenton and inquired into the condition and
needs of the establishment daubenton placed in his hands the brochure
of 1790 written by lamarck the next day lakanal after a short
conference with his colleagues of the committee of public instruction
read in the tribune a short report and a decree which the committee
adopted without discussion
their minds were elsewhere for grave news had come in from all
quarters the austrians were bombarding valenciennes the prussians had
invested mayence the spanish were menacing perpignan and bands of
vendeans had seized saumur after a bloody battle while at caen at
evreux at bordeaux at marseilles and elsewhere muttered the thunders
of the outbreaks provoked by the proscription of the girondins so that
under these alarming conditions the decree of the 10th of june in
spite of its importance to science and higher learning in france was
passed without discussion
in his lamarck de mortillet states explicitly that lamarck in his
address of 1790 changed the name of the jardin du roi to jardin des
plantes30 as the article states entirely devoted to his studies
lamarck entered into no intrigue under the falling monarchy so he
always remained in a position straitened and inferior to his merits it
was owing to this and his retired mode of life that the singleminded
student of nature was not disturbed in his studies and meditations by
the revolution and when the name of the jardin du roi threatened to be
fatal to this establishment it was he who presented a memoir to
transform it under the name of jardin des plantes into an institution
of higher instruction with six professors in 1793 lakanal adopted
lamarcks plan and enlarging upon it created twelve chairs for the
teaching of the natural sciences
bourguin thus puts the matter
  in june 1793 lakanal having learned that the vandals that is
  his expression had demanded of the tribune of the convention the
  suppression of the royal garden as being an annex of the kings
  palace recurred to the memoirs of lamarck presented in 1790 and
  gave his plan of organization he inspired himself with lamarcks
  ideas but enlarged upon them instead of six positions of
  professorsadministrative which lamarck asked for lakanal
  established twelve chairs for the teaching of different branches of
  natural science31

lamarck saying that lamarcks work peut tre utile mais nest pas
absolutement ncessaire the intendant as hamy adds knew well the
value of the services rendered by lamarck at the royal garden and that
as a partial recompense he had been appointed botanist to the museum
he also equally well knew that the author of the flore franaise was
in a most precarious situation and supported on his paltry salary a
family of seven persons as he was already at this time married and had
five children but his own place was in peril and he did not hesitate
to sacrifice the poor savant whom he had himself installed as keeper of

of knowledge of botany his time was not entirely occupied that for two
months he had written him in regard to the duties of his position

29 joseph lakanal was born in 1762 and died in 1845 he was a
professor of philosophy in a college of the oratory and doctor of the
faculty at angers when in 1792 he was sent as a representative
dput to the national convention and being versed in educational
questions he was placed on the committee of public instruction and
elected its president he was the means as hamy states of saving from
a lamentable destruction by rejuvenizing them the scientific
institutions of ancient france during the revolution he voted for the
death of louis xvi
lakanal also presented a plan of organization of a national institute
what is now the institut de france and was charged with designating the
first fortyeight members who should elect all the others he was by
the first fortyeight thus elected proscribed as a regicide at the
second restoration he sailed for the united states where he was warmly
welcomed by jefferson the united states congress voted him five hundred
acres of land the government of louisiana offered him the presidency of
its university which however he did not accept in 1825 he went to
live on the shores of mobile bay on land which he purchased from the
proceeds of the sale of the land given him by congress here he became a
pioneer and planter
in 1830 he manifested a desire to return to his native country and
offered his services to the new government but received no answer and
was completely ignored but two years later thanks to the initiative of
geoffroy st hilaire who was the means of his relection to the french
academy he decided to return and did so in 1837 he lived in

went farther than lakanal he had insisted on the necessity of the
appointment of four demonstrators for zology in the decree of june 10
1793 they were even reduced to two afterwards they saw that this
number was insufficient and today 1863 the department of zology is
administered at the museum by four professors in conformity with the
division indicated by lamarck
chapter iv
professor of invertebrate zology at the museum
lamarcks career as a botanist comprised about twentyfive years we now
come to the third stage of his lifelamarck the zologist and
evolutionist he was in his fiftieth year when he assumed the duties of
his professorship of the zology of the invertebrate animals and at a
period when many men desire rest and freedom from responsibility with
the vigor of an intellectual giant lamarck took upon his shoulders new
labors in an untrodden field both in pure science and philosophic
thought
it was now the summer of 1793 and on the eve of the reign of terror
when paris from early in october until the end of the year was in the
deadliest throes of revolution the dull thud of the guillotine placed
in front of the tuileries in the place de la revolution which is now
the place de la concorde a little to the east of where the obelisk of
luxor now stands could almost be heard by the quiet workers in the
museum for sansculottism in its most aggressive and hideous forms raged
not far from the jardin des plantes then just on the border of the
densest part of the paris of the first revolution lavoisier the
founder of modern chemistry was guillotined some months later the abb
hay the founder of crystallography had been the year previous
rescued from prison by young geoffroy st hilaire his neck being barely
saved from the gleaming axe roland the friend of science and letters
had been so hunted down that at rouen in a moment of despair on
hearing of his wifes death he thrust his swordcane through his heart
madame roland had been beheaded as also a cousin of her husband and we
can well imagine that these fateful summer and autumn days were scarcely
favorable to scientific enterprises32 still however amid the loud
alarums of this social tempest the museum underwent a new birth which
proved not to be untimely the minister of the interior garat invited
the professors of the museum to constitute an assembly to nominate a
director and a treasurer and he begged them to present extracts of
their deliberations for him to send to the executive council under the
supervision of which the national museum is for the future placed
though in general the assembly only reported to the minister matters
relating to the expenses the first annual grant of the museum being
100000 livres
four days after june 14th the assembly met and adopted the name of the
establishment in the following terms musum dhistoire naturelle
dcrt par la convention nationale le 10 juin 1793 and at a meeting
held on the 9th of july the assembly definitely organized the first
bureau with daubenton as director thouin treasurer and desfontaines
secretary lamarck as the records show was present at all these
meetings and at the first one june 14th lamarck and fourcroy were
designated as commissioners for the formation of the museum library
all this was done without the aid or presence of bernardin
de saintpierre the intendant the minister of the interior meanwhile
had communicated to him the decision of the national convention and
invited him to continue his duties up to the moment when the new
organization should be established after remaining in his office until
july 9th he retired from the museum august 7th following and finally
withdrew to the country at essones
the organization of the museum is the same now as in 1793 having for
over a century been the chief biological centre of france and with its
magnificent collections was never more useful in the advancement of
science than at this moment
let us now look at the composition of the assembly of professors which
formed the board of administration of the museum at the time of his
appointment
the associates of lamarck and geoffroy st hilaire who had already been
connected with the royal garden and cabinet were daubenton thouin
desfontaines portal and mertrude the nestor of the faculty was
daubenton who was born in 1716 he was the collaborator of buffon in
the first part of his histoire naturelle and the author of treatises
on the mammals and of papers on the bats and other mammals also on
reptiles together with embryological and anatomical essays thouin the
professor of horticulture was the veteran gardener and architect of the
jardin des plantes and withal a most useful man he was affable
modest genial greatly beloved by his students a man of high
character and possessing much executive ability a street near the
jardin was named after him he was succeeded by bosc desfontaines
had the chair of botany but his attainments as a botanist were
mediocre and his lectures were said to have been tame and
uninteresting portal taught human anatomy while mertrude lectured on
vertebrate anatomy his chair was filled by cuvier in 1795
of this group lamarck was facile princeps as he combined great
sagacity and experience as a systematist with rare intellectual and
philosophic traits for this reason his fame has perhaps outlasted that
of his young contemporary geoffroy st hilaire
the necessities of the museum led to the division of the chair of
zology botany being taught by desfontaines and now began a new
era in the life of lamarck after twentyfive years spent in botanical
research he was compelled as there seemed nothing else for him to
undertake to assume charge of the collection of invertebrate animals
and to him was assigned that enormous chaotic mass of forms then known
as molluscs insects worms and microscopic animals had he continued
to teach botany we might never have had the lamarck of biology and
biological philosophy but turned adrift in a world almost unexplored
he faced the task with his oldtime bravery and dogged persistence and
at once showed the skill of a master mind in systematic work
the two new professorships in zology were filled one by lamarck
previously known as a botanist and the other by the young tienne
geoffroy st hilaire then twentytwo years old who was at that time a
student of hay and in charge of the minerals besides teaching
mineralogy with especial reference to crystallography
to geoffroy was assigned the four classes of vertebrates but in reality
he only occupied himself with the mammals and birds afterwards
lacpde33 took charge of the reptiles and fishes on the other hand
lamarcks field comprised more than ninetenths of the animal kingdom
already the collections of insects crustacea worms molluscs
echinoderms corals etc at the museum were enormous at this time
france began to send out those exploring expeditions to all parts of the
globe which were so numerous and fruitful during the first third of the
nineteenth century the task of arranging and classifying singlehanded
this enormous mass of material was enough to make a young man quail and
it is a proof of the vigor innate ability and breadth of view of the
man that in this pioneer work he not only reduced to some order this
vast horde of forms but showed such insight and brought about such
radical reforms in zological classification especially in the
foundation and limitation of certain classes an insight no one before
him had evinced to him and to latreille much of the value of the rgne
animal of cuvier as regards invertebrate classes is due
the exact title of the chair held by lamarck is given in the tat of
persons attached to the national museum of natural history at the date
of the 1er messidor an ii of the republic 1794 where he is
mentioned as follows lamarckfifty years old married for the second
time wife enceinte six children professor of zology of insects
of worms and microscopic animals his salary like that of the other
professors was put at 2868 livres 6 sous 8 deniers34
tienne geoffroy st hilaire35 has related how the professorship was
given to lamarck
  the law of 1793 had prescribed that all parts of the natural
  sciences should be equally taught the insects shells and an
  infinity of organismsa portion of creation still almost
  unknownremained to be treated in such a course a desire to comply
  with the wishes of his colleagues members of the administration
  and without doubt also the consciousness of his powers as an
  investigator determined m de lamarck this task so great and
  which would tend to lead him into numberless researches this
  friendless unthankful task he acceptedcourageous resolution
  which has resulted in giving us immense undertakings and great and
  important works among which posterity will distinguish and honor
  forever the work which entirely finished and collected into seven
  volumes is known under the name of animaux sans vertbres
before his appointment to this chair lamarck had devoted considerable
attention to the study of conchology and already possessed a rather
large collection of shells his last botanical paper appeared in 1800
but practically his botanical studies were over by 1793
during the early years of the revolution namely from 1789 to and
including 1791 lamarck published nothing whether this was naturally
due to the social convulsions and turmoil which raged around the jardin
des plantes or to other causes is not known in 1792 however lamarck
and his friends and colleagues bruguire olivier and the abb hay
founded the journal dhistoire naturelle which contains nineteen
botanical articles two on shells besides one on physics by lamarck
these with many articles by other men of science illustrated by
plates indicate that during the years of social unrest and upheaval in
paris and though france was also engaged in foreign wars the
philosophers preserved in some degree at least the traditional calm of
their profession and passed their days and nights in absorption in
matters biological and physical in 1801 appeared his systme des
animaux sans vertbres preceded by the opening discourse of his
lectures on the lower animals in which his views on the origin of
species were first propounded during the years 17931798 or for a
period of six years he published nothing on zology and during this
time only one paper appeared in 1798 on the influence of the moon on
the earths atmosphere but as his memoirs on fire and on sound were
published in 1798 it is evident that his leisure hours during this
period when not engaged in museum work and the preparation of his
lectures were devoted to meditations on physical and meteorological
subjects and most probably it was towards the end of this period that
he brooded over and conceived his views on organic evolution
it appears that he was led in the first place to conchological studies
through his warm friendship for a fellow naturalist and this is one of
many proofs of his affectionate generous nature the touching story is
told by tienne geoffroy st hilaire36
  it was impossible to assign him a professorship of botany m de
  lamarck then fortynine years old accepted this change in his
  scientific studies to take charge of that which everybody had
  neglected because it was indeed a heavy load this branch of
  natural history where with so varied relations everything was to
  be created on one group he was a little prepared but it was by
  accident a selfsacrifice to friendship was the cause for it was
  both to please his friend bruguire as well as to penetrate more
  deeply into the affections of this very reserved naturalist and
  also to converse with him in the only language which he wished to
  hear which was restricted to conversations on shells that m de
  lamarck had made some conchological studies oh how in 1793 did
  he regret that his friend had gone to persia he had wished he had
  planned that he should take the professorship which it was proposed
  to create he would at least supply his place it was in answer to
  the yearnings of his soul and this affectionate impulse became a
  fundamental element in the nature of one of the greatest of
  zological geniuses of our epoch
once settled in his new line of work lamarck the incipient zologist
at a period in life when many students of less flexible and energetic
natures become either hidebound and conservative averse to taking up a
different course of study or actually cease all work and rust
outafter a half century of his life had passed this rare spirit
burning with enthusiasm charged like some oldtime knight or explorer
into a new realm and into fresh fields and pastures new his spirit
still young and fresh after nearly thirty years of mental toil so
unrequited in material things felt a new stimulus as he began to
investigate the lower animals so promising a field for discovery
he said himself
  that which is the more singular is that the most important
  phenomena to be considered have been offered to our meditations only
  since the time when attention has been paid to the animals least
  perfect and when researches on the different complications of the
  organization of these animals have become the principal foundation
  of their study it is not less singular to realize that it was
  almost always from the examination of the smallest objects which
  nature presents to us and that of considerations which seem to us
  the most minute that we have obtained the most important knowledge
  to enable us to arrive at the discovery of her laws and to
  determine her course
after a year of preparation he opened his course at the museum in the
spring of 1794 in his introductory lecture given in 1803 after ten
years of work on the lower animals he addressed his class in these
words
  indeed it is among those animals which are the most multiplied and
  numerous in nature and the most ready to regenerate themselves
  that we should seek the most instructive facts bearing on the course
  of nature and on the means she has employed in the creation of her
  innumerable productions in this case we perceive that relatively
  to the animal kingdom we should chiefly devote our attention to the
  invertebrate animals because their enormous multiplicity in nature
  the singular diversity of their systems of organization and of their
  means of multiplication their increasing simplification and the
  extreme fugacity of those which compose the lowest orders of these
  animals show us much better than the higher animals the true
  course of nature and the means which she has used and which she
  still unceasingly employs to give existence to all the living bodies
  of which we have knowledge
during this decade 17931803 and the one succeeding lamarcks mind
grew and expanded before 1801 however much he may have brooded over
the matter we have no utterances in print on the transformation theory
his studies on the lower animals and his general knowledge of the
vertebrates derived from the work of his contemporaries and his
observations in the museum and menagerie gave him a broad grasp of the
entire animal kingdom such as no one before him had as the result his
comprehensive mind with its powers of rapid generalization enabled him
to appreciate the series from monad his bauche to man the range of
forms from the simple to the complex even though not a comparative
anatomist like cuvier he made use of the latters discoveries and
could understand and appreciate the gradually increasing complexity of
forms and unlike cuvier realize that they were blood relations and
not separate piecemeal creations animal life so immeasurably higher
than vegetable forms with its highly complex physiological functions
and varied means of reproduction and the relations of its forms to each
other and to the world around affords facts for evolution which were
novel to lamarck the descriptive botanist

illustration maison de buffon in which lamarck lived in paris
17931829
in accordance with the rules of the museum which required that all the
professors should be lodged within the limits of the jardin the choice
of lodgings being given to the oldest professors lamarck at the time
of his appointment took up his abode in the house now known as the
maison de buffon situated on the opposite side of the jardin des
plantes from the house afterwards inhabited by cuvier and in the angle
between the galerie de zoologie and the museum library37 with little
doubt the windows of his study where his earlier addresses the
recherches sur lorganisation des corps vivans and the philosophie
zoologique were probably written looked out upon what is now the
court on the westerly side of the house that facing the rue geoffroy
st hilaire
at the time of his entering on his duties as professor of zology
lamarck was in his fiftieth year he had married twice and was the
father of six children and without fortune he married for a third and
afterwards for a fourth time and in all seven children were born to
him as in the year 1794 the minute referring to his request for an
indemnity states il est charg de sept enfans dont un est sur les
vaisseaux de la rpublique another son was an artist as shown by the
records of the assembly of the museum for september 23 1814 when he
asked for a chamber in the lodgings of thouin for the use of his son
peintre
geoffroy st hilaire in 1829 spoke of one of his sons m auguste de
lamarck as a skilful and highly esteemed engineer of pontsetchausses
then advantageously situated
but man cannot live by scientific researches and philosophic meditations
alone the history of lamarcks life is painful from beginning to end
with his large family and slender salary he was never free from carking
cares and want on the 30 fructidor an ii of the republic the
national convention voted the sum of 300000 livres with which an
indemnity was to be paid to citizens eminent in literature and art
lamarck had sacrificed much time and doubtless some money in the
preparation and publication of his works and he felt that he had a just
claim to be placed on the list of those who had been useful to the
republic and at the same time could give proof of their good
citizenship and of their right to receive such indemnity or
appropriation
accordingly in 1795 he sent in a letter which possesses much
autobiographical interest to the committee of public instruction in
which he says
  during the twentysix years that he has lived in paris the citizen
  lamarck has unceasingly devoted himself to the study of natural
  history and particularly botany he has done it successfully for
  it is fifteen years since he published under the title of flore
  franaise the history and description of the plants of france with
  the mention of their properties and of their usefulness in the arts
  a work printed at the expense of the government well received by
  the public and which now is much sought after and very rare he
  then describes his second great botanical undertaking the
  encyclopdia and illustration of genera with nine hundred plates
  he states that for ten years past he has kept busy a great number
  of parisian artists three printing presses for different works
  besides delivering a course of lectures
the petition was granted at about this period a pension of twelve
hundred francs from the academy of sciences and which had increased to
three thousand francs had ceased eighteen months previously to be paid
to him but at the time an ii lamarck was charg de sept enfans
and this appropriation was a most welcome addition to his small salary
the next year an iii he again applied for a similar allowance from
the funds providing an indemnity for men of letters and artists whose
talents are useful to the republic again referring to the flore
franaise and his desire to prepare a second edition of it and his
other works and travels in the interest of botanical science he says
  if i had been less overburdened by needs of all kinds for some
  years and especially since the suppression of my pension from the
  aforesaid academy of sciences i should prepare the second edition
  of this useful work and this would be without doubt indeed the
  opportunity of making a new present to my country
  since my return to france i have worked on the completion of my
  great botanical enterprises and indeed for about ten years past my
  works have obliged me to keep in constant activity a great number of
  artists such as draughtsmen engravers and printers but these
  important works that i have begun and have in a welladvanced
  state have been in spite of all my efforts suspended and
  practically abandoned for the last ten years the loss of my pension
  from the academy of sciences and the enormous increase in the price
  of articles of subsistence have placed me with my numerous family
  in a state of distress which leaves me neither the time nor the
  freedom from care to cultivate science in a fruitful way
lamarcks collection of shells the accumulation of nearly thirty
years38 was purchased by the government at the price of five thousand
livres this sum was used by him to balance the price of a national
estate for which he had contracted by virtue of the law of 28 ventse de
lan iv39 this little estate which was the old domain of beauregard
was a modest farmhouse or countryhouse at hricourtsaintsamson in
the department of seineetoise not far to the northward of beauvais
and about fifty miles from paris it is probable that as a proprietor of
a landed property he passed the summer season or a part of it on this
estate
this request was we may believe made from no unworthy or mercenary
motive but because he thought that such an indemnity was his due some
years after in 1809 the chair of zology newly formed by the facult
des sciences in paris was offered to him desirable as the salary would
have been in his straitened circumstances he modestly refused the
offer because he felt unable at that time of life he was however but
sixtyfive years of age to make the studies required worthily to occupy
the position
one of lamarcks projects which he was never able to carry out for it
was even then quite beyond the powers of any man singlehanded to
undertake was his systme de la nature we will let him describe it
in his own words especially since the account is somewhat
autobiographical it is the second memoir he addressed to the committee
of public instruction of the national convention dated 4 vendmiaire
lan iii 1795
  in my first memoir i have given you an account of the works which i
  have published and of those which i have undertaken to contribute to
  the progress of natural history also of the travels and researches
  which i have made
  but for a long time i have had in view a very important
  workperhaps better adapted for education in france than those i
  have already composed or undertakena work in short which the
  national convention should without doubt order and of which no part
  could be written so advantageously as in paris where are to be
  found abundant means for carrying it to completion
  this is a systme de la nature a work analogous to the systema
  natur of linnus but written in french and presenting the
  picture complete concise and methodical of all the natural
  productions observed up to this day this important work of
  linnus which the young frenchmen who intend to devote themselves
  to the study of natural history always require is the object of
  speculations by foreign authors and has already passed through
  thirteen different editions moreover their works which to our
  shame we have to use because we have none written expressly for
  us are filled especially the last edition edited by gmelin with
  gross mistakes omissions of double and triple occurrence and
  errors in synonymy and present many generic characters which are
  inexact or imperceptible and many series badly divided or genera
  too numerous in species and difficulties insurmountable to
  students
  if the committee of public instruction had the time to devote any
  attention to the importance of my project to the utility of
  publishing such a work and perhaps to the duty prescribed by the
  national honor i would say to it that after having for a long time
  reflected and meditated and determined upon the most feasible plan
  finally after having seen amassed and prepared the most essential
  materials i offer to put this beautiful project into execution i
  have not lost sight of the difficulties of this great enterprise i
  am i believe as well aware of them and better than any one else
  but i feel that i can overcome them without descending to a simple
  and dishonorable compilation of what foreigners have written on the
  subject i have some strength left to sacrifice for the common
  advantage i have had some experience and practice in writing works
  of this kind my herbarium is one of the richest in existence my
  numerous collection of shells is almost the only one in france the
  specimens of which are determined and named according to the method
  adopted by modern naturalistsfinally i am in a position to profit
  by all the aid which is to be found in the national museum of
  natural history with these means brought together i can then hope
  to prepare in a suitable manner this interesting work
  i had at first thought that the work should be executed by a
  society of naturalists but after having given this idea much
  thought and having already the example of the new encyclopdia i
  am convinced that in such a case the work would be very defective in
  arrangement without unity or plan without any harmony of
  principles and that its composition might be interminable
  written with the greatest possible conciseness this work could not
  be comprised in less than eight volumes in 8vo namely one volume
  for the quadrupeds and birds one volume for the reptiles and
  fishes two volumes for the insects one volume for the worms the
  molluscs madrepores lithophytes and naked worms two volumes for
  the plants one volume for the minerals eight volumes in all
  it is impossible to prepare in france a work of this nature without
  having special aid from the nation because the expense of printing
  on account of the enormous quantity of citations and figures which
  it would contain would be such that any arrangement with the
  printer or the manager of the edition could not remunerate the
  author for writing such an immense work
  if the nation should wish to print the work at its own expense and
  then give to the author the profits of the sale of this edition
  the author would be very much pleased and would doubtless not
  expect any further aid but it would cost the nation a great deal
  and i believe that this useful project could be carried through with
  greater economy
  indeed if the nation will give me twenty thousand francs in a
  single payment i will take the whole responsibility and i agree
  if i live that before the expiration of seven years the systme de
  la nature in french with the complemental addition the
  corrections and the convenient explanations shall be at the
  disposition of all those who love or study natural history

32 most men of science of the revolution like monge and others were
advanced republicans and the chevalier lamarck though of noble birth
was perhaps not without sympathy with the ideas which led to the
establishment of the republic it is possible that in his walks and
intercourse with rousseau he may have been inspired with the new notions
of liberty and equality first promulgated by that philosopher
his studies and meditations were probably not interrupted by the events
of the terror stevens in his history of the french revolution tells
us that paris was never gayer than in the summer of 1793 and that
during the reign of terror the restaurants cafs and theatres were
always full there were never more theatres open at the same period than
then though no single great play or opera was produced meanwhile the
great painter david at this time built up a school of art and made that
city a centre for art students indeed the revolution was a grand time
for enthusiastic young men while people in general lived their
ordinary lives there is little doubt then that the savants except
the few who were occupied by their duties as members of the convention
nationale worked away quietly at their specialties each in his own

37 a few years ago when we formed the plan of writing his life we
wrote to friends in paris for information as to the exact house in which
lamarck lived and received the answer that it was unknown another
proof of the neglect and forgetfulness that had followed lamarck so many
years after his death and which was even manifested before he died
afterwards professor giard kindly wrote that by reference to the procs
verbaux of the assembly it had been found by professor hamy that he
had lived in the house of buffon
the house is situated at the corner of rue de buffon and rue geoffroy
st hilaire the courtyard facing rue geoffroy st hilaire bears the
number 2 rue de buffon and is in the angle between the galerie de
zoologie and the bibliothque the edifice is a large fourstoried one
lamarck occupied the second tage what we should call the third
story it was first occupied by buffon his bedroom where he died was
on the premier tage it was tenanted by de quatrefages in his time
and is at present occupied by professor g t hamy professor l
vaillant living in the first tage or second story and dr j
deniker the bibliothcaire and learned anthropologist in the third
the second tage was about fifty years ago 184050 renovated for
the use of fremy the chemist so that the exact room occupied by lamarck
as a study cannot be identified
this ancient house was originally called la croix de fer and was
built about two centuries before the foundation of the jardin du roi it
appears from an inspection of the notes on the titles and copies of the
original deeds preserved in the archives and kindly shown me by
professor g t hamy the archivist of the museum that this house was
erected in 1468 the deed being dated 1xbre 1468 the house is
referred to as maison ditte la croix de fer in deeds of 1684 1755
and 1768 it was sold by charles roger to m le compte de buffon
march 23 1771 one of the old gardens overlooked by it was called de
jardin de la croix it was originally the first structure erected on
the south side of the jardin du roi
38 in the avertissement to his systme des animaux sans vertbres
1801 after stating that he had at his disposition the magnificent
collection of invertebrate animals of the museum he refers to his
private collection as follows et une autre assez riche que jai forme
moimme par prs de trente annes de recherches p vii afterwards he
formed another collection of shells named according to his system and
containing a part of the types described in his histoire naturelle des
animaux sans vertbres and in his minor articles this collection the
government did not acquire and it is now in the museum at geneva the
paris museum however possesses a good many of the lamarckian types
which are on exhibition perrier l c p 20

last days and death
lamarcks life was saddened and embittered by the loss of four wives
and the pangs of losing three of his children40 also by the rigid
economy he had to practise and the unending poverty of his whole
existence a very heavy blow to him and to science was the loss at an
advanced age of his eyesight
it was apparently not a sudden attack of blindness for we have hints
that at times he had to call in latreille and others to aid him in the
study of the insects the continuous use of the magnifying lens and the
microscope probably was the cause of enfeebled eyesight resulting in
complete loss of vision duval41 states that he passed the last ten
years of his life in darkness that his loss of sight gradually came on
until he became completely blind
in the reports of the meetings of the board of professors there is but
one reference to his blindness previous to this we find that at his
last appearance at these sessionsie april 19 1825since his
condition did not permit him to give his course of lectures he had
asked m latreille to fill his place but such was the latters health
he proposed that m audouin sublibrarian of the french institute
should lecture in his stead on the invertebrate animals this was
agreed to
the next reference and the only explicit one is that in the records
for may 23 1826 as follows vu la ccit dont m de lamarck est
frapp m bosc42 continuera dexercer sur les parties confiert 
m audouin la surveillance attribue au professeur
but according to duval long before this he had been unable to use his
eyes in his systme analytique des connaissances positives de
lhomme published in 1820 he refers to the sudden loss of his
eyesight
even in advanced life lamarck seems not to have suffered from
illhealth despite the fact that he apparently during the last thirty
years of his life lived in a very secluded way whether he went out into
the world to the theatre or even went away from paris and the museum
into the country in his later years is a matter of doubt it is said
that he was fond of novels his daughters reading to him those of the
best french authors after looking with some care through the records of
the sessions of the assembly of professors we are struck with the
evidences of his devotion to routine museum work and to his courses of
lectures
at that time the museum sent out to the coles centrales of the
different departments of france named collections made up from the
duplicates and in this sort of drudgery lamarck took an active part he
also took a prominent share in the business of the museum in the
exchange and in the purchase of specimens and collections in his
department and even in the management of the menagerie thus he
reported on the dentition of the young lions one dying from teething
on the illness and recovery of one of the elephants on the generations
of goats and kids in the park also on a smallsized bull born of a
small cow covered by a scottish bull the young animal having as he
states all the characters of the original
for one year 1794 he was secretary of the board of professors of the
museum43 the records of the meetings from 4 vendmiaire lan iii
until 4 vendmiaire lan iv are each written in his bold legible
handwriting or signed by him he signed his name lamarck this period
being that of the first republic afterwards in the records his name
is written de lamarck he was succeeded by  geoffroy st hilaire
who signed himself plain geoffroy
in 1802 he acted as treasurer of the assembly and again for a period of
six years until and including 1811 when he resigned the reason given
being il soccupe depuis six ans et que ses travaux et son age lui
rendent penibles
lamarck was extremely regular in his attendance at these meetings from
1793 until 1818 he rarely if ever missed a meeting we have only
observed in the records of this long period the absence of his name on
two or three occasions from the list of those present during 1818 and
the following year it was his blindness which probably prevented his
regular attendance july 15 1818 he was present and presented the
fifth volume of his animaux sans vertbres and august 31 1819 he
was present44 and laid before the assembly the sixth volume of the
same great work
illustration portrait of lamarck when old and blind in the costume
of a member of the institute engraved in 1824
from the observations of the records we infer that lamarck never had
any long lingering illness or suffered from overwork though his life
had little sunshine or playtime in it he must have had a strong
constitution his only infirmity being the terrible one especially to
an observer of nature of total blindness
lamarcks greatest work in systematic zology would never have been
completed had it not been for the selfsacrificing spirit and devotion
of his eldest daughter
a part of the sixth and the whole of the last volume of the animaux
sans vertbres were presented to the assembly of professors
september 10 1822 this volume was dictated to and written out by one
of his daughters mlle cornelie de lamarck on her the aged savant
leaned during the last ten years of his lifethose years of failing
strength and of blindness finally becoming total the frail woman
accompanied him in his hours of exercise and when he was confined to
his house she never left him it is stated by cuvier in his eulogy
that at her first walk out of doors after the end came she was nearly
overcome by the fresh air to which she had become so unaccustomed she
indeed practically sacrificed her life to her father it is one of the
rarest and most striking instances of filial devotion known in the
annals of science or literature and is a noticeable contrast to the
daughters of the blind milton whose domestic life was rendered unhappy
by their undutifulness as they were impatient of the restraint and
labors his blindness had imposed upon them
besides this the seventh volume is a voluminous scientific work filled
with very dry special details making the labor of writing out from
dictation of corrections and preparation for the press most wearisome
and exhausting to say nothing of the corrections of the proofsheets a
task which probably fell to herwork enough to break down the health of
a strong man
it was a natural and becoming thing for the assembly of professors of
the museum in view of the malheureuse position de la famille to vote
to give her employment in the botanical laboratory in arranging and
pasting the dried plants with a salary of 1000 francs
of the last illness of lamarck and the nature of the sickness to which
he finally succumbed there is no account it is probable that
enfeebled by the weakness of extreme old age he gradually sank away
without suffering from any acute disease
the exact date of his death has been ascertained by dr mondire45
with the aid of m saintjoanny archiviste du dpartment de la seine
who made special search for the record the acte states that
december 28 1829 lamarck then a widower died in the jardin du roi
at the age of eightyfive years
the obsequies as stated in the moniteur universel of paris for
december 23 1829 were celebrated on the sunday previous in the church
of saintmdard his parish from the church the remains were borne to
the cemetery of montparnasse at the interment which took place
december 30 m latreille in the name of the academy of sciences and
m geoffroy st hilaire in the name and on behalf of his colleagues
the professors of the museum of natural history pronounced eulogies at
the grave the eulogy prepared by cuvier and published after his death
was read at a session of the academy of sciences by baron silvestre
november 26 1832
with the exception of these formalities the great french naturalist
the linn of france was buried as one forgotten and unknown we read
with astonishment in the account by dr a mondire who made zealous
inquiries for the exact site of the grave of lamarck that it is and
forever will be unknown it is a sad and discreditable and to us
inexplicable fact that his remains did not receive decent burial they
were not even deposited in a separate grave but were thrown into a
trench apparently situated apart from the other graves and from which
the bones of those thrown there were removed every five years they are
probably now in the catacombs of paris mingled with those of the
thousands of unknown or paupers in that great ossuary46
dr mondires account is as follows having found in the moniteur the
notice of the burial services as above stated he goes on to say
  armed with this document i went again to the cemetery of
  montparnasse where i fortunately found a conservator m lacave
  who is entirely au courant with the question of transformism he
  therefore interested himself in my inquiries and thanks to him i
  have been able to determine exactly where lamarck had been buried i
  say had been because alas he had been simply placed in a trench
  off on one side fosse  part that is to say one which should
  change its occupant at the end of five years was it negligence was
  it the jealousy of his colleagues was it the result of the troubles
  of 1830 in brief there had been no permission granted to purchase
  a burial lot the bones of lamarck are probably at this moment mixed
  with those of all the other unknown which lie there what had at
  first led us into an error is that we made the inquiries under the
  name of lamarck instead of that of de monnet in reality the
  register of inscription bears the following mention
  de monnet de lamarck buried this 20 december 1829 85 years 3d
  square 1st division 2d line trench 22
  at some period later a friendly hand without doubt had written
  on the margin of the register the following information
  to the left of m dassas
  m lacave kindly went with us to search for the place where lamarck
  had been interred and on the register we saw this
  dassas 1st division 4th line south no 6 to the west
  concession 11651829 on arriving at the spot designated we found
  some new graves but nothing to indicate that of m dassas our only
  mark by which we could trace the site after the changes wrought
  since 1829 after several ineffectual attempts i finally perceived
  a flat grave surrounded by an iron railing and covered with weeds
  its surface seemed to me very regular and i probed this lot there
  was a gravestone there the gravedigger who accompanied us cleared
  away the surface and i confess that it was with the greatest
  pleasure and with deep emotion that we read the name dassas
illustration position of the burial place of lamarck in the cemetery
of montparnasse
  we found the place but unfortunately as i have previously said
  the remains of lamarck are no longer there
mondire added to his letter a little plan p 59 which he drew on the
spot47
but the lifework of lamarck and his theory of organic evolution as
well as the lessons of his simple and noble character are more durable
and lasting than any monument of stone or brass his name will never be
forgotten either by his own countrymen or by the world of science and
philosophy after the lapse of nearly a hundred years and in this first
year of the twentieth century his views have taken root and flourished
with a surprising strength and vigor and his name is preminent among
the naturalists of his time
no monument exists in montparnasse but within the last decade though
the reparation has come tardily the bust of lamarck may be seen by
visitors to the jardin des plantes on the outer wall of the nouvelle
galerie containing the museums of comparative anatomy palontology
and anthropology
although the city of paris has not yet erected a monument to its
greatest naturalist some public recognition of his eminent services to
the city and nation was manifested when the municipal council of paris
on february 10 1875 gave the name lamarck to a street48 this is a
long and not unimportant street on the hill of montmartre in the xviiie
arrondissement and in the zone of the old stone or gypsum quarries
which existed before paris extended so far out in that direction and
from which were taken the fossil remains of the early tertiary mammals
described by cuvier
the city of toulouse has also honored itself by naming one of its
streets after lamarck this was due to the proposal of professor mile
cartailhac to the municipal council which voted to this effect may 12
1886
in the meetings of the assembly of professors no one took the trouble to
prepare and enter minutes however brief and formal relative to his
decease the death of lamarck is not even referred to in the
procsverbaux this is the more marked because there is an entry in
the same records for 1829 and about the same date of an extraordinary
sance held november 19 1829 when the assembly was convoked to
take measures regarding the death of professor vauquelin relative to the
choice of a candidate chevreul being elected to fill his chair
lamarcks chair was at his death divided and the two professorships
thus formed were given to latreille and de blainville
at the session of the assembly of professors held december 8 1829
geoffroy st hilaire sent in a letter to the assembly urging that the
department of invertebrate animals be divided into two and referred to
the bad state of preservation of the insects the force of assistants to
care for these being insufficient he also in his usual tactful way
referred to the complaisance extrme de la parte de m de lamarck in
1793 in assenting to the reunion in a single professorship of the mass
of animals then called insectes et vermes
the two successors of the chair held by lamarck were certainly not
dilatory in asking for appointments at a session of the professors held
december 22 1829 the first meeting after his death we find the
following entry m latreille crit pour exprimer son dsir dtre
prsent comme candidat  la chaire vacante par le dcs de m lamarck
et pour rappeler ses titres  cette place
m de blainville also wrote in the same manner dans le cas que la
chaire serait divise il demande la place de professeur de lhistoire
des animaux inarticuls dans le cas contraire il se prsente galement
comme candidat voulant tout en respectant les droits acquis ne pas
laisser dans loubli ceux qui lui appartiennent
january 12 1830 latreille49 was unanimously elected by the assembly
a candidate to the chair of entomology and at a following session
february 16th de blainville was unanimously elected a candidate for
the chair of molluscs vers et zoophytes and on the 16th of march the
royal ordinance confirming those elections was received by the assembly
there could have been no fitter appointments made for those two
positions lamarck had long known latreille and loved him as a son de
blainville honored and respected lamarck and fully appreciated his
commanding abilities as an observer and thinker

arrested but afterwards set free and placed first on the directory in
1795 in 1798 he sailed for charleston s c nominated successively
viceconsul at wilmington and consul at new york but not obtaining his
exequatur from president adams he went to live with the botanist
michaux in carolina in his botanical garden where he devoted himself to
natural history until the quarrel in 1800 between the united states and
france caused him to return to france on his return he sent north
american insects to his friends fabricius and olivier fishes to
lacpde birds to daudin reptiles to latreille not giving all his
time to public life he devoted himself to natural history

present and made a report relative to madrepores and molluscs in the
summer of 1821 he attended several of the meetings august 7 1821 he
was present and referred to the collection of shells of struthiolaria
he was present may 23d and june 9th when it was voted that he should
enjoy the garden of the house he occupied and that a chamber should be
added to his lodgings he was frequent in attendance this year
especially during the summer months he attended a few meetings at
intervals in 1822 1823 and only twice in 1824
at a meeting held april 19 1825 he was present and stating that his
condition did not permit him to lecture asked to have audouin take his

owing to a violent stormthe century cyclopedia of names
47 still hoping that the site of the grave might have been kept open
and desiring to satisfy myself as to whether there was possibly space
enough left on which to erect a modest monument to the memory of
lamarck i took with me the brochure containing the letter and plan of
dr mondire to the cemetery of montparnasse with the aid of one of the
officials i found what he told me was the site but the entire place was
densely covered with the tombs and gravestones of later interments
rendering the erection of a stone however small and simple quite out
of the question
48 the rue lamarck begins at the elevated square on which is situated
the church of the sacrcoeur now in process of erection and from this
point one obtains a commanding and very fine view overlooking the city
from there the street curves round to the westward ending in the avenue
de saintouen and continues as a wide and long thoroughfare ending to
the north of the cemetery of montmartre a neighboring street rue
becquerel is named after another french savant and parallel to it is a
short street named rue darwin
49 latreille was born at brives november 29 1762 and died
february 6 1833 he was the leading entomologist of his time and to
him cuvier was indebted for the arrangement of the insects in the rgne
animal his bust is to be seen on the same side of the nouvelle galerie
in the jardin des plantes as those of lamarck cuvier de blainville
and dorbigny his first paper was introduced by lamarck in 1792 in the
minutes of the session of 4 thermidor lan vi july 1798 we find
this entry the citizen lamarck announces that the citizen latreille
offered to the administration to work under the direction of that
professor in arranging the very numerous collection of insects of the
museum so as to place them under the eye of the public and here he
remained until his appointment several years 1825 before lamarcks
death he had asked to have latreille fill his place in giving
instruction
audouin 17971841 also an eminent entomologist and morphologist was
appointed aidenaturalisteadjoint in charge of mollusca crustacea
worms and zophytes he was afterwards associated with h milne edwards
in works on annelid worms december 26 1827 latreille asked to be
allowed to employ boisduval as a prparateur he became the author of
several works on injurious insects and lepidoptera
chapter vi
position in the history of science opinions of his contemporaries and
some later biologists
de blainville a worthy successor of lamarck in his posthumous book
cuvier et geoffroy sainthilaire pays the highest tribute to his
predecessor whose position as the leading naturalist of his time he
fully and gratefully acknowledges saying among the men whose lectures
i have had the advantage of hearing i truly recognize only three
masters m de lamarck m claude richard and m pinel p 43 he
also speaks of wishing to write the scientific biographies of cuvier and
de lamarck the two zologists of this epoch whose lectures he most
frequently attended and whose writings he studied and who have
exercised the greatest influence on the zology of our time p 42
likewise in the opening words of the preface he refers to the rank taken
by lamarck
  the aim which i have proposed to myself in my course on the
  principles of zology demonstrated by the history of its progress
  from aristotle to our time and consequently the plan which i have
  followed to attain this aim have very naturally led me so to
  speak in spite of myself to signalize in m de lamarck the
  expression of one of those phases through which the science of
  organization has to pass in order to arrive at its last term before
  showing its true aim from my point of view this phase does not seem
  to me to have been represented by any other naturalist of our time
  whatever may have been the reputation which he made during his
  life
he then refers to the estimation in which lamarck was held by auguste
comte who in his cours de philosophie positive has anticipated and
even surpassed himself in the high esteem he felt for the celebrated
author of the philosophie zoologique
the eulogy by cuvier which gives most fully the details of the early
life of lamarck and which has been the basis for all the subsequent
biographical sketches was unworthy of him lamarck had with his
customary selfabnegation and generosity aided and favored the young
cuvier in the beginning of his career50 who in his rgne animal
adopted the classes founded by lamarck thoroughly convinced of the
erroneous views of cuvier in regard to cataclysms he criticised and
opposed them in his writings in a courteous and proper way without
directly mentioning cuvier by name or entering into any public debate
with him
when the hour came for the great comparative anatomist and
palontologist from his exalted position to prepare a tribute to the
memory of a naturalist of equal merit and of a far more thoughtful and
profound spirit to be read before the french academy of sciences what
a eulogy it wasas de blainville exclaims et quel loge it was not
printed until after cuviers death and then it is stated portions
were omitted as not suitable for publication51 this is we believe
the only stain on cuviers life and it was unworthy of the great man
in this loge so different in tone from the many others which are
collected in the three volumes of cuviers eulogies he indiscriminately
ridicules all of lamarcks theories whatever may have been his
condemnation of lamarcks essays on physical and chemical subjects he
might have been more reserved and less dogmatic and sarcastic in his
estimate of what he supposed to be the value of lamarcks views on
evolution it was cuviers adverse criticisms and ridicule and his
antievolutional views which more than any other single cause retarded
the progress of biological science and the adoption of a working theory
of evolution for which the world had to wait half a century
it even appears that lamarck was in part instrumental in inducing cuvier
in 1795 to go to paris from normandy and become connected with the
museum de blainville relates that the abb tessier met the young
zologist at valmont near fcamp and wrote to geoffroy that he had
just discovered in normandy a pearl and invited him to do what he
could to induce cuvier to come to paris i made said geoffroy the
proposition to my confrres but i was supported and only feebly by
m de lamarck who slightly knew m cuvier as the author of a memoir on
entomology
the eulogy pronounced by geoffroy st hilaire over the remains of his
old friend and colleague was generous sympathetic and heartfelt
  yes he said in his eloquent way for us who knew m de lamarck
  whom his counsels have guided whom we have found always
  indefatigable devoted occupied so willingly with the most
  difficult labors we shall not fear to say that such a loss leaves
  in our ranks an immense void from the blessings of such a life so
  rich in instructive lessons so remarkable for the most generous
  selfabnegation it is difficult to choose
  a man of vigorous profound ideas and very often admirably
  generalized lamarck conceived them with a view to the public good
  if he met as often happened with great opposition he spoke of it
  as a condition imposed on every one who begins a reform moreover
  the great age the infirmities but especially the grievous
  blindness of m de lamarck had reserved for him another lot this
  great and strong mind could enjoy some consolation in knowing the
  judgment of posterity which for him began in his own lifetime when
  his last tedious days useless to science had arrived when he had
  ceased to be subjected to rivalry envy and passion became
  extinguished and justice alone remained de lamarck then heard
  impartial voices the anticipated echo of posterity which would
  judge him as history will judge him yes the scientific world has
  pronounced its judgment in giving him the name of the french
  linn thus linking together the two men who have both merited a
  triple crown by their works on general natural history zology and
  botany and whose names increasing in fame from age to age will
  both be handed down to the remotest posterity52
also in his tudes sur la vie les ouvrages et les doctrines de
buffon 1838 geoffroy again with much warmth of affection says
  attacked on all sides injured likewise by odious ridicule
  lamarck too indignant to answer these cutting epigrams submitted
  to the indignity with a sorrowful patience lamarck lived a long
  while poor blind and forsaken but not by me i shall ever love
  and venerate him53
the following evidently heartfelt and sincere tribute to his memory
showing warm esteem and thorough respect for lamarck and also a
confident feeling that his lasting fame was secure is to be found in an
obscure little book54 containing satirical humorous but perhaps not
always fair or just characterizations and squibs concerning the
professors and aidnaturalists of the jardin des plantes
  what head will not be uncovered on hearing pronounced the name of
  the man whose genius was ignored and who languished steeped in
  bitterness blind poor forgotten he remained alone with a glory
  of whose extent he himself was conscious but which only the coming
  ages will sanction when shall be revealed more clearly the laws of
  organization
  lamarck thy abandonment sad as it was in thy old age is better
  than the ephemeral glory of men who only maintain their reputation
  by sharing in the errors of their time
  honor to thee respect to thy memory thou hast died in the breach
  while fighting for truth and the truth assures thee immortality
lamarcks theoretical views were not known in germany until many years
after his death had goethe his contemporary 17491832 known of
them he would undoubtedly have welcomed his speculations have
expressed his appreciation of them and lamarcks reputation would in
his own lifetime have raised him from the obscurity of his later years
at paris
hearty appreciation though late in the century came from ernst
haeckel whose bold and suggestive works have been so widely read in
his history of creation 1868 he thus estimates lamarcks work as a
philosopher
  to him will always belong the immortal glory of having for the
  first time worked out the theory of descent as an independent
  scientific theory of the first order and as the philosophical
  foundation of the whole science of biology
referring to the philosophie zoologique he says
  this admirable work is the first connected exposition of the theory
  of descent carried out strictly into all its consequences by its
  purely mechanical method of viewing organic nature and the strictly
  philosophical proofs brought forward in it lamarcks work is raised
  far above the prevailing dualistic views of his time and with the
  exception of darwins work which appeared just half a century
  later we know of none which we could in this respect place by the
  side of the philosophie zoologique how far it was in advance of
  its time is perhaps best seen from the circumstance that it was not
  understood by most men and for fifty years was not spoken of at
  all cuvier lamarcks greatest opponent in his report on the
  progress of natural science in which the most unimportant
  anatomical investigations are enumerated does not devote a single
  word to this work which forms an epoch in science goethe also
  who took such a lively interest in the french naturephilosophy and
  in the thoughts of kindred minds beyond the rhine nowhere
  mentions lamarck and does not seem to have known the philosophie
  zoologique at all
again in 1882 haeckel writes55
  we regard it as a truly tragic fact that the philosophie
  zoologique of lamarck one of the greatest productions of the great
  literary period of the beginning of our century received at first
  only the slightest notice and within a few years became wholly
  forgotten not until fully fifty years later when darwin
  breathed new life into the transformation views founded therein was
  the buried treasure again recovered and we cannot refrain from
  regarding it as the most complete presentation of the development
  theory before darwin
  while lamarck clearly expressed all the essential fundamental ideas
  of our present doctrine of descent and excites our admiration at
  the depth of his morphological knowledge he none the less surprises
  us by the prophetic vorausschauende clearness of his
  physiological conceptions
in his views on life the nature of the will and reason and other
subjects haeckel declares that lamarck was far above most of his
contemporaries and that he sketched out a programme of the biology of
the future which was not carried out until our day
j victor carus56 also claims for lamarck the lasting merit of having
been the first to have placed the theory of descent on a scientific
foundation
the best most catholic and just exposition of lamarcks views and
which is still worth reading is that by lyell chapters xxxivxxxvi of
his principles of geology 1830 and though at that time one would not
look for an acceptance of views which then seemed extraordinary and
indeed farfetched lyell had no words of satire and ridicule only a
calm able statement and discussion of his principles indeed it is
well known that when in after years his friend charles darwin
published his views lyell expressed some leaning towards the older
speculations of lamarck
lyells opinions as to the interest and value of lamarcks ideas may be
found in his life and letters and also in the life and letters of
charles darwin in the chapter on the reception of the origin of
species by huxley are the following extracts from lyells letters
ii pp 179204 in a letter addressed to mantell dated march 2
1827 lyell speaks of having just read lamarck he expresses his
delight at lamarcks theories and his personal freedom from any
objections based on theological grounds and though he is evidently
alarmed at the pithecoid origin of man involved in lamarcks doctrine
he observes but after all what changes species may really undergo
how impossible will it be to distinguish and lay down a line beyond
which some of the socalled extinct species have never passed into
recent ones
he also quotes a remarkable passage in the postscript to a letter
written to sir john herschel in 1836 in regard to the origination of
new species i am very glad to find that you think it probable it may be
carried on through the intervention of intermediate causes
how nearly lyell was made a convert to evolution by reading lamarcks
works may be seen by the following extracts from his letters quoted by
huxley
  i think the old creation is almost as much required as ever but
  of course it takes a new form if lamarcks views improved by yours
  are adopted to darwin march 11 1863 p 363
                                   
  as to lamarck i find that grove who has been reading him is
  wonderfully struck with his book i remember that it was the
  conclusion he lamarck came to about man that fortified me thirty
  years ago against the great impression which his argument at first
  made on my mindall the greater because constant prevost a pupil
  of cuvier forty years ago told me his conviction that cuvier
  thought species not real but that science could not advance without
  assuming that they were so
                                   
  when i came to the conclusion that after all lamarck was going to
  be shown to be right that we must go the whole orang i reread
  his book and remembering when it was written i felt i had done
  him injustice
  even as to mans gradual acquisition of more and more ideas and
  then of speech slowly as the ideas multiplied and then his
  persecution of the beings most nearly allied and competing with
  himall this is very darwinian
  the substitution of the varietymaking power for volition
  muscular action etc and in plants even volition was not called
  in is in some respects only a change of names call a new variety
  a new creation one may say of the former as of the latter what
  you say when you observe that the creationist explains nothing and
  only affirms it is so because it is so
  lamarcks belief in the slow changes in the organic and inorganic
  world in the year 1800 was surely above the standard of his times
  and he was right about progression in the main though you have
  vastly advanced that doctrine as to owen in his aye aye paper he
  seems to me a disciple of pouchet who converted him at rouen to
  spontaneous generation
  have i not at p 412 put the vast distinction between you and
  lamarck as to necessary progression strongly enough to darwin
  march 15 1863 lyells letters ii p 365
darwin in the freedom of private correspondence paid scant respect to
the views of his renowned predecessor as the following extracts from
his published letters will show
  heaven forfend me from lamarck nonsense of a tendency to
  progression adaptations from the slow willing of animals etc
  but the conclusions i am led to are not widely different from his
  though the means of change are wholly so darwins life and
  letters ii p 23 1844
                                   
  with respect to books on this subject i do not know of any
  systematical ones except lamarcks which is veritable rubbish
  is it not strange that the author of such a book as the animaux
  sans vertbres should have written that insects which never see
  their eggs should will and plants their seeds to be of
  particular forms so as to become attached to particular

breadth and catholicity and despite the fact that he rejected lamarcks
peculiar evolutional views associated him with the most eminent

position in the scientific world
  i am not likely to take a low view of darwins position in the
  history of science but i am disposed to think that buffon and
  lamarck would run him hard in both genius and fertility in breadth
  of view and in extent of knowledge these two men were giants though

the memory of lamarck is deeply and warmly cherished throughout france
he gave his country a second linn one of the leading botanists in
europe and the greatest zologist of his time he now shares equally
with geoffroy st hilaire and with cuvier the distinction of raising
biological science to that eminence in the first third of the nineteenth
century which placed france as the mother of biologists in the van of
all the nations when we add to his triumphs in pure zology the fact
that he was in his time the philosopher of biology it is not going too
far to crown him as one of the intellectual glories not only of france
but of the civilized world
how warmly his memory is now cherished may be appreciated by the perusal
of the following letter with its delightful reminiscences for which we
are indebted to the venerable and distinguished zologist and
comparative anatomist who formerly occupied the chair made illustrious
by lamarck and by his successor de blainville and who founded the
laboratoire arago on the mediterranean also that of experimental
zology at roscoff and who still conducts the journal de zoologie

  je nai rien appris de plus que ce que vous voulez bien me rappeler
  comme layant trouv dans mon adresse de 1889 je ne connais plus ni

chapter vii
lamarcks work in meteorology and physical science
when a medical student in paris lamarck from day to day watching the
clouds from his attic windows became much interested in meteorology
and indeed at first this subject had nearly as much attraction for him
as botany for a long period he pursued these studies and he was the
first one to foretell the probabilities of the weather thus
anticipating by over half a century the modern idea of making the
science of meteorology of practical use to mankind
his article de linfluence de la lune sur latmosphre terrestre
appeared in the journal de physique for 1798 and was translated in
two english journals the titles of several other essays will be found
in the bibliography at the close of this volume
from 1799 to 1810 he regularly published an annual meteorological report
containing the statement of probabilities acquired by a long series of
observations on the state of the weather and the variations of the
atmosphere at different times of the year giving indications of the
periods when to expect pleasant weather or rain storms tempests
frosts thaws etc finally the citations of these probabilities of
times favorable to ftes journeys voyages harvesting crops and
other enterprises dependent on good weather
lamarck thus explained the principles on which he based his
probabilities two kinds of causes he says displace the fluids which
compose the atmosphere some being variable and irregular others
constant whose action is subject to progressive and fixed laws
between the tropics constant causes exercise an action so considerable
that the irregular effects of variable causes are there in some degree
lost hence result the prevailing winds which in these climates become
established and change at determinate epochs
beyond the tropics and especially toward the middle of the temperate
zones variable causes predominate we can however still discover
there the effects of the action of constant causes though much
weakened we can assign them the principal epochs and in a great number
of cases make this knowledge turn to our profit it is in the elevation
and depression abaissement of the moon above and below the celestial
equator that we should seek for the most constant of these causes
with his usual facility in such matters he was not long in advancing a
theory according to which the atmosphere is regarded as resembling the
sea having a surface waves and storms it ought likewise to have a
flux and reflux for the moon ought to exercise the same influence upon
it that it does on the ocean in the temperate and frigid zones
therefore the wind which is only the tide of the atmosphere must
depend greatly on the declination of the moon it ought to blow toward
the pole that is nearest to it and advancing in that direction only in
order to reach every place traversing dry countries or extensive seas
it ought then to render the sky serene or stormy if the influence of
the moon on the weather is denied it is only that it may be referred to
its phases but its position in the ecliptic is regarded as affording
probabilities much nearer the truth58
in each of these annuals lamarck took great care to avoid making any
positive predictions no one he says could make these predictions
without deceiving himself and abusing the confidence of persons who
might place reliance on them he only intended to propose simple
probabilities
after the publication of the first of these annuals at the request of
lamarck who had made it the subject of a memoir read to the institute
in 1800 9 ventse lan ix chaptal minister of the interior
thought it well to establish in france a regular correspondence of
meteorological observations made daily at different points remote from
each other and he conferred the direction of it on lamarck this system
of meteorological reports lasted but a short time and was not
maintained by chaptals successor after three of these annual reports
had appeared lamarck rather suddenly stopped publishing them and an
incident occurred in connection with their cessation which led to the
story that he had suffered ill treatment and neglect from napoleon i
it has been supposed that lamarck who was frank and at times brusque in
character had made some enemies and that he had been represented to
the emperor as a maker of almanacs and of weather predictions and that
napoleon during a reception showing to lamarck his great
dissatisfaction with the annuals had ordered him to stop their
publication
but according to bourguins statement this is not the correct version
he tells us
  according to traditions preserved in the family of lamarck things
  did not happen so at all during a reception given to the institute
  at the tuileries napoleon who really liked lamarck spoke to him
  in a jocular way about his weather probabilities and lamarck very
  much provoked trs contrari at being thus chaffed in the
  presence of his colleagues resolved to stop the publication of his
  observations on the weather what proves that this version is the
  true one is that lamarck published another annual which he had in
  preparation for the year 1810 in the preface he announced that his
  age ill health and his circumstances placed him in the unfortunate
  necessity of ceasing to busy himself with this periodical work he
  ended by inviting those who had the taste for meteorological
  observations and the means of devoting their time to it to take up
  with confidence an enterprise good in itself based on a genuine
  foundation and from which the public would derive advantageous
  results
these opuscles such as they were in which lamarck treated different
subjects bearing on the winds great droughts rainy seasons tides
etc became the precursors of the annuaires du bureau des
longitudes
an observation of lamarcks on a rare and curious form of cloud has
quite recently been referred to by a french meteorologist it is
probable says m e durandgreville in la nature november 24 1900
that lamarck was the first to observe the socalled pocky or festoon
cloud or mammatocirrus cloud which at rare intervals has been
observed since his time59
full of over confidence in the correctness of his views formed without
reference to experiments although lavoisier by his discovery of oxygen
in the years 177285 and other researches had laid the foundations of
the antiphlogistic or modern chemistry lamarck quixotically attempted
to substitute his own speculative views for those of the discoverers of
oxygenpriestley 1774 and the great french chemist lavoisier
lamarck in his hydrogologie 1802 went so far as to declare
  it is not true and it seems to me even absurd to believe that pure
  air which has been justly called vital air and which chemists
  now call oxygen gas can be the radical of saline mattersnamely
  can be the principle of acidity of causticity or any salinity
  whatever there are a thousand ways of refuting this error without
  the possibility of a reply this hypothesis the best of all
  those which had been imagined when lavoisier conceived it cannot
  now be longer held since i have discovered what is really
  caloric p 161
after paying his respects to priestley he asks what then can be the
reason why the views of chemists and mine are so opposed and complains
that the former have avoided all written discussion on this subject and
this after his three physicochemical works the rfutation the
recherches and the mmoires had appeared and seemed to chemists to
be unworthy of a reply
it must be admitted that lamarck was on this occasion unduly
selfopinionated and stubborn in adhering to such views at a time when
the physical sciences were being placed on a firm and lasting basis by
experimental philosophers the two great lessons of scienceto suspend
ones judgment and to wait for more light in theoretical matters on
which scientific men were so dividedand the necessity of adhering to
his own line of biological study where he had facts of his own
observing on which to rest his opinions lamarck did not seem ever to
have learned
the excuse for his rash and quixotic course in respect to his
physicochemical vagaries is that he had great mental activity lamarck
was a synthetic philosopher he had been brought up in the encyclopdic
period of learning he had from his early manhood been deeply interested
in physical subjects in middle age he probably lived a very retired
life did not mingle with his compeers or discuss his views with them
so that when he came to publish them he found not a single supporter
his speculations were received in silence and not deemed worthy of
discussion
a very just and discriminating judge of lamarcks work professor
cleland thus refers to his writings on physics and chemistry
  the most prominent defect in lamarck must be admitted quite apart
  from all consideration of the famous hypothesis which bears his
  name to have been want of control in speculation doubtless the
  speculative tendency furnished a powerful incentive to work but it
  outran the legitimate deductions from observation and led him into
  the production of volumes of worthless chemistry without
  experimental basis as well as into spending much time in fruitless
  meteorological predictions encyc brit art lamarck
how a modern physicist regards lamarcks views on physics may be seen by
the following statement kindly written for this book by professor carl
barus of brown university providence
  lamarcks physical and chemical speculations made throughout on
  the basis of the alchemistic philosophy of the time will have
  little further interest today than as evidence showing the broadly
  philosophic tendencies of lamarcks mind made without experiment
  and without mathematics the contents of the three volumes will
  hardly repay perusal except by the historian interested in certain
  aspects of prelavoisierian science the temerity with which
  physical phenomena are referred to occult static molecules
  permeated by subtle fluids the whole mechanism left without dynamic
  quality since the mass of the molecule is to be nonessential is
  markedly in contrast with the discredit into which such hypotheses
  have now fallen it is true that an explanation of natural phenomena
  in terms le feu thr le feu calorique et le feu fix might be
  interpreted with reference to the modern doctrine of energy but it
  is certain that lamarck antedating fresnel carnot ampre not to
  mention their great followers had not the faintest inkling of the
  possibility of such an interpretation indeed one may readily
  account for the resemblance to modern views seeing that all
  speculative systems of science must to some extent run in parallel
  inasmuch as they begin with the facts of common experience nor were
  his speculations in any degree stimulating to theoretical science
  many of his mechanisms in which the ether operates on a plane of
  equality with the air can only be regarded with amusement the whole
  of his elaborate schemes of color classification may be instanced as
  forerunners of the methods commercially in vogue today they are
  not the harbingers of methods scientifically in vogue one looks in
  vain for research adequate to carry the load of so much speculative
  text
  even if we realize that the beginnings of science could but be made
  amid such groping in the dark it is a pity that a man of lamarcks
  genius which seems to have been destitute of the instincts of an
  experimentalist should have lavished so much serious thought in
  evolving a system of chemical physics out of himself
the chemical status of lamarcks writings is thus stated by professor h
carrington bolton in a letter dated washington d c february 9 1900
  excuse delay in replying to your inquiry as to the chemical status
  of the french naturalist lamarck not until this morning have i
  found it convenient to go to the library of congress that library
  has not the recherches nor the mmoires but the position of
  lamarck is well known he had no influence on chemistry and his
  name is not mentioned in the principal histories of chemistry he
  made no experiments but depended upon his imagination for his
  facts he opposed the tenets of the new french school founded by
  lavoisier and proposed a fanciful scheme of abstract principles
  that remind one of alchemy
  cuvier in his loge mmoires acad royale des sciences
  1832 estimates lamarck correctly as respects his position in
  physical science
lamarck boldly carried the principle of change and evolution into
inorganic nature by the same law of change of circumstances producing
change of species
under the head de lespce parmi les minraux p 149 the author
states that he had for a long time supposed that there were no species
among minerals here also he doubts and boldly if not rashly in
this case opposes accepted views and in this field as elsewhere
shows at least his independence of thought
  they teach in paris he says that the integrant molecule of each
  kind of compound is invariable in nature and consequently that it
  is as old as nature hence mineral species are constant
  for myself i declare that i am persuaded and even feel convinced
  that the integrant molecule of every compound substance whatever
  may change its nature namely may undergo changes in the number and
  in the proportions of the principles which compose it
he enlarges on this subject through eight pages he was evidently led to
take this view from his assumption that everything every natural
object organic or inorganic undergoes a change but it may be
objected that this view will not apply to minerals because those of the
archan rocks do not differ and have undergone no change since then to
the present time unless we except such minerals as are alteration
products due to metamorphism the primary laws of nature of physics
and of chemistry are unchangeable while change progression from the
generalized to the specialized is distinctly characteristic of the
organic as opposed to the inorganic world

lamarcks work in geology
whatever may be said of his chemical and physical lucubrations lamarck
in his geological and palontological writings is despite their errors
always suggestive and in some most important respects in advance of his
time and this largely for the reason that he had once travelled and to
some extent observed geological phenomena in the central regions of
france in germany and hungary visiting mines and collecting ores and
minerals besides being in a degree familiar with the french cretaceous
fossils but more especially those of the tertiary strata of paris and
its vicinity he had therefore from his own experience slight as it
was some solid grounds of facts and observations on which to meditate
and from which to reason
he did not attempt to touch upon cosmological theorieschaos and
creationbut rather confined himself to the earth and more
particularly to the action of the ocean and to the changes which he
believed to be due to organic agencies the most impressive truth in
geology is the conception of the immensity of past time and this truth
lamarck fully realized his views are to be found in a little book of
268 pages entitled hydrogologie it appeared in 1802 an x or
ten years before the first publication of cuviers famous discours sur
les revolutions de la surface du globe 1812 written in his popular
and attractive style and thoroughly in accord with the cosmological and
theological prepossessions of the age the discours was widely read and
passed through many editions on the other hand the hydrogologie
died stillborn with scarcely a friend or a reader never reaching a
second edition and is now like most of his works a bibliographical
rarity
the only writer who has said a word in its favor or contrasted it with
the work of cuvier is the judicious and candid huxley who though by
no means favorable to lamarcks factors of evolution frankly said
  the vast authority of cuvier was employed in support of the
  traditionally respectable hypotheses of special creation and of
  catastrophism and the wild speculations of the discours sur les
  revolutions de la surface du globe were held to be models of sound
  scientific thinking while the really much more sober and
  philosophic hypotheses of the hydrogologie were scouted60
before summarizing the contents of this book let us glance at the
geological atmospherethin and tenuous as it was thenin which lamarck
lived the credit of being the first observer before steno 1669 to
state that fossils are the remains of animals which were once alive is
due to an italian frascatero of verona who wrote in 1517
  but says lyell61 the clear and philosophical views of
  frascatero were disregarded and the talent and argumentative powers
  of the learned were doomed for three centuries to be wasted in the
  discussion of these two simple and preliminary questions first
  whether fossil remains had ever belonged to living creatures and
  secondly whether if this be admitted all the phenomena could not
  be explained by the deluge of noah
previous to this the great artist architect engineer and musician
leonardo da vinci 14521519 who among other great works planned and
executed some navigable canals in northern italy and who was an
observer of rare penetration and judgment saw how fossil shells were
formed saying that the mud of rivers had covered and penetrated into
the interior of fossil shells at a time when these were still at the
bottom of the sea near the coast62
that versatile and observing genius bernard palissy as early as 1580
in a book entitled the origin of springs from rainwater and in other
writings criticized the notions of the time especially of italian
writers that petrified shells had all been left by the universal
deluge
  it has happened said fontenelle in his eulogy on palissy
  delivered before the french academy a century and a half later
  that a potter who knew neither latin nor greek dared toward the
  end of the sixteenth century to say in paris and in the presence
  of all the doctors that fossil shells were veritable shells
  deposited at some time by the sea in the places where they were
  then found that the animals had given to the figured stones all
  their different shapes and that he boldly defied all the school of
  aristotle to attack his proofs63
then succeeded at the end of the seventeenth century the forerunners
of modern geology steno 1669 leibnitz 1683 ray 1692 woodward
1695 vallisneri 1721 while moro published his views in 1745 in
the eighteenth century raumur64 1720 presented a paper on the
fossil shells of touraine
cuvier65 thus pays his respects in at least an unsympathetic way to
the geological essayists and compilers of the seventeenth century
  the end of the seventeenth century lived to see the birth of a new
  science which took in its infancy the highsounding name of
  theory of the earth starting from a small number of facts badly
  observed connecting them by fantastic suppositions it pretended to
  go back to the origin of worlds to as it were play with them and
  to create their history its arbitrary methods its pompous
  language altogether seemed to render it foreign to the other
  sciences and indeed the professional savants for a long time cast
  it out of the circle of their studies
their views often premature composed of halftruths were mingled with
glaring errors and fantastic misconceptions but were none the less
germinal leibnitz was the first to propose the nebular hypothesis
which was more fully elaborated by kant and laplace buffon influenced
by the writing of leibnitz in his thorie de la terre published in
1749 adopted his notion of an original volcanic nucleus and a universal
ocean the latter as he thought leaving the land dry by draining into
subterranean caverns he also dimly saw or gathered from his reading
that the mountains and valleys were due to secondary causes that
fossiliferous strata had been deposited by ocean currents and that
rivers had transported materials from the highlands to the lowlands he
also states that many of the fossil shells which occur in europe do not
live in the adjacent seas and that there are remains of fishes and of
plants not now living in europe and which are either extinct or live in
more southern climates and others in tropical seas also that the bones
and teeth of elephants and of the rhinoceros and hippopotamus found in
siberia and elsewhere in northern europe and asia indicate that these
animals must have lived there though at present restricted to the
tropics in his last essay poques de la nature 1778 he claims
that the earths history may be divided into epochs from the earliest
to the present time the first epoch was that of fluidity of
incandescence when the earth and the planets assumed their form the
second of cooling the third when the waters covered the earth and
volcanoes began to be active the fourth that of the retreat of the
seas and the fifth the age when the elephants the hippopotamus and
other southern animals lived in the regions of the north the sixth
when the two continents america and the old world became separate the
seventh and last being the age of man above all by his attractive
style and bold suggestions he popularized the subjects and created an
interest in these matters and a spirit of inquiry which spread
throughout france and the rest of europe
but notwithstanding the crude and uncritical nature of the writings of
the second half of the eighteenth century resulting from the lack of
that more careful and detailed observation which characterizes our day
there was during this period a widespread interest in physical and
natural science and it led up to that more exact study of nature which
signalizes the nineteenth century more new truths concerning the
external world says buckle were discovered in france during the
latter half of the eighteenth century than during all preceding periods
put together66 as perkins67 says interest in scientific study
as in political investigation seemed to rise suddenly from almost
complete inactivity to extraordinary development in both departments
english thinkers had led the way but if the impulse to such
investigations came from without the work done in france in every
branch of scientific research during the eighteenth century was excelled
by no other nation and england alone could assert any claim to results
of equal importance the researches of coulomb in electricity of buffon
in geology of lavoisier in chemistry of daubenton in comparative
anatomy carried still farther by their illustrious successors towards
the close of the century did much to establish conceptions of the
universe and its laws upon a scientific basis and not only did
rousseau make botany fashionable but goldsmith wrote from paris in
1755 i have seen as bright a circle of beauty at the chemical lectures
of rouelle as gracing the court of versailles petit lectured on
astronomy to crowded houses and among his listeners were gentlemen and
ladies of fashion as well as professional students68 the
popularizers of science during this period were voltaire montesquieu
alembert diderot and other encyclopdists
here should be mentioned one of buffons contemporaries and countrymen
one who was the first true field geologist an observer rather than a
compiler or theorist this was jean e guettard 17151786 he
published says sir archibald geikie in his valuable work the
founders of geology about two hundred papers on a wide range of
scientific subjects besides half a dozen quarto volumes of his
observations together with many excellent plates geikie also states
that he is undoubtedly entitled to rank among the first great pioneers
of modern geology he was the first 1751 to make a geological map of
northern france and roughly traced the limits of his three bands or
formations from france across the southeastern english counties in his
work on the degradation of mountains effected in our time by heavy
rains rivers and the sea69 he states that the sea is the most
potent destroyer of the land and that the material thus removed is
deposited either on the land or along the shores of the sea he thought
that the levels of the valleys are at present being raised owing to the
deposit of detritus in them he points out that the deposits laid down
by the ocean do not extend far out to sea that consequently the
elevations of new mountains in the sea by the deposition of sediment
is a process very difficult to conceive that the transport of the
sediment as far as the equator is not less improbable and that still
more difficult to accept is the suggestion that the sediment from our
continent is carried into the seas of the new world in short we are
still very little advanced towards the theory of the earth as it now
exists guettard was the first to discover the volcanoes of auvergne
but he was hopelessly wrong in regard to the origin of basalt
forestalling werner in his mistakes as to its aqueous origin he was
thus the first neptunist while as geikie states his observations in
auvergne practically started the vulcanist camp
we now come to lamarcks own time he must have been familiar with the
results of pallass travels in russia and siberia 179394 the
distinguished german zologist and geologist besides working out the
geology of the ural mountains showed in 1777 that there was a general
law in the formation of all mountain chains composed chiefly of primary
rocks70 the granitic axis being flanked by schists and these by
fossiliferous strata from his observations made on the volga and about
its mouth he presented proofs of the former extension in comparatively
recent times of the caspian sea but still more pregnant and remarkable
was his discovery of an entire rhinoceros with its flesh and skin in
the frozen soil of siberia his memoir on this animal places him among
the forerunners of if not within the ranks of the founders of
palontology
meanwhile soldani an italian had in 1780 shown that the limestone
strata of italy had accumulated in a deep sea at least far from land
and he was the first to observe the alternation of marine and
freshwater strata in the paris basin
lamarck must have taken much interest in the famous controversy between
the vulcanists and neptunists he visited freyburg in 1771 whether he
met werner is not known as werner began to lecture in 1775 he must
have personally known faujas of paris who in 1779 published his
description of the volcanoes of vivarais and velay while desmarests
17251815 elaborate work on the volcanoes of auvergne published in
1774 in which he proved the igneous origin of basalt was the best
piece of geological exploration which had yet been accomplished and is
still a classic71
werner 17501817 the propounder of the neptunian theory was one of
the founders of modern geology and of palontology his work entitled
ueber die assern kennzeichen der fossilien appeared in 1774 his
kurze klassifikation und beschreibung der gebirgsarten in 1787 he
discovered the law of the superposition of stratified rocks though he
wrongly considered volcanic rocks such as basalt to be of aqueous
origin being as he supposed formed of chemical precipitates from water
but he was the first to state that the age of different formations can
be told by their fossils certain species being confined to particular
beds while others ranged throughout whole formations and others seemed
to occur in several different formations the original species found in
these formations appearing to have been so constituted as to live
through a variety of changes which had destroyed hundreds of other
species which we find confined to particular beds72 his views as
regards fossils as jameson states were probably not known to cuvier
and it is more than doubtful whether lamarck knew of them he observed
that fossils appear first in transition or palozoic strata and were
mainly corals and molluscs that in the older carboniferous rocks the
fossils are of higher types such as fish and amphibious animals while
in the tertiary or alluvial strata occur the remains of birds and
quadrupeds he thought that marine plants were more ancient than land
plants his studies led him to infer that the fossils contained in the
oldest rocks are very different from any of the species of the present
time that the newer the formation the more do the remains approach in
form to the organic beings of the present creation and that in the
very latest formations fossil remains of species now existing occur
such advanced views as these would seem to entitle werner to rank as one
of the founders of palontology73
huttons theory of the earth appeared in 1785 and in a more developed
state as a separate work in 179574 the ruins of an older world
he said are visible in the present structure of our planet and the
strata which now compose our continents have been once beneath the sea
and were formed out of the waste of prexisting continents the same
forces are still destroying by chemical decomposition or mechanical
violence even the hardest rocks and transporting the materials to the
sea where they are spread out and form strata analogous to those of
more ancient date although loosely deposited along the bottom of the
ocean they became afterwards altered and consolidated by volcanic heat
and were then heaved up fractured and contorted again he said in
the economy of the world i can find no traces of a beginning no
prospect of an end as lyell remarks hutton imagined that the
continents were first gradually destroyed by aqueous degradation and
when their ruins had furnished materials for new continents they were
upheaved by violent convulsions he therefore required alternate periods
of general disturbance and repose
to hutton therefore we are indebted for the idea of the immensity of
the duration of time he was the forerunner of lyell and of the
uniformitarian school of geologists
hutton observed that fossils characterized certain strata but the value
of fossils as timemarks and the principle of the superposition of
stratified fossiliferous rocks were still more clearly established by
william smith an english surveyor in 1790 meanwhile the abb hay
the founder of crystallography was in 1802 professor of mineralogy in
the jardin des plantes
lamarcks contributions to physical geology his theory of the earth
such were the amount and kind of knowledge regarding the origin and
structure of our earth which existed at the close of the eighteenth
century while lamarck was meditating his hydrogologie and had begun
to study the invertebrate fossils of the paris tertiary basin
his object he says in his work is to present certain considerations
which he believed to be new and of the first order which had escaped
the notice of physicists and which seemed to him should serve as the
foundations for a good theory of the earth his theses are
  1 what are the natural consequences of the influence and the
  movements of the waters on the surface of the globe
  2 why does the sea constantly occupy a basin within the limits
  which contain it and there separate the dry parts of the surface of
  the globe always projecting above it
  3 has the ocean basin always existed where we actually see it and
  if we find proofs of the sojourn of the sea in places where it no
  longer remains by what cause was it found there and why is it no
  longer there
  4 what influence have living bodies exerted on the substances found
  on the surface of the earth and which compose the crust which
  invests it and what are the general results of this influence
lamarck then disclaims any intentions of framing brilliant hypotheses
based on supposititious principles but nevertheless as we shall see
he falls into this same error and like others of his period makes some
preposterous hypotheses though these are far less so than those of
cuviers discours he distinguishes between the action of rivers or of
freshwater currents torrents storms the melting of snow and the
work of the ocean the rivers wear away and bear materials from the
highlands to the lowlands so that the plains are gradually elevated
ravines form and become immense valleys and their sides form elevated
crests and pass into mountain ranges
he brings out and emphasizes the fact now so well known that the
erosive action of rain and rivers has formed mountains of a certain
class
  it is then evident to me that every mountain which is not the
  result of a volcanic irruption or of some local catastrophe has
  been carved out from a plain where its mass is gradually formed
  and was a part of it hence what in this case are the summits of
  the mountains are only the remains of the former level of the plain
  unless the process of washing away and other means of degradation
  have not since reduced its height
now this will apply perfectly well to our tablelands mesas the
mountains of our badlands even to our catskills and to many elevations
of this nature in france and in northern africa but lamarck
unfortunately does not stop here but with the zeal of an innovator by
no means confined to his time alone claims that the mountain masses of
the alps and the andes were carved out of plains which had been raised
above the sealevel to the present heights of those mountains
two causes he says have concurred in forming these elevated plains
  one consists in the continual accumulation of material filling the
  portion of the oceanbasin from which the same seas slowly retreat
  for it does not abandon those parts of the oceanbasin which are
  situated nearer and nearer to the shores that it tends to leave
  until after having filled its bottom and having gradually raised it
  it follows that the coasts which the sea is abandoning are never
  made by a very deeplying formation however often it appears to be
  such for they are continually elevated as the result of the
  perpetual balancing of the sea which casts off from its shores all
  the sediments brought down by the rivers in such a way that the
  great depths of the ocean are not near the shore from which the sea
  retreats but out in the middle of the ocean and near the opposite
  shores which the sea tends to invade
  the other cause as we shall see is found in the detritus of
  organic bodies successively accumulated which perpetually elevates
  although with extreme slowness the soil of the dry portions of the
  globe and which does it all the more rapidly as the situation of
  these parts gives less play to the degradation of the surface caused
  by the rivers
  doubtless a plain which is destined some day to furnish the
  mountains which the rivers will carve out from its mass would have
  when still but a little way from the sea but a moderate elevation
  above its river channels but gradually as the ocean basin removed
  from this plain this basin constantly sinking down into the
  interior paisseur of the external crust of the globe and the
  soil of the plain perpetually rising higher from the deposition of
  the detritus of organic bodies it results that after ages of
  elevation of the plain in question it would be in the end
  sufficiently thick for high mountains to be shaped and carved out of
  its mass
  although the ephemeral length of life of man prevents his
  appreciation of this fact it is certain that the soil of a plain
  unceasingly acquires a real increase in its elevation in proportion
  as it is covered with different plants and animals indeed the
  dbris successively heaped up for numerous generations of all these
  beings which have by turns perished and which as the result of the
  action of their organs have during the course of this life given
  rise to combinations which would never have existed without this
  means most of the principles which have formed them not being
  borrowed from the soil this dbris i say wasting successively on
  the soil of the plain in question gradually increases the thickness
  of its external bed multiplies there the mineral matters of all
  kinds and gradually elevates the formation
our author as is evident had no conception nor had any one else at
the time he wrote of the slow secular elevation of a continental
plateau by crustmovements and lamarcks idea of the formation of
elevated plains on land by the accumulation of dbris of organisms is
manifestly inadequate our arial or eolian rocks and loess being
winddeposits of sand and silt rather than matters of organic origin
thus he cites as an example of his theory the vast elevated plains of
tartary which he thought had been dry land from time immemorable
though we now know that the rise took place in the quaternary or present
period on the other hand given these vast elevated plains he was
correct in affirming that rivers flowing through them wore out enormous
valleys and carved out high mountains left standing by atmospheric
erosion for examples of such are to be seen in the valley of the nile
the colorado the upper missouri etc
he then distinguishes between granitic or crystalline mountains and
those composed of stratified rocks and volcanic mountains
the erosive action of rivers is thus discussed they tend first he
says to fill up the ocean basins and second to make the surface of
the land broken and mountainous by excavating and furrowing the plains
our author did not at all understand the causes of the inclination or
tilting up of strata little close observation or field work had yet
been done and the rocks about paris are but slightly if at all
disturbed he attributes the dipping down of strata to the inclination
of the shores of the sea though he adds that nevertheless it is often
due to local subsidences and then he remarks that indeed in many
mountains and especially in the pyrenees in the very centre of these
mountains we observe that the strata are for the most part either
vertical or so inclined that they more or less approach this direction
  but he asks should we conclude from this that there has
  necessarily occurred a universal catastrophe a general overturning
  this assumption so convenient for those naturalists who would
  explain all the facts of this kind without taking the trouble to
  observe and study the course which nature follows is not at all
  necessary here for it is easy to conceive that the inclined
  direction of the beds in the mountains may have been produced by
  other causes and especially by causes more natural and less
  hypothetical than a general overturning of strata
while streams of fresh water tend to fill up and destroy the ocean
basins he also insists that the movements of the sea such as the
tides currents storms submarine volcanoes etc on the contrary
tend to unceasingly excavate and restablish these basins of course we
now know that tides and currents have no effect in the ocean depths
though their scouring effects near shore in shallow waters have locally
had a marked effect in changing the relations of land and sea lamarck
went so far as to insist that the ocean basin owes its existence and its
preservation to the scouring action of the tides and currents
the earths interior was in lamarcks opinion solid formed of
quartzose and silicious rocks and its centre of gravity did not
coincide with its geographical centre or what he calls the centre de
forme he imagined also that the ocean revolved around the globe from
east to west and that this movement by its continuity displaced the
ocean basin and made it pass successively over all the surface of the
earth
then in the third chapter he asks if the basin of the sea has always
been where we now actually see it and whether we find proofs of the
sojourn of the sea in the place where it is now absent if so what are
the causes of these changes he reiterates his strange idea of a general
movement of the ocean from east to west at the rate of at least three
leagues in twentyfour hours and due to the moons influence and here
lamarck in spite of his uniformitarian principles is strongly
cataclysmic what he seems to have in mind is the great equatorial
current between africa and the west indies to this perpetual movement
of the waters of the atlantic ocean he ventures to attribute the
excavation of the gulf of mexico and presumes that at the end of ages
it will break through the isthmus of panama and transform america into
two great islands or two small continents not understanding that the
islands are either the result of upheaval or outliers of continents
due to subsidence lamarck supposed that his westward flow of the ocean
due to the moons attraction eroded the eastern shores of america and
the currents thus formed in their efforts to move westward arrested by
america and by the eastern coasts of china were in great part diverted
towards the south pole and seeking to break through a passage across
the ancient continent have a long time since reduced the portion of
this continent which united new holland to asia into an archipelago
which comprises the molucca philippine and mariana islands the west
indies and windward islands were formed by the same means and the sea
not breaking through the isthmus of panama was turned southward and the
action of its currents resulted in detaching the island of tierra del
fuego from south america in like manner new zealand was separated from
new holland madagascar from africa and ceylon from india
he then refers to other displacements of the ocean basin to the
shallowing of the straits of sunda of the baltic sea the ancient
subsidence of the coast of holland and zealand and states that sweden
offers all the appearance of having recently emerged from the sea while
the caspian sea formerly much larger than at present was once in
communication with the black sea and that some day the straits of sunda
and the straits of dover will be dry land so that the union of england
and france will be formed anew
strangely enough with these facts known to him lamarck did not see
that such changes were due to changes of level of the land rather than
to their being abandoned or invaded by the sea but explained these by
his bizarre hypothesis of westwardflowing currents due to the moons
action though it should be in all fairness stated that down to recent
times there have been those who believed that it is the sea and not the
land which has changed its level
this idea that the sea and not the land has changed its level was
generally held at the time lamarck wrote though strabo had made the
shrewd observation that it was the land which moved the greek
geographer threw aside the notion of some of his contemporaries and
with wonderful prevision considering the time he wrote and the limited
observations he could make claimed that it is not the sea which has
risen or fallen but the land itself which is sometimes raised up and
sometimes depressed while the seabottom may also be elevated or sunk
down he refers to such facts as deluges earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions and sudden swellings of the land beneath the sea
  and it is not merely the small but the large islands also not
  merely the islands but the continents which can be lifted up
  together with the sea and too the large and small tracts may
  subside for habitations and cities like bure bizona and many
  others have been engulfed by earthquakes75
but it was not until eighteen centuries later that this doctrine under
the teachings of playfair leopold von buch and lie de beaumont
182930 became generally accepted in 1845 humboldt remarked it is a
fact today recognized by all geologists that the rise of continents is
due to an actual upheaval and not to an apparent subsidence occasioned
by a general depression of the level of the sea cosmos i yet as
late as 1869 we have an essay by h trautschold76 in which is a
statement of the arguments which can be brought forward in favor of the
doctrine that the increase of the land above sea level is due to the
retirement of the sea77
as authentic and unimpeachable proofs of the former existence of the sea
where now it is absent lamarck cites the occurrence of fossils in rocks
inland lamarcks first paper on fossils was read to the institute in
1799 or about three years previous to the publication of the
hydrogologie he restricts the term fossils to vegetable and animal
remains since the word in his time was by some loosely applied to
minerals as well as fossils to anything dug out of the earth we find
fossils he says on dry land even in the middle of continents and
large islands and not only in places far removed from the sea but even
on mountains and in their bowels at considerable heights each part of
the earths surface having at some time been a veritable ocean bottom
he then quotes at length accounts of such instances from buffon and
notices their prodigious number and that while the greater number are
marine others are freshwater and terrestrial shells and the marine
shells may be divided into littoral and pelagic
  this distinction is very important to make because the
  consideration of fossils is as we have already said one of the
  principal means of knowing well the revolutions which have taken
  place on the surface of our globe this subject is of great
  importance and under this point of view it should lead naturalists
  to study fossil shells in order to compare them with their
  analogues which we can discover in the sea finally to carefully
  seek the places where each species lives the banks which are
  formed of them the different beds which these banks may present
  etc etc so that we do not believe it out of place to insert here
  the principal considerations which have already resulted from that
  which is known in this respect
the fossils which are found in the dry parts of the surface of the
globe are evident indications of a long sojourn of the sea in the very
places where we observe them under this heading after repeating the
statement previously made that fossils occur in all parts of the dry
land in the midst of the continents and on high mountains he inquires
by what cause so many marine shells could be found in the explored
parts of the world discarding the old idea that they are monuments of
the deluge transformed into fossils he denies that there was such a
general catastrophe as a universal deluge and goes on to say in his
assured but calm and philosophic way
  on the globe which we inhabit everything is submitted to continual
  and inevitable changes which result from the essential order of
  things they take place in truth with more or less promptitude or
  slowness according to the nature the condition or the situation
  of the objects nevertheless they are wrought in some time or other
  to nature time is nothing and it never presents a difficulty she
  always has it at her disposal and it is for her a means without
  limit with which she has made the greatest as well as the least
  things
  the changes to which everything in this world is subjected are
  changes not only of form and of nature but they are changes also of
  bulk and even of situation
  all the considerations stated in the preceding chapters should
  convince us that nothing on the surface of the terrestrial globe is
  immutable they teach us that the vast ocean which occupies so great
  a part of the surface of our globe cannot have its bed constantly
  fixed in the same place that the dry or exposed parts of this
  surface themselves undergo perpetual changes in their condition and
  that they are in turn successively invaded and abandoned by the sea
  there is indeed every evidence that these enormous masses of
  water continually displace themselves both their bed and their
  limits
  in truth these displacements which are never interrupted are in
  general only made with extreme and almost inappreciable slowness
  but they are in ceaseless operation and with such constancy that
  the ocean bottom which necessarily loses on one side while it gains
  on another has already without doubt spread over not only once
  but even several times every point of the surface of the globe
  if it is thus if each point of the surface of the terrestrial
  globe has been in turn dominated by the seasthat is to say has
  contributed to form the bed of those immense masses of water which
  constitute the oceanit should result 1 that the insensible but
  uninterrupted transfer of the bed of the ocean over the whole
  surface of the globe has given place to deposits of the remains of
  marine animals which we should find in a fossil state 2 that this
  translation of the ocean basin should be the reason why the dry
  portions of the earth are always more elevated than the level of the
  sea so that the old ocean bed should become exposed without being
  elevated above the sea and without consequently giving rise to the
  formation of mountains which we observe in so many different regions
  of the naked parts of our globe
thus littoral shells of many genera such as pectens tellin cockle
shells turban shells sabots etc madrepores and other littoral
polyps the bones of marine or of amphibious animals which have lived
near the sea and which occur as fossils are then unimpeachable
monuments of the sojourn of the sea on the points of the dry parts of
the globe where we observe their deposits and besides these occur
deepwater forms thus the encrinites the belemnites the
orthoceratites the ostracites the terebratules etc all animals
which habitually live at the bottom found for the most part among the
fossils deposited on the point of the globe in question are
unimpeachable witnesses which attest that this same place was once part
of the bottom or great depths of the sea he then attempts to prove
and does so satisfactorily that the shells he refers to are what he
calls deepwater plagiennes he proves the truth of his thesis by the
following facts
  1 we are already familiar with a marine grypha and different
  terebratul also marine shellfish which do not however live
  near shore 2 also the greatest depth which has been reached with
  the rake or the dredge is not destitute of molluscs since we find
  there a great number which only live at this depth and without
  instruments to reach and bring them up we should know nothing of the
  cones olives mitra many species of murex strombus etc 3
  finally since the discovery of a living encrinus drawn up on a
  sounding line from a great depth and where lives the animal or
  polyp in question it is not only possible to assure ourselves that
  at this depth there are other living animals but on the contrary we
  are strongly bound to think that other species of the same genus
  and probably other animals of different genera also live at the
  same depths all this leads one to admit with bruguire78 the
  existence of deepwater shellfish and polyps which like him i
  distinguish from littoral shells and polyps
  the two sorts of monuments of which i have above spoken namely
  littoral and deepsea fossils may be and often should be found
  separated by different beds in the same bank or in the same
  mountains since they have been deposited there at very different
  epochs but they may often be found mixed together because the
  movements of the water the currents submarine volcanoes etc
  have overturned the beds yet some regular deposits in water always
  tranquil would be left in quite distant beds every dry part of
  the earths surface when the presence or the abundance of marine
  fossils prove that formerly the sea has remained in that place has
  necessarily twice received for a single incursion of the sea
  littoral shells and once deepsea shells in three different
  depositsthis will not be disputed but as such an incursion of the
  sea can only be accomplished by a period of immense duration it
  follows that the littoral shells deposited at the first sojourn of
  the edge of the sea and constituting the first deposit have been
  destroyedthat is to say have not been preserved to the present
  time while the deepwater shells form the second deposit and there
  the littoral shells of the third deposit are in fact the only ones
  which now exist and which constitute the fossils that we see
he again asserts that these deposits could not be the result of any
sudden catastrophe because of the necessarily long sojourn of the sea
to account for the extensive beds of fossil shells the remains of
infinitely multiplied generations of shelled animals which have lived
in this place and have there successively deposited their dbris he
therefore supposes that these remains continually heaped up have
formed these shell banks become fossilized after the lapse of
considerable time and in which it is often possible to distinguish
different beds he then continues his line of anticatastrophic
reasoning and we must remember that in his time facts in biology and
geology were feebly grasped and scientific reasoning or induction was
in its infancy
  i would again inquire how in the supposition of a universal
  catastrophe there could have been preserved an infinity of delicate
  shells which the least shock would break but of which we now find a
  great number uninjured among other fossils how also could it happen
  that bivalve shells with which calcareous rocks and even those
  changed into a silicious condition are interlarded should be all
  still provided with their two valves as i have stated if the
  animals of these shells had not lived in these places
  there is no doubt but that the remains of so many molluscs that so
  many shells deposited and consequently changed into fossils and
  most of which were totally destroyed before their substance became
  silicified furnished a great part of the calcareous matter which we
  observe on the surface and in the upper beds of the earth
  nevertheless there is in the sea for the formation of calcareous
  matter a cause which is greater than shelled molluscs which is
  consequently still more powerful and to which must be referred
  ninetynine hundredths and indeed more of the calcareous matter
  occurring in nature this cause so important to consider is the
  existence of coralligenous polyps which we might therefore call
  testaceous polyps because like the testaceous molluscs these
  polyps have the faculty of forming by a transudation or a continual
  secretion of their bodies the stony and calcareous polypidom on
  which they live
  in truth these polyps are animals so small that a single one only
  forms a minute quantity of calcareous matter but in this case what
  nature does not obtain in any volume or in quantity from any one
  individual she simply receives by the number of animals in
  question through the enormous multiplicity of these animals and
  their astonishing fecunditynamely by the wonderful faculty they
  have of promptly regenerating of multiplying in a short time their
  generations successively and rapidly accumulating finally by the
  total amount of reunion of the products of these numerous little
  animals
  moreover it is a fact now well known and well established that the
  coralligenous polyps namely this great family of animals with
  coral stocks such as the millepores the madrepores astr
  meandrin etc prepare on a great scale at the bottom of the sea
  by a continual secretion of their bodies and as the result of their
  enormous multiplication and their accumulated generations the
  greatest part of the calcareous matter which exists the numerous
  coral stocks which these animals produce and whose bulk and numbers
  perpetually increase form in certain places islands of considerable
  extent fill up extensive bays gulfs and roadsteads in a word
  close harbors and entirely change the condition of coasts
  these enormous banks of madrepores and millepores heaped upon each
  other covered and intermingled with serpul different kinds of
  oysters patell barnacles and other shells fixed by their base
  form irregular mountains of an almost limitless extent
  but when after the lapse of considerable time the sea has left
  the places where these immense deposits are laid down then the slow
  but combined alteration that these great masses undergo left
  uncovered and exposed to the incessant action of the air light and
  a variable humidity changes them gradually into fossils and
  destroys their membranous or gelatinous part which is the readiest
  to decompose this alteration which the enormous masses of the
  corals in question continued to undergo caused their structure to
  gradually disappear and their great porosity unceasingly diminished
  the parts of these stony masses by displacing and again bringing
  together the molecules composing them so that undergoing a new
  aggregation these calcareous molecules obtained a number of points
  of contact and constituted harder and more compact masses it
  finally results that instead of the original masses of madrepores
  and millepores there occurs only masses of a compact calcareous
  rock which modern mineralogists have improperly called primitive
  limestone because seeing in it no traces of shells or corals
  they have mistaken these stony masses for deposits of a matter
  primitively existing in nature
he then reiterates the view that these deposits of marble and
limestones often forming mountain ranges could not have been the
result of a universal catastrophe and in a very modern way goes on to
specify what the limits of catastrophism are the only catastrophes
which a naturalist can reasonably admit as having taken place are
partial or local ones those dependent on causes acting in isolated
places such as the disturbances which are caused by volcanic eruptions
by earthquakes by local inundations by violent storms etc these
catastrophes are with reason admissible because we observe their
analogues and because we know that they often happen he then gives
examples of localities along the coast of france as at manche where
there are ranges of high hills made up of limestones containing gryph
ammonites and other deepwater shells
in the conclusion of the chapter after stating that the ocean has
repeatedly covered the greater part of the earth he then claims that
the displacement of the sea producing a constantly variable
inequality in the mass of the terrestrial radii has necessarily caused
the earths centre of gravity to vary as also its two poles79
moreover since it appears that this variation very irregular as it is
not being subjected to any limits it is very probable that each point
of the surface of the planet we inhabit is really in the case of
successively finding itself subjected to different climates he then
exclaims in eloquent profound and impassioned language
  how curious it is to see that such suppositions receive their
  confirmation from the consideration of the state of the earths
  surface and of its external crust from that of the nature of
  certain fossils found in abundance in the northern regions of the
  earth and whose analogues now live in warm climates finally in
  that of the ancient astronomical observations of the egyptians
  oh how great is the antiquity of the terrestrial globe and how
  small are the ideas of those who attribute to the existence of this
  globe a duration of six thousand and some hundred years since its
  origin down to our time
  the physiconaturalist and the geologist in this respect see things
  very differently for if they have given the matter the slightest
  considerationthe one the nature of fossils spread in such great
  numbers in all the exposed parts of the globe both in elevated
  situations and at considerable depths in the earth the other the
  number and disposition of the beds as also the nature and order of
  the materials which compose the external crust of this globe studied
  throughout a great part of its thickness and in the mountain
  masseshave they not had opportunities to convince themselves that
  the antiquity of this same globe is so great that it is absolutely
  beyond the power of man to appreciate it in an adequate way
  assuredly our chronologies do not extend back very far and they
  could only have been made by propping them up by fables traditions
  both oral and written become necessarily lost and it is in the
  nature of things that this should be so
  even if the invention of printing had been more ancient than it is
  what would have resulted at the end of ten thousand years
  everything changes everything becomes modified everything becomes
  lost or destroyed every living language insensibly changes its
  idiom at the end of a thousand years the writings made in any
  language can only be read with difficulty after two thousand years
  none of these writings will be understood besides wars vandalism
  the greediness of tyrants and of those who guide religious opinions
  who always rely on the ignorance of the human race and are supported
  by it how many are the causes as proved by history and the
  sciences of epochs after epochs of revolutions which have more or
  less completely destroyed them
  how many are the causes by which man loses all trace of that which
  has existed and cannot believe nor even conceive of the immense
  antiquity of the earth he inhabits
  how great will yet seem this antiquity of the terrestrial globe in
  the eyes of man when he shall form a just idea of the origin of
  living bodies as also of the causes of the development and of the
  gradual process of perfection of the organization of these bodies
  and especially when it will be conceived that time and favorable
  circumstances having been necessary to give existence to all the
  living species such as we actually see he is himself the last
  result and the actual maximum of this process of perfecting the
  limit terme of which if it exists cannot be known
in the fourth chapter of the book there is less to interest the reader
since the author mainly devotes it to a reiteration of the ideas of his
earlier works on physics and chemistry he claims that the minerals and
rocks composing the earths crust are all of organic origin including
even granite the thickness of this crust he thinks in the absence of
positive knowledge to be from three to four leagues or from nine to
twelve miles
after describing the mode of formation of minerals including agates
flint geodes etc he discusses the process of fossilization by
molecular changes silicious particles replacing the vegetable or animal
matter as in the case of fossil wood
while then the products of animals such as corals and molluscs are
limestones those of vegetables are humus and clay and all of these
deposits losing their less fixed principles pass into a silicious
condition and end by being reduced to quartz which is the earthy
element in its purest form the salts pyrites and metals only differ
from other minerals by the different circumstances under which they were
accumulated in their different proportions and in their much greater
amount of carbonic or acidific fire
regarding granite which he says naturalists very erroneously consider
as primitive he begins by observing that it is only by conjecture
that we should designate as primitive any matter whatever he recognizes
the fact that granite forms the highest mountains which are generally
arranged in more or less regular chains but he strangely assumes that
the constituents of granite ie felspar quartz and mica did not
exist before vegetables and that these minerals and their aggregation
into granite were the result of slow deposition in the ocean80 he
goes so far as to assert that the porphyritic rocks were not thus formed
in the sea but that they are the result of deposits carried down by
streams especially torrents flowing down from mountains gneiss he
thinks resulted from the detritus of granitic rocks by means of an
inappreciable cement and formed in a way analogous to that of the
porphyries
then he attacks the notion of leibnitz of a liquid globe in which all
mineral substances were precipitated tumultuously replacing this idea
by his chemical notion of the origin of the crystalline and volcanic
rocks
he is on firmer ground in explaining the origin of chalk and clay for
the rocks of the region about paris with which he was familiar are
sedimentary and largely of organic origin
in the addition pp 173188 following the fourth chapter lamarck
states that allowing for the variations in the intensity of the cause
of elevation of the land as the result of the accumulations of organic
matter he thinks he can without great error consider the mean rate as
324 mm 1 foot a century as a concrete example it has been observed
he says that one river valley has risen a foot higher in the space of
eleven years
passing by his speculations on the displacement of the poles of the
earth and on the elevations of the equatorial regions which will
dispense with the necessity of considering the earth as originally in a
liquid condition he allows that the terrestrial globe is not at all a
body entirely and truly solid but that it is a combination runion
of bodies more or less solid displaceable in their mass or in their
separate parts and among which there is a great number which undergo
continual changes in condition
it was of course too early in the history of geology for lamarck to
seize hold of the fact now so well known that the highest mountain
ranges as the alps pyrenees the caucasus atlas ranges and the
mountains of the moon he does not mention the himalayas are the
youngest and that the lowest mountains especially those in the more
northern parts of the continents are but the roots or remains of what
were originally lofty mountain ranges his idea on the contrary was
that the high mountain chains above mentioned were the remains of
ancient equatorial elevations which the fresh waters for an enormous
multitude of ages were in the process of progressively eroding and
wearing down
what he says of the formation of coal is noteworthy
  wherever there are masses of fossil wood buried in the earth the
  enormous subterranean beds of coal that are met with in different
  countries these are the witnesses of ancient encroachments of the
  sea over a country covered with forests it has overturned them
  buried them in deposits of clay and then after a time has
  withdrawn
in the appendix he briefly rehearses the laws of evolution as stated in
his opening lecture of his course given in the year ix 1801 and
which would be the subject of his projected work biologie the third
and last part of the terrestrial physics a work which was not
published but which was probably comprised in his philosophie
zoologique
the hydrogologie closes with a mmoire sur la matire du feu and
one sur la matire du son both being reprinted from the journal de

77 suess also in his anlitz etc substitutes for the folding of
the earths crust by tangential pressure the subsidence by gravity of
portions of the crust their falling in obliging the sea to follow
suess also explains the later transgressions of the sea by the
progressive accumulation of sediments which raise the level of the sea

in the deformation of the globe is vertical descent and not as neumayr

78 bruguire 17501799 a conchologist of great merit his
descriptions of new species were clear and precise in his paper on the
coal mines of the mountains of cevennes choix de mmoires dhist nat
1792 he made the first careful study of the coal formation in the
cevennes including its beds of coal sandstone and shale a de
jussieu had previously supposed that the immense deposits of coal were
due to sudden cataclysms or to one of the great revolutions of the earth
during which the seas of the east or west indies having been driven as
far as into europe had deposited on its soil all these exotic plants to
be found there after having torn them up on their way
but bruguire who is to be reckoned among the early uniformitarians
says that the capacity for observation is now too wellinformed to be
contented with such a theory and he explains the formation of coal
deposits in the following essentially modern way
the stores of coal although formed of vegetable substances owe their
origin to the sea it is when the places where we now find them were
covered by its waters that these prodigious masses of vegetable
substances were gathered there and this operation of nature which
astonishes the imagination far from depending on any extraordinary
commotion of the globe seems on the contrary to be only the result of
time of an order of things now existing and especially that of slow
changes i pp 116 117
the proofs he brings forward are the horizontality of the beds both of
coal and deposits between them the marine shells in the sandstones the
fossil fishes intermingled with the plant remains in the shales
moreover some of the coal deposits are covered by beds of limestone
containing marine shells which lived in the sea at a very great depth
the alternation of these beds the great mass of vegetable matter which
lived at small distances from the soil which conceals them and the
occurrence of these beds so high up show that at this time europe was
almost wholly covered by the sea the summits of the alps and the
pyrenees being then as he says so many small islands in the midst of
the ocean he also intimates that the climate when these ferns bamboo
and banana lived was warmer than that of europe at present
in this essay then we see a great advance in correctness of geological
observation and reasoning over any previous writers while its
suggestions were appreciated and adopted by lamarck
79 hooke had previously in order to explain the presence of tropical
fossil shells in england indulged in a variety of speculations
concerning changes in the position of the axis of the earths rotation
a shifting of the earths centre of gravity analogous to the
revolutions of the magnetic pole etc lyells principles see also

chapter ix
lamarck the founder of invertebrate palontology
it was fortunate for palontology that the two greatest zologists of
the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries
lamarck and cuvier lived in the paris basin a vast cemetery of corals
shells and mammals and not far from extensive deposits of cretaceous
rocks packed with fossil invertebrates with their then unrivalled
knowledge of recent or existing forms they could restore the
assemblages of extinct animals which peopled the cretaceous ocean and
more especially the tertiary seas and lakes
lamarck drew his supplies of tertiary shells from the tertiary beds
situated within a radius of from twentyfive to thirty miles from the
centre of paris and chiefly from the village of grignon about ten
miles west of paris beyond versailles and still a rich collecting
ground for the students of the museum and sorbonne he acknowledges the
aid received from defrance81 who had already collected at grignon
five hundred species of fossil shells threefourths of which he says
had not then been described
lamarcks first essay sur les fossiles on fossils in general was
published at the end of his systme des animaux sans vertbres
pp 401411 in 1801 a year before the publication of the
hydrogologie i give the name fossils he says to remains of
living beings changed by their long sojourn in the earth or under
water but whose forms and structure are still recognizable
  from this point of view the bones of vertebrate animals and the
  remains of testaceous molluscs of certain crustacea of many
  echinoderms coral polyps when after having been for a long time
  buried in the earth or hidden under the sea will have undergone an
  alteration which while changing their substance has nevertheless
  destroyed neither their forms their figures nor the special
  features of their structures
he goes on to say that the animal parts having been destroyed the shell
remains being composed of calcareous matter this shell then has lost
its lustre its colors and often even its nacre if it had any and in
this altered condition it is usually entirely white in some cases where
the shells have remained for a long period buried in a mud of some
particular color the shell receives the same color
  in france the fossil shells of courtagnon near reims grignon near
  versailles of what was formerly touraine etc are almost all
  still in this calcareous state having more or less completely lost
  their animal partsnamely their lustre their peculiar colors and
  their nacre
  other fossils have undergone such an alteration that not only have
  they lost their animal portion but their substance has been changed
  into a silicious matter i give to this second kind of fossil the
  name of silicious fossils and examples of this kind are the
  different oysters des ostracites many terebratul des
  terebratulites trigoni ammonites echinites encrinites etc
  the fossils of which i have just spoken are in part buried in the
  earth and others lie scattered over its surface they occur in all
  the exposed parts of our globe in the middle even of the largest
  continents and what is very remarkable they occur on mountains up
  to very considerable altitudes in many places the fossils buried in
  the earth form banks extending several leagues in length82
conchologists he says did not care to collect or study fossil shells
because they had lost their lustre colors and beauty and they were
rejected from collections on this account as dead and uninteresting
but he adds since attention has been drawn to the fact that these
fossils are extremely valuable monuments for the study of the
revolutions which have taken place in different regions of the earth
and of the changes which the beings living there have themselves
successively undergone in my lectures i have always insisted on these
considerations consequently the search for and study of fossils have
excited special interest and are now the objects of the greatest
interest to naturalists
lamarck then combats the views of several naturalists undoubtedly
referring to cuvier that the fossils are extinct species and that the
earth has passed through a general catastrophe un bouleversement
universel with the result that a multitude of species of animals and
plants were consequently absolutely lost or destroyed and remarks in
the following telling and somewhat derisive language
  a universal catastrophe bouleversement which necessarily
  regulates nothing mixes up and disperses everything is a very
  convenient way to solve the problem for those naturalists who wish
  to explain everything and who do not take the trouble to observe
  and investigate the course followed by nature as respects its
  production and everything which constitutes its domain i have
  already elsewhere said what should be thought of this socalled
  universal overturning of the globe i return to fossils
  it is very true that of the great quantity of fossil shells
  gathered in the different countries of the earth there are yet but
  a very small number of species whose living or marine analogues are
  known nevertheless although this number may be very small which
  no one will deny it is enough to suppress the universality
  announced in the proposition cited above
  it is well to remark that among the fossil shells whose marine or
  living analogues are not known there are many which have a form
  closely allied to shells of the same genera known to be now living
  in the sea however they differ more or less and cannot be
  rigorously regarded as the same species as those known to be living
  since they do not perfectly resemble them these are it is said
  extinct species
  i am convinced that it is possible never to find among fresh or
  marine shells any shells perfectly similar to the fossil shells of
  which i have just spoken i believe i know the reason i proceed to
  succinctly indicate and i hope that it will then be seen that
  although many fossil shells are different from all the marine
  shells known this does not prove that the species of these shells
  are extinct but only that these species have changed as the result
  of time and that actually they have different forms from those
  individuals whose fossil remains we have found
then he goes on in the same strain as in the opening discourse saying
that nothing terrestrial remains constant that geological changes are
continually occurring and that these changes produce in living
organisms a diversity of habits a different mode of life and as the
result modifications or developments in their organs and in the shape of
their parts
  we should still realize that all the modifications which the
  organism undergoes in its structure and form as the result of the
  influence of circumstances which would influence this being are
  propagated by generation and that after a long series of ages not
  only will it be able to form new species new genera and even new
  orders but also each species will even necessarily vary in its
  organization and in its forms
  we should not be more surprised then if among the numerous fossils
  which occur in all the dry parts of the globe and which offer us the
  remains of so many animals which have formerly existed there should
  be found so few of which we know the living analogues if there is
  in this on the contrary anything which should astonish us it is
  to find that among these numerous fossil remains of beings which
  have lived there should be known to us some whose analogues still
  exist from a germ to a vast multitude of living forms of different
  and ascending grades of perfection ending in man
  this fact as our collection of fossils proves should lead us to
  suppose that the fossil remains of the animals whose living
  analogues we know are the less ancient fossils the species to which
  each of them belongs had doubtless not yet time to vary in any of
  its forms
  we should then never expect to find among the living species the
  totality of those that we meet with in the fossil state and yet we
  cannot conclude that any species can really be lost or extinct it
  is undoubtedly possible that among the largest animals some species
  have been destroyed as a result of the multiplication of man in the
  regions where they live but this conjecture cannot be based on the
  consideration of fossils alone we can only form an opinion in this
  respect when all the inhabited parts of the globe will have become
  perfectly known
lamarck did not have as we now have a knowledge of the geological
succession of organic forms the comparatively full and detailed view
which we possess of the different vast assemblages of plant and animal
life which have successively peopled the surface of our earth is a
vision on which his eyes never rested his slight piecemeal glimpse of
the animal life of the paris basin and of the few other extinct forms
then known was all he had to depend upon or reason from he was not
disposed to believe that the thread of life once begun in the earliest
times could be arbitrarily broken by catastrophic means that there was
no relation whatever between the earlier and later faunas he utterly
opposed cuviers view that species once formed could ever be lost or
become extinct without ancestors or descendants he on the contrary
believed that species underwent a slow modification and that the fossil
forms are the ancestors of the animals now living moreover lamarck was
the inventor of the first genealogical tree his phylogeny in the
second volume of his philosophie zoologique p 463 proves that he
realized that the forms leading up to the existing ones were practically
extinct as we now use the word lamarck in theory was throughout as
houssay well says at one with us who are now living but a century
behind us in knowledge of the facts needed to support his theory
in this first published expression of his views on palontology we find
the following truths enumerated on which the science is based 1 the
great length of geological time 2 the continuous existence of animal
life all through the different geological periods without sudden total
extinctions and as sudden recreations of new assemblages 3 the
physical environment remaining practically the same throughout in
general but with 4 continual gradual but not catastrophic changes in
the relative distribution of land and sea and other modifications in the
physical geography changes which 5 caused corresponding changes in
the habitat and 6 consequently in the habits of the living beings so
that there has been all through geological history a slow modification
of lifeforms
thus lamarcks idea of creation is evolutional rather than
uniformitarian there was from his point of view not simply a
uniform march along a dead level but a progression a change from the
lower or generalized to the higher or specializedan evolution or
unfolding of organic life in his effort to disprove catastrophism he
failed to clearly see that species as we style them became extinct
though really the changes in the species practically amounted to
extinctions of the earlier species as such the little that was known
to lamarck at the time he wrote prevented his knowing that species
became extinct as we say or recognizing the fact that while some
species genera and even orders may rise culminate and die others
are modified while a few persist from one period to another he did
however see clearly that taking plant and animal life as a whole it
underwent a slow modification the later forms being the descendants of
the earlier and this truth is the central one of modern palontology
lamarcks first memoir on fossil shells in which he described many new
species was published in 1802 after the appearance of his
hydrogologie to which he refers it was the first of a series of
descriptive papers which appeared at intervals from 1802 to 1806 he
does not fail to open the series of memoirs with some general remarks
which prove his broad philosophic spirit that characterizing the
founder of a new science he begins by saying that the fossil forms have
their analogues in the tropical seas he claims that there was evident
proof that these molluscs could not have lived in a climate like that of
places in which they now occur instancing nautilius pompilius which
now lives in the seas of warm countries also the presence of exotic
ferns palms fossil amber fossil gum elastic besides the occurrence
of fossil crocodiles and elephants both in france and germany83
hence there have been changes of climate since these forms flourished
and he adds the intervals between these changes of climate were
stationary periods whose duration was practically without limit he
assigns a duration to these stationary or intermediate periods of from
three to five million years eacha duration infinitely small relative
to those required for all the changes of the earths surface
he refers in an appreciative way to the first special treatise on fossil
shells ever published that of an englishman named brander84 who
collected the shells out of the cliffs by the seacoast between christ
church and lymington but more especially about the cliffs by the
village of hordwell where the strata are filled with these fossils
lamarck working upon collections of tertiary shells from grignon and
also from courtagnon near reims with the aid of branders work showed
that these beds not known to be eocene extended into hampshire
england thus being the first to correlate by their fossils though in a
limited way to be sure the tertiary beds of france with those of
england
how he at a later period 1805 regarded fossils and their relations to
geology may be seen in his later memoirs sur les fossiles des environs
de paris85
  the determination of the characters both generic and specific of
  animals of which we find the fossil remains in almost all the dry
  parts of the continents and large islands of our globe will be from
  several points of view a thing extremely useful to the progress of
  natural history at the outset the more this determination is
  advanced the more will it tend to complete our knowledge in regard
  to the species which exist in nature and of those which have
  existed as it is true that some of them have been lost as we have
  reason to believe at least as concerns the large animals moreover
  this same determination will be singularly advantageous for the
  advancement of geology for the fossil remains in question may be
  considered from their nature their condition and their situation
  as authentic monuments of the revolutions which the surface of our
  globe has undergone and they can throw a strong light on the nature
  and character of these revolutions
this series of papers on the fossils of the paris tertiary basin
extended through the first eight volumes of the annales and were
gathered into a volume published in 1806 in his descriptions his work
was comparative the fossil species being compared with their living
representatives the thirty plates containing 483 figures representing
184 species exclusive of those figured by brard were afterwards
published with the explanations but not the descriptions as a
separate volume in 182386 this the text published in 1806 is the
first truly scientific palontological work ever published preceding
cuviers ossemens fossiles by six years
when we consider lamarcksat his time unrivalledknowledge of
molluscs his philosophical treatment of the relations of the study of
fossils to geology his correlation of the tertiary beds of england with
those of france and his comparative descriptions of the fossil forms
represented by the existing shells it seems not unreasonable to regard
him as the founder of invertebrate palontology as cuvier was of
vertebrate or mammalian palontology
we have entered the claim that lamarck was one of the chief founders of
palontology and the first french author of a genuine detailed
palontological treatise it must be admitted therefore that the
statement generally made that cuvier was the founder of this science
should be somewhat modified though he may be regarded as the chief
founder of vertebrate palontology
in this field however cuvier had his precursors not only in germany
and holland but also in france
our information as to the history of the rise of vertebrate palontology
is taken from blainvilles posthumous work entitled cuvier et geoffroy
sainthilaire87 in this work a severe critical and perhaps not
always sufficiently appreciative account of cuviers character and work
we find an excellent history of the first beginnings of vertebrate
palontology blainville has little or nothing to say of the first steps
in invertebrate palontology and singularly enough not a word of
lamarcks principles and of his papers and works on fossil shellsa
rather strange oversight because he was a friend and admirer of
lamarck and succeeded him in one of the two departments of
invertebrates created at the museum dhistoire naturelle after lamarcks
death
blainville who by the way was the first to propose the word
palontology shows that the study of the great extinct mammals had
for forty years been held in great esteem in germany before faujas and
cuvier took up the subject in france two frenchmen also before 1789
had examined mammalian bones thus bernard de jussieu knew of the
existence in a fossil state of the teeth of the hippopotamus
guettard88 published in 1760 a memoir on the fossil bones of aix en
provence lamanon 1780178389 in a beautiful memoir described a
head almost entire found in the gypsum beds of paris daubenton had
also slightly anticipated cuviers law of correlation giving a very
remarkable example of the mode of procedure to follow in order to solve
these kinds of questions by the way in which he had recognized a bone of
a giraffe whose skeleton he did not possess de blainville
  but it was especially in germany in the hands of pallas camper
  blumenbach anatomists and physicians also those of walch merck
  hollmann esper rosenmller and collini who was not however
  occupied with natural history of beckman who had even discussed
  the subject in a general way de reductione rerum fossilium ad
  genera naturalia prototyporumnov comm soc scient
  goettingensis t ii that palontology applied to quadrupeds had
  already settled all that pertained to the largest species
as early as 1764 hollmann90 had admirably identified the bones of a
rhinoceros found in a bonedeposit of the hartz although he had no
skeleton of this animal for comparison
pallas in a series of memoirs dating from 1773 had discovered and
distinguished the species of siberian elephant or mammoth the
rhinoceros and the large species of oxen and buffalo whose bones were
found in such abundance in the quaternary deposits of siberia and as
blainville says if he did not distinguish the species it was because
at this epoch the question of the distinction of the two species of
rhinoceros and of elephants in the absence of material could not be
solved this solution however was made by the dutch anatomist camper
in 1777 who had brought together at amsterdam a collection of skeletons
and skulls of the existing species which enabled him for the first time
to make the necessary comparisons between the extinct and living
species a few years later 1780 blumenbach confirmed campers
identification and gave the name of elephas primigenius to the
siberian mammoth
  beckman says blainville as early as 1772 had even published a
  very good memoir on the way in which we should consider fossil
  organic bodies he was also the first to propose using the name
  fossilia instead of petrefacta and to name the science which
  studies fossils oryctology it was also he who admitted that these
  bodies should be studied with reference to the class order genus
  species as we would do with a living being and he compared them
  which he called prototypes91 with their analogues he then
  passes in review following the zological order the fossils which
  had been discovered by naturalists he even described one of them as
  a new species besides citing with an erudition then rare all the
  authors and all the works where they were described he did no more
  than to indicate but not name each species thus he was the means of
  soon producing a number of german authors who made little advance
  from lack of anatomical knowledge but afterwards the task fell into
  the hands of men capable of giving to the newly created palontology
  a remarkable impulse and one which since then has not abated
blumenbach92 the most eminent and allround german anatomist and
physiologist of his time one of the founders of anthropology as well as
of palontology had meanwhile established the fact that there were two
species of fossil cavebear which he named ursus spelus and u
arctoideus he began to publish his archologia telluris93 the
first part of which appeared in 1803
from blainvilles useful summary we learn that blumenbach mainly
limiting his work to the fossils of hanover aimed at studying fossils
in order to explain the revolutions of the earth
  hence the order he proposed to follow was not that commonly
  followed in treatises on oryctology namely systematic following
  the classes and the orders of the animal and vegetable kingdom but
  in a chronological order in such a way as to show that the classes
  so far as it was possible to conjecture with any probability were
  established after or in consequence of the different revolutions of
  the earth
  thus as we see all the great questions more or less insoluble
  which the study of fossil organic bodies can offer were raised and
  even discussed by the celebrated professor of gttingen as early as
  1803 before anything of the sort could have arisen from the essays
  of m g cuvier the errors of distribution in the classes committed
  by blumenbach were due to the backward state of geology
the political troubles of germany which also bore heavily upon the
university of gttingen probably brought blumenbachs labors to an end
for after a second specimen of his work of less importance than the
first the archologia telluris was discontinued
the french geologist faujas94 who also published several articles on
fossil animals ceased his labors and now cuvier began his memorable
work
the field of the labors and triumphs of palontology were now
transferred to france we have seen that the year 1793 when lamarck and
geoffroy sainthilaire were appointed to fill the new zological chairs
and the latter had in 1795 called cuvier from normandy to paris was a
time of renascence of the natural sciences in france cuvier began a
course of lectures on comparative anatomy at the museum of natural
history he was more familiar than any one else in france with the
progress in natural science in germany and had felt the stimulus
arising from this source besides as blainville stated he was also
impelled by the questions boldly raised by faujas in his geological
lectures who was somewhat of the school of buffon cuvier moreover
had at his disposition the collection of skeletons of the museum which
was frequently increased by those of the animals which died in the
menagerie with his knowledge of comparative anatomy of which after
vicqdazyr he was the chief founder and with the gypsum quarry of
montmartre that rich cemetery of tertiary mammals to draw from he had
the whole field before him and rapidly built up his own vast
reputation and thus added to the glory of france
his first contribution to palontology95 appeared in 1798 in which he
announced his intention of publishing an extended work on fossil bones
of quadrupeds to restore the skeletons and to compare them with those
now living and to determine their relations and differences but says
blainville in the list of thirty or forty species which he enumerates
in his tableau none was apparently discovered by him unless it was the
species of dog of montmartre which he afterward referred to his new
genera palotherium and anaplotherium in 1801 le 26 brumaire an ix
he published by order of the institut the programme of a work on
fossil quadrupeds with an increased number of species but as
blainville states it was not until 1804 and in tome iii of the
annales du musum namely more than three years after his programme
that he began his publications by fragments and without any order while
these publications lasted more than eight years before they were
collected into a general work this corps douvrage being the
ossemens fossiles which was issued in 1812 in four quarto volumes
with an atlas of plates
it is with much interest then that we turn to cuviers great work
which brought him such immediate and widespread fame in order to see
how he treated his subject his general views are contained in the
preliminary remarks in his wellknown essay on the theory of the earth
1812 which was followed in 1821 by his discours sur les rvolutions
de la surface du globe
it was written in a more attractive and vigorous style than the writings
of lamarck more elegant concise and with less repetition but it is
destitute of the philosophic grasp and is not the work of a profound
thinker but rather of a man of talent who was an industrious collector
and accurate describer of fossil bones of a high order to be sure but
analytical rather than synthetical of one knowing well the value of
carefully ascertained and demonstrated facts but too cautious if he
was by nature able to do so to speculate on what may have seemed to him
too few facts it is also the work of one who fell in with the current
views of the time as to the general bearing of his discoveries on
philosophy and theology believing as he did in the universality of the
noachian deluge
like lamarck cuvier independently made use of the comparative method
the foundation method in palontology and cuviers wellknown law of
correlation of structures so well exemplified in the vertebrates was
a fresh new contribution to philosophical biology
in his discours speaking of the difficulty of determining the bones
of fossil quadrupeds as compared with fossil shells or the remains of
fishes he remarks96
  happily comparative anatomy possessed a principle which well
  developed was capable of overcoming every difficulty it was that
  of the correlation of forms in organic beings by means of which
  each kind of organism can with exactitude be recognized by every
  fragment of each of its partsevery organized being he adds
  forms an entire system unique and closed whose organs mutually
  correspond and concur in the same definite action by a reciprocal
  reaction hence none of these parts can change without the other
  being also modified and consequently each of them taken
  separately indicates and produces donne all the others
  a claw a shoulderblade a condyle a leg or armbone or any
  other bone separately considered enables us to discover the kind of
  teeth to which they have belonged so also reciprocally we may
  determine the form of the other bones from the teeth thus
  commencing our investigation by a careful survey of any one bone by
  itself a person who is sufficiently master of the laws of organic
  structure can reconstruct the entire animal the smallest facet of
  bone the smallest apophysis has a determinate character relative
  to the class the order the genus and the species to which it
  belongs so that even when one has only the extremity of a
  wellpreserved bone he can with careful examination assisted by
  analogy and exact comparison determine all these things as surely
  as if he had before him the entire animal
cuvier adds that he has enjoyed every kind of advantage for such
investigations owing to his fortunate situation in the museum of natural
history and that by assiduous researches for nearly thirty years97
he has collected skeletons of all the genera and subgenera of
quadrupeds with those of many species in certain genera and several
individuals of certain species with such means it was easy for him to
multiply his comparisons and to verify in all their details the
applications of his laws
such is the famous law of correlation of parts of cuvier it could be
easily understood by the layman and its enunciation added vastly to the
popular reputation and prestige of the young science of comparative
anatomy98 in his time and applied to the forms occurring in the
paris basin it was a most valuable ingenious and yet obvious method
and even now is the principal rule the palontologist follows in
identifying fragments of fossils of any class but it has its
limitations and it goes without saying that the more complete the
fossil skeleton of a vertebrate or the remains of an arthropod the
more complete will be our conception of the form of the extinct
organism it may be misleading in the numerous cases of convergence and
of generalized forms which now abound in our palontological
collections we can well understand how guarded one must be in working
out the restorations of dinosaurs and fossil birds of the permian and
triassic theromorphs and the tertiary creodonts as compared with
existing carnivora
as the late o c marsh99 observed
  we know today that unknown extinct animals cannot be restored from
  a single tooth or claw unless they are very similar to forms already
  known had cuvier himself applied his methods to many forms from
  the early tertiary or older formations he would have failed if for
  instance he had had before him the disconnected fragments of an
  eocene tillodont he would undoubtedly have referred a molar tooth to
  one of his pachyderms an incisor tooth to a rodent and a claw bone
  to a carnivore the tooth of a hesperornis would have given him no
  possible hint of the rest of the skeleton nor its swimming feet the
  slightest clue to the ostrichlike sternum or skull and yet the
  earnest belief in his own methods led cuvier to some of his most
  important discoveries
let us now examine from cuviers own words in his discours not
relying on the statements of his expositors or followers just what he
taught notwithstanding the clear utterances of his older colleague
lamarck whose views he set aside and either ignored or ridiculed100
                                   
he at the outset affirms that nature has like mankind also had her
intestine wars and that the surface of the globe has been much
convulsed by successive revolutions and various catastrophes
as first proof of the revolutions on the surface of the earth he
instances fossil shells which in the lowest and most level parts of the
earth are almost everywhere in such a perfect state of preservation
that even the smallest of them retain their most delicate parts their
sharpest ridges and their finest and tenderest processes
  we are therefore forcibly led to believe not only that the sea has
  at one period or another covered all our plains but that it must
  have remained there for a long time and in a state of tranquillity
  which circumstance was necessary for the formation of deposits so
  extensive so thick in part so solid and filled with the exuvi of
  aquatic animals
but the traces of revolutions become still more marked when we ascend a
little higher and approach nearer to the foot of the great mountain
chains hence the strata are variously inclined and at times vertical
contain shells differing specifically from those of beds on the plains
below and are covered by horizontal later beds thus the sea previous
to the formation of the horizontal strata had formed others which by
some means have been broken lifted up and overturned in a thousand
ways there had therefore been also at least one change in the basin of
that sea which preceded ours it had also experienced at least one
revolution
he then gives proofs that such revolutions have been numerous
  thus the great catastrophes which have produced revolutions in the
  basins of the sea were preceded accompanied and followed by
  changes in the nature of the fluid and of the substances which it
  held in solution and when the surface of the seas came to be
  divided by islands and projecting ridges different changes took
  place in every separate basin
we now come to the cuvierian doctrine par excellence one in which he
radically differs from lamarcks views as to the genetic relations
between the organisms of successive strata
  amid these changes of the general fluid it must have been almost
  impossible for the same kind of animals to continue to live nor did
  they do so in fact their species and even their genera change
  with the strata and although the same species occasionally recur at
  small distances it is generally the case that the shells of the
  ancient strata have forms peculiar to themselves that they
  gradually disappear till they are not to be seen at all in the
  recent strata still less in the existing seas in which indeed we
  never discover their corresponding species and where several even
  of their genera are not to be found that on the contrary the
  shells of the recent strata resemble as regards the genus those
  which still exist in the sea and that in the last formed and
  loosest of these strata there are some species which the eye of the
  most expert naturalists cannot distinguish from those which at
  present inhabit the ocean
  in animal nature therefore there has been a succession of changes
  corresponding to those which have taken place in the chemical nature
  of the fluid and when the sea last receded from our continent its
  inhabitants were not very different from those which it still
  continues to support
he then refers to successive irruptions and retreats of the sea the
final result of which however has been a universal depression of the
level of the sea
  these repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea have neither been
  slow nor gradual most of the catastrophes which have occasioned
  them have been sudden
he then adds his proofs of the occurrence of revolutions before the
existence of living beings like lamarck cuvier was a wernerian and in
speaking of the older or primitive crystalline rocks which contain no
vestige of fossils he accepted the view of the german theorist in
geology that granites forming the axis of mountain chains were formed
in a fluid
we must give cuvier the credit of fully appreciating the value of
fossils as being what he calls historical documents also for
appreciating the fact that there were a number of revolutions marking
either the incoming or end of a geological period but as he failed to
perceive the unity of organization in organic beings and their genetic
relationship as had been indicated by lamarck and by geoffroy
st hilaire so in geological history he did not grasp as did lamarck
the vast extent of geological time and the general uninterrupted
continuity of geological events he was analytic thoroughly believing
in the importance of confining himself to the discovery of facts and
considering the multitude of fantastic hypotheses and suggestions of
previous writers of the eighteenth century this was sound sensible
and thoroughly scientific but unfortunately he did not stop here
master of facts concerning the fossil mammals of the paris basin he
alsousually cautious and always a shrewd man of the worldfell into
the error of writing his theory of the world and of going to the
extreme length of imagining universal catastrophes where there are but
local ones a universal noachian deluge when there was none and of
assuming that there were at successive periods thoroughgoing total and
sudden extinctions of life and as sudden recreations cuvier was a
natural leader of men a ready debater and a clear forcible writer a
man of great executive force but lacking in insight and imagination he
dominated scientific paris and france he was the lawgiver and autocrat
of the laboratories of paris and the views of quiet thoughtful
profound scholars such as lamarck and geoffroy st hilaire were
disdainfully pushed aside overborne and the progress of geological
thought was arrested while owing to his great prestige the rising
views of the lamarckian school were nipped in the bud every one after
the appearance of cuviers great work on fossil mammals and of his
rgne animal was a cuvierian and down to the time of lyell and of
charles darwin all naturalists with only here and there an exception
were pronounced cuvierians in biology and geologycatastrophists rather
than uniformitarians we now with the increase of knowledge of physical
and historical geology of the succession of life on the earth of the
unity of organization pervading that life from monad to man all through
the ages from the precambrian to the present age know that there were
vast periods of preparation followed by crises perhaps geologically
brief when there were widespread changes in physical geography which
reacted on the lifeforms rendering certain ones extinct and modifying
others but this conception is entirely distinct from the views of
cuvier and his school101 which may in the light of our present
knowledge properly be deemed not only totally inadequate but childish
and fantastic
cuvier cites the view of dolomieu the wellknown geologist and
mineralogist 17701801 only however to reject it who went to the
extent of supposing that tides of seven or eight hundred fathoms have
carried off from time to time the bottom of the ocean throwing it up in
mountains and hills on the primitive valleys and plains of the
continents dolomieu in journal de physique
cuvier met with objections to his extreme views in his discourse he
thus endeavors to answer the following objection which has already
been stated against my conclusions
  why may not the nonexisting races of mammiferous land quadrupeds
  be mere modifications or varieties of those ancient races which we
  now find in the fossil state which modifications may have been
  produced by change of climate and other local circumstances and
  since raised to the present excessive differences by the operation
  of similar causes during a long succession of ages
  this objection may appear strong to those who believe in the
  indefinite possibility of change of forms in organized bodies and
  think that during a succession of ages and by alternations of
  habits all the species may change into each other or one of them
  give birth to all the rest yet to these persons the following
  answer may be given from their own system if the species have
  changed by degrees as they assume we ought to find traces of this
  gradual modification thus between the palotherium and the species
  of our own days we should be able to discover some intermediate
  forms and yet no such discovery has ever been made since the
  bowels of the earth have not preserved monuments of this strange
  genealogy we have a right to conclude that the ancient and now
  extinct species were as permanent in their forms and characters as
  those which exist at present or at least that the catastrophe
  which destroyed them did not have sufficient time for the production
  of the changes that are alleged to have taken place
cuvier thus emphatically rejects all idea that any of the tertiary
mammals could have been the ancestral forms of those now existing
  from all these wellestablished facts there does not seem to be
  the smallest foundation for supposing that the new genera which i
  have discovered or established among extraneous fossils such as the
  palotherium anaplotherium megalonynx mastodon
  pterodactylis etc have ever been the sources of any of our
  present animals which only differ as far as they are influenced by
  time or climate even if it should prove true which i am far from
  believing to be the case that the fossil elephants rhinoceroses
  elks and bears do not differ further from the present existing
  species of the same genera than the present races of dogs differ
  among themselves this would by no means be a sufficient reason to
  conclude that they were of the same species since the races or
  varieties of dogs have been influenced by the trammels of
  domestication which these other animals never did and indeed never
  could experience102
the extreme views of cuvier as to the frequent renewal and extinction of
life were afterward in 1850 carried out to an exaggerated extent by
dorbigny who maintained that the life of the earth must have become
extinct and again renewed twentyseven times similar views were held by
agassiz who however maintained the geological succession of animals
and the parallelism between their embryonic development and geological
succession the two foundation stones of the biogenetic law of haeckel
but immediately after the publication of cuviers ossemens fossiles
as early as 1813 von schlotheim the founder of vegetable palontology
refused to admit that each set of beds was the result of such a
thoroughgoing revolution103
at a later date bronn demonstrated that certain species indeed really
passed from one formation to another and though stratigraphic
boundaries are often barriers confining the persistence of some form
still this is not an absolute rule since the species in nowise appear
in their entirety104 at present the persistence of genera like
saccamina lingula ceratodus etc from one age to another or even
through two or more geological ages is well known while atrypa
reticulatus a species of worldwide distribution lived from near the
beginning of the upper silurian to the waverly or beginning of the
carboniferous age
such were the views of the distinguished founder of vertebrate
palontology when we compare the hydrogologie of lamarck with
cuviers discours we see though some erroneous views some very
fantastic conceptions are held in common with others of his time in
regard to changes of level of the land and the origin of the crystalline
rocks that it did contain the principles upon which modern palontology
is founded while those of cuvier are now in the limboso densely
populatedof exploded illfounded theories
our claim that lamarck should share with cuvier the honor of being a
founder of palontology105 is substantiated by the philosophic lyell
who as early as 1836 in his principles of geology expresses the same
view in the following words the labors of cuvier in comparative
osteology and of lamarck in recent and fossil shells had raised these
departments of study to a rank of which they had never previously been
deemed susceptible
our distinguished american palontologist the late o c marsh takes
the same view and draws the following parallel between the two great
french naturalists
  in looking back from this point of view the philosophical breadth
  of lamarcks conclusions in comparison with those of cuvier is
  clearly evident the invertebrates on which lamarck worked offered
  less striking evidence of change than the various animals
  investigated by cuvier yet they led lamarck directly to evolution
  while cuvier ignored what was before him on this point and rejected
  the proof offered by others both pursued the same methods and had
  an abundance of material on which to work yet the facts observed
  induced cuvier to believe in catastrophes and lamarck in the
  uniform course of nature cuvier declared species to be permanent
  lamarck that they were descended from others both men stand in the
  first rank in science but lamarck was the prophetic genius half a
  century in advance of his time106
footnotes
81 although defrance born 1759 died in 1850 aided lamarck in
collecting tertiary shells his earliest palontological paper on
hipponyx did not appear until the year 1819
82 in a footnote lamarck refers to an unpublished work which probably
formed a part of the hydrogologie published in the following year

eaus sur la surface du globe terrestre et des indices du dplacement

83 it should be stated that the first observer to inaugurate the
comparative method was that remarkable forerunner of modern
palontologists steno the dane who was for a while a professor at
padua in 1669 in his treatise entitled de solido intra solidum
naturaliter contento which lyell translates on gems crystals and
organic petrefactions inclosed within solid rocks he showed by
dissecting a shark from the mediterranean that certain fossil teeth
found in tuscany were also those of some shark he had also compared
the shells discovered in the italian strata with living species pointed
out their resemblance and traced the various gradations from shells
merely calcined or which had only lost their animal gluten to those
petrefactions in which there was a perfect substitution of stony matter
lyells principles p 25 about twenty years afterwards the
english philosopher robert hooke in a discourse on earthquakes written
in 1688 but published posthumously in 1705 was aware that the fossil
ammonites nautili and many other shells and fossil skeletons found in
england were of different species from any then known but he doubted
whether the species had become extinct observing that the knowledge of
naturalists of all the marine species especially those inhabiting the
deep sea was very deficient in some parts of his writings however he
leans to the opinion that species had been lost some species he
observes with great sagacity are peculiar to certain places and not
to be found elsewhere turtles and such large ammonites as are found in
portland seem to have been the productions of hotter countries and he
thought that england once lay under the sea within the torrid zone
lyells principles
gesner the botanist of zurich also published in 1758 an excellent
treatise on petrefactions and the changes of the earth which they
testify he observed that some fossils such as ammonites gryphites
belemnites and other shells are either of unknown species or found
only in the indian and other distant seas lyells principles
geikie estimates very highly guettards labors in palontology saying
that his descriptions and excellent drawings entitle him to rank as the
first great leader of the palontological school of france he
published many long and elaborate memoirs containing brief descriptions
but without specific names and figured some hundreds of fossil shells
he was the first to recognize trilobites illnus in the silurian
slates of angers in a memoir published in 1762 some of his generic
names says geikie have passed into the languages of modern
palontology and one of the genera of chalk sponges which he
described has been named after him guettardia in his memoir on the
accidents that have befallen fossil shells compared with those which are
found to happen to shells now living in the sea trans acad roy
sciences 1765 pp 189 329 399 he shows that the beds of fossil
shells on the land present the closest possible analogy to the flow of
the present sea so that it becomes impossible to doubt that the
accidents such as broken and worn shells which have affected the
fossil organisms arose from precisely the same causes as those of
exactly the same nature that still befall their successors on the
existing ocean bottom on the other hand geikie observes that it must
be acknowledged that guettard does not seem to have had any clear ideas
of the sequence of formations and of geological structures

98 de blainville is inclined to make light of cuviers law and of his
assumptions and in his somewhat cynical depreciatory way says
thus for the thirty years during which appeared the works of m g
cuvier on fossil bones under the most favorable circumstances in a
kind of renascence of the science of organization of animals then
almost effaced in france aided by the richest osteological collections
which then existed in europe m g cuvier passed an active and a
comparatively long life in a region abounding in fossil bones without
having established any other principle in osteology than a witticism
which he had been unable for a moment to take seriously himself because
he had not yet investigated or sufficiently studied the science of
organization which i even doubt to speak frankly if he ever did
otherwise he would himself soon have perceived the falsity of his
assertion that a single facet of a bone was sufficient to reconstruct a
skeleton from the observation that everything is harmoniously correlated
in an animal it is a great thing if the memory aided by a strong
imagination can thus pass from a bone to the entire skeleton even in
an animal well known and studied even to satiety but for an unknown
animal there is no one except a man but slightly acquainted with the
anatomy of animals who could pretend to do it it is not true anatomists
like hunter camper pallas vicqdazyr blumenbach soemmering and
meckel who would be so presuming and m g cuvier would have been
himself much embarrassed if he had been taken at his word and besides
it is this assertion which will remain formulated in the mouths of the
ignorant and which has already made many persons believe that it is
possible to answer the most difficult and often insoluble problems in
palontology without having made any preliminary study with the aid of
dividers and on the other hand discouraging the blumenbachs and
soemmerings from giving their attention to this kind of work
huxley has inter alia put the case in a somewhat similar way to
show that the law should at least be applied with much caution to
unknown forms
cuvier in the discours sur les rvolutions de la surface du globe
strangely credits himself and has ever since been credited by others
with the invention of a new method of palontological research but if
you will turn to the recherches sur les ossemens fossiles and watch
cuvier not speculating but working you will find that his method is
neither more nor less than that of steno if he was able to make his
famous prophecy from the jaw which lay upon the surface of a block of
stone to the pelvis which lay hidden in it it was not because either he
or any one else knew or knows why a certain form of jaw is as a rule
constantly accompanied by the presence of marsupial bones but simply
because experience has shown that these two structures are cordinated

100 the following statement of cuviers views is taken from jamesons
translation of the first essay on the theory of the earth which
formed the introduction to his recherches sur les ossemens fossiles
the first edition of which appeared in 1812 or ten years after the
publication of the hydrogologie the original i have not seen but i
have compared jamesons translation with the sixth edition of the
discours 1820
101 cuvier in speaking of these revolutions which have changed the
surface of our earth correctly reasons that they must have excited a
more powerful action upon terrestrial quadrupeds than upon marine
animals as these revolutions he says have consisted chiefly in
changes of the bed of the sea and as the waters must have destroyed all
the quadrupeds which they reached if their irruption over the land was
general they must have destroyed the entire class or if confined only
to certain continents at one time they must have destroyed at least all
the species inhabiting these continents without having the same effect
upon the marine animals on the other hand millions of aquatic animals
may have been left quite dry or buried in newly formed strata or thrown
violently on the coasts while their races may have been still preserved
in more peaceful parts of the sea whence they might again propagate and
spread after the agitation of the water had ceased

lamarcks opinions on general physiology and biology
lamarck died before the rise of the sciences of morphology embryology
and cytology as to palontology which he aided in founding he had but
the slightest idea of the geological succession of lifeforms and not
an inkling of the biogenetic law or recapitulation theory little did he
know or foresee that the main and strongest support of his own theory
was to be this same science of the extinct forms of life yet it is a
matter of interest to know what were his views or opinions on the nature
of life whether he made any suggestions bearing on the doctrine of the
unity of nature whether he was a vitalist or not and whether he was a
follower of haller and of bonnet107 as was cuvier or pronounced in
favor of epigenesis
we know that he was a firm believer in spontaneous generation and that
he conceived that it took place not only in the origination of his
primeval germs or bauches but at all later periods down to the
present day
yet lamarck accepted harveys doctrine published in 1651 that all
living beings arose from germs or eggs108
he must have known of spallanzanis experiments published in 1776 even
if he had not read the writings of treviranus 18021805 both of whom
had experimentally disproved the theory of the spontaneous generation of
animalcules in putrid infusions showing that the lowest organisms
develop only from germs
the eighteenth century though one of great intellectual activity was
however as regards cosmology geology general physiology or biology a
period of groping in the dim twilight when the whole truth or even a
part of it was beyond the reach of the greatest geniuses and they could
only seize on halftruths lamarck both a practical botanist
systematic zologist and synthetic philosopher had done his best work
before the rise of the experimental and inductive methods when direct
observation and experiments had begun to take the place of vague 
priori thinking and reasoning so that he labored under a disadvantage
due largely to the age in which he lived
only the closing years of the century witnessed the rise of the
experimental methods in physics and chemistry owing to the brilliant
work of priestley and of lavoisier the foundations of general
physiology had been laid by haller109 those of embryology to a
partial extent by wolff110 von baers work not appearing until 1829
the year in which lamarck died
spontaneous generationlamarcks views on spontaneous generation are
stated in his recherches sur lorganisation des corps vivans 1802
he begins by referring to his statement in a previous work111 that
life may be suspended for a time and then go on again
  here i would remark it life can be produced prpare both by
  an organic act and by nature herself without any act of this kind
  in such a way that certain bodies without possessing life can be
  prepared to receive it by an impression which indicates in these
  bodies the first traces of organization
we will not enter upon an exposition of his views on the nature of
sexual generation and of fecundation the character of his vapeur
subtile aura vitalis which he supposes to take an active part in
the act of fertilization because the notion is quite as objectionable
as that of the vital force which he rejects he goes on to say however
that we cannot penetrate farther into the wonderful mystery of
fecundation but the opinions he expresses lead to the view that
nature herself imitates her procedures in fecundation in another state
of things without having need of the union or of the products of any
prexistent organization
he proceeds to observe that in the places where his aura vitalis or
subtle fluid is very abundant as in hot climates or in heated periods
and especially in humid places life seems to originate and to multiply
itself everywhere and with a singular rapidity
  in this high temperature the higher animals and mankind develop and
  mature more rapidly and diseases run their courses more swiftly
  while on the other hand these conditions are more favorable to the
  simpler forms of life for the reason that in them the orgasm and
  irritability are entirely dependent on external influences and all
  plants are in the same case because heat moisture and light
  complete the conditions necessary to their existence
  because heat is so advantageous to the simplest animals let us
  examine whether there is not occasion for believing that it can
  itself form with the concourse of favorable circumstances the
  first germs of animal life
  nature necessarily forms generations spontaneous or direct at
  the extremity of each organic kingdom or where the simplest organic
  bodies occur
this proposition he allows is so far removed from the view generally
held that it will be for a long time and perhaps always regarded as
one of the errors of the human mind
  i do not he adds ask any one to accord it the least confidence
  on my word alone but as surely it will happen sooner or later
  that men on the one hand independent of prejudices even the most
  widespread and on the other profound observers of nature may have
  a glimpse of this truth i am very content that we should know that
  it is of the number of those views which in spite of the prejudices
  of my age i have thought it well to accept
why he asks should not heat and electricity act on certain matters
under favorable conditions and circumstances he quotes lavoisier as
saying chmie i p 202 that god in creating light had spread
over the world the principle of organization of feeling and of thought
and lamarck suggests that heat this mother of generation this
material soul of organized bodies may be the chief one of the means
which nature directly employs to produce in the appropriate kind of
matter an act of arrangement of parts of a primitive germ of
organization and consequently of vitalization analogous to sexual
fecundation
  not only the direct formation of the simplest living beings could
  have taken place as i shall attempt to demonstrate but the
  following considerations prove that it is necessary that such
  germformations should be effected and be repeated under favorable
  conditions without which the state of things which we observe could
  neither exist nor subsist
his argument is that in the lower polyps the protozoa there is no
sexual reproduction no eggs but they perish as he strangely thought
without apparently attempting to verify his belief in the winter how
he asks can they reappear is it not more likely that these simple
organisms are themselves regenerated after much verbiage and
repetition he concludes
  we may conceive that the simplest organisms can arise from a minute
  mass of substances which possess the following conditionsnamely
  which will have solid parts in a state nearest the fluid conditions
  consequently having the greatest suppleness and only sufficient
  consistence to be susceptible of constituting the parts contained in
  it such is the condition of the most gelatinous organized bodies
  through such a mass of substances the subtile and expansive fluids
  spread and always in motion in the milieu environing it
  unceasingly penetrate it and likewise dissipate it arranging while
  traversing this mass the internal disposition of its parts and
  rendering it suitable to continually absorb and to exhale the other
  environing fluids which are able to penetrate into its interior and
  which are susceptible of being contained
  these other fluids which are water charged with dissolved
  dissous gas or with other tenuous substances the atmospheric
  air which contains water etc i call containable fluids to
  distinguish them from subtile fluids such as caloric electricity
  etc which no known bodies are believed to contain
  the containable fluids absorbed by the small gelatinous mass in
  question remain almost motionless in its different parts because
  the noncontainable subtile fluids which always penetrate there do
  not permit it
  in this way the uncontainable fluids at first mark out the first
  traces of the simplest organization and consequently the
  containable fluids by their movements and their other influences
  develop it and with time and all the favorable circumstances
  complete it
this is certainly a sufficiently vague and unsatisfactory theory of
spontaneous generation this sort of guesswork and hypothetical
reasoning is not entirely confined to lamarcks time have we not even
a century later examples among some of our biologists and very eminent
ones of whole volumes of  priori theorizing and reasoning with
scarcely a single new fact to serve as a foundation and yet this is an
age of laboratories of experimentations and of trained observers the
best of us indulge in farfetched hypotheses such as pangenesis
panmixia the existence of determinants and if this be so should we not
excuse lamarck who gave so many years to close observation in
systematic botany and zology for his flights into the empyrean of
subtle fluids containable and uncontainable and for his invocation of
an aura vitalis at a time when the world of demonstrated facts in
modern biology was undiscovered and its existence unsuspected
the prexistence of germs and the encasement theorylamarck did not
believe in bonnets idea of the prexistence of germs he asks whether
there is any foundation for the notion that germs successively develop
in generations ie in the multiplication of individuals for the
preservation of species and says
  i am not inclined to believe it if this prexistence is taken in a
  general sense but in limiting it to individuals in which the
  unfertilized embryos or germs are formed before generation i then
  believe that it has some foundationthey say with good reason he
  adds that every living being originates from an egg but the
  eggs being the envelope of every kind of germ they prexist in the
  individuals which produce them before fertilization has vivified
  them the seeds of plants which are vegetable eggs actually exist
  in the ovaries of flowers before the fertilization of these
  ovaries112
from whom did he get this idea that seeds or eggs are envelopes of all
sorts of germs it is not the evolution of a single germ as for
example an excessively minute but complete chick in the hens egg in
the sense held by bonnet who it was he does not mention he evidently
however had the swiss biologist in mind who held that all living
things proceed from prexisting germs113
whatever may have been his views as to the germs in the egg before
fertilization we take it that he believed in the epigenetic development
of the plant or animal after the seed or egg was once fertilized114
lamarck did not adopt the encasement theory of swammerdam and of heller
we find nothing in lamarcks writings opposed to epigenesis the
following passage which bears on this subject is translated from his
mmoires de physique p 250 where he contrasts the growth of
organic bodies with that of minerals
  the body of this living being not having been formed by
  juxtaposition as most mineral substances that is to say by the
  external and successive apposition of particles aggregated en
  masse by attraction but essentially formed by generation in its
  principle it has then grown by intussusceptionnamely by the
  introduction the transportation and the internal apposition of
  molecules borne along and deposited between its parts whence have
  resulted the successive developments of parts which compose the body
  of this living individual and from which afterwards also result the
  repairs which preserve it during a limited time
here as elsewhere in his various works lamarck brings out the fact
for the first time stated that all material things are either
nonliving or mineral inorganic or living organic a favorite phrase
with him is living bodies or as we should say organisms he also is
the first one to show that minerals increase by juxtaposition while
organisms grow by intussusception
no one would look in his writings for an idea or suggestion of the
principle of differentiation of parts or organs as we now understand it
or for the idea of the physiological division of labor these were
reserved for the later periods of embryology and morphology
origin of the first vital functionwe will now return to the germ
after it had begun spontaneous existence lamarck proceeds to say
  before the containable fluids absorbed by the small jellylike
  mass in question have been expelled by the new portions of the same
  fluids which reach there they can then deposit certain of the
  contained fluids they carry along and the movements of the
  contained fluids may apply these substances to the containing parts
  of the newly organized microscopic being in this way originates the
  first of the vital functions which becomes established in the
  simplest organism ie nutrition the environing containable
  fluids are then for the living body of very great simplicity a
  veritable chyle entirely prepared by nature
  mutilation cannot operate without gradually increasing the
  consistence of the parts contained within the minute new organism
  and without extending its dimensions hence soon arose the second of
  the vital functions growth or internal development
first faculty of animal naturethen gradually as the continuity of
this state of things within the same minute living mass in question
increases the consistence of its parts enclosed within and extends its
dimensions a vital orgasm at first very feeble but becoming
progressively more intense is formed in these enclosed parts and
renders them susceptible of reaction against the slight impression of
the fluids in motion which they contain and at the same time renders
them capable of contraction and of distention hence the origin of
animal irritability and the basis of feeling which is developed
wherever a nervous fluid susceptible of locating the effects in one of
several special centres can be formed
  scarcely will the living corpuscle newly animalized have received
  any increase in consistence and in dimensions of the parts
  contained when as the result of the organic movement which it
  enjoys it will be subjected to successive changes and losses of its
  substance
  it will then be obliged to take nourishment not only to obtain any
  development whatever but also to preserve its individual existence
  because it is necessary that it repair its losses under penalty of
  its destruction
  but as the individual in question has not yet any special organ for
  nutrition it therefore absorbs by the pores of its internal surface
  the substance adapted for its nourishment thus the first mode of
  taking food in a living body so simple can be no other than by
  absorption or a sort of suction which is accomplished by the pores
  of its outer surface
  this is not all up to the present time the animalized corpuscle we
  are considering is still only a primitive animalcule because it as
  yet has no special organ let us see then how nature will come to
  furnish it with any primitive special organ and what will be the
  organ that nature will form before any others and which in the
  simplest animal is the only one constantly found this is the
  alimentary canal the principal organ of digestion common to all
  except colpodes vibrios proteus amoeba volvoces monads etc
  this digestive canal is he saysproceeding with his  priori
  morphologya little different from that of this day produced by
  contractions of the body which are stronger in one part of the body
  than in another until a little crease is produced on the surface of
  the body this furrow or crease will receive the food insensibly
  this little furrow by the habit of being filled and by the so
  frequent use of its pores will gradually increase in depth it will
  soon assume the form of a pouch or of a tubular cavity with porous
  walls a blind sac or with but a single opening behold the
  primitive alimentary canal created by nature the simplest organ of
  digestion
in like  priori manner he describes the creation of the faculty of
reproduction the next organ he says is that of reproduction due to
the regenerative faculty he describes fission and budding finally
p 122 he says
  indeed we perceive that if the first germs of living bodies are
  all formed in one day in such great abundance and facility under
  favorable circumstances they ought to be nevertheless by reason
  of the antiquity of the causes which make them exist the most
  ancient organisms in nature
in 1794 he rejected the view once held of a continuous chain of being
the chelle des tres suggested by locke and by leibnitz and more
fully elaborated by bonnet from the inorganic to the organic worlds
from minerals to plants from plants to polyps our infusoria polyps
to worms and so on to the higher animals he on the contrary affirms
that nature makes leaps that there is a wide gap between minerals and
living bodies that everything is not gradated and shaded into each
other one reason for this was possibly his strange view expressed in
1794 that all brute bodies and inorganic matters even granite were
not formed at the same epoch but at different times and were derived
from organisms115
the mystical doctrine of a vital force was rife in lamarcks time the
chief starting point of the doctrine was due to haller and as verworn
states it is a doctrine which has confused all physiology down to the
middle of the present century and even now emerges again here and there
in varied form116
lamarck was not a vitalist life he says117 is usually supposed to
be a particular being or entity a sort of principle whose nature is
unknown and which possesses living bodies this notion he denies as
absurd saying that life is a very natural phenomenon a physical fact
in truth a little complicated in its principles but not in any sense a
particular or special being or entity
he then defines life in the following words life is an order and a
state of things in the parts of every body possessing it which permits
or renders possible in it the execution of organic movement and which
so long as it exists is effectively opposed to death derange this
order and this state of things to the point of preventing the execution
of organic movement or the possibility of its restablishment then you
cause death afterwards in the philosophie zoologique he modifies
this definition which reads thus life in the parts of a body which
possesses it is an order and a state of things which permit organic
movements and these movements which constitute active life result
from the action of a stimulating cause which excites them118
for the science of all living bodies lamarck proposed the word
biology which is so convenient a term at the present day the word
first appears in the preface to the hydrogologie published in 1802
it is worthy of note that in the same year the same word was proposed
for the same science by g r treviranus as the title of a work
biologie der philosophie der lebenden natur published in 18021805
vols ivi 18021822 the first volume appearing in 1802
in the second part of the philosophie zoologique he considers the
physical causes of life and in the introduction he defines nature as
the ensemble of objects which comprise 1 all existing physical
bodies 2 the general and special laws which regulate the changes of
condition and situation of these bodies 3 finally the movement
everywhere going on among them resulting in the wonderful order of
things in nature
to regard nature as eternal and consequently as having existed from all
time is baseless and unreasonable he prefers to think that nature is
only a result whence i suppose and am glad to admit a first cause
in a word a supreme power which has given existence to nature which
has made it as a whole what it is
as to the source of life in bodies endowed with it he considers it a
problem more difficult than to determine the course of the stars in
space or the size masses and movements of the planets belonging to
our solar system but however formidable the problem the difficulties
are not insurmountable as the phenomena are purely physicalie
essentially resulting from acts of organization
after defining life in the third chapter beginning vol ii he treats
of the exciting cause of organic movements this exciting cause is
foreign to the body which it vivifies and does not perish like the
latter this cause resides in invisible subtile expansive
everactive fluids which penetrate or are incessantly developed in the
bodies which they animate these subtile fluids we should in these days
regard as the physicochemical agents such as heat light electricity
what he says in the next two chapters as to the orgasme and
irritability excited by the beforementioned exciting cause may be
regarded as a crude foreshadowing of the primary properties of
protoplasm now regarded as the physical basis of lifeie
contractility irritability and metabolism in chapter vi lamarck
discusses direct or spontaneous generation in the same way as in 1802
in the following paragraph we have foreshadowed the characteristic
qualities of the primeval protoplasmic matter fitted to receive the
first traces of organization and life
  every mass of substance homogeneous in appearance of a gelatinous
  or mucilaginous consistence whose parts coherent among themselves
  will be in the state nearest fluidity but will have only a
  consistence sufficient to constitute containing parts will be the
  body most fitted to receive the first traces of organization and
  life
in the third part of the philosophie zoologique lamarck considers the
physical causes of feelingie those which form the productive
force of actions and those giving rise to intelligent acts after
describing the nervous system and its functions he discusses the
nervous fluid his physiological views are based on those of richerands
physiologie which he at times quotes
lamarcks thoughts on the nature of the nervous fluid recherches sur
le fluide nerveux are curious and illustrative of the gropings after
the truth of his age
he claims that the supposed nervous fluid has much analogy to the
electric that it is the feu thr animalized by the circumstances
under which it occurs in his recherches sur lorganisation des corps
vivans 1802 he states that as the result of changes continually
undergone by the principal fluids of an animal there is continually set
free in a state of feu fix a special fluid which at the instant of
its disengagement occurs in the expansive state of the caloric then
becomes gradually rarefied and insensibly arrives at the state of an
extremely subtile fluid which then passes along the smallest nervous
ramifications in the substance of the nerve which is a very good
conductor for it on its side the brain sends back the subtile fluid in
question along the nerves to the different organs
in the same work 1802 lamarck defines thought as a physical act taking
place in the brain this act of thinking gives rise to different
displacements of the subtile nervous fluid and to different
accumulations of this fluid in the parts of the brain where the ideas
have been traced there result from the flow of the fluid on the
conserved impressions of ideas special movements which portions of this
fluid acquire with each impression which give rise to compounds by
their union producing new impressions on the delicate organ which
receives them and which constitute abstract ideas of all kinds also
the different acts of thought
all the acts which constitute thought are the comparisons of ideas both
simple and complex and the results of these comparisons are judgments
he then discusses the influence of the nervous fluid on the muscles and
also its influence considered as the cause of feeling sentiment
finally he concludes that feu fix caloric the nervous fluid and
the electric fluid are only one and the same substance occurring in
different states

chapter xi
lamarck as a botanist
during the century preceding the time of lamarck botany had not
flourished in france with the vigor shown in other countries lamarck
himself frankly stated in his address to the committee of public
instruction of the national convention that the study of plants had been
for a century neglected by frenchmen and that the great progress which
it had made during this time was almost entirely due to foreigners
  i am free to say that since the distinguished tournefort the french
  have remained to some extent inactive in this direction they have
  produced almost nothing unless we except some fragmentary mediocre
  or unimportant works on the other hand linn in sweden dilwillen
  in england haller in switzerland jacquin in austria etc have
  immortalized themselves by their own works vastly extending the
  limit of our knowledge in this interesting part of natural history
what led young lamarck to take up botanical studies his botanical
rambles about paris and his longer journeys in different parts of
france and in other countries his six years of unremitting labor on his
flore franaise and the immediate fame it brought him culminating in
his election as a member of the french academy have been already
recounted
lamarck was thirtyfour when his flore franaise appeared it was not
preceded as in the case of most botanical works by any preliminary
papers containing descriptions of new or unknown species and the three
stout octavo volumes appeared together at the same date
the first volume opens with a report on the work made by mm duhamel and
guettard then follows the discours prliminaire comprising over a
hundred pages while the main body of the work opens with the principes
lmentaires de botanique occupying 223 pages the work was a general
elementary botany and written in french before this time botanists had
departed from the artificial system of linn though it was convenient
for amateurs in naming their plants jussieu had proposed his system of
natural families founded on a scientific basis but naturally more
difficult for the use of beginners to obviate the matter lamarck
conceived and proposed the dichotomic method for the easy determination
of species no new species were described and the work written in the
vernacular was simply a guide to the indigenous plants of france
beginning with the cryptogams and ending with the flowering plants a
second edition appeared in 1780 and a third edited and remodelled by
a p de candolle and forming six volumes appeared in 18051815 this
was until within a comparatively few years the standard french botany
soon after the publication of his flore franaise he projected two
other works which gave him a still higher position among botanists his
dictionnaire de botanique was published in 17831817 forming eight
volumes and five supplementary ones the first two and part of the third
volume were written by lamarck the remainder by other botanists who
completed it after lamarck had abandoned botanical studies and taken up
his zological work his second great undertaking was lillustration
des genres 17911800 with a supplement by poiret 1823
cuvier speaks thus of these works
  lillustration des genres is a work especially fitted to enable
  one to acquire readily an almost complete idea of this beautiful
  science the precision of the descriptions and of the definitions of
  linnus is maintained as in the institutions of tournefort with
  figures adapted to give body to these abstractions and to appeal
  both to the eye and to the mind and not only are the flowers and
  fruits represented but often the entire plant more than two
  thousand genera are thus made available for study in a thousand
  plates in quarto and at the same time the abridged characters of a
  vast number of species are given
  the dictionnaire contains more details of the history with
  careful descriptions critical researches on their synonymy and
  many interesting observations on their uses or on special points of
  their organizations the matter is not all original in either of the
  works far from it but the choice of figures is skilfully made the
  descriptions are drawn from the best authors and there are a large
  number which relate to species and also some genera previously
  unknown
lamarck himself says that after the publication of his flore
franaise his zeal for work increasing and after travelling by order
of the government in different parts of europe he undertook on a vast
scale a general work on botany
  this work comprised two distinct features in the first le
  dictionnaire which made a part of the new encyclopedia the
  citizen lamarck treats of philosophical botany also giving the
  complete description of all the genera and species known an immense
  work from the labor it cost and truly original in its execution
  the second treatise entitled illustration des genres presents in
  the order of the sexual system the figures and the details of all
  the genera known in botany and with a concise exposition of the
  generic characters and of the species known this work unique of
  its kind already contains six hundred plates executed by the best
  artists and will comprise nine hundred also for more than ten
  years the citizen lamarck has employed in paris a great number of
  artists moreover he has kept running three separate presses for
  different works all relating to natural history
cuvier in his loge also adds
  it is astonishing that m de lamarck who hitherto had been
  studying botany as an amateur was able so rapidly to qualify
  himself to produce so extensive a work in which the rarest plants
  were described it is because from the moment he undertook it with
  all the enthusiasm of his nature he collected them from the gardens
  and examined them in all the available herbaria passing the days at
  the houses of the botanists he knew but chiefly at the home of m
  de jussieu in that home where for more than a century a scientific
  hospitality welcomed with equal kindness every one who was
  interested in the delightful study of botany when any one reached
  paris with plants he might be sure that the first one who should
  visit him would be m de lamarck this eager interest was the means
  of his receiving one of the most valuable presents he could have
  desired the celebrated traveller sonnerat having returned in 1781
  for the second time from the indies with very rich collections of
  natural history imagined that every one who cultivated this science
  would flock to him it was not at pondichry or in the moluccas that
  he had conceived an idea of the vortex which too often in this
  capital draws the savants as well as men of the world no one came
  but m de lamarck and sonnerat in his chagrin gave him the
  magnificent collection of plants which he had brought he profited
  also by that of commerson and by those which had been accumulated
  by m de jussieu and which were generously opened to him
these works were evidently planned and carried out on a broad and
comprehensive scale with originality of treatment and they were most
useful and widely used lamarcks original special botanical papers were
numerous they were mostly descriptive of new species and genera but
some were much broader in scope and were published over a period of ten
years from 1784 to 1794 and appeared in the journal dhistoire
naturelle which he founded and in the mmoires of the academy of
sciences
he discussed the shape or aspect of the plants characteristic of certain
countries while his last botanical effort was on the sensibility of
plants 1798
although not in the front rank of botanists compared with linn
jussieu de candolle and others yet during the twentysix years of his
botanical career it may safely be said that lamarck gave an immense
impetus to botany in france and fully earned the title of the french
linn
lamarck not only described a number of genera and species of plants but
he attempted a general classification as cleland states
  in 1785 hist de lacad he evinced his appreciation of the
  necessity of natural orders in botany by an attempt at the
  classification of plants interesting though crude and falling
  immeasurably short of the system which grew in the hands of his
  intimate friend jussieuencyc brit art lamarck
a genus of tropical plants of the group solanace was named markea
by richard in honor of lamarck but changed by persoon and poiret to
lamarckea the name lamarckia of moench and koeler was proposed for
a genus of grasses it is now chrysurus
lamarcks success as a botanist led to more or less intimate relations
with buffon but it appears that the goodwill of this great naturalist
and courtier for the rising botanist was not wholly disinterested
lamarck owed the humble and poorly paid position of keeper of the
herbarium to buffon bourguin adds however
  mais il les dut moins  ses mrites quaux petits passions de la
  science officielle the illustrious buffon who was at the same
  time a very great lord at court was jealous of linn he could not
  endure having any one compare his brilliant and eloquent
  wordpictures of animals with the cold and methodical descriptions
  of the celebrated swedish naturalist so he attempted to combat him
  in another fieldbotany for this reason he encouraged and pushed
  lamarck into notice who as the popularizer of the system of
  classification into natural families seemed to him to oppose the
  development of the arrangement of linn
lamarcks style was never a highly finished one and his incipient
essays seemed faulty to buffon who took so much pains to write all his
works in elegant and pure french so he begged the abb hay to review
the literary form of lamarcks works
here it might be said that lamarcks is the philosophic style often
animated clear and pure it at times however becomes prolix and
tedious owing to occasional repetition
but after all it can easily be understood that the discipline of his
botanical studies the friendship manifested for him by buffon then so
influential and popular the relations lamarck had with jussieu hay
and the zologists of the jardin du roi were all important factors in
lamarcks success in life a success not without terrible drawbacks and
to the full fruition of which he did not in his own life attain
chapter xii
lamarck the zologist
although there has been and still may be a difference of opinion as to
the value and permanency of lamarcks theoretical views there has never
been any lack of appreciation of his labors as a systematic zologist
he was undoubtedly the greatest zologist of his time lamarck is the
one dominant personage who in the domain of zology filled the interval
between linn and cuvier and in acuteness and sound judgment he at
times surpassed cuvier his was the master mind of the period of
systematic zology which began with linnthe period which in the
history of zology preceded that of comparative anatomy and morphology
after aristotle no epochmaking zologist arose until linn was born
in england linn was preceded by ray but binomial nomenclature and the
first genuine attempt at the classification of animals dates back to the
systema natur of linn the tenth edition of which appeared in 1758
illustration portrait of lamarck
the contemporaries of lamarck in biological science in the eighteenth
century were camper 172289 spallanzani 172999 wolff 173394
hunter 172893 bichat 17711802 and vicq dazyr 174894 these
were all anatomists and physiologists the lastnamed being the first
to propose and use the term comparative anatomy while bichat was the
founder of histology and pathological anatomy there was in fact no
prominent systematic zologist in the interval between linn and
lamarck in france there were only two zologists of prominence when
lamarck assumed his duties at the museum these were bruguire the
conchologist and olivier the entomologist in germany hermann was the
leading systematic zologist we would not forget the labors of the
great german anatomist and physiologist blumenbach who was also the
founder of anthropology nor the german anatomists tiedemann bojanus
and carus nor the embryologist dllinger but lamarcks method and
point of view were of a new orderhe was much more than a mere
systematist his work in systematic zology unlike that of linn and
especially of cuvier was that of a far higher grade lamarck besides
his rigid analytical thorough and comprehensive work on the
invertebrates whereby he evolved order and system out of the chaotic
mass of forms comprised in the insects and vermes of linn was animated
with conceptions and theories to which his forerunners and
contemporaries geoffroy st hilaire excepted were entire strangers
his tabular view of the classes of the animal kingdom was to his mind a
genealogical tree his idea of the animal kingdom anticipated and was
akin to that of our day he compares the animal series to a tree with
its numerous branches rather than to a single chain of being this
series as he expressly states began with the monad and ended with
man it began with the simple and ended with the complex or as we
should now say it proceeded from the generalized or undifferentiated to
the specialized and differentiated he perceived that many forms had
been subjected to what he calls degeneration or as we say
modification and that the progress from the simple to the complex was
by no means direct moreover fossil animals were according to his
views practically extinct species and stood in the light of being the
ancestors of the members of our existing fauna in fact his views
notwithstanding shortcomings and errors in classification naturally due
to the limited knowledge of anatomy and development of his time have
been at the end of a century entirely confirmeda striking testimony to
his profound insight sound judgment and philosophic breadth
the reforms that he brought about in the classification of the
invertebrate animals were direct and positive improvements were adopted
by cuvier in his rgne animal and have never been set aside we owe
to him the foundation and definition of the classes of infusoria
annelida arachnida and crustacea the two latter groups being
separated from the insects he also showed the distinctness of
echinoderms from polyps thus anticipating leuckart who established the
phylum of coelenterata nearly half a century later his special work
was the classification of the great group of mollusca which he regarded
as a class when in our boyhood days we attempted to arrange our shells
we were taught to use the lamarckian system that of linn having been
discarded many years previous the great reforms in the classification
of shells are evidenced by the numerous manuals of conchology based on
the works of lamarck
we used to hear much of the lamarckian genera of shells and lamarck was
the first to perceive the necessity of breaking up into smaller
categories the few genera of linn which now are regarded as families
he may be said to have had a wonderfully good eye for genera all his
generic divisions were at once accepted since they were based on valid
characters
though not a comparative anatomist he at once perceived the value of a
knowledge of the internal structure of animals and made effective use
of the discoveries of cuvier and of his predecessorsin fact basing
his system of classification on the organs of respiration circulation
and the nervous system
he intimated that specific characters vary most and that the peripheral
parts of the body as the shell outer protective structures the limbs
mouthparts antenn etc are first affected by the causes which
produce variation while he distinctly states that it requires a longer
time for variations to take place in the internal organs on the latter
he relied in defining his classes
one is curious to know how lamarck viewed the question of species this
is discussed at length by him in his general essays which are
reproduced farther on in this biography but his definition of what a
species is far surpasses in breadth and terseness and better satisfies
the views now prevailing than that of any other author
his definition of a species is as follows
  every collection of similar individuals perpetuated by generation
  in the same condition so long as the circumstances of their
  situation do not change enough to produce variations in their
  habits character and form
lamarcks rare skill thoroughness and acuteness as an observer
combined with great breadth of view were also supplemented by the
advantages arising from residence in paris and his connection with the
museum of natural history paris was in the opening years of the
nineteenth century the chief centre of biological science france having
convalesced from the intestinal disorders of the revolution and as the
result of her foreign wars adding to her territory and power had begun
with the strength of a young giant to send out those splendid exploring
expeditions which gathered in collections in natural history from all
parts of the known or accessible world and poured them as it were
into the laps of the professors of the jardin des plantes the shelves
and cases of the galleries fairly groaned with the weight of the
zological riches which crowded them from the year 1800 to 1832 the
french government showed the greatest activity in sending out exploring
expeditions to egypt africa and the tropics119
the zologists who explored egypt were geoffroy st hilaire and savigny
those who visited the east the south seas the east indian archipelago
and other regions were bruguire olivier bory de st vincent pron
lesueur quoy gaimard le vaillant edoux and souleyet the natural
result was the enormous collections of the jardin des plantes and
consequently enlarged views regarding the number and distribution of
species and their relation to their environment
in paris about the time of lamarcks death flourished also savigny
who published his immortal works on the morphology of arthropods and of
ascidians and strausdurckheim whose splendidly illustrated volumes on
the anatomy of the cockchafer and of the cat will never cease to be of
value and  geoffroy st hilaire whose elaborate and classical works
on vertebrate morphology embryology and comparative anatomy added so
much to the prestige of french science
we may be sure that lamarck did his own work without help from others
and gave full credit to those who like defrance or bruguire aided or
immediately preceded him he probably was lacking in executive force or
in the art which cuvier knew so well to practise of enlisting young men
to do the drudgery or render material aid and then in some cases
neglecting to give them proper credit
the first memoir or paper published on a zological subject by lamarck
was a modest one on shells which appeared in 1792 in the journal
dhistoire naturelle the editors of which were lamarck bruguire
olivier hay and pelletier this paper was a review of an excellent
memoir by bruguire who preceded lamarck in the work of dismemberment
of the linnan genera his next paper was on four new species of helix
to this journal of which only two volumes were published cuvier
contributed his first papernamely on some new species of cloportes
oniscus a genus of terrestrial crustacea or pillbugs this was
followed by his second memoir on the anatomy of the limpet his next
article being descriptions of two species of flies from his collection
of insects120 seven years later lamarck gave some account of the
genera of cuttlefishes his first general memoir was a prodromus of a
new classification of shells 1799
meanwhile lamarcks knowledge of shells and corals was utilized by
cuvier in his tableau lmentaire published in 1798 who acknowledges
in the preface that in the exposition of the genera of shells he has
been powerfully seconded while he indicated to him cuvier a part of
the subgenera of corals and alcyonarians and adds i have received
great aid from the examination of his collection also he acknowledges
that he had been greatly aided puissamment second by lamarck who
had even indicated the most of the subdivisions established in his
tableau lmentaire for the insects blainville l c p 129 and
he also accepted his genera of cuttlefishes
after this lamarck judiciously refrained from publishing descriptions of
new species and other fragmentary labors and for some ten years from
the date of publication of his first zological article reserved his
strength and elaborated his first general zological work a thick
octavo volume of 452 pages entitled systme des animaux sans
vertbres which appeared in 1801
linn had divided all the animals below the vertebrates into two classes
only the insecta and vermes the insects comprising the present classes
of insects myriapoda arachnida and crustacea the vermes embracing
all the other invertebrate animals from the molluscs to the monads
lamarck perceived the need of reform of bringing order out of the
chaotic mass of animal forms and he says p 33 that he has been
continually occupied since his attachment to the museum with this
reform
he relies for his characters the fundamental ones on the organs of
respiration circulation and on the form of the nervous system the
reasons he gives for his classification are sound and philosophical and
presented with the ease and aplomb of a master of taxonomy
he divided the invertebrates which cuvier had called animals with white
blood into the seven following classes
we place in a parallel column the classification of cuvier in 1798
  classification of lamarck        classification of cuvier
  1 mollusca                           i mollusca
  2 crustacea                         ii insectes et vers
  3 arachnides comprising                 1 insectes
     the myriapoda                        2 vers
  4 insectes                         iii zoophytes
  5 vers                                  1 echinodermes
                                            2 meduses animaux
  6 radiaires                                infusorines rotifer
                                               vibrio volvox
  7 polypes                               3 zoophytes proprement
                                               dits
of these four were for the first time defined and the others
restricted it will be noticed that he separates the radiata
radiaires from the polypes his radiaires included the
echinoderms the vers echinoderms of bruguire and the medus his
radiaires molasses the latter forming the discophora and
siphonophora of present zologists this is an anticipation of the
division by leuckart in 1839 of the radiata of cuvier into
coelenterata and echinodermata
the polypes of lamarck included not only the forms now known as such
but also the rotifera and protozoa though as we shall see he
afterwards in his course of 1807 eliminated from this heterogeneous
assemblage the infusoria
comparing this classification with that of cuvier121 published in
1798 we find that in the most important respects ie the
foundation of the classes of crustacea arachnida and radiata there is
a great advance over cuviers system in cuviers work the molluscs are
separated from the worms and they are divided into three groups
cephalopodes gasteropodes and acephalesan arrangement which still
holds that of lamarck into mollusques cphals and mollusques acphals
being much less natural with the elimination of the mollusca cuvier
allowed the vers or vermes of linn to remain undisturbed except that
the zophytes the equivalent of lamarcks polypes are separately
treated
he agrees with cuvier in placing the molluscs at the head of the
invertebrates a course still pursued by some zologists at the present
day he states in the philosophie zoologique122 that in his course
of lectures of the year 1799 he established the class of crustacea and
adds that although this class is essentially distinct it was not until
six or seven years after that some naturalists consented to adopt it
the year following or in his course of 1800 he separated from the
insects the class of arachnida as easy and necessary to be
distinguished but in 1809 he says that this class is not yet admitted
into any other work than my own123 as to the class of annelides he
remarks cuvier having discovered the existence of arterial and venous
vessels in different animals which have been confounded under the name
of worms vers with other animals very differently organized i
immediately employed the consideration of this new fact in rendering my
classification more perfect and in my course of the year 10 1802 i
established the class of annelides a class which i have placed after
the molluscs and before the crustaceans as their known organization
requires he first established this class in his recherches sur les
corps vivans 1802 but it was several years before it was adopted by
naturalists
the next work in which lamarck deals with the classification of the
invertebrates is his discours douverture du cours des animaux sans
vertbres published in 1806
on page 70 he speaks of the animal chain or series from the monad to
man ascending from the most simple to the most complex the monad is
one of his polypes amorphs and he says that it is the most simple
animal form the most like the original germ bauche from which
living bodies have descended from the monad nature passes to the
volvox proteus amoeba and vibrio from them are derived the
polypes rotifres and other radiaires and then the vers
arachnides and crustacea on page 77 a tabular view is presented as
follows
    1 les mollusques
    2 les cirrhipdes
    3 les annelides
    4 les crustacs
    5 les arachnides
    6 les insectes
    7 les vers
    8 les radiaires
    9 les polypes
it will be seen that at this date two additional classes are proposed
and definedie the annelides and the cirrhipedes though the class
of annelida was first privately characterized in his lectures for 1802
the elimination of the barnacles or cirrhipedes from the molluscs was a
decided step in advance and was a proof of the acute observation and
sound judgment of lamarck he says that this class is still very
imperfectly known and its position doubtful and adds the cirrhipedes
have up to the present time been placed among the molluscs but
although certain of them closely approach them in some respects they
have a special character which compels us to separate them in short in
the genera best known the feet of these animals are distinctly
articulated and even crustaceous crustacs he does not refer to
the nervous system but this is done in his next work it will be
remembered that cuvier overlooked this feature of the jointed limbs and
also the crustaceouslike nervous system of the barnacles and allowed
them to remain among the molluscs notwithstanding the decisive step
taken by lamarck it was not until many years after 1830 that thompson
proved by their lifehistory that barnacles are true crustacea
in the philosophie zoologique the ten classes of the invertebrates are
arranged in the following order
    les mollusques
    les cirrhipdes
    les annelides
    les crustacs
    les arachnides
    les insectes
    les vers
    les radiaires
    les polypes
    les infusoires
at the end of the second volume lamarck gives a tabular view on a page
by itself p 463 showing his conception of the origin of the
different groups of animals this is the first phylogeny or genealogical
tree ever published

the next innovation made by lamarck in the extrait du cours de
zoologie in 1812 was not a happy one in this work he distributed the
fourteen classes of the animal kingdom into three groups which he named
animaux apathiques sensibles and intelligens in this
physiologicopsychological base for a classification he unwisely
departed from his usual more solid foundation of anatomical structure
and the results were worthless he however repeats it in his great
work histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertbres 18151822
the sponges were by cuvier and also by lamarck accorded a position
among the polypes near alcyonium which represents the latters
polypiers empts and it is interesting to notice that for many
years remaining among the protozoa meanwhile even by agassiz regarded
as vegetables they were by haeckel restored to a position among the
coelenterates though for over twenty years they have by some american
zologists been more correctly regarded as a separate phylum124
lamarck also separated the seals and morses from the cetacea adopting
his idea cuvier referred the seals to an order of carnivora
another interesting matter to which professor lacazeduthiers has
called attention in his interesting letter on p 77 is the position
assigned lucernaria among his radiaires molasses near what are now
ctenophora and medus though one would have supposed he would from
its superficial resemblance to polyps have placed it among the polyps
to lamarck we are also indebted for the establishment in 1818 of the
molluscan group of heteropoda
lamarcks acuteness is also shown in the fact that whereas cuvier
placed them among the acephalous molluscs he did not regard the
ascidians as molluscs at all but places them in a class by themselves
under the name of tunicata following the sipunculus worms yet he
allowed them to remain near the holothurians then including sipunculus
in his group of radiaires echinodermes between the latter and the
vers he differs from cuvier in regarding the tunic as the homologue of
the shell of lamellibranches remarking that it differs in being
muscular and contractile
lamarcks fame as a zologist rests chiefly on this great work it
elicited the highest praise from his contemporaries besides containing
the innovations made in the classification of the animal kingdom which
he had published in previous works it was a summary of all which was
then known of the invertebrate classes thus forming a most convenient
handbook since it mentioned all the known genera and all the known
species except those of the insects of which only the types are
mentioned it passed through two editions and still is not without
value to the working systematist
in his histoire des progrs des sciences naturelles cuvier does it
justice referring to the earlier volume he states that it has
extended immensely the knowledge especially by a new distribution of
the shelled molluscs  m de lamarck has established with as much
care as sagacity the genera of shells again he says in noticing the
three first volumes the great detail into which m de lamarck has
entered the new species he has described renders his work very
valuable to naturalists and renders most desirable its prompt
continuation especially from the knowledge we have of means which this
experienced professor possesses to carry to a high degree of perfection
the enumeration which he will give us of the shells oeuvres

his excellences says cleland speaking of lamarck as a scientific
observer were width of scope fertility of ideas and a preminent
faculty of precise description arising not only from a singularly terse
style but from a clear insight into both the distinctive features and
the resemblance of forms encyc britannica art lamarck
the work moreover is remarkable for being the first one to begin with
the simplest and to end with the most highly developed forms
lamarcks special line of study was the mollusca how his work is still
regarded by malacologists is shown by the following letter from our
leading student of molluscs dr w h dall
        smithsonian institution
        united states national museum washington d c
            november 4 1899
  lamarck was one of the best naturalists of his time when geniuses
  abounded his work was the first wellmarked step toward a natural
  system as opposed to the formalities of linn he owed something to
  cuvier yet he knew how to utilize the work in anatomy offered by
  cuvier in making a natural classification his failing eyesight
  which obliged him latterly to trust to the eyes of others his
  poverty and trials of various kinds more than excuse the occasional
  slips which we find in some of the later volumes of the animaux
  sans vertbres these are rather of the character of typographical
  errors than faults of scheme or principle
  the work of lamarck is really the foundation of rational natural
  malacological classification practically all that came before his
  time was artificial in comparison work that came later was in the
  line of expansion and elaboration of lamarcks without any change
  of principle only with the application of embryology and
  microscopical work of the most modern type has there come any
  essential change of method and this is rather a new method of
  getting at the facts than any fundamental change in the way of using
  them when found i shall await your work on lamarcks biography with
  great interest
    i remain

the evolutionary views of buffon and of geoffroy st hilaire
of the french precursors of lamarck there were fourduret 1609 de
maillet 1748 robinet 1768 and buffon the opinions of the first
three could hardly be taken seriously as they were crude and fantastic
though involving the idea of descent the suggestions and hypotheses of
buffon and of erasmus darwin were of quite a different order and
deserve careful consideration
illustration maison de buffon in which lamarck lived 17931829
george louis leclerc comte de buffon was born in 1707 at montbard
burgundy in the same year as linn he died at paris in 1788 at the
age of eightyone years he inherited a large property from his father
who was a councillor of the parliament of burgundy he studied at dijon
and travelled abroad buffon was rich but greatly to his credit
devoted all his life to the care of the royal garden and to writing his
works being a most prolific author he was not an observer not even a
closet naturalist i have passed he is reported to have said fifty
years at my desk appointed in 1739 when he was thirtytwo years old
intendant of the royal garden he divided his time between his retreat
at montbard and paris spending four months in paris and the remainder
of the year at montbard away from the distractions and dissipations of
the capital it is significant that he wrote his great histoire
naturelle at montbard and not at paris where were the collections of
natural history
his biographer flourens says what dominates in the character of
buffon is elevation force the love of greatness and glory he loved
magnificence in everything his fine figure his majestic air seemed to
have some relation with the greatness of his genius and nature had
refused him none of those qualities which could attract the attention of
mankind
nothing is better known than the navet of his selfesteem he
admired himself with perfect honesty frankly but goodnaturedly
he was once asked how many great men he could really mention he
answered fivenewton bacon leibnitz montesquieu and myself his
admirable style gained him immediate reputation and glory throughout the
world of letters his famous epigram le style est lhomme mme is
familiar to every one that his moral courage was scarcely of a high
order is proved by his little affair with the theologians of the
sorbonne buffon was not of the stuff of which martyrs are made
his forte was that of a brilliant writer and most industrious compiler
a popularizer of science he was at times a bold thinker but his
prudence not to say timidity in presenting in his ironical way his
thoughts on the origin of things is annoying for we do not always
understand what buffon did really believe about the mutability or the
fixity of species as too plain speaking in the days he wrote often led
to persecution and personal hazard125
his cosmological ideas were based on those of burnet and leibnitz his
geological notions were founded on the labors of palissy steno
woodward and whiston he depended upon his friend daubenton for
anatomical facts and on gueneau de montbliard and the abb bexon for
his zological data as flourens says buffon was not exactly an
observer others observed and discovered for him he discovered
himself the observations of others he sought for ideas others sought
facts for him how fulsome his eulogists were is seen in the case of
flourens who capped the climax in exclaiming buffon is leibnitz with
the eloquence of plato and he adds he did not write for savants he
wrote for all mankind no one now reads buffon while the works of
raumur who preceded him are nearly as valuable as ever since they
are packed with careful observations
the experiments of redi of swammerdam and of vallisneri and the
observations of raumur had no effect on buffon who maintained that
of the different forms of genesis spontaneous generation is not only
the most frequent and the most general but the most ancientnamely
the primitive and the most universal126
buffon by nature was unsystematic and he possessed little of the spirit
or aim of the true investigator he left no technical papers or memoirs
or what we would call contributions to science in his history of
animals he began with the domestic breeds and then described those of
most general popular interest those most known he knew as
malesherbes claimed little about the works even of linn and other
systematists neither grasping their principles nor apparently caring to
know their methods his single positive addition to zological science
was generalizations on the geographical distribution of animals he
recognized that the animals of the tropical and southern portions of the
old and new worlds were entirely unlike while those of north america
and northern eurasia were in many cases the same
we will first bring together as flourens and also butler have done his
scattered fragmentary views or rather suggestions on the fixity of
species and then present his thoughts on the mutability of species
the species is then an abstract and general term127 there only
exist individuals and suites of individuals that is to say
species128 he also says that nature imprints on each species its
unalterable characters that each species has an equal right to
creation129 that species even those nearest allied are separated
by an interval over which nature cannot pass130 and that each
species having been independently created the first individuals have
served as a model for their descendants131
buffon however shows the true scientific spirit in speaking of final
causes
  the pig he says is not formed as an original special and
  perfect type its type is compounded of that of many other animals
  it has parts which are evidently useless or which at any rate it
  cannot use  but we ever on the lookout to refer all parts to
  a certain endwhen we can see no apparent use for them suppose
  them to have hidden uses and imagine connections which are without
  foundation and serve only to obscure our perception of nature as
  she really is we fail to see that we thus rob philosophy of her
  true character which is to inquire into the how of these
  thingsinto the manner in which nature actsand that we substitute
  for this true object a vain idea seeking to divine the whythe
  ends which she has proposed in acting tome v p 104 1755 ex
  butler
the volumes of the histoire naturelle on animals beginning with
tome iv appeared in the years 1753 to 1767 or over a period of
fourteen years butler in his evolution old and new effectually
disposes of isidore geoffroy st hilaires statement that at the
beginning of his work tome iv 1753 he affirms the fixity of species
while from 1761 to 1766 he declares for variability but butler asserts
from his reading of the first edition that from the very first chapter
onward he leant strongly to mutability even if he did not openly avow
his belief in it the reader who turns to buffon himself will find
that the idea that buffon took a less advanced position in his old age
than he had taken in middle life is also without foundation132
p 104
but he had more to say on the other side that of the mutability of
species and it is these tentative views that his commentators have
assumed to have been his real sentiments or belief and for this reason
place buffon among the evolutionists though he had little or no idea of
evolution in the enlarged and thoroughgoing sense of lamarck
he states however that the presence of callosities on the legs of the
camel and llama are the unmistakable results of rubbing or friction so
also with the callosities of baboons and the pouched monkeys and the
double soles of mans feet133 in this point he anticipates erasmus
darwin and lamarck as we shall see however his notions were much less
firmly grounded than those of erasmus darwin who was a close observer
as well as a profound thinker
in his chapter on the dgnration des animaux or as it is
translated modification of animals buffon insists that the three
causes are climate food and domestication the examples he gives are
the sheep which having originated as he thought from the mufflon
shows marked changes the ox varies under the influence of food reared
where the pasturage is rich it is twice the size of those living in a
dry country the races of the torrid zones bear a hump on their
shoulders the zebu the buffalo is in short only a variety only a
race of our domestic ox he attributed the camels hump to domesticity
he refers the changes of color in the northern hare to the simple change
of seasons
he is most explicit in referring to the agency of climate and also to
time and to the uniformity of natures processes in causing variation
writing in 1756 he says
  if we consider each species in the different climates which it
  inhabits we shall find perceptible varieties as regards size and
  form they all derive an impress to a greater or less extent from
  the climate in which they live these changes are only made slowly
  and imperceptibly natures great workman is time he marches ever
  with an even pace and does nothing by leaps and bounds but by
  degrees gradations and succession he does all things and the
  changes which he worksat first imperceptiblebecome little by
  little perceptible and show themselves eventually in results about
  which there can be no mistake nevertheless animals in a free wild
  state are perhaps less subject than any other living beings man not
  excepted to alterations changes and variations of all kinds
  being free to choose their own food and climate they vary less than
  domestic animals vary134
the buffonian factor of the direct influence of climate is not in
general of so thoroughgoing a character as usually supposed by the
commentators of buffon he generally applies it to the superficial
changes such as the increase or decrease in the amount of hair or
similar modifications not usually regarded as specific characters the
modifications due to the direct influence of climate may be effected he
says within even a few generations
under the head of geographical distribution in tome ix 1761 in
which subject buffon made his most original contribution to exact
biology he claims to have been the first even to have suspected that
not a single tropical species is common to both eastern and western
continents but that the animals common to both continents are those
adapted to a temperate or cold climate he even anticipates the subject
of migration in past geological times by supposing that those forms
travelled from the old world either over some land still unknown or
more probably over territory which has long since been submerged135
  the mammoth was certainly the greatest and strongest of all
  quadrupeds but it has disappeared and if so how many smaller
  feebler and less remarkable species must have perished without
  leaving us any traces or even hints of their having existed how
  many other species have changed their nature that is to say
  become perfected or degraded through great changes in the
  distribution of land and ocean through the cultivation or neglect
  of the country which they inhabit through the longcontinued
  effects of climatic changes so that they are no longer the same
  animals that they once were yet of all living beings after man the
  quadrupeds are the ones whose nature is most fixed and form most
  constant birds and fishes vary much more easily insects still more
  again than these and if we descend to plants which certainly
  cannot be excluded from animated nature we shall be surprised at
  the readiness with which species are seen to vary and at the ease
  with which they change their forms and adopt new natures136
the following passages debarring the error of deriving all the american
from the old world forms and the mistake in supposing that the american
forms grew smaller than their ancestors in the old world certainly
smack of the principle of isolation and segregation and this is
buffons most important contribution to the theory of descent
  it is probable then that all the animals of the new world are
  derived from congeners in the old without any deviation from the
  ordinary course of nature we may believe that having become
  separated in the lapse of ages by vast oceans and countries which
  they could not traverse they have gradually been affected by and
  derived impressions from a climate which has itself been modified
  so as to become a new one through the operations of those same
  causes which dissociated the individuals of the old and the new
  world from one another thus in the course of time they have grown
  smaller and changed their characters this however should not
  prevent our classifying them as different species now for the
  difference is no less real though it dates from the creation
  nature i maintain is in a state of continual flux and movement
  it is enough for man if he can grasp her as she is in his own time
  and throw but a glance or two upon the past and future so as to try
  and perceive what she may have been in former times and what one day
  she may attain to137
buffon thus suggests the principle of the struggle for existence to
prevent overcrowding resulting in the maintenance of the balance of
nature
  it may be said that the movement of nature turns upon two immovable
  pivotsone the illimitable fecundity which she has given to all
  species the other the innumerable difficulties which reduce the
  results of that fecundity and leave throughout time nearly the same
  quantity of individuals in every species  destruction and
  sterility follow closely upon excessive fecundity and
  independently of the contagion which follows inevitably upon
  overcrowding each species has its own special sources of death and
  destruction which are of themselves sufficient to compensate for
  excess in any past generation138
he also adds the species the least perfect the most delicate the
most unwieldy the least active the most unarmed etc have already
disappeared or will disappear139
on one occasion in writing on the dog he anticipates erasmus darwin
and lamarck in ascribing to the direct cause of modification the inner
feelings of the animal modified change of condition being the indirect
cause140 he however did not suggest the idea of the transmission of
acquired characters by heredity and does not mention the word heredity
these are all the facts he stated but though not an observer buffon
was a broad thinker and was led from these few data to generalize as
he could well do from the breadth of his knowledge of geology gained
from the works of his predecessors from leibnitz to woodward and
whiston
  after the rapid glance he says at these variations which
  indicate to us the special changes undergone by each species there
  arises a more important consideration and the view of which is
  broader it is that of the transformation changement of the
  species themselves it is that more ancient modification which has
  gone on from time immemorial which seems to have been made in each
  family or if we prefer in each of the genera in which were
  comprised more or less allied species141
in the beginning of his first volume he states that we can descend by
almost imperceptible degrees from the most perfect creature to the most
formless matterfrom the most highly organized animal to the most
entirely inorganic substance we will recognize this gradation as the
great work of nature and we will observe it not only as regards size
and form but also in respect of movements and in the successive
generations of every species
  hence he continues arises the difficulty of arriving at any
  perfect system or method in dealing either with nature as a whole or
  even with any single one of her subdivisions the gradations are so
  subtle that we are often obliged to make arbitrary divisions nature
  knows nothing about our classifications and does not choose to lend
  herself to them without reasons we therefore see a number of
  intermediate species and objects which it is very hard to classify
  and which of necessity derange our system whatever it may be142
this is all true and was probably felt by buffons predecessors but it
does not imply that he thought these forms had descended from one
another
  in thus comparing he adds all the animals and placing them
  each in its proper genus we shall find that the two hundred species
  whose history we have given may be reduced to a quite small number
  of families or principal sources from which it is not impossible
  that all the others may have issued143
he then establishes on the one hand nine species which he regarded as
isolated and on the other fifteen principal genera primitive sources
or as we would say ancestral forms from which he derived all the
animals mammals known to him
hence he believed that he could derive the dog the jackal the wolf
and the fox from a single one of these four species yet he remarks
per contra in 1753
  although we cannot demonstrate that the production of a species by
  modification is a thing impossible to nature the number of
  contrary probabilities is so enormous that even philosophically we
  can scarcely doubt it for if any species has been produced by the
  modification of another if the species of ass has been derived from
  that of the horse this could have been done only successively and
  by gradual steps there would have been between the horse and ass a
  great number of intermediate animals the first of which would
  gradually differ from the nature of the horse and the last would
  gradually approach that of the ass and why do we not see today the
  representatives the descendants of those intermediate species why
  are only the two extremes living tome iv p 390 if we once
  admit that the ass belongs to the horse family and that it only
  differs from it because it has been modified dgnr we may
  likewise say that the monkey is of the same family as man that it
  is a modified man that man and the monkey have had a common origin
  like the horse and ass that each family has had but a single
  source and even that all the animals have come from a single
  animal which in the succession of ages has produced while
  perfecting and modifying itself all the races of other animals
  tome iv p 382 if it were known that in the animals there had
  been i do not say several species but a single one which had been
  produced by modification from another species if it were true that
  the ass is only a modified horse there would be no limit to the
  power of nature and we would not be wrong in supposing that from a
  single being she has known how to derive with time all the other
  organized beings ibid p 382
the next sentence however translated reads as follows
  but no it is certain from revelation that all animals have alike
  been favored with the grace of an act of direct creation and that
  the first pair of every species issued fully formed from the hands
  of the creator tome iv p 383
in which of these views did buffon really believe yet they appear in
the same volume and not at different periods of his life
he actually does say in the same volume iv p 358 it is not
impossible that all species may be derivations issues in the same
volume also p 215 he remarks
  there is in nature a general prototype in each species on which
  each individual is modelled but which seems in being realized to
  change or become perfected by circumstances so that relatively to
  certain qualities there is a singular bizarre variation in
  appearance in the succession of individuals and at the same time a
  constancy in the entire species which appears to be admirable
and yet we find him saying at the same period of his life in the
previous volume that species are the only beings in nature beings
perpetual as ancient as permanent as she144 a few pages farther on
in the same volume of the same work apparently written at the same
time he is strongly and stoutly antievolutional affirming the
imprint of each species is a type whose principal features are graven in
characters forever ineffaceable and permanent145
in this volume iv p 55 he remarks that the senses whether in man
or in animals may be greatly developed by exercise
the impression left on the mind after reading buffon is that even if
he threw out these suggestions and then retracted them from fear of
annoyance or even persecution from the bigots of his time he did not
himself always take them seriously but rather jotted them down as
passing thoughts certainly he did not present them in the formal
forcible and scientific way that erasmus darwin did the result is that
the tentative views of buffon which have to be with much research
extracted from the fortyfour volumes of his works would now be
regarded as in a degree superficial and valueless but they appeared
thirtyfour years before lamarcks theory and though not epochmaking
they are such as will render the name of buffon memorable for all time
tienne geoffroy st hilaire
tienne geoffroy st hilaire was born at tampes april 15 1772 he
died in paris in 1844 he was destined for the church but his tastes
were for a scientific career his acquaintance with the abb hay and
daubenton led him to study mineralogy he was the means of liberating
hay from a political prison the abb as the result of the events of
august 1792 being promptly set free at the request of the academy of
sciences the young geoffroy was in his turn aided by the illustrious
hay who obtained for him the position of subguardian and demonstrator
of mineralogy in the cabinet of natural history at the early age of
twentyone years as we have seen he was elected professor of zology
in the museum in charge of the department of mammals and birds he was
the means of securing for cuvier then of his own age a position in the
museum as professoradjunct of comparative anatomy for two years 1795
and 1796 the two youthful savants were inseparable sharing the same
apartments the same table the same amusements the same studies and
their scientific papers were prepared in company and signed in common
illustration  geoffroy st hilaire
geoffroy became a member of the great scientific commission sent to
egypt by napoleon 17891802 by his boldness and presence of mind he
with savigny and the botanist delille saved the treasures which at
alexandria had fallen into the hands of the english general in command
in 1808 he was charged by napoleon with the duty of organizing public
instruction in portugal here again by his address and firmness he
saved the collections and exchanges made there from the hands of the
english when thirtysix years old he was elected a member of the
institute
in 1818 he began to discuss philosophical anatomy the doctrine of
homologies he also studied the embryology of the mammals and was the
founder of teratology it was he who discovered the vestigial teeth of
the baleen whale and those of embryo birds and the bearing of this on
the doctrine of descent must have been obvious to him
as early as 1795 before lamarck had changed his views as to the
stability of species the young geoffroy then twentythree years old
dared to claim that species may be only les diverses dgnrations
dun mme type these views he did not abandon nor on the other
hand did he actively promulgate them it was not until thirty years
later in his memoir on the anatomy of the gavials that he began the
series of his works bearing on the question of species in 1831 was held
the famous debates between himself and cuvier in the academy of
sciences but the contest was not so much on the causes of the variation
of species as on the doctrine of homologies and the unity of
organization in the animal kingdom
in fact geoffroy did not adopt the views peculiar to his old friend
lamarck but was rather a follower of buffon his views were preceded by
two premises
the species is only fix sous la raison du maintien de ltat
conditionnel de son milieu ambiant
it is modified it changes if the environment milieu ambiant
varies and according to the extent selon la porte of the variations
of the latter146
as the result among recent or living beings there are no essential
differences as regards themcest le mme cours dvnements or
la mme marche dexcitation147
on the other hand the monde ambiant having undergone more or less
considerable change from one geological epoch to another the atmosphere
having even varied in its chemical composition and the conditions of
respiration having been thus modified148 the beings then living would
differ in structure from their ancestors of ancient times and would
differ from them according to the degree of the modifying power149
again he says the animals living today have been derived by a series
of uninterrupted generations from the extinct animals of the
antediluvian world150 he gave as an example the crocodiles of the
present day which he believed to have descended from the fossil forms
while he admitted the possibility of one type passing into another
separated by characters of more than generic value he always according
to his son isidore rejected the view which made all the living species
descend dune espce antediluvienne primitive151 it will be seen
that geoffroy st hilaires views were chiefly based on palontological
evidence he was throughout broad and philosophical and his eloquent
demonstration in his philosophie anatomique of the doctrine of
homologies served to prepare the way for modern morphology and affords
one of the foundation stones on which rests the theory of descent
though temporarily vanquished in the debate with cuvier who was a
forceful debater and represented the views then prevalent a later
generation acknowledges that he was in the right and remembers him as
one of the founders of evolution

the views of erasmus darwin
erasmus darwin the grandfather of charles darwin was born in 1731 or
twentyfour years after buffon he was an english country physician with
a large practice and not only interested in philosophy mechanics and
natural science but given to didactic rhyming as evinced by the
botanical garden and the loves of the plants the latter of which was
translated into french in 1800 and into italian in 1805 his shrewd
and homely mind his powers of keen observation and strong common sense
were revealed in his celebrated work zoonomia which was published in
two volumes in 1794 and translated into german in 179599 he was not a
zologist published no separate scientific articles and his striking
and original views on evolution which were so far in advance of his
time appear mostly in the section on generation comprising 173 pages
of his zoonomia152 which was mainly a medical work the book was
widely read excited much discussion and his views decided opposition
samuel butler in his evolution old and new 1879 remarks paleys
natural theology is written throughout at the zoonomia though he
is careful moro suo never to mention this work by name paleys
success was probably one of the chief causes of the neglect into which
the buffonian and darwinian systems fell in this country dr darwin
died in the same year 1802 as that in which the natural theology was
published
krause also writes of the reception given by his contemporaries to his
physiophilosophical ideas they spoke of his wild and eccentric
fancies and the expression darwinising as employed for example by
the poet coleridge when writing on stillingfleet was accepted in
england nearly as the antithesis of sober biological investigation153
the grandson of erasmus darwin had little appreciation of the views of
him of whom through atavic heredity he was the intellectual and
scientific child it is curious he says in the historical sketch of
the origin of speciesit is curious how largely my grandfather
dr erasmus darwin anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of
opinion of lamarck in his zoonomia vol i pp 500510 published
in 1794 it seems a little strange that charles darwin did not devote a
few lines to stating just what his ancestors views were for certain of
them as we shall see are anticipations of his own
the views of erasmus darwin may thus be summarily stated
1 all animals have originated from a single living filament p 230
or stated in other words referring to the warmblooded animals alone
one is led to conclude that they have alike been produced from a
similar living filament p 236 and again he expresses the conjecture
that one and the same kind of living filament is and has been the cause
of all organic life p 244 it does not follow that he was a
spermist since he strongly argued against the incasement or
evolution theory of bonnet
2 changes produced by differences of climate and even seasons thus
the sheep of warm climates are covered with hair instead of wool and
the hares and partridges of the latitudes which are long buried in snow
become white during the winter months p 234 only a passing
reference is made to this factor and the effects of domestication are
but cursorily referred to in this respect darwins views differed much
from buffons with whom they were the primary causes in the
modification of animals
the other factors or agencies are not referred to by buffon showing
that darwin was not indebted to buffon but thought out the matter in
his own independent way
3 fifthly from their first rudiment or primordium to the termination
of their lives all animals undergo perpetual transformations which are
in part produced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires
and aversions of their pleasures and their pains or of irritations or
of associations and many of these acquired forms or propensities are
transmitted to their posterity p 237 the three great objects of
desire are he says lust hunger and security p 237
4 contests of the males for the possession of the females or law of
battle under the head of desire he dwells on the desire of the male for
the exclusive possession of the female and these have acquired weapons
to combat each other for this purpose as the very thick shieldlike
horny skin on the shoulders of the boar and his tusks the horns of the
stag the spurs of cocks and quails the final cause he says of
this contest among the males seems to be that the strongest and most
active animal should propagate the species which should thence become
improved p 238 this savors so strongly of sexual selection that we
wonder very much that charles darwin repudiated it as erroneous it is
not mentioned by lamarck nor is dr darwins statement of the exertions
and desires of animals at all similar to lamarcks who could not have
borrowed his ideas on appetency from darwin or any other predecessor
5 the transmission of characters acquired during the lifetime of the
parent this is suggested in the following crude way
  thirdly when we enumerate the great changes produced in the
  species of animals before their maturity as for example when the
  offspring reproduces the effects produced upon the parent by
  accident or cultivation or the changes produced by the mixture of
  species as in mules or the changes produced probably by the
  exuberance of nourishment supplied to the fetus as in monstrous
  births with additional limbs many of these enormities of shape are
  propagated and continued as a variety at least if not as a new
  species of animal i have seen a breed of cats with an additional
  claw on every foot of poultry also with an additional claw and
  with wings to their feet and of others without rumps mr buffon
  mentions a breed of dogs without tails which are common at rome and
  naples which he supposes to have been produced by a custom long
  established of cutting their tails close off there are many kinds
  of pigeons admired for their peculiarities which are more or less
  thus produced and propagated154
6 the means of procuring food has he says diversified the forms of
all species of animals thus the nose of the swine has become hard for
the purpose of turning up the soil in search of insects and of roots
the trunk of the elephant is an elongation of the nose for the purpose
of pulling down the branches of trees for his food and for taking up
water without bending his knees beasts of prey have acquired strong
jaws or talons cattle have acquired a rough tongue and a rough palate
to pull off the blades of grass as cows and sheep some birds have
acquired harder beaks to crack nuts as the parrot others have acquired
beaks to break the harder seeds as sparrows others for the softer
kinds of flowers or the buds of trees as the finches other birds have
acquired long beaks to penetrate the moister soils in search of insects
or roots as woodcocks and others broad ones to filtrate the water of
lakes and to retain aquatic insects all which seem to have been
gradually produced during many generations by the perpetual endeavors of
the creature to supply the want of food and to have been delivered to
their posterity with constant improvement of them for the purpose
required p 238
7 the third great want among animals is that of security which seems
to have diversified the forms of their bodies and the color of them
these consist in the means of escaping other animals more powerful than
themselves155 hence some animals have acquired wings instead of legs
as the smaller birds for purposes of escape others great length of
fin or of membrane as the flyingfish and the bat others have acquired
hard or armed shells as the tortoise and the echinus marinus p 239
  the colors of insects he says and many smaller animals
  contribute to conceal them from the dangers which prey upon them
  caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally green earthworms
  the color of the earth which they inhabit butterflies which
  frequent flowers are colored like them small birds which frequent
  hedges have greenish backs like the leaves and lightcolored
  bellies like the sky and are hence less visible to the hawk who
  passes under them or over them those birds which are much amongst
  flowers as the goldfinch fringilla carduelis are furnished
  with vivid colors the lark partridge hare are the color of dry
  vegetables or earth on which they rest and frogs vary their color
  with the mud of the streams which they frequent and those which
  live on trees are green fish which are generally suspended in
  water and swallows which are generally suspended in air have
  their backs the color of the distant ground and their bellies of
  the sky in the colder climates many of these become white during
  the existence of the snows hence there is apparent design in the
  colors of animals whilst those of vegetables seem consequent to
  the other properties of the materials which possess them the
  loves of the plants p 38 note
in his zoonomia  xxxix vi darwin also speaks of the efficient
cause of the various colors of the eggs of birds and of the hair and
feathers of animals which are adapted to the purpose of concealment
thus the snake and wild cat and leopard are so colored as to resemble
dark leaves and their light interstices p 248 the eggs of
hedgebirds are greenish with dark spots those of crows and magpies
which are seen from beneath through wicker nests are white with dark
spots and those of larks and partridges are russet or brown like their
nests or situations he adds the final cause of their colors is easily
understood as they serve some purpose of the animal but the efficient
cause would seem almost beyond conjecture of all this subject of
protective mimicry thus sketched out by the older darwin we find no
hint or trace in any of lamarcks writings
8 great length of time he speaks of the great length of time since
the earth began to exist perhaps millions of ages before the
commencement of the history of mankind p 240
in this connection it may be observed that dr darwin emphatically
opposes the preformation views of haller and bonnet in these words
  many ingenious philosophers have found so great difficulty in
  conceiving the manner of the reproduction of animals that they have
  supposed all the numerous progeny to have existed in miniature in
  the animal originally created and that these infinitely minute
  forms are only evolved or distended as the embryon increases in the
  womb this idea besides being unsupported by any analogy we are
  acquainted with ascribes a greater tenuity to organized matter than
  we can readily admit p 317 and in another place he claims that
  we cannot but be convinced that the fetus or embryon is formed by
  apposition of new parts and not by the distention of a primordial
  nest of germs included one within another like the cups of a
  conjurer p 235
9 to explain instinct he suggests that the young simply imitate the
acts or example of their parents he says that wild birds choose spring
as their building time from the acquired knowledge that the mild
temperature of the air is more convenient for hatching their eggs and
further on referring to the fact that seedeating animals generally
produce their young in spring he suggests that it is part of the
traditional knowledge which they learn from the example of their
parents156
10 hybridity he refers in a cursory way to the changes produced by the
mixture of species as in mules
of these ten factors or principles and other views of dr darwin some
are similar to those of lamarck while others are directly opposed
there are therefore no good grounds for supposing that lamarck was
indebted to darwin for his views thus erasmus darwin supposes that the
formation of organs precedes their use as he says the lungs must be
previously formed before their exertions to obtain fresh air can exist
the throat or oesophagus must be formed previous to the sensation or
appetites of hunger and thirst zoonomia p 222 again zoonomia
i p 498 from hence i conclude that with the acquisition of new
parts new sensations and new desires as well as new powers are
produced p 226 lamarck does not carry his doctrine of
useinheritance so far as erasmus darwin who claimed what some still
maintain at the present day that the offspring reproduces the effects
produced upon the parent by accident or cultivation
the idea that all animals have descended from a similar living filament
is expressed in a more modern and scientific way by lamarck who derived
them from monads
the erasmus darwin way of stating that the transformations of animals
are in part produced by their own exertions in consequence of their
desires and aversions etc is stated in a quite different way by
lamarck
finally the principle of law of battle or the combat between the males
for the possession of the females with the result that the strongest
and most active animal should propagate the species is not hinted at
by lamarck this view on the contrary is one of the fundamental
principles of the doctrine of natural selection and was made use of by
charles darwin and others so also erasmus anticipated charles darwin in
the third great want of security in seeking which the forms and
colors of animals have been modified this is an anticipation of the
principle of protective mimicry so much discussed in these days by
darwin wallace and others and which was not even mentioned by
lamarck from the internal evidence of lamarcks writings we therefore
infer that he was in no way indebted to erasmus darwin for any hints or
ideas157

157 mr samuel butler in his evolution old and new taking it for
granted that lamarck was a partisan of immutability till 1801
intimates that the secret of this sudden conversion must be found in a
french translation by m deleuze of dr darwins poem the loves of the
plants which appeared in 1800 lamarckthe most eminent botanist of
his timewas sure to have heard of and seen this and would probably
know the translator who would be able to give him a fair idea of the
zoonomia p 258
but this notion seems disproved by the fact that lamarck delivered his
famous lecture published in 1801 during the last of april or in the
first half of may 1800 the views then presented must have been formed
in his mind at least for some timeperhaps a year or moreprevious
and were the result of no sudden inspiration least of all from any
information given him by deleuze whom he probably never met if lamarck
had actually seen and read the zoonomia he would have been manly
enough to have given him credit for any novel ideas besides that as we
have already seen the internal evidence shows that lamarcks views were
in some important points entirely different from those of erasmus
darwin and were conceptions original with the french zologist
krause in his excellent essay on the scientific works of erasmus darwin
1879 refers to lamarck as evidently a disciple of darwin stating
that lamarck worked out in all directions erasmus darwins principles
of will and active efforts p 212
chapter xv
when did lamarck change his views regarding the mutability of species
lamarcks mind was essentially philosophical he was given to inquiring
into the causes and origin of things when thirtytwo years old he wrote
his researches on the causes of the principal physical facts though
this work did not appear from the press until 1794 when he was fifty
years of age in this treatise he inquires into the origin of compounds
and of minerals also he conceived that all the rocks as well as all
chemical compounds and minerals originated from organic life these
inquiries were reiterated in his memoirs on physics and natural
history which appeared in 1797 when he was fiftythree years old
the atmosphere of philosophic france as well as of england and germany
in the eighteenth century was charged with inquiries into the origin of
things material though more especially of things immaterial it was a
period of energetic thinking whether lamarck had read the works of
these philosophers or not we have no means of knowing buffon we know
was influenced by leibnitz
did buffons guarded suggestions have no influence on the young lamarck
he enjoyed his friendship and patronage in early life frequenting his
house and was for a time the travelling companion of buffons son it
should seem most natural that he would have been personally influenced
by his great predecessor but we see no indubitable trace of such
influence in his writings lamarckism is not buffonism it comprises in
the main quite a different more varied and comprehensive set of
factors158
was lamarck influenced by the biological writings of haller bonnet or
by the philosophic views of condillac whose essai sur lorigine des
connaissances humaines appeared in 1786 or of condorcet whom he must
personally have known and whose esquisse dun tableau historique des
progrs de lesprit humain was published in 1794159 in one case only
in lamarcks works do we find reference to these thinkers
was lamarck as the result of his botanical studies from 1768 to 1793
and being puzzled as systematic botanists are by the variations of the
more plastic species of plants led to deny the fixity of species
we have been unable to find any indications of a change of views in his
botanical writings though his papers are prefaced by philosophical
reflections
it would indeed be interesting to know what led lamarck to change his
views without any explanation as to the reason from his own pen we
are led to suppose that his studies on the invertebrates his perception
of the gradations in the animal scale from monad to man together with
his inherent propensity to inquire into the origin of things also his
studies on fossils as well as the broadening nature of his zological
investigations and his meditations during the closing years of the
eighteenth century must gradually have led to a change of views
it was said by isidore geoffroy st hilaire that lamarck was long a
partisan of the immutability of species160 but the use of the word
partisan appears to be quite incorrect as he only in one instance
expresses such views
the only place where we have seen any statement of lamarcks earlier
opinions is in his recherches sur les causes des principaux faits
physiques which was written as the advertisement states about
eighteen years before its publication in 1794 the treatise was
actually presented april 22 1780 to the acadmie des sciences161 it
will be seen by the following passages which we translate that as
huxley states this view presents a striking contrast to those to be
found in the philosophie zoologique
  685 although my sole object in this article article premier
  p 188 has only been to treat of the physical cause of the
  maintenance of life of organic beings still i have ventured to urge
  at the outset that the existence of these astonishing beings by no
  means depends on nature that all which is meant by the word nature
  cannot give lifenamely that all the faculties of matter added to
  all possible circumstances and even to the activity pervading the
  universe cannot produce a being endowed with the power of organic
  movement capable of reproducing its like and subject to death
  686 all the individuals of this nature which exist are derived
  from similar individuals which all taken together constitute the
  entire species however i believe that it is as impossible for man
  to know the physical origin of the first individual of each species
  as to assign also physically the cause of the existence of matter or
  of the whole universe this is at least what the result of my
  knowledge and reflection leads me to think if there exist any
  varieties produced by the action of circumstances these varieties
  do not change the nature of the species ces varits ne dnaturent
  point les espces but doubtless we are often deceived in
  indicating as a species what is only a variety and i perceive that
  this error may be of consequence in reasoning on this subject
  tome ii pp 213214
it must apparently remain a matter of uncertainty whether this opinion
so decisively stated was that of lamarck at thirtytwo years of age
and which he allowed to remain as then stated for eighteen years or
whether he inserted it when reading the proofs in 1794 it would seem as
if it were the expression of his views when a botanist and a young man
in his mmoires de physique et dhistoire naturelle which was
published in 1797 there is nothing said bearing on the stability of
species and though his work is largely a repetition of the
recherches the author omits the passages quoted above was this
period of six years between 1794 and 1800 given to a reconsideration
of the subject resulting in favor of the doctrine of descent
huxley quotes these passages and then in a footnote p 211 after
stating that lamarcks recherches was not published before 1794 and
stating that at that time it presumably expressed lamarcks mature
views adds it would be interesting to know what brought about the
change of opinion manifested in the recherches sur lorganisation des
corps vivans published only seven years later
in the appendix to this book 1802 he thus refers to his change of
views i have for a long time thought that species were constant in
nature and that they were constituted by the individuals which belong
to each of them i am now convinced that i was in error in this respect
and that in reality only individuals exist in nature p 141
some clew in answer to the question as to when lamarck changed his views
is afforded by an almost casual statement by lamarck in the addition
entitled sur les fossiles to his systme des animaux sans vertbres
1801 where after speaking of fossils as extremely valuable monuments
for the study of the revolutions the earth has passed through at
different regions on its surface and of the changes living beings have
there themselves successively undergone he adds in parenthesis dans
mes leons jai toujours insiste sur ces considrations are we to
infer from this that these evolutionary views were expressed in his
first course or in one of the earlier courses of zological
lecturesie soon after his appointment in 1793and if not then
at least one or two or perhaps several years before the year 1800 for
even if the change in his views were comparatively sudden he must have
meditated upon the subject for months and even perhaps years before
finally committing himself to these views in print so strong and bold a
thinker as lamarck had already shown himself in these fields of thought
and one so inflexible and unyielding in holding to an opinion once
formed as he must have arrived at such views only after long
reflection there is also every reason to suppose that lamarcks theory
of descent was conceived by himself alone from the evidence which lay
before him in the plants and animals he had so well studied for the
preceding thirty years and that his inspiration came directly from
nature and not from buffon and least of all from the writings of
erasmus darwin

the steps in the development of lamarcks views on evolution before the
publication of his philosophie zoologique
i from the systme des animaux sans vertbres 1801
the first occasion on which so far as his published writings show
lamarck expressed his evolutional views was in the opening lecture162
of his course on the invertebrate animals delivered in the spring of
1800 and published in 1801 as a preface to his systme des animaux
sans vertbres this being the first sketch or prodromus of his later
great work on the invertebrate animals in the preface of this book
referring to the opening lecture he says i have glanced at some
important and philosophic views that the nature and limits of this work
do not permit me to develop but which i propose to take up elsewhere
with the details necessary to show on what facts they are based and
with certain explanations which would prevent any one from
misunderstanding them it may be inferred from this that he had for
some time previous meditated on this theme it will now be interesting
to see what factors of evolution lamarck employed in this first sketch
of his theory
after stating the distinctions existing between the vertebrate and
invertebrate animals and referring to the great diversity of animal
forms he goes on to say that nature began with the most simply
organized and having formed them then with the aid of much time and
of favorable circumstances she formed all the others
  it appears as i have already said that time and favorable
  conditions are the two principal means which nature has employed in
  giving existence to all her productions we know that for her time
  has no limit and that consequently she has it always at her
  disposal
  as to the circumstances of which she has had need and of which she
  makes use every day in order to cause her productions to vary we
  can say that they are in a manner inexhaustible
  the essential ones arise from the influence and from all the
  environing media milieux from the diversity of local causes
  diversit des lieux of habits of movements of action finally
  of means of living of preserving their lives of defending
  themselves of multiplying themselves etc moreover as the result
  of these different influences the faculties developed and
  strengthened by use usage became diversified by the new habits
  maintained for long ages and by slow degrees the structure the
  consistence in a word the nature the condition of the parts and of
  the organs consequently participating in all these influences
  became preserved and were propagated by generation163
  the bird which necessity besoin drives to the water to find
  there the prey needed for its subsistence separates the toes of its
  feet when it wishes to strike the water164 and move on its
  surface the skin which unites these toes at their base contracts
  in this way the habit of extending itself thus in time the broad
  membranes which connect the toes of ducks geese etc are formed
  in the way indicated
  but one accustomed to live perched on trees has necessarily the end
  of the toes lengthened and shaped in another way its claws are
  elongated sharpened and are curved and bent so as to seize the
  branches on which it so often rests
  likewise we perceive that the shore bird which does not care to
  swim but which however is obliged a besoin to approach the
  water to obtain its prey will be continually in danger of sinking
  in the mud but wishing to act so that its body shall not fall into
  the liquid it will contract the habit of extending and lengthening
  its feet hence it will result in the generations of these birds
  which continue to live in this manner that the individuals will
  find themselves raised as if on stilts on long naked feet namely
  denuded of feathers up to and often above the thighs
  i could here pass in review all the classes all the orders all
  the genera and species of animals which exist and make it apparent
  that the conformation of individuals and of their parts their
  organs their faculties etc is entirely the result of
  circumstances to which the race of each species has been subjected
  by nature
  i could prove that it is not the form either of the body or of its
  parts which gives rise to habits to the mode of life of animals
  but on the contrary it is the habits the mode of life and all
  the influential circumstances which have with time made up the
  form of the body and of the parts of animals with the new forms new
  faculties have been acquired and gradually nature has reached the
  state in which we actually see her pp 1215
he then points out the gradation which exists from the most simple
animal up to the most composite since from the monad which so to
speak is only an animated point up to the mammals and from them up to
man there is evidently a shaded gradation in the structure of all the
animals so also among the plants there is a graduated series from the
simplest such as mucor viridescens up to the most complicated plant
but he hastens to say that by this regular gradation in the complication
of the organization he does not mean to infer the existence of a linear
series with regular intervals between the species and genera
  such a series does not exist but i speak of a series almost
  regularly graduated in the principal groups masses such as the
  great families series most assuredly existing both among animals
  and among plants but which as regards genera and especially
  species form in many places lateral ramifications whose
  extremities offer truly isolated points
this is the first time in the history of biological science that we have
stated in so scientific broad and modern form the essential
principles of evolution lamarck insists that time without limit and
favorable conditions are the two principal means or factors in the
production of plants and animals under the head of favorable conditions
he enumerates variations in climate temperature the action of the
environment the diversity of local causes change of habits movement
action variation in means of living of preservation of life of means
of defence and varying modes of reproduction as the result of the
action of these different factors the faculties of animals developed
and strengthened by use become diversified by the new habits so that
by slow degrees the new structures and organs thus arising become
preserved and transmitted by heredity
in this address it should be noticed that nothing is said of willing and
of internal feeling which have been so much misunderstood and
ridiculed or of the direct or indirect action of the environment he
does speak of the bird as wishing to strike the water but this
liberally interpreted is as much a physiological impulse as a mental
desire no reference also is made to geographical isolation a factor
which he afterwards briefly mentioned
although lamarck does not mention the principle of selection he refers
in the following way to competition or at least to the checks on the
too rapid multiplication of the lower invertebrates
  so were it not for the immense consumption as food which is made in
  nature of animals which compose the lower orders of the animal
  kingdom these animals would soon overpower and perhaps destroy by
  their enormous numbers the more highly organized and perfect
  animals which compose the first classes and the first orders of this
  kingdom so great is the difference in the means and facility of
  multiplying between the two
  but nature has anticipated the dangerous effects of this vast power
  of reproduction and multiplication she has prevented it on the one
  hand by considerably limiting the duration of life of these beings
  so simply organized which compose the lower classes and especially
  the lowest orders of the animal kingdom on the other hand both by
  making these animals the prey of each other thus incessantly
  reducing their numbers and also by determining through the
  diversity of climates the localities where they could exist and by
  the variety of seasonsie by the influences of different
  atmospheric conditionsthe time during which they could maintain
  their existence
  by means of these wise precautions of nature everything is well
  balanced and in order individuals multiply propagate and die in
  different ways no species predominates up to the point of effecting
  the extinction of another except perhaps in the highest classes
  where the multiplication of the individuals is slow and difficult
  and as the result of this state of things we conceive that in
  general species are preserved p 22
here we have in anticipation the doctrine of malthus which as will be
remembered so much impressed charles darwin and led him in part to
work out his principle of natural selection
the author then taking up other subjects first asserts that among the
changes that animals and plants unceasingly bring about by their
production and dbris it is not the largest and most perfect animals
which have caused the most considerable changes but rather the coral
polyps etc165 he then after dilating on the value of the study of
the invertebrate animals proceeds to define them and closes his
lecture by describing the seven classes into which he divides this
group
ii recherches sur lorganisation des corps vivans 1802 opening
discourse
the following is an abstract with translations of the most important
passages relating to evolution
that the portion of the animal kingdom treated in these lectures
comprises more species than all the other groups taken together is
however the least of those considerations which should interest my
hearers
  it is the group containing the most curious forms the richest in
  marvels of every kind the most astonishing especially from the
  singular facts of organization that they present though it is that
  hitherto the least considered under these grand points of view
  how much better than learning the names and characters of all the
  species is it to learn of the origin relation and mode of
  existence of all the natural productions with which we are
  surrounded
  first part progress in structure of living beings in proportion
  as circumstances favor them
  when we give continued attention to the examination of the
  organization of different living beings to that of different
  systems which this organization presents in each organic kingdom
  finally to certain changes which are seen to be undergone in certain
  circumstances we are convinced
  1 that the nature of organic movement is not only to develop the
  organization but also to multiply the organs and to fulfil the
  functions and that at the outset this organic movement continually
  tends to restrict to functions special to certain parts the
  functions which were at first generalie common to all parts
  of the body
  2 that the result of nutrition is not only to supply to the
  developing organization what the organic movement tends to form but
  besides also by a forced inequality between the matters which are
  assimilated and those which are dissipated by losses this function
  at a certain term of the duration of life causes a progressive
  deterioration of the organs so that as a necessary consequence it
  inevitably causes death
  3 that the property of the movement of the fluids in the parts
  which contain them is to break out passages places of deposit and
  outlets to there create canals and consequently different organs
  to cause these canals as well as the organs to vary on account of
  the diversity both of the movements and of the nature of the fluids
  which give rise to them finally to enlarge elongate to gradually
  divide and solidify the walls of these canals and these organs by
  the matters which form and incessantly separate the fluids which are
  there in movement and one part of which is assimilated and added to
  the organs while the other is rejected and cast out
  4 that the state of organization in each organism has been
  gradually acquired by the progress of the influences of the movement
  of fluids and by those changes that these fluids have there
  continually undergone in their nature and their condition through
  the habitual succession of their losses and of their renewals
  5 that each organization and each form acquired by this course of
  things and by the circumstances which there have concurred were
  preserved and transmitted successively by generation heredity
  until new modifications of these organizations and of these forms
  have been acquired by the same means and by new circumstances
  6 finally that from the uninterrupted concurrence of these causes
  or from these laws of nature together with much time and with an
  almost inconceivable diversity of influential circumstances organic
  beings of all the orders have been successively formed
  considerations so extraordinary relatively to the ideas that the
  vulgar have generally formed on the nature and origin of living
  bodies will be naturally regarded by you as stretches of the
  imagination unless i hasten to lay before you some observations and
  facts which supply the most complete evidence
  from the point of view of knowledge based on observation the
  philosophic naturalist feels convinced that it is in that which is
  called the lowest classes of the two organic kingdomsie in
  those which comprise the most simply organized beingsthat we can
  collect facts the most luminous and observations the most decisive
  on the production and the reproduction of the living beings in
  question on the causes of the formation of the organs of these
  wonderful beings and on those of their developments of their
  diversity and their multiplicity which increase with the concourse
  of generations of times and of influential circumstances
  hence we may be assured that it is only among the singular beings
  of these lowest classes and especially in the lowest orders of
  these classes that it is possible to find on both sides the
  primitive germs of life and consequently the germs of the most
  important faculties of animality and vegetality
modification of the organization from one end to the other of the
animal chain
one is forced he says to recognize that the totality of existing
animals constitute a series of groups forming a true chain and that
there exists from one end to the other of this chain a gradual
modification in the structure of the animals composing it as also a
proportionate diminution in the number of faculties of these animals
from the highest to the lowest the first germs these being without
doubt the form with which nature began with the aid of much time and
favorable circumstances to form all the others
he then begins with the mammals and descends to molluscs annelids and
insects down to the polyps as it is better to proceed from the known
to the unknown but farther on p 38 he finally remarks
  ascend from the most simple to the most compound depart from the
  most imperfect animalcule and ascend along the scale up to the
  animal richest in structure and faculties constantly preserve the
  order of relation in the group then you will hold the true thread
  which connects all the productions of nature you will have a just
  idea of its progress and you will be convinced that the most simple
  of its living productions have successively given existence to all
  the others
  the series which constitutes the animal scale resides in the
  distribution of the groups and not in that of the individuals and
  species
  i have already said166 that by this shaded graduation in the
  complication of structure i do not mean to speak of the existence
  of a linear and regular series of species or even genera such a
  series does not exist but i speak of a quite regularly graduated
  series in the principal groups ie in the principal system of
  organizations known which give rise to classes and to great
  families series most assuredly existing both among animals and
  plants although in the consideration of genera and especially in
  that of species it offers many lateral ramifications whose
  extremities are truly isolated points
  however although there has been denied in a very modern work the
  existence in the animal kingdom of a single series natural and at
  the same time graduated in the composition of the organization of
  beings which it comprehends series in truth necessarily formed of
  groups subordinated to each other as regards structure and not of
  isolated species or genera i ask where is the wellinformed
  naturalist who would now present a different order in the
  arrangement of the twelve classes of the animal kingdom of which i
  have just given an account
  i have already stated what i think of this view which has seemed
  sublime to some moderns and indorsed by professor hermann
each distinct group or mass of forms has he says its peculiar system
of essential organs but each organ considered by itself does not follow
as regular a course in its degradations modifications
  indeed the least important organs or those least essential to
  life are not always in relation to each other in their improvement
  or their degradation and an organ which in one species is atrophied
  may be very perfect in another these irregular variations in the
  perfecting and in the degradation of nonessential organs are due to
  the fact that these organs are oftener than the others submitted to
  the influences of external circumstances and give rise to a
  diversity of species so considerable and so singularly ordered that
  instead of being able to arrange them like the groups in a single
  simple linear series under the form of a regular graduated scale
  these very species often form around the groups of which they are
  part lateral ramifications the extremities of which offer points
  truly isolated
  there is needed in order to change each internal system of
  organization a combination of more influential circumstances and
  of more prolonged duration than to alter and modify the external
  organs
  i have observed however that when circumstances demand nature
  passes from one system to another without making a leap provided
  they are allies it is indeed by this faculty that she has come to
  form them all in succession in proceeding from the simple to the
  more complex
  it is so true that she has the power that she passes from one
  system to the other not only in two different families which are
  allied but she also passes from one system to the other in the same
  individual
  the systems of organization which admit as organs of respiration
  true lungs are nearer to systems which admit gills than those which
  require trache thus not only does nature pass from gills to lungs
  in allied classes and families as seen in fishes and reptiles but
  in the latter she passes even during the life of the same
  individual which successively possesses each system we know that
  the frog in the tadpole state respires by gills while in the more
  perfect state of frog it respires by lungs we never see that nature
  passes from a system with trache to a system with lungs
  it is not the organs ie the nature and form of the parts of
  the body of an animal which give rise to the special habits and
  faculties but on the contrary its habits its mode of life and
  the circumstances in which individuals are placed which have with
  time brought about the form of its body the number and condition
  of its organs finally the faculties which it possesses
                                   
  time and favorable circumstances are the two principal means which
  nature employs to give existence to all her productions we know
  that time has for her no limit and that consequently she has it
  always at her disposition
  as to the circumstances of which she has need besoin and which
  she employs every day to bring about variations in all that she
  continues to produce we can say that they are in her in some degree
  inexhaustible
  the principal ones arise from the influence of climate from that
  of different temperatures of the atmosphere and from all
  environing surroundings milieux from that of the diversity of
  places and their situations from that of the most ordinary habitual
  movements of actions the most frequent finally from that of the
  means of preservation of the mode of life of defence of
  reproduction etc
  moreover as the result of these different influences the faculties
  increase and strengthen themselves by use diversify themselves by
  the new habits preserved through long periods and insensibly the
  conformation the consistencein a word the nature and state of
  the parts and also of the organsconsequently participate in all
  these influences are preserved and propagate themselves by
  generation systme des animaux sans vertbres p 12
                                   
  it is easy for any one to see that the habit of exercising an organ
  in every living being which has not reached the term of diminution
  of its faculties not only makes this organ more perfect but even
  makes it acquire developments and dimensions which insensibly change
  it with the result that with time it renders it very different from
  the same organ considered in another organism which has not or has
  but slightly exercised it it is also very easy to prove that the
  constant lack of exercise of an organ gradually reduces it and ends
  by atrophying it
then follow the facts regarding the mole spalax anteater and the
lack of teeth in birds the origin of shore birds swimming birds and
perching birds which are stated farther on
  thus the efforts in any direction maintained for a long time or
  made habitually by certain parts of a living body to satisfy the
  needs called out exigs by nature or by circumstances develop
  these parts and cause them to acquire dimensions and a form which
  they never would have obtained if these efforts had not become an
  habitual action of the animals which have exercised them
  observations made on all the animals known would furnish examples of
  this
  when the will determines an animal to any kind of action the
  organs whose function it is to execute this action are then
  immediately provoked by the flowing there of subtile fluids which
  become the determining cause of movements which perform the action
  in question a multitude of observations support this fact which
  now no one would doubt
  it results from this that multiplied repetitions of these acts of
  organization strengthen extend develop and even create the organs
  which are there needed it is only necessary to closely observe that
  which is everywhere happening in this respect to firmly convince
  ourselves of this cause of developments and organic changes
  however each change acquired in an organ by habitual use
  sufficient to have formed opr it is preserved by generation
  if it is common to the individuals which unite in the reproduction
  of their kind finally this change propagates itself and is then
  handed down se passe to all the individuals which succeed and
  which are submitted to the same circumstances without their having
  been obliged to acquire it by the means which have really created
  it
  besides in the unions between the sexes the intermixtures between
  individuals which have different qualities or forms are necessarily
  opposed to the constant propagation of these qualities and forms we
  see that which in man who is exposed to such different
  circumstances which influence individuals prevents the qualities of
  accidental defects which they have happened to acquire from being
  preserved and propagated by heredity gnration
  you can now understand how by such means and an inexhaustible
  diversity of circumstances nature with sufficient length of time
  has been able to and should produce all these results
  if i should choose here to pass in review all the classes orders
  genera and species of animals in existence i could make you see
  that the structure of individuals and their organs faculties etc
  is solely the result of circumstances to which each species and all
  its races have been subjected by nature and of habits that the
  individuals of this species have been obliged to contract
  the influences of localities and of temperatures are so striking
  that naturalists have not hesitated to recognize the effects on the
  structure the developments and the faculties of the living bodies
  subject to them
  we have long known that the animals inhabiting the torrid zone are
  very different from those which live in the other zones buffon has
  remarked that even in latitudes almost the same the animals of the
  new continent are not the same as those of the old
  finally the count lacpde wishing to give to this wellfounded
  fact the precision which he believed it susceptible has traced
  twentysix zological divisions on the dry parts of the globe and
  eighteen over the ocean but there are many other influences than
  those which depend on localities and temperatures
  everything tends then to prove my assertionnamely that it is
  not the form either of the body or of its parts which has given rise
  to habits and to the mode of life of animals but on the contrary
  it is the habits the mode of life and all the other influential
  circumstances which have with time produced the form of the bodies
  and organs of animals with new forms new faculties have been
  acquired and gradually nature has arrived at the state where we
  actually see it
                                   
  finally as it is only at that extremity of the animal kingdom where
  occur the most simply organized animals that we meet those which may
  be regarded as the true germs of animality and it is the same at
  the same end of the vegetable series is it not at this end of the
  scale both animal and vegetable that nature has commenced and
  recommenced without ceasing the first germ of her living production
  who is there in a word who does not see that the process of
  perfection of those of these first germs which circumstances have
  favored will gradually and after the lapse of time give rise to all
  the degrees of perfection and of the composition of the
  organization from which will result this multiplicity and this
  diversity of living beings of all orders with which the exterior
  surface of our globe is almost everywhere filled or covered
  indeed if the manner usage of life tends to develop the
  organization and even to form and multiply the organs as the state
  of an animal which has just been born proves it compared to that
  where it finds itself when it has reached the term where its organs
  beginning to deteriorate cease to make new developments if then
  each particular organ undergoes remarkable changes according as it
  is exercised and according to the manner of which i have shown you
  some examples you will understand that in carrying you to the end
  of the animal chain where are found the most simple organizations
  and that in considering among these organizations those whose
  simplicity is so great that they lie at the very door of the
  creative power of nature then this same naturethat is to say the
  state of things which existhas been to form directly the first
  beginnings of organization she has been able consequently by the
  manner of life and the aid of circumstances which favor its
  duration to progressively render perfect its work and to carry it
  to the point where we now see it
  time is wanting to present to you the series of results of my
  researches on this interesting subject and to develop
  1 what really is life
  2 how nature herself creates the first traces of organization in
  appropriate groups where it had not existed
  3 how the organic or vital movement is excited by it and held
  together with the aid of a stimulating and active cause which she
  has at her disposal in abundance in certain climates and in certain
  seasons of the year
  4 finally how this organic movement by the influence of its
  duration and by that of the multitude of circumstances which modify
  its effects develops arranges and gradually complicates the
  organs of the living body which possesses them
  such has been without doubt the will of the infinite wisdom which
  reigns throughout nature and such is effectively the order of
  things clearly indicated by the observation of all the facts which
  relate to them end of the opening discourse
  appendix p 141
  on species in living bodies
  i have for a long time thought that species were constant in
  nature and that they were constituted by the individuals which
  belong to each of them
  i am now convinced that i was in error in this respect and that in
  reality only individuals exist in nature
  the origin of this error which i have shared with many naturalists
  who still hold it arises from the long duration in relation to
  us of the same state of things in each place which each organism
  inhabits but this duration of the same state of things for each
  place has its limits and with much time it makes changes in each
  point of the surface of the globe which produces changes in every
  kind of circumstances for the organisms which inhabit it
  indeed we may now be assured that nothing on the surface of the
  terrestrial globe remains in the same state everything after a
  while undergoes different changes more or less prompt according
  to the nature of the objects and of circumstances elevated areas
  are constantly being lowered and the loose material carried down to
  the lowlands the beds of rivers of streams of even the sea are
  gradually removed and changed as also the climate167 in a word
  the whole surface of the earth gradually undergoes a change in
  situation form nature and aspect we see on every hand what
  ascertained facts prove it is only necessary to observe and to give
  ones attention to be convinced of it
  however if relatively to living beings the diversity of
  circumstances brings about for them a diversity of habits a
  different mode of existence and as the result modifications in
  their organs and in the shape of their parts one should believe
  that very gradually every living body whatever would vary in its
  organization and its form
  all the modifications that each living being will have undergone as
  the result of change of circumstances which have influenced its
  nature will doubtless be propagated by heredity gnration but
  as new modifications will necessarily continue to operate however
  slowly not only will there continually be found new species new
  genera and even new orders but each species will vary in some part
  of its structure and its form
  i very well know that to our eyes there seems in this respect a
  stability which we believe to be constant although it is not so
  truly for a very great number of centuries may form a period
  insufficient for the changes of which i speak to be marked enough
  for us to appreciate them thus we say that the flamingo
  phoenicopterus has always had as long legs and as long a neck
  as have those with which we are familiar finally it is said that
  all animals whose history has been transmitted for 2000 or 3000
  years are always the same and have lost or acquired nothing in the
  process of perfection of their organs and in the form of their
  different parts we may be assured that this appearance of
  stability of things in nature will always be taken for reality by
  the average of mankind because in general it judges everything only
  relatively to itself
  but i repeat this consideration which has given rise to the
  admitted error owes its source to the very great slowness of the
  changes which have gone on a little attention given to the facts
  which i am about to cite will afford the strongest proof of my
  assertion
  what nature does after a great length of time we do every day by
  suddenly changing as regards a living being the circumstances in
  which it and all the individuals of its species are placed
  all botanists know that the plants which they transplant from their
  natal spot into gardens for cultivation there gradually undergo
  changes which in the end render them unrecognizable many plants
  naturally very hairy there become glabrous or nearly so a quantity
  of those which were procumbent or trailing there have erect stems
  others lose their spines or their thorns finally the dimensions of
  parts undergo changes which the circumstances of their new situation
  infallibly produce this is so well known that botanists prefer not
  to describe them at least unless they are newly cultivated is not
  wheat triticum sativum a plant brought by man to the state
  wherein we actually see it which otherwise i could not believe who
  can now say in what place its like lives in nature
  to these known facts i will add others still more remarkable and
  which confirm the view that change of circumstances operates to
  change the parts of living organisms
  when ranunculus aquatilis lives in deep water all it can do
  while growing is to make the end of its stalks reach the surface of
  the water where they flourish then all the leaves of the plant are
  finely cut or pinked168 if the same plant grows in shallower
  water the growth of its stalks may give them sufficient extent for
  the upper leaves to develop out of the water then its lower leaves
  only will be divided into hairlike joints while the upper ones
  will be simple rounded and a little lobed169 this is not all
  when the seeds of the same plant fall into some ditch where there is
  only water or moisture sufficient to make them germinate the plant
  develops all its leaves in the air and then none of them is divided
  into capillary points which gives rise to ranunculus hederaceus
  which botanists regard as a species
  another very striking proof of the effect of a change of
  circumstances on a plant submitted to it is the following
  it is observed that when a tuft of juncus bufonius grows very
  near the edge of the water in a ditch or marsh this rush then pushes
  out filiform stems which lie in the water are there deformed
  becoming disturbed traantes proliferous and very different
  from that of juncus bufonius which grows out of water this plant
  modified by the circumstances i have just indicated has been
  regarded as a distinct species it is the juncus supinus of
  rotte170
  i could also give citations to prove that the changes of
  circumstances relative to organisms necessarily change the
  influences which they undergo on the part of all that which environs
  them or which acts on them and so necessarily bring about changes
  in their size their shape their different organs
  then among living beings nature seems to me to offer in an absolute
  manner only individuals which succeed one another by generation
  however in order to facilitate the study and recognition of these
  organisms i give the name of species to every collection of
  individuals which during a long period resemble each other so much
  in all their parts that these individuals only present small
  accidental differences which in plants reproduction by seeds
  causes to disappear
  but besides that at the end of a long period the totality of
  individuals of such a species change as the circumstances which act
  on them those of these individuals which from special causes are
  transported into very different situations from those where the
  others occur and then constantly submitted to other influencesthe
  former i say assume new forms as the result of a long habit of
  this other mode of existence and then they constitute a new
  species which comprehends all the individuals which occur in the
  same condition of existence we see then the faithful picture of
  that which happened in this respect in nature and of that which the
  observation of its acts can alone discover to us
iii lamarcks views on species as published in 1803
in the opening lecture171 of his course at the museum of natural
history delivered in prairial may 20june 18 1803 we have a
further statement of the theoretical views of lamarck on species and
their origin he addresses his audience as citoyens france still
being under the rgime of the republic
the brochure containing this address is exceedingly rare the only copy
existing as far as we know being in the library of the museum of
natural history in paris the authors name is not even given and there
is no imprint lamarcks name however is written on the outside of the
cover of the copy we have translated at the end of the otherwise blank
page succeeding the last page p 46 is printed the words esquisse
dun philosophie zoologique the preliminary sketch however never
having been added
he begins by telling his hearers that they should not desire to burden
their memories with the infinite details and immense nomenclature of
the prodigious quantity of animals among which we distinguish an
illimitable number of species but what is more worthy of you and of
more educational value you should seek to know the course of nature
you may enter upon the study of classes orders genera and even of
the most interesting species because this would be useful to you but
you should never forget that all these subdivisions which could not
however be well spared are artificial and that nature does not
recognize any of them
  in the opening lecture of my last years course i tried to convince
  you that it is only in the organization of animals that we find the
  foundation of the natural relations between the different groups
  where they diverge and where they approach each other finally i
  tried to show you that the enormous series of animals which nature
  has produced presents from that of its extremities where are placed
  the most perfect animals down to that which comprises the most
  imperfect or the most simple an evident modification though
  irregularly defined nuanc in the structure of the
  organization
  today after having recalled some of the essential considerations
  which form the base of this great truth after having shown you the
  principal means by which nature is enabled to create oprer her
  innumerable productions and to vary them infinitely finally after
  having made you see that in the use she has made of her power of
  generating and multiplying living beings she has necessarily
  proceeded from the more simple to the more complex gradually
  complicating the organization of these bodies as also the
  composition of their substance while also in that which she has
  done on nonliving bodies she has occupied herself unremittingly in
  the destruction of all prexistent combinations i shall undertake
  to examine under your eyes the great question in natural
  historywhat is a species among organized beings
  when we consider the series of animals beginning at the end
  comprising the most perfect and complicated and passing down
  through all the degrees of this series to the other end we see a
  very evident modification in structure and faculties on the
  contrary if we begin with the end which comprises animals the most
  simple in organization the poorest in faculties and in organsin a
  word the most imperfect in all respectswe necessarily remark as
  we gradually ascend in the series a truly progressive complication
  in the organization of these different animals and we see the
  organs and faculties of these beings successively multiplying and
  diversifying in a most remarkable manner
  these facts once known present truths which are to some extent
  eternal for nothing here is the product of our imagination or of
  our arbitrary principles that which i have just explained rests
  neither on systems nor on any hypothesis it is only the very simple
  result of the observation of nature hence i do not fear to advance
  the view that all that one can imagine from any motives whatever
  to contradict these great verities will always be destroyed by the
  evidence of the facts with which it deals
  to these facts it is necessary to add these very important
  considerations which observation has led me to perceive and the
  basis of which will always be recognized by those who pay attention
  to them they are as follows
  firstly the exercise of life and consequently of organic
  movement constitutes its activity tends without ceasing not only
  to develop and to extend the organization but it tends besides to
  multiply the organs and to isolate them in special centres
  foyers to make sure whether the exercise of life tends to
  extend and develop the organization it suffices to consider the
  state of the organs of any animal which has just been born and to
  compare them in this condition with what they are when the animal
  has attained the period when its organs cease to receive any new
  development then we will see on what this organic law is based
  which i have published in my recherches sur les corps vivans
  p 8 ie that
  the special property of movement of fluids in the supple parts of
  the living body which contain them is to open frayer there
  routes places of deposit and tissues to create there canals and
  consequently different organs to cause these canals and these
  organs to vary there by reason of the diversity both of the
  movements as well as the nature of the fluids which occur there
  finally to enlarge to elongate to divide and to gradually
  strengthen affermir these canals and their organs by the matters
  which are formed in the fluids in motion which incessantly separate
  themselves and a part of which is assimilated and united with
  organs while the rest is rejected
  secondly the continual employment of an organ especially if it is
  strongly exercised strengthens this organ develops it increases
  its dimensions enlarges and extends its faculties
  this second law of effects of exercise of life has been understood
  for a long time by those observers who have paid attention to the
  phenomena of organization
  indeed we know that all the time that an organ or a system of
  organs is rigorously exercised throughout a long time not only its
  power and the parts which form it grow and strengthen themselves
  but there are proofs that this organ or system of organs at that
  time attracts to itself the principal active forces of the life of
  the individual because it becomes the cause which under these
  conditions makes the functions of other organs to be diminished in
  power
  thus not only every organ or every part of the body whether of man
  or of animals being for a long period and more vigorously exercised
  than the others has acquired a power and facility of action that
  the same organ could not have had before and that it has never had
  in individuals which have exercised less but also we consequently
  remark that the excessive employment of this organ diminishes the
  functions of the others and proportionately enfeebles them
  the man who habitually and vigorously exercises the organ of his
  intelligence develops and acquires a great facility of attention of
  aptitude for thought etc but he has a feeble stomach and strongly
  limited muscular powers he on the contrary who thinks little does
  not easily and then only momentarily fixes his attention while
  habitually giving much exercise to his muscular organs has much
  vigor possesses an excellent digestion and is not given to the
  abstemiousness of the savant and man of letters
  moreover when one exercises long and vigorously an organ or system
  of organs the active forces of life in my opinion the nervous
  fluid have taken such a habit of acting porter towards this
  organ that they have formed in the individual an inclination to
  continue to exercise which it is difficult for it to overcome
  hence it happens that the more we exercise an organ the more we
  use it with facility the more does it result that we perceive the
  need besoin of continuing to use it at the times when it is
  placed in action so we remark that the habit of study of
  application of work or of any other exercise of our organs or of
  any one of our organs becomes with time an indispensable need to
  the individual and often a passion which it does not know how to
  overcome
  thirdly finally the effort made by necessity to obtain new
  faculties is aided by the concurrence of favorable circumstances
  they create crent with time the new organs which are adapted
  propres to their faculties and which as the result develop
  after long use quen suite un long emploi dveloppe
  how important is this consideration and what light it spreads on
  the state of organization of the different animals now living
  assuredly it will not be those who have long been in the habit of
  observing nature and who have followed attentively that which
  happens to living individuals to animals and to plants who will
  deny that a great change in the circumstances of their situation and
  of their means of existence forces them and their race to adopt new
  habits it will not be those i say who attempt to contest the
  foundation of the consideration which i have just exposed
  they can readily convince themselves of the solidity of that which
  i have already published in this respect172
  i have felt obliged to recall to you these great considerations a
  sketch of which i traced for you last year and which i have stated
  for the most part in my different works because they serve as you
  have seen as a solution of the problem which interests so many
  naturalists and which concerns the determination of species among
  living bodies
  indeed if in ascending in the series of animals from the most
  simply organized animalcule as from the monad which seems to be
  only an animated point up to the animals the most perfect or whose
  structure is the most complicatedin a word up to animals with
  mammyou observe in the different orders which comprise this great
  series a gradation shaded nuanc although irregular in the
  composition of the organization and in the increasing number of
  faculties is it not evident that in the case where nature would
  exert some active power on the existence of these organized bodies
  she has been able to make them exist only by beginning with the most
  simple and that she has been able to form directly among the
  animals only that which i call the rough sketches or germs
  bauches of animalitythat is to say only these animalcules
  almost invisible and to some extent without consistence that we see
  develop spontaneously and in an astonishing abundance in certain
  places and under certain circumstances while only in contrary
  circumstances are they totally destroyed
  do we not therefore perceive that by the action of the laws of
  organization which i have just now indicated and by that of
  different means of multiplication which are due to them qui en
  drivent nature has in favorable times places and climates
  multiplied her first germs bauches of animality given place to
  developments of their organizations rendered gradually greater the
  duration of those which have originally descended from them and
  increased and diversified their organs then always preserving the
  progress acquired by the reproductions of individuals and the
  succession of generations and aided by much time and by a slow but
  constant diversity of circumstances she has gradually brought about
  in this respect the state of things which we now observe
  how grand is this consideration and especially how remote is it
  from all that is generally thought on this subject moreover the
  astonishment which its novelty and its singularity may excite in you
  requires that at first you should suspend your judgment in regard to
  it but the observation which establishes it is now on record
  consigne and the facts which support it exist and are
  incessantly renewed however as they open a vast field to your
  studies and to your own researches it is to you yourselves that i
  appeal to pronounce on this great subject when you have sufficiently
  examined and followed all the facts which relate to it
  if among living bodies there are any the consideration of whose
  organization and of the phenomena which they produce can enlighten
  us as to the power of nature and its course relatively to the
  existence of these bodies also as to the variations which they
  undergo we certainly have to seek for them in the lowest classes of
  the two organic kingdoms the animals and the plants it is in the
  classes which comprise the living bodies whose organization is the
  least complex that we can observe and bring together facts the most
  luminous observations the most decisive on the origin of these
  bodies on their reproduction and their admirable diversification
  finally on the formation and the development of their different
  organs the whole process being aided by the concurrence of
  generations of time and of circumstances
  it is indeed among living bodies the most multiplied the most
  numerous in nature the most prompt and easy to regenerate
  themselves that we should seek the most instructive facts bearing
  on the course of nature and on the means she has employed to create
  her innumerable productions in this case we perceive that
  relatively to the animal kingdom we should chiefly give our
  attention to the invertebrate animals because their enormous
  multiplicity in nature the singular diversity of their systems of
  organization and of their means of multiplication their increasing
  simplification and the extreme fugacity of those which compose the
  lowest orders of these animals show us much better than the others
  the true course of nature and the means which she has used and
  which she is still incessantly employing to give existence to all
  the living bodies of which we have knowledge
  her course and her means are without doubt the same for the
  production of the different plants which exist and indeed though
  it is not believed as some naturalists have wrongly held but
  without proof that plants are bodies more simple in organization
  than the most simple animals it is a veritable error which
  observation plainly denies
  truly vegetable substance is less surcharged with constituent
  principles than any animal substance whatever or at least most of
  them but the substance of a living body and the organization of
  these bodies are two very different things but there is in plants
  as in animals a true gradation in organization from the plant
  simplest in organization and parts up to plants the most complex in
  structure and with the most diversified organs
  if there is some approach or at least some comparison to make
  between vegetables and animals this can only be by opposing plants
  the most simply organized like fungi and alg to the most
  imperfect animals like the polyps and especially the amorphous
  polyps which occur in the lowest order
  at present we clearly see that in order to bring about the
  existence of animals of all the classes of all the orders and of
  all the genera nature has had to begin by giving existence to those
  which are the most simple in organization and lacking most in organs
  and faculties the frailest in constituency the most ephemeral the
  quickest and easiest to multiply and we shall find in the
  amorphous or microscopic polyps the most striking examples of
  this simplification of organization and the indication that it is
  solely among them that occur the astonishing germs of animality
  at present we only know the principal law of the organization the
  power of the exercise of the functions of life the influence of the
  movement of fluids in the supple parts of organic bodies and the
  power which the regenerations have of conserving the progress
  acquired in the composition of organs
  at present finally relying on numerous observations seeing that
  with the aid of much time of changes in local circumstances in
  climates and consequently in the habits of animals the progression
  in the complication of their organization and in the diversity of
  their parts has gradually operated a d soprer in a way that
  all the animals now known have been successively formed such as we
  now see them it becomes possible to find the solution of the
  following question
  what is a species among living beings
  all those who have much to do with the study of natural history
  know that naturalists at the present day are extremely embarrassed
  in defining what they mean by the word species
  in truth observation for a long time has shown us and shows us
  still in a great number of cases collections of individuals which
  resemble each other so much in their organization and by the
  ensemble of their parts that we do not hesitate to regard these
  collections of similar individuals as constituting so many species
  from this consideration we call species every collection of
  individuals which are alike or almost so and we remark that the
  regeneration of these individuals conserves the species and
  propagates it in continuing successively to reproduce similar
  individuals
  formerly it was supposed that each species was immutable as old as
  nature and that she had caused its special creation by the supreme
  author of all which exists
  but we can impose on him laws in the execution of his will and
  determine the mode which he has been pleased to follow in this
  respect so it is only in this way that he permits us to recognize
  it by the aid of observation has not his infinite power created an
  order of things which successively gives existence to all that we
  see as well as to all that which exists and which we do not know
  assuredly whatever has been his will the omnipotence of his power
  is always the same and in whatever way this supreme will has been
  manifested nothing can diminish its greatness as regards then
  the decrees of this infinite wisdom i confine myself to the limits
  of a simple observer of nature then if i discover anything in the
  course that nature follows in her creations i shall say without
  fear of deceiving myself that it has pleased its author that she
  possesses this power
  the idea that was held as to species among living bodies was quite
  simple easy to grasp and seemed confirmed by the constancy in the
  similar form of the individuals which reproduction or generation
  perpetuated there still occur among us a very great number of these
  pretended species which we see every day
  however the farther we advance in the knowledge of the different
  organized bodies with which almost every part of the surface of the
  globe is covered the more does our embarrassment increase in
  determining what should be regarded as species and the greater is
  the reason for limiting and distinguishing the genera
  as we gradually gather the productions of nature as our
  collections gradually grow richer we see almost all the gaps filled
  up and our lines of demarcation effaced we find ourselves
  compelled to make an arbitrary determination which sometimes leads
  us to seize upon the slightest differences between varieties to form
  of them the character of that which we call species and sometimes
  one person designates as a variety of such a species individuals a
  little different which others regard as constituting a particular
  species
  i repeat the richer our collections become the more numerous are
  the proofs that all is more or less shaded nuanc that the
  remarkable differences become obliterated and that the more often
  nature leaves it at our disposal to establish distinctions only
  minute and in some degree trivial peculiarities
  but some genera among animals and plants are of such an extent
  from the number of species they contain that the study and the
  determination of these species are now almost impossible the
  species of these genera arranged in series and placed together
  according to their natural relations present with those allied to
  them differences so slight that they shade into each other and
  because these species are in some degree confounded with one another
  they leave almost no means of determining by expression in words
  the small differences which distinguish them
  there are also those who have been for a long time and strongly
  occupied with the determination of the species and who have
  consulted rich collections who can understand up to what point
  species among living bodies merge one into another fondent les
  unes dans les autres and who have been able to convince
  themselves in the regions parties where we see isolated
  species that this is only because there are wanting other species
  which are more nearly related and which we have not yet collected
  i do not mean to say by this that the existing animals form a very
  simple series one everywhere equally graduated but i say that they
  form a branching series irregularly graduated and which has no
  discontinuity in its parts or which at best has not always had if
  it is true that it is to be found anywhere sil est vrai quil
  sen trouve quelque part it results from this that the species
  which terminates each branch of the general series holds a place at
  least on one side apart from the other allied species which
  intergrade with them behold this state of things so well known
  which i am now compelled to demonstrate
  i have no need besoin of any hypothesis or any supposition for
  this i call to witness all observing naturalists
  not only many genera but entire orders and some classes even
  already present us with portions almost complete of the state of
  things which i have just indicated
  however when in this case we have arranged the species in series
  and they are all well placed according to their natural relations
  if you select one of them and it results in making a leap saut
  pardessus over to several others you take another one of them a
  little less remote these two species placed in comparison will
  then present the greatest differences from each other it is thus
  that we had begun to regard most of the productions of nature which
  occur at our door then the generic and specific distinctions were
  very easy to establish but now that our collections are very much
  richer if you follow the series that i have cited above from the
  species that you first chose up to that which you took in the second
  place and which is very different from the first you have passed
  from shade to shade without having remarked any differences worth
  noticing
  i ask what experienced zologist or botanist is there who has not
  thoroughly realized that which i have just explained to you
  or how can one study or how can one be able to determine in a
  thorough way the species among the multitude of known polyps of all
  orders of radiates worms and especially of insects where the
  simple genera of papilio phalna noctua tinea musca ichneumon
  curculio capricorn scarabus cetonia etc etc already contain
  so many closely allied species which shade into each other are
  almost confounded one with another what a host of molluscan shells
  exist in every country and in all seas which elude our means of
  distinction and exhaust our resources in this respect ascend to
  the fishes to the reptiles to the birds even to the mammals and
  you will see except the lacun which are still to be filled
  everywhere shadings which take place between allied species even
  the genera and where after the most industrious study we fail to
  establish good distinctions does not botany which considers the
  other series comprising the plants offer us in its different
  parts a state of things perfectly similar in short what
  difficulties do not arise in the study and in the determination of
  species in the genera lichena fucus carex poa piper euphorbia
  erica hieracium solanum geranium mimosa etc etc
  when these genera were established but a small number of species
  were known and then it was easy to distinguish them but at present
  almost all the gaps between them are filled and our specific
  differences are necessarily minute and very often insufficient
  from this state of things well established we see what are the
  causes which have given rise to them we see whether nature
  possesses the means for this and if observation has been able to
  give us our explanation of it
  a great many facts teach us that gradually as the individuals of
  one of our species change their situation climate mode of life or
  habits they thus receive influences which gradually change the
  consistence and the proportions of their parts their form their
  faculties even their organization so that all of them participate
  eventually in the changes which they have undergone
  in the same climate very different situations and exposures at
  first cause simple variations in the individuals which are found
  exposed there but as time goes on the continual differences of
  situation of individuals of which i have spoken which live and
  successively reproduce in the same circumstances give rise among
  them to differences which are in some degree essential to their
  being in such a way that at the end of many successive generations
  these individuals which originally belonged to another species are
  at the end transformed into a new species distinct from the other
  for example if the seeds of a grass or of every other plant
  natural to a humid field should be transplanted by an accident at
  first to the slope of a neighboring hill where the soil although
  more elevated would yet be quite cool frais so as to allow the
  plant to live and then after having lived there and passed through
  many generations there it should gradually reach the poor and
  almost arid soil of a mountain sideif the plant should thrive and
  live there and perpetuate itself during a series of generations it
  would then be so changed that the botanists who should find it there
  would describe it as a separate species
  the same thing happens to animals which circumstances have forced
  to change their climate manner of living and habits but for these
  the influences of the causes which i have just cited need still more
  time than in the case of plants to produce the notable changes in
  the individuals though in the long run however they always
  succeed in bringing them about
  the idea of defining under the word species a collection of
  similar individuals which perpetuate the same by generation and
  which have existed thus as anciently as nature implies the
  necessity that the individuals of one and the same species cannot
  mix in their acts of generation with the individuals of a
  different species unfortunately observation has proved and still
  proves every day that this consideration has no basis for the
  hybrids very common among plants and the unions which are often
  observed between the individuals of very different species among
  animals have made us perceive that the limits between these
  species supposed to be constant are not so rigid as is supposed
  in truth nothing often results from these singular unions
  especially when they are very incongruous as the individuals which
  result from them are usually sterile but also when the disparities
  are less great it is known that the drawbacks dfauts with
  which it has to do no longer exist however this means alone
  suffices to gradually create the varieties which have afterwards
  arisen from races and which with time constitute that which we
  call species
  to judge whether the idea which is formed of species has any real
  foundation let us return to the considerations which i have already
  stated they are namely
  1 that all the organic bodies of our globe are veritable
  productions of nature which she has created in succession at the
  end of much time
  2 that in her course nature has begun and begins anew every day
  by forming the simplest organic bodies and that she directly forms
  only thesethat is to say only these first primitive germs
  bauches of organization which have been badly characterized by
  the expression of spontaneous generations quon a dsignes
  malpropos par lexpression de gnrations spontanes
  3 that the first germs bauches of the animals and plants were
  formed in favorable places and circumstances the functions of life
  beginning and an organic movement established these have
  necessarily gradually developed the organs so that after a time and
  under suitable circumstances they have been differentiated as also
  the different parts elles les ont diversifis ainsi qui les
  parties
  4 that the power of increase in each portion of organic bodies
  being inherited at the first production effets of life it has
  given rise to different modes of multiplication and of regeneration
  of individuals and in that way the progress acquired in the
  composition of the organization and in the forms and the diversity
  of the parts has been preserved
  5 that with the aid of sufficient time of circumstances which
  have been necessarily favorable of changes that all parts of the
  surface of the globe have successively undergone in their
  conditionin a word with the power that new situations and new
  habits have in modifying the organs of bodies endowed with lifeall
  those which now exist have been imperceptibly formed such as we see
  them
  6 finally that according to a similar order of things living
  beings having undergone each of the more or less great changes in
  the condition of their organization and of their parts that which
  is designated as a species among them has been insensibly and
  successively so formed can have only a relative constancy in its
  condition and cannot be as ancient as nature
  but it will be said when it is necessary to suppose that with
  the aid of much time and of an infinite variation in circumstances
  nature has gradually formed the different animals that we know
  would we not be stopped in this supposition by the sole
  consideration of the admirable diversity which we observe in the
  instinct of different animals and by that of the marvels of all
  sorts which their different kinds of industry present
  will one dare to carry the spirit of system porter lesprit de
  systme to the point of saying that it is nature and she alone
  which creates this astonishing diversity of means of ruses of
  skill of precautions of patience of which the industry of animals
  offers us so many examples what we observe in this respect in the
  class of insects alone is it not a thousand times more than is
  necessary to compel us to perceive that the limits of the power of
  nature by no means permit her herself to produce so many marvels
  and to force the most obstinate philosophy to recognize that here
  the will of the supreme author of all things has been necessary and
  has alone sufficed to cause the existence of so many admirable
  things
  without doubt one would be rash or rather wholly unreasonable to
  pretend to assign limits to the power of the first author of all
  things and by that alone no one can dare to say that this infinite
  power has not been able to will that which nature herself shows us
  she has willed
  this being so if i discover that nature herself brings about or
  causes all the wonders just cited that she creates the
  organization the life even feeling that she multiplies and
  diversifies within limits which are not known to us the organs and
  faculties of organic bodies the existence of which she sustains or
  propagates that she has created in animals by the single way of
  need which establishes and directs the habits the source of all
  actions from the most simple up to those which constitute
  instinct industry finally reason should i not recognize in this
  power of naturethat is to say of existing thingsthe execution
  of the will of its sublime author who has been able to will that it
  should have this power shall i any the less wonder at the
  omnipotence of the power of the first cause of all things if it has
  pleased itself that things should be thus than if by so many
  separate acts of his omnipotent will he should be occupied and
  occupy himself still continually with details of all the special
  creations all the variations and all the developments and
  perfections all the destructions and all the renewalsin a word
  with all the changes which are in general produced in things which
  exist
  but i intend to prove in my biologie that nature possesses in her
  faculties all that is necessary to have to be able herself to
  produce that which we admire in her works and regarding this
  subject i shall then enter into sufficient details which i am here
  obliged to omit173
  however it is still objected that all we see stated regarding the
  state of living bodies are unalterable conditions in the
  preservation of their form and it is thought that all the animals
  whom history has transmitted to us for two or three thousand years
  have always remained the same and have lost nothing nor acquired
  anything in the perfecting of their organs and in the form of their
  parts
  while this apparent stability has for a long time been accepted as
  true it has just been attempted to establish special proofs in a
  report on the collections of natural history brought from egypt by
  the citizen geoffroy
quotes three paragraphs in which the reporters cuvier and geoffroy
st hilaire say that the mummied animals of thebes and memphis are
perfectly similar to those of today then he goes on to say
  i have seen them these animals and i believe in the conformity of
  their resemblance with the individuals of the same species which
  live today thus the animals which the egyptians worshipped and
  embalmed two or three thousand years ago are still in every respect
  similar to those which actually live in that country
  but it would be assuredly very singular that this should be
  otherwise for the position of egypt and its climate are still or
  very nearly the same as at former times therefore the animals which
  live there have not been compelled to change their habits
  there is then nothing in the observation which has just been
  reported which should be contrary to the considerations which i
  have expressed on this subject and which especially proves that the
  animals of which it treats have existed during the whole period of
  nature it only proves that they have existed for two or three
  thousand years and every one who is accustomed to reflect and at
  the same time to observe that which nature shows us of the monuments
  of its antiquity readily appreciates the value of a duration of two
  or three thousand years in comparison with it
  hence as i have elsewhere said it is sure that this appearance of
  the stability of things in nature will always be mistaken by the
  average of mankind for the reality because in general people only
  judge of everything relatively to themselves
  for the man who observes and who in this respect only judges from
  the changes which he himself perceives the intervals of these
  changes are stationary conditions tats which should appear to
  be limitless because of the brevity of life of the individuals of
  his species thus as the records of his observations and the notes
  of facts which he has consigned to his registers only extend and
  mount up to several thousands of years three to five thousand
  years which is an infinitely small period of time relatively to
  those which have sufficed to bring about the great changes which the
  surface of the globe has undergone everything seems stable to him
  in the planet which he inhabits and he is inclined to reject the
  monuments heaped up around him or buried in the earth which he
  treads under his feet and which surrounds him on all sides174
                                   
  it seems to me as mistaken as to expect some small creatures
  which only live a year which inhabit some corner of a building
  and which we may suppose are occupied with consulting among
  themselves as to the tradition to pronounce on the duration of the
  edifice where they occur and that going back in their paltry
  history to the twentyfifth generation they should unanimously
  decide that the building which serves to shelter them is eternal or
  at least that it has always existed because it has always appeared
  the same to them and since they have never heard it said that it
  had a beginning great things grandeurs in extent and in
  duration are relative175
  when man wishes to clearly represent this truth he will be reserved
  in his decisions in regard to stability which he attributes in
  nature to the state of things which he observes there176
  to admit the insensible change of species and the modifications
  which individuals undergo as they are gradually forced to vary their
  habits or to contract new ones we are not reduced to the unique
  consideration of too small spaces of time which our observations can
  embrace to permit us to perceive these changes for besides this
  induction a quantity of facts collected for many years throws
  sufficient light on the question that i examine so that does not
  remain undecided and i can say now that our sciences of observation
  are too advanced not to have the solution sought for made evident
  indeed besides what we know of the influences and the results of
  heteroclite fecundations we know positively today that a forced
  and longsustained change both in the habits and mode of life of
  animals and in the situation soil and climate of plants brings
  about after a sufficient time has elapsed a very remarkable change
  in the individuals which are exposed to them
  the animal which lives a free wandering life on plains where it
  habitually exercises itself in running swiftly the birds whose
  needs besoins require them unceasingly to traverse great spaces
  in the air finding themselves enclosed some in the compartments of
  our menageries or in our stables and others in our cages or in our
  poultry yards are submitted there in time to striking influences
  especially after a series of regenerations under the conditions
  which have made them contract new habits the first loses in large
  part its nimbleness its agility its body becomes stouter its
  limbs diminish in power and suppleness and its faculties are no
  longer the same the second become clumsy they are unable to fly
  and grow more fleshy in all parts of their bodies
  behold in our stout and clumsy horses habituated to draw heavy
  loads and which constitute a special race by always being kept
  togetherbehold i say the difference in their form compared with
  those of english horses which are all slender with long necks
  because for a long period they have been trained to run swiftly
  behold in them the influence of a difference of habit and judge for
  yourselves you find them then such as they are in some degree in
  nature you find there our cock and our hen in the condition we have
  made them as also the mixed races that we have formed by mixed
  breeding between the varieties produced in different countries or
  where they were so in the state of domesticity you find there
  likewise our different races of domestic pigeons our different
  dogs etc what are our cultivated fruits our wheat our cabbage
  our lettuce etc etc if they are not the result of changes which
  we ourselves have effected in these plants in changing by our
  culture the conditions of their situation are they now found in
  this condition in nature to these incontestable facts add the
  considerations which i have discussed in my recherches sur les
  corps vivans p 56 et suiv and decide for yourselves
  thus among living bodies nature as i have already said offers
  only in an absolute way individuals which succeed each other
  genetically and which descend one from the other so the species
  among them are only relative and only temporary
  nevertheless to facilitate the study and the knowledge of so many
  different bodies it is useful to give the name of species to the
  entire collection of individuals which are alike which reproduction
  perpetuates in the same condition as long as the conditions of their
  situation do not change enough to make their habits their
  character and their form vary
  such is citizens the exact sketch of that which goes on in nature
  since she has existed and of that which the observation of her acts
  has alone enabled us to discover i have fulfilled my object if in
  presenting to you the results of my researches and of my experience
  i have been able to disclose to you that which in your studies of
  this kind deserves your special attention
  you now doubtless conceive how important are the considerations
  which i have just exposed to you and how wrong you would be if in
  devoting yourself to the study of animals or of plants you should
  seek to see among them only the multiplied distinctions that we have
  been obliged to establish in a word if you should confine
  yourselves to fixing in your memory the variable and indefinite
  nomenclature which is applied to so many different bodies instead
  of studying nature herselfher course her means and the constant
  results that she knows how to attain
on the next fly page are the following words esquisse dune
philosophie zoologique
iv lamarcks views as published in 1806177
  those who have observed much and have consulted the great
  collections have been able to convince themselves that as gradually
  as the circumstances of their habitat of exposure to their
  surroundings of climate food mode of living etc have changed
  the characters of size form of proportion between the parts of
  color of consistence of duration of agility and of industry have
  proportionately changed
  they have been able to see as regards the animals that the more
  frequent and longer sustained use of any organ gradually strengthens
  this organ develops it enlarges it and gives it a power
  proportional to the length of time it has been used while the
  constant lack of use of such an organ insensibly weakens it causes
  it to deteriorate progressively diminishes its faculties and tends
  to make it waste away178
  finally it has been remarked that all that nature has made
  individuals to acquire or lose by the sustained influence of
  circumstances where their race has existed for a long time she has
  preserved by heredity in the new individuals which have originated
  from them elle le conserve par la gnration aux nouveaux
  individus qui en proviennent these verities are firmly grounded
  and can only be misunderstood by those who have never observed and
  followed nature in her operations
  thus we are assured that that which is taken for species among
  living bodies and that all the specific differences which
  distinguish these natural productions have no absolute stability
  but that they enjoy only a relative stability which it is very
  important to consider in order to fix the limits which we must
  establish in the determination of that which we must call species
  it is known that different places change in nature and character by
  reason of their position their composition we should say
  geological structure or features and their climate that which is
  easily perceived in passing over different places distinguished by
  special characteristics behold already a cause of variation for the
  natural productions which inhabit these different places but that
  which is not sufficiently known and even that which people refuse to
  believe is that each place itself changes after a time in exposure
  in climate in nature and in character although with a slowness so
  great in relation to our period of time that we attribute to it a
  perfect stability
  now in either case these changed places proportionately change
  the circumstances relative to the living bodies which inhabit them
  and these produce again other influences on those same bodies
  we see from this that if there are extremes in these changes there
  are also gradations nuances that is to say steps which are
  intermediate and which fill up the interval consequently there are
  also gradations in the differences which distinguish that which we
  call species
  indeed as we constantly meet with such shades or intermediate
  steps between these socalled species we find ourselves forced
  to descend to the minutest details to find any distinctions the
  slightest peculiarities of form of color of size and often even
  of differences only perceived in the aspect of the individual
  compared with other individuals which are related to it the more by
  their relations are seized upon by naturalists to establish
  specific differences so that the slightest varieties being
  reckoned as species our catalogues of species grow infinitely
  great and the name of the productions of nature of the most
  interest to us are so to speak buried in these enormous lists
  become very difficult to find because now the objects are mostly
  only determined by characters which our senses can scarcely enable
  us to perceive
  meanwhile we should remember that nothing of all this exists in
  nature that she knows neither classes orders genera nor species
  in spite of all the foundation which the portion of the natural
  series which our collection contains has seemed to afford them and
  that of organic or living bodies there are in reality only
  individuals and among different races which gradually pass
  nuancent into all degrees of organization p 14
on p 70 he speaks of the animal chain from monad to man ascending from
the most simple to the most complex the monad is the most simple the
most like a germ of living bodies and from its nature passes to the
volvoces proteus vibrios from them nature arrives at the production
of polypes rotifresand then at radiaires worms arachnida
crustacea and cirrhipedes

chapter xvii
the philosophie zoologique
lamarcks mature views on the theory of descent comprise a portion of
his celebrated philosophie zoologique we will let him tell the story
of creation by natural causes so far as possible in his own words
in the avertissement or preface he says that his experience has led
him to realize that a body of precepts and of principles relating to the
study of animals and even applicable to other parts of the natural
sciences would now be useful our knowledge of zological facts having
for about thirty years made considerable progress
after referring to the differences in structure and faculties
characterizing animals of different groups he proceeds to outline his
theory and begins by asking
  how indeed can i consider the singular modification in the
  structure of animals as we glance over the series from the most
  perfect to the least perfect without asking how we can account for
  a fact so positive and so remarkablea fact attested to me by so
  many proofs should i not think that nature has successively
  produced the different living beings by proceeding from the most
  simple to the most compound because in ascending the animal scale
  from the most imperfect up to the most perfect the organization
  perfects itself and becomes gradually complicated in a most
  remarkable way
this leads him to consider what is life and he remarks p xv that it
does not exist without external stimuli the conditions necessary for
the existence of life are found completely developed in the simplest
organization we are then led to inquire how this organization by
reason of certain changes can give rise to other organisms less simple
and finally originate creatures becoming gradually more complicated as
we see in ascending the animal scale then employing the two following
considerations he believes he perceives the solution of the problem
which has occupied his thoughts
he then cites as factors 1 use and disuse 2 the movement of
internal fluids by which passages are opened through the cellular tissue
in which they move and finally create different organs hence the
movement of fluids in the interior of animals and the influence of
new circumstances as animals gradually expose themselves to them in
spreading into every inhabitable place are the two general causes which
have produced the different animals in the condition we now see them
meanwhile he perceived the importance of the preservation by heredity
though he nowhere uses that word in the new individuals reproduced of
everything which the results of the life and influencing circumstances
had caused to be acquired in the organization of those which have
transmitted existence to them
in the discours prliminaire referring to the progression in
organization of animals from the simplest to man as also to the
successive acquisition of different special organs and consequently of
as many faculties as new organs obtained he remarks
  then we can perceive how needs besoins at the outset reduced
  to nullity and of which the number gradually increases have
  produced the inclination penchant to actions fitted to satisfy
  it how the actions becoming habitual and energetic have caused
  the development of the organs which execute them how the force
  which excites the organic movements may in the simplest animals be
  outside of them and yet animate them how then this force has been
  transported and fixed in the animal itself finally how it then has
  become the source of sensibility and in the end that of acts of
  intelligence
  i shall add that if this method had been followed then sensation
  would not have been regarded as the general and immediate cause of
  organic movements and it would not have been said that life is a
  series of movements which are executed in virtue of sensations
  received by different organs or in other words that all the vital
  movements are the product of impressions received by the sensitive
  parts179
  this cause seems up to a certain point established as regards the
  most perfect animals but had it been so relatively to all living
  beings they should all be endowed with the power of sensation but
  it cannot be proved that this is the case with plants and it cannot
  likewise be proved that it is so with all the animals known
  but nature in creating her organisms has not begun by suddenly
  establishing a faculty so eminent as that of sensation she has had
  the means of producing this faculty in the imperfect animals of the
  first classes of the animal kingdom referring to the protozoa but
  she has accomplished this gradually and successively nature has
  progressively created the different special organs also the
  faculties which animals enjoy
he remarks that though it is indispensable to classify living forms yet
that our classifications are all artificial that species genera
families orders and classes do not exist in natureonly the
individuals really exist in the third chapter he gives the old
definition of species that they are fixed and immutable and then
speaks of the animal series saying
  i do not mean by this to say that the existing animals form a very
  simple series and especially evenly graduated but i claim that
  they form a branched series180 irregularly graduated and which
  has no discontinuity in its parts or which at least has not
  always had if it is true that owing to the extinction of some
  species there are some breaks it follows that the species which
  terminates each branch of the general series is connected at least
  on one side with other species which intergrade with it p 59
he then points out the difficulty of determining what are species in
certain large genera such as papilio ichneumon etc how new species
arise is shown by observation
  a number of facts teaches us that in proportion as the individuals
  of one of our species are subjected to changes in situation
  climate mode of life or habits they thereby receive influences
  which gradually change the consistence and the proportions of their
  parts their form their faculties even their structure so that it
  follows that all of them after a time participate in the changes to
  which they have been subjected
  in the same climate very different situations and exposures cause
  simple variations in the individuals occurring there but after the
  lapse of time the continual differences of situation of the
  individuals of which i speak which live and successively reproduce
  under the same circumstances produce differences in them which
  become in some degree essential to their existence so that at the
  end of many successive generations these individuals which
  originally belonged to another species became finally transformed
  into a new species distinct from the other
  for example should the seeds of a grass or of any other plant
  natural to a moist field be carried by any means at first to the
  slope of a neighboring hill where the soil although more elevated
  will yet be sufficiently moist to allow the plant to live there and
  if it results after having lived there and having passed through
  several generations that it gradually reaches the dry and almost
  arid soil of a mountain side if the plant succeeds in living there
  and perpetuates itself there during a series of generations it will
  then be so changed that any botanists who should find it there would
  make a distinct species of it
  the same thing happens in the case of animals which circumstances
  have forced to change in climate mode of life and habits but in
  their case the influences of the causes which i have just cited need
  still more time than the plants to bring about notable changes in
  the individuals
  the idea of embracing under the name of species a collection of
  like individuals which are perpetuated by generation and which have
  remained the same as long as nature has endured implies the
  necessity that the individuals of one and the same species should
  not cross with individuals of a different species
  unfortunately observation has proved and still proves every day
  that this consideration is unfounded for hybrids very common among
  plants and the pairings which we often observe between the
  individuals of very different species of animals have led us to
  see that the limits between these supposed constant species are not
  so fixed as has been imagined
  in truth nothing often results from these singular unions
  especially if they are very illassorted and then the individuals
  which do result from them are usually infertile but also when the
  disparities are less great we know that the default in question
  does not occur
  but this cause only suffices to create step by step varieties
  which finally become races and which with time constitute what we
  call species
  to decide whether the idea which is formed of the species has any
  real foundation let us return to the considerations which i have
  already explained they lead us to see
  1 that all the organized bodies of our globe are true productions
  of nature which she has successively formed after the lapse of much
  time
  2 that in her course nature has begun and begins over again
  every day to form the simplest organisms and that she directly
  creates only those namely which are the first germs bauches
  of organization which are designated by the expression of
  spontaneous generations
  3 that the first germs of the animal and plant having been formed
  in appropriate places and circumstances the faculties of a
  beginning life and of an organic movement established have
  necessarily gradually developed the organs and that with time they
  have diversified them as also the parts
  4 that the power of growth in each part of the organized body
  being inherent in the first created forms of life it has given rise
  to different modes of multiplication and of regeneration of
  individuals and that consequently the progress acquired in the
  composition of the organization and in the shape and diversity of
  the parts has been preserved
  5 that with the aid of sufficient time of circumstances which
  have been necessarily favorable of changes of condition that every
  part of the earths surface has successively undergonein a word
  by the power which new situations and new habits have of modifying
  the organs of living beings all those which now exist have been
  gradually formed such as we now see them
  6 finally that according to a similar order of things living
  beings having undergone each of the more or less great changes in
  the condition of their structure and parts that which we call a
  species among them has been gradually and successively so formed
  having only a relative constancy in its condition and not being as
  old as nature herself
  but it will be said when it is supposed that by the aid of much
  time and of an infinite variation in circumstances nature has
  gradually formed the different animals known to us shall we not be
  stopped in this supposition by the simple consideration of the
  admirable diversity which we observe in the instincts of different
  animals and by that of the marvels of every kind presented by their
  different kinds of industry
  shall we dare to extend the spirit of system so far as to say that
  it is nature who has herself alone created this astonishing
  diversity of means of contrivances of skill of precautions of
  patience of which the industry of animals offers us so many
  examples what we observe in this respect in the simple class of
  insects is it not a thousand times more than sufficient to make
  us realize that the limit to the power of nature in nowise permits
  her to herself produce so many marvels but to force the most
  obstinate philosopher to recognize that here the will of the supreme
  author of all things has been necessary and has alone sufficed to
  create so many admirable things
  without doubt one would be rash or rather wholly insensate to
  pretend to assign limits to the power of the first author of all
  things but aside from that no one could dare to say that this
  infinite power could not will that which nature even shows us it has
  willed181 p 67
referring to the alleged proof of the fixity of species brought forward
by cuvier in the annales du musum dhistoire naturelle i pp 235
and 236 that the mummied birds crocodiles and other animals of egypt
present no differences from those now living lamarck says
  it would assuredly be very singular if it were otherwise because
  the position of egypt and its climate are still almost exactly what
  they were at that epoch moreover the birds which live there still
  exist under the same circumstances as they were then not having
  been obliged to change their habits
  moreover who does not perceive that birds which can so easily
  change their situation and seek places which suit them are less
  subject than many other animals to the variations of local
  circumstances and hence less restricted in their habits
he adds the fact that the animals in question have inhabited egypt for
two or three thousand years and not necessarily from all time and that
this is not time enough for marked changes he then gives the following
definition of species which is the best ever offered species then
have only a relative stability and are invariable only temporarily
  yet to facilitate the study and knowledge of so many different
  organisms it is useful to give the name of species to every
  similar collection of similar individuals which are perpetuated by
  heredity gnration in the same condition so long as the
  circumstances of their situation do not change enough to render
  variable their habits character and form
he then discusses fossil species in the way already described in
chapter iii p 75
the subject of the checks upon overpopulation by the smaller and weaker
animals or the struggle for existence is thus discussed in
chapter iv
  owing to the extreme multiplication of the small species and
  especially of the most imperfect animals the multiplicity of
  individuals might be prejudicial to the preservation of the species
  to that of the progress acquired in the improvement of the
  organizationin a word to the general order if nature had not
  taken precautions to keep this multiplication within due limits over
  which she would never pass
  animals devour one another except those which live only on plants
  but the latter are exposed to being devoured by the carnivorous
  animals
  we know that it is the strongest and the best armed which devour
  the weaker and that the larger kinds devour the smaller
  nevertheless the individuals of a single species rarely devour each
  other they war upon other races182
  the multiplication of the small species of animals is so
  considerable and the renewals of their generations are so prompt
  that these small species would render the earth uninhabitable to the
  others if nature had not set a limit to their prodigious
  multiplication but since they serve as prey for a multitude of
  other animals as the length of their life is very limited and as
  the lowering of the temperature kills them their numbers are always
  maintained in proper proportions for the preservation of their races
  and that of others
  as to the larger and stronger animals they would be too dominant
  and injure the preservation of other races if they should multiply
  in too great proportions but their races devouring each other they
  would only multiply slowly and in a small number at a time this
  would maintain in this respect the kind of equilibrium which should
  exist
  finally only man considered separately from all which is
  characteristic of him seems capable of multiplying indefinitely
  because his intelligence and his resources secure him from seeing
  his increase arrested by the voracity of any animals he exercises
  over them such a supremacy that instead of fearing the larger and
  stronger races of animals he is thus rather capable of destroying
  them and he continually checks their increase
  but nature has given him numerous passions which unfortunately
  developing with his intelligence thus place a great obstacle to
  the extreme multiplication of the individuals of his species
  indeed it seems as if man had taken it upon himself unceasingly to
  reduce the number of his fellowcreatures for never i do not
  hesitate to say will the earth be covered with the population that
  it could maintain several of its habitable parts would always be
  alternately very sparsely populated although the time for these
  alternate changes would be to us measureless
  thus by these wise precautions everything is preserved in the
  established order the changes and perpetual renewals which are
  observable in this order are maintained within limits over which
  they cannot pass the races of living beings all subsist in spite of
  their variations the progress acquired in the improvement of the
  organization is not lost everything which appears to be disordered
  overturned anomalous renters unceasingly into the general order
  and even coperates with it and especially and always the will of
  the sublime author of nature and of all existing things is
  invariably executed pp 98101
in the sixth chapter the author treats of the degradation and
simplification of the structure from one end to the other of the animal
series proceeding as he says inversely to the general order of
nature from the compound to the more simple why he thus works out this
idea of a general degradation is not very apparent since it is out of
tune with his views so often elsewhere expressed of a progressive
evolution from the simple to the complex and to his own classification
of the animal kingdom beginning as it does with the simplest forms and
ending with man perhaps however he temporarily adopts the prevailing
method of beginning with the highest forms in order to bring out
clearly the successive steps in inferiority or degradation presented in
descending the animal scale
we will glean some passages of this chapter which bear on his theory of
descent speaking of the different kinds of aquatic surroundings he
remarks
  in the first place it should be observed that in the waters
  themselves she nature presents considerably diversified
  circumstances the fresh waters marine waters calm or stagnant
  waters running waters or streams the waters of warm climates
  those of cold regions finally those which are shallow and those
  which are very deep offer many special circumstances each of which
  acts differently on the animals living in them now in a degree
  equal to the makeup of the organization the races of animals which
  are exposed to either of these circumstances have been submitted to
  special influences and have been diversified by them
he then after referring to the general degradation of the batrachians
touches upon the atrophy of legs which has taken place in the snakes
  if we should consider as a result of degradation the loss of legs
  seen in the snakes the ophidia should be regarded as constituting
  the lowest order of reptiles but it would be an error to admit this
  consideration indeed the serpents being animals which in order to
  hide themselves have adopted the habit of gliding directly along
  the ground their body has lengthened very considerably and
  disproportionately to its thickness now elongated legs proving
  disadvantageous to their necessity of gliding and hiding very short
  legs being only four in number since they are vertebrate animals
  would be incapable of moving their bodies thus the habits of these
  animals have been the cause of the disappearance of their legs and
  yet the batrachians which have them offer a more degraded
  organization and are nearer the fishes p 155
referring on the next page to the fishes he remarks
  without doubt their general form their lack of a constriction
  between the head and the body to form a neck and the different fins
  which support them in place of legs are the results of the
  influence of the dense medium which they inhabit and not that of
  the dgradation of their organization but this modification
  dgradation is not less real and very great as we can convince
  ourselves by examining their internal organs it is such as to
  compel us to assign to the fishes a rank lower than that of the
  reptiles
he then states that the series from the lamprey and fishes to the
mammals is not a regularly gradated one and accounts for this because
the work of nature has been often changed hindered and diverted in
direction by the influences which singularly different even contrasted
circumstances have exercised on the animals which are there found
exposed in the course of a long series of their renewed generations
lamarck thus accounts for the production of the radial symmetry of the
medus and echinoderms his radiaires at the present day this
symmetry is attributed perhaps more correctly to their more or less
fixed mode of life
  it is without doubt by the result of this means which nature
  employs at first with a feeble energy with polyps and then with
  greater developments in the radiata that the radial form has been
  acquired because the subtile ambient fluids penetrating by the
  alimentary canal and being expansive have been able by an
  incessantly renewed repulsion from the centre towards every point of
  the circumference to give rise to this radiated arrangement of
  parts
  it is by this cause that in the radiata the intestinal canal
  although still very imperfect since more often it has only a single
  opening is yet complicated with numerous radiating vasculiform
  often ramified appendages
  it is doubtless also by this cause that in the soft radiates as
  the medus etc we observe a constant isochronic movement
  movement very probably resulting from the successive intermissions
  between the masses of subtile fluids which penetrate into the
  interior of these animals and those of the same fluids which escape
  from it often being spread throughout all their parts
  we cannot say that the isochronic movements of the soft radiates
  are the result of their respiration for below the vertebrate
  animals nature does not offer in that of any animal these
  alternate and measured movements of inspiration and expiration
  whatever may be the respiration of radiates it is extremely slow
  and is executed without perceptible movements p 200
the influence of circumstances on the actions and habits of animals
it is in chapter vii that the views of lamarck are more fully presented
than elsewhere and we therefore translate all of it as literally as
possible so as to preserve the exact sense of the author
  we do not here have to do with a line of argument but with the
  examination of a positive fact which is more general than is
  supposed and which has not received the attention it deserves
  doubtless because very often it is quite difficult to discover
  this fact consists in the influence which circumstances exert on the
  different organisms subjected to them
  in truth for a long time there has been noticed the influence of
  different states of our organization on our character our
  propensities penchants our actions and even our ideas but it
  seems to me that no one has yet recognized that of our actions and
  of our habits on our organization itself now as these actions and
  these habits entirely depend on the circumstances in which we
  habitually find ourselves i shall try to show how great is the
  influence which these circumstances exercise on the general form on
  the condition of the parts and even on the organization of living
  bodies it is therefore this very positive fact which is to be the
  subject of this chapter
  if we have not had numerous occasions to plainly recognize the
  effects of this influence on certain organisms which we have
  transported under entirely new and different circumstances and if
  we had not seen these effects and the changes resulting from them
  produced in a way under our very eyes the important fact in
  question would have always remained unknown
  the influence of circumstances is really continuously and
  everywhere active on living beings but what renders it difficult
  for us to appreciate this influence is that its effects only become
  sensible or recognizable especially in the animals at the end of a
  long period
  before stating and examining the proofs of this fact which
  deserves our attention and which is very important for a zological
  philosophy let us resume the thread of the considerations we had
  begun to discuss
  in the preceding paragraph we have seen that it is now an
  incontrovertible fact that in considering the animal scale in a
  sense the inverse of that of nature we find that there exists in
  the groups composing this scale a continuous but irregular
  modification dgradation in the organization of animals which
  they comprise an increasing simplification in the organization of
  these organisms finally a proportionate diminution in the number
  of faculties of these beings
  this fact once recognized may throw the greatest light on the very
  order which nature has followed in the production of all the
  existing animals but it does not show why the structure of animals
  in its increasing complexity from the more imperfect up to the most
  perfect offers only an irregular gradation whose extent presents a
  number of anomalies or digressions which have no appearance of order
  in their diversity
  now in seeking for the reason of this singular irregularity in the
  increasing complexity of organization of animals if we should
  consider the outcome of the influences that the infinitely
  diversified circumstances in all parts of the globe exercise on the
  general form the parts and the very organization of these animals
  everything will be clearly explained
  it will indeed be evident that the condition in which we find all
  animals is on one side the result of the increasing complexity of
  the organization which tends to form a regular gradation and on
  the other that it is that of the influences of a multitude of very
  different circumstances which continually tend to destroy the
  regularity in the gradations of the increasing complexity of the
  organization
  here it becomes necessary for me to explain the meaning i attach to
  the expression circumstances influencing the form and structure of
  animalsnamely that in becoming very different they change with
  time both their form and organization by proportionate
  modifications
  assuredly if these expressions should be taken literally i should
  be accused of an error for whatever may be the circumstances they
  do not directly cause any modification in the form and structure of
  animals
  but the great changes in the circumstances bring about in animals
  great changes in their needs and such changes in their needs
  necessarily cause changes in their actions now if the new needs
  become constant or very permanent the animals then assume new
  habits which are as durable as the needs which gave origin to
  them we see that this is easily demonstrated and even does not need
  any explanation to make it clearer
  it is then evident that a great change in circumstances having
  become constant in a race of animals leads these animals into new
  habits
  now if new circumstances having become permanent in a race of
  animals have given to these animals new habitsthat is to say
  have led them to perform new actions which have become
  habitualthere will from this result the use of such a part by
  preference to that of another and in certain cases the total lack
  of use of any part which has become useless
  nothing of all this should be considered as a hypothesis or as a
  mere peculiar opinion they are on the contrary truths which
  require in order to be made evident only attention to and the
  observation of facts
  we shall see presently by the citation of known facts which prove
  it on one side that the new wants having rendered such a part
  necessary have really by the result of efforts given origin to this
  part and that as the result of its sustained use it has gradually
  strengthened it developed and has ended in considerably increasing
  its size on the other side we shall see that in certain cases the
  new circumstances and new wants having rendered such a part wholly
  useless the total lack of use of this part has led to the result
  that it has gradually ceased to receive the development which the
  other parts of the animal obtain that it gradually becomes
  emaciated and thin and that finally when this lack of use has been
  total during a long time the part in question ends in disappearing
  all this is a positive fact i propose to give the most convincing
  proofs
  in the plants where there are no movements and consequently no
  habits properly so called great changes in circumstances do not
  bring about less great differences in the development of their
  parts so that these differences originate and develop certain of
  them while they reduce and cause several others to disappear but
  here everything operates by the changes occurring in the nutrition
  of the plant in its absorptions and transpirations in the amount
  of heat light air and humidity which it habitually receives
  finally in the superiority that certain of the different vital
  movements may assume over others
  between individuals of the same species some of which are
  constantly well nourished and in circumstances favorable to their
  entire development while the others live under reversed
  circumstances there is brought about a difference in the condition
  of these individuals which gradually becomes very remarkable how
  many examples could i not cite regarding animals and plants which
  would confirm the grounds for this view now if the circumstances
  remain the same rendering habitual and constant the condition of
  individuals badly fed diseased or languishing their internal
  organization becomes finally modified and reproduction between the
  individuals in question preserves the acquired modifications and
  ends in giving rise to a race very distinct from that of the
  individuals which unceasingly meet with circumstances favorable to
  their development
  a very dry springtime is the cause of the grass of a field growing
  very slowly remaining scraggy and puny flowering and fruiting
  without growing much
  a spring interspersed with warm days and rainy days makes the same
  grass grow rapidly and the harvest of hay is then excellent
  but if any cause perpetuates the unfavorable circumstances
  surrounding these plants they vary proportionally at first in
  their appearance and general condition and finally in several
  particulars of their characters
  for example if some seed of any of the grasses referred to should
  be carried into an elevated place on a dry and stony greensward
  much exposed to the winds and should germinate there the plant
  which should be able to live in this place would always be badly
  nourished and the individuals reproduced there continuing to exist
  under these depressing circumstances there would result a race
  truly different from that living in the field though originating
  from it the individuals of this new race would be small scraggy
  and some of their organs having developed more than others would
  then offer special proportions
  those who have observed much and who have consulted the great
  collections have become convinced that in proportion as the
  circumstances of habitat exposure climate food mode of life
  etc come to change the characters of size form proportion
  between the parts color consistence agility and industry in the
  animals change proportionally
  what nature accomplishes after a long time we bring about every
  day by suddenly changing in the case of a living plant the
  circumstances under which it and all the individuals of its species
  exist
  all botanists know that the plants which they transplant from their
  birthplace into gardens for cultivation gradually undergo changes
  which at last render them unrecognizable many plants naturally
  very hairy then become glabrous or almost so many of those which
  were creeping and trailing then become erect others lose their
  spines or their prickles others still from the woody and perennial
  condition which their stem possesses in a warm climate pass in our
  climate into an herbaceous condition and among these several are
  nothing more than annual plants finally the dimensions of their
  parts themselves undergo very considerable changes these effects of
  changes of circumstances are so well known that botanists prefer not
  to describe garden plants at least only those which have been newly
  cultivated
  is not cultivated wheat triticum sativum only a plant brought
  by man into the condition in which we actually see it who can tell
  me in what country such a plant lives in a state of naturethat is
  to say without being there the result of its culture in some
  neighboring region
  where occur in nature our cabbage lettuce etc in the condition
  in which we see them in our kitchengardens is it not the same as
  regards a number of animals which domestication has changed or
  considerably modified
  what very different races among our fowls and domestic pigeons
  which we have obtained by raising them in different circumstances
  and in different countries and how vainly do we now endeavor to
  rediscover them in nature
  those which are the least changed without doubt by a more recent
  process of domestication and because they do not live in a climate
  which is foreign to them do not the less possess in the condition
  of some of their parts great differences produced by the habits
  which we have made them contract thus our ducks and our domestic
  geese trace back their type to the wild ducks and geese but ours
  have lost the power of rising into the high regions of the air and
  of flying over extensive regions finally a decided change has
  been wrought in the state of their parts compared with that of
  animals of the race from which they have descended
  who does not know that such a native bird which we raise in a cage
  and which lives there five or six years in succession and after
  that replaced in naturenamely set freeis then unable to fly
  like its fellows which have always been free the slight change of
  circumstance operating on this individual has only diminished its
  power of flight and doubtless has not produced any change in the
  shape of its parts but if a numerous series of generations of
  individuals of the same race should have been kept in captivity for
  a considerable time there is no doubt but that even the form of the
  parts of these individuals would gradually undergo notable changes
  for a much stronger reason if instead of a simple captivity
  constantly maintained over them this circumstance had been at the
  same time accompanied by a change to a very different climate and
  if these individuals by degrees had been habituated to other kinds
  of food and to other kinds of movements to obtain it certainly
  these circumstances united and becoming constant would insensibly
  form a new and special race
  where do we find in nature this multitude of races of dogs
  which as the result of domesticity to which we have reduced these
  animals have been brought into their present condition where do we
  find these bulldogs greyhounds water spaniels spaniels
  pugdogs etc etc races which present among themselves much
  greater differences than those which we admit to be specific in wild
  animals of the same genus
  without doubt a primitive single race very near the wolf if it
  is not itself the true type has been submitted by man at some
  period to the process of domestication this race which then
  offered no difference between its individuals has been gradually
  dispersed by man into different countries with different climates
  and after a time these same individuals having undergone the
  influences of their habitats and of the different habits they were
  obliged to contract in each country have undergone remarkable
  changes and have formed different special races now the man who
  for commercial reasons or from interests of any other kind travels
  a very great distance having carried into a densely populated
  place as for example a great capital different races of dogs
  originated in some very distant country then the increase of these
  races by heredity gnration has given rise successively to all
  those we now know
  the following fact proves as regards plants how a change in any
  important circumstance leads to a change in the parts of their
  organisms
  so long as ranunculus aquatilis is submerged in the water its
  leaves are all finely incised and the divisions hairlike but when
  the stalks of this plant reach the surface of the water the leaves
  which grow out in the air are wider rounded and simply lobed if
  some feet from the same plant the roots succeed in pushing into a
  soil only damp without being submerged their stalks then are
  short none of their leaves are divided into capillary divisions
  which gives rise to ranunculus hederaceus which the botanists
  regard as a species whenever they meet with it
  there is no doubt that as regards animals important changes in the
  circumstances under which they are accustomed to live do not produce
  alteration in their organs for here the changes are much slower in
  operating than in plants and consequently are to us less marked
  and their cause less recognizable
  as to the circumstances which have so much power in modifying the
  organs of living beings the most influential are doubtless the
  diversity of the surroundings in which they live but besides this
  there are many others which in addition have a considerable
  influence in the production of the effects in question
  it is known that different localities change in nature and quality
  owing to their position their nature and their climate as is
  easily seen in passing over different places distinguished by
  special features hence we see a cause of variation for the animals
  and plants which live in these different places but what we do not
  sufficiently know and even what we generally refuse to believe is
  that each place itself changes with time in exposure in climate in
  nature and quality although with a slowness so great in relation
  to our own continuance that we attribute to it a perfect stability
  now in either case these changed localities proportionally change
  the circumstances relative to the organisms which inhabit them and
  the latter then give rise to other influences bearing on these same
  beings
  we perceive from this that if there are extremes in these changes
  there are also gradationsnamely degrees which are intermediate
  and which fill the interval consequently there are also gradations
  in the differences which distinguish what we call species
  it is then evident that the whole surface of the earth offers in
  the nature and situation of the matters which occupy its different
  points a diversity of circumstances which is throughout in relation
  with that of the forms and parts of animals independent of the
  special diversity which necessarily results from the progress of the
  composition of organization in each animal
  in each locality where animals can live the circumstances which
  establish there an order of things remain for a long time the same
  and really change there only with a slowness so great that man
  cannot directly notice them he is obliged to consult monuments to
  recognize that in each one of these places the order of things that
  he discovers there has not always been the same and to perceive
  that it will change more
  the races of animals which live in each of these places should
  then retain their customary habits there also for a long time
  hence to us seems an apparent constancy of races which we call
  speciesconstancy which has originated among us the idea that
  these races are as ancient as nature
  but in the different points of the earths surface which can be
  inhabited nature and the situation of the places and climates
  constitute there for the animals as for the plants different
  circumstances of all sorts of degrees the animals which inhabit
  these different places should then differ from each other not only
  on account of the state of nature of the organization in each race
  but besides by reason of the habits that the individuals of each
  race there are forced to have so in proportion as he traverses the
  larger parts of the earths surface the observing naturalist sees
  circumstances changing in a manner somewhat noticeable he
  constantly sees that the species change proportionately in their
  characters
  now the true order of things necessary to consider in all this
  consists in recognizing
  1 that every slight change maintained under the circumstances
  where occur each race of animals brings about in them a real change
  in their wants
  2 that every change in the wants of animals necessitates in them
  other movements actions to satisfy the new needs and
  consequently other habits
  3 that every new want necessitating new actions to satisfy it
  demands of the animal which feels it both the more frequent use of
  such of its parts of which before it made less use which develops
  and considerably enlarges them and the use of new parts which
  necessity has caused to insensibly develop in it by the effects of
  its inner feelings which i shall constantly prove by known facts
  thus to arrive at a knowledge of the true causes of so many
  different forms and so many different habits of which the known
  animals offer us examples it is necessary to consider that
  circumstances infinitely diversified but all slowly changing into
  which the animals of each race are successively thrown have caused
  for each of them new wants and necessarily changes in their habits
  moreover this truth which cannot be denied being once recognized
  it will be easy to see how the new needs have been able to be
  satisfied and the new habits formed if any attention be given to
  the two following laws of nature which observation always confirms
  first law
  in every animal which has not exceeded the term of its development
  the more frequent and sustained use of any organ gradually
  strengthens this organ develops and enlarges it and gives it a
  strength proportioned to the length of time of such use while the
  constant lack of use of such an organ imperceptibly weakens it
  causes it to become reduced progressively diminishes its faculties
  and ends in its disappearance
  second law
  everything which nature has caused individuals to acquire or lose
  by the influence of the circumstances to which their race may be for
  a long time exposed and consequently by the influence of the
  predominant use of such an organ or by that of the constant lack of
  use of such part it preserves by heredity gnration and passes
  on to the new individuals which descend from it provided that the
  changes thus acquired are common to both sexes or to those which
  have given origin to these new individuals
  these are the two fundamental truths which can be misunderstood
  only by those who have never observed or followed nature in its
  operations or only by those who allow themselves to fall into the
  error which i have combated
  naturalists having observed that the forms of the parts of animals
  compared with the uses of these parts are always in perfect accord
  have thought that the forms and conditions of parts have caused the
  function but this is a mistake for it is easy to demonstrate by
  observation that it is on the contrary the needs and uses of
  organs which have developed these same parts which have even given
  origin to them where they did not exist and which consequently have
  given rise to the condition in which we observe them in each animal
  if this were not so it would have been necessary for nature to
  have created for the parts of animals as many forms as the diversity
  of circumstances in which they have to live had required and that
  these forms and also the circumstances had never varied
  this is certainly not the existing order of things and if it were
  really such we should not have the racehorses of england we
  should not have our great draft horses so clumsy and so different
  from the first named for nature herself has not produced their
  like we should not for the same reason have terrier dogs with bow
  legs greyhounds so swift in running waterspaniels etc we
  should not have tailless fowls fantail pigeons etc finally we
  could cultivate the wild plants as much as we pleased in the rich
  and fertile soil of our gardens without fearing to see them change
  by long culture
  for a long time we have felt the force of the saying which has
  passed into the wellknown proverbhabits form a second nature
  assuredly if the habits and nature of each animal can never vary
  the proverb is false has no foundation and does not apply to the
  instances which led to its being spoken
  if we should seriously consider all that i have just stated it
  might be thought that i had good reason when in my work entitled
  recherches sur les corps vivans p 50 i established the
  following proposition
  it is not the organsthat is to say the nature and form of the
  parts of the body of an animalwhich have given rise to its habits
  and its special faculties but it is on the contrary its habits
  its manner of life and the circumstances in which are placed the
  individuals from which it originates which have with time brought
  about the form of its body the number and condition of its organs
  finally the faculties which it enjoys
  if we weigh this proposition and if we recall all the observations
  which nature and the state of things continually lead us to do then
  its importance and its solidity will become more evident
  time and favorable circumstances are as i have already said the
  two principal means which nature employs to give existence to all
  her productions we know that time for her has no limits and that
  consequently it is ever at her disposal
  as to the circumstances of which she has need and which she uses
  still daily to cause variations in all that she continues to
  produce we can say that they are in some degree for her
  inexhaustible
  the principal circumstances arise from the influence of climate
  from those of different temperatures of the atmosphere and from all
  the environing media from that of the diversity of different
  localities and their situation from that of habits the ordinary
  movements the most frequent actions finally from that of means of
  preservation of mode of living of defence of reproduction etc
  moreover owing to these diverse influences the faculties increase
  and become stronger by use become differentiated by the new habits
  preserved for long ages and insensibly the organization the
  consistencein a word the nature and condition of parts as also
  of the organsparticipate in the results of all these influences
  become preserved and are propagated by generation
  these truths which are only the results of the two natural laws
  above stated are in every case completely confirmed by facts they
  clearly indicate the course of nature in all the diversity of its
  products
  but instead of contenting ourselves with generalities which might
  be considered as hypothetical let us directly examine the facts
  and consider in the animals the result of the use or disuse of
  their organs on the organs themselves according to the habits that
  each race has been compelled to contract
  i shall now attempt to prove that the constant lack of exercise of
  organs at first diminishes their faculties gradually impoverishes
  them and ends by making them disappear or even causing them to be
  atrophied if this lack of use is perpetuated for a very long time
  through successive generations of animals of the same race
  i shall next prove that on the contrary the habit of exercising
  an organ in every animal which has not attained the limit of the
  diminution of its faculties not only perfects and increases the
  faculties of this organ but besides enables it to acquire
  developments and dimensions which insensibly change it so that with
  time it renders it very different from the same organ in another
  animal which exercises it much less
  the lack of use of an organ become constant by the habits formed
  gradually impoverishes this organ and ends by causing it to
  disappear and even to destroy it
  as such a proposition can only be admitted on proof and not by its
  simple announcement let us prove it by the citation of the leading
  known facts on which it is based
  the vertebrate animals whose plan of organization is in all nearly
  the same although they offer much diversity in their parts have
  jaws armed with teeth moreover those among them which
  circumstances have placed in the habit of swallowing their food
  without previous mastication are exposed to the result that their
  teeth become undeveloped these teeth then either remain concealed
  between the bony edges of the jaws without appearing above or even
  their gums are found to have been atrophied
  in the baleen whales which have been supposed to be completely
  deprived of teeth m geoffroy has found them concealed in the jaws
  of the foetus of this animal this professor has also found in
  the birds the groove where the teeth should be situated but they
  are no longer to be seen there
  in the class even of mammals which comprises the most perfect
  animals and chiefly those in which the vertebrate plan of
  organization is most perfectly carried out not only the baleen has
  no usable teeth but the anteater myrmecophaga is also in the
  same condition whose habit of not masticating its food has been for
  a long time established and preserved in its race
  the presence of eyes in the head is a characteristic of a great
  number of different animals and becomes an essential part of the
  plan of organization of vertebrates
  nevertheless the mole which owing to its habits makes very little
  use of vision has only very small eyes which are scarcely visible
  since they exercise these organs to a very slight extent
  the aspalax of olivier voyage en egypte et en perse ii
  pl 28 f 2 which lives under ground like the mole and which
  probably exposes itself still less than that animal to the light of
  day has totally lost the power of sight also it possesses only
  vestiges of the organ of which it is the seat and yet these
  vestiges are wholly concealed under the skin and other parts which
  cover them and do not permit the least access to the light
  the proteus an aquatic reptile allied to the salamander in its
  structure and which lives in the dark subterranean waters of deep
  caves has like the aspalax only vestiges of the organs of
  sightvestiges which are covered and concealed in the same manner
  we turn to a decisive consideration relative to this question
  light does not penetrate everywhere consequently animals which
  habitually live in situations where it does not penetrate lack the
  occasion of exercising the organs of sight if nature has provided
  them with them moreover the animals which make part of the plan of
  organization in which eyes are necessarily present have
  originally had them however since we find them among those which
  are deprived of the use of this organ and which have only vestiges
  concealed and covered over it should be evident that the
  impoverishment and even the disappearance of these organs are the
  result of a constant lack of exercise
  what proves it is that the organ of hearing is never in this
  condition and that we always find it in the animals when the nature
  of their organization should require its existence the reason is as
  follows
  the cause of sound that which moved by the shock or the
  vibrations of bodies transmits to the organ of hearing the
  impression which it receives penetrates everywhere traverses all
  the media and even the mass of the densest bodies from this it
  results that every animal which makes a part of a plan of
  organization to which hearing is essential has always occasion to
  exercise this organ in whatever situation it lives so among the
  vertebrate animals we see none deprived of their organs of
  hearing but in the groups below them when the same organs are once
  wanting we do not again find them
  it is not so with the organ of sight for we see this organ
  disappear reappear and again disappear in proportion to the
  possibility or impossibility of the animals exercising it
  in the acephalous molluscs the great development of the mantle
  of these molluscs has rendered their eyes and even their head
  entirely useless these organs also forming a part of a plan of
  organization which should comprise them have disappeared and
  atrophied from constant lack of use
  finally it is a part of the plan of organization of reptiles as
  in other vertebrate animals to have four legs appended to their
  skeleton the serpents should consequently have four though they do
  not form the lowest order of reptiles and are not so near the
  fishes as the batrachians the frogs the salamanders etc
  however the serpents having taken up the habit of gliding along
  the ground and of concealing themselves in the grass their body
  owing to continually repeated efforts to elongate itself so as to
  pass through narrow spaces has acquired a considerable length
  disproportionate to its size moreover limbs would have been very
  useless to these animals and consequently would not have been
  employed because long legs would have interfered with their need of
  gliding and very short legs not being more than four in number
  would have been incapable of moving their body hence the lack of
  use of these parts having been constant in the races of these
  animals has caused the total disappearance of these same parts
  although really included in the plan of organization of the animals
  of their class
  many insects which by the natural character of their order and
  even of their genus should have wings lack them more or less
  completely from disuse a quantity of coleoptera orthoptera
  hymenoptera and of hemiptera etc afford examples the habits of
  these animals do not require them to make use of their wings
  but it is not sufficient to give the explanation of the cause which
  has brought about the condition of the organs of different
  animalsa condition which we see to be always the same in those of
  the same species we must besides observe the changes of condition
  produced in the organs of one and the same individual during its
  life by the single result of a great change in the special habits
  in the individuals of its species the following fact which is one
  of the most remarkable will serve to prove the influence of habits
  on the condition of organs and show how changes wrought in the
  habits of an individual produce the condition of the organs which
  are brought into action during the exercise of these habits
  m tenon member of the institute has given an account to the
  class of sciences that having examined the intestinal canal of
  several men who had been hard drinkers all their lives he had
  constantly found it to be shortened to an extraordinary extent
  compared with the same organ in those not given to such a habit
  we know that hard drinkers or those who are addicted to
  drunkenness take very little solid food that they eat very
  lightly and that the beverage which they take in excess frequently
  suffices to nourish them
  moreover as fluid aliments especially spirituous liquors do not
  remain a long time either in the stomach or in the intestines the
  stomach and the remainder of the intestinal canal lose the habit of
  being distended in intemperate persons so also in sedentary persons
  and those engaged in mental labor who are habituated to take but
  little food gradually and at length their stomach becomes
  contracted and their intestines shortened
  we are not concerned here with the shrinkage and shortening
  produced by a puckering of the parts which permit ordinary
  extension if instead of a continued emptiness these viscera should
  be filled the shrinkage and shortening in question are real
  considerable and such that these organs would burst open rather
  than yield suddenly to the causes which would require ordinary
  extension
  in circumstances of persons of the same age compare a man who in
  order to devote himself to habitual study and mental work which
  have rendered his digestion more difficult has contracted the habit
  of eating lightly with another who habitually takes a good deal of
  exercise walks out often and eats heartily the stomach of the
  first will be weakened and a small quantity of food will fill it
  while that of the second will be not only maintained in its ordinary
  health but even strengthened
  we have here the case of an organ much modified in its dimensions
  and in its faculties by the single cause of a change in habits
  during the life of the individual
  the frequent use of an organ become constant by habit increases
  the faculties of this organ even develops it and enables it to
  acquire dimensions and a power of action which it does not possess
  in animals which exercise less
  we have just said that the lack of employment of an organ which
  necessarily exists modifies it impoverishes it and ends by its
  disappearing entirely
  i shall now demonstrate that the continued employment of an organ
  with the efforts made to draw out its powers under circumstances
  where it would be of service strengthens extends and enlarges
  this organ or creates a new one which can exercise the necessary
  functions
  the bird which necessity drives to the water to find there prey
  fitted for its sustenance opens the digits of its feet when it
  wishes to strike the water and propel itself along its surface the
  skin which unites these digits at their base by these acts of
  spreading apart being unceasingly repeated contracts the habit of
  extending so that after a while the broad membranes which connect
  the digits of ducks geese etc are formed as we see them the
  same efforts made in swimmingie in pushing back the water in
  order to advance and to move in this liquidhave likewise extended
  the membrane situated between the digits of the frogs the
  seaturtles the otter beaver etc
  on the contrary the bird whose mode of life habituates it to perch
  on trees and which is born of individuals who have all contracted
  this habit has necessarily the digits of the feet longer and shaped
  in another way than those of the aquatic animals which i have just
  mentioned its claws after a while became elongated pointed and
  curved or hooklike in order to grasp the branches on which the
  animal often rests
  likewise we see that the shore bird which is not inclined to swim
  and which moreover has need of approaching the edge of the water to
  find there its prey is in continual danger of sinking in the mud
  now this bird wishing to act so that its body shall not fall into
  the water makes every effort to extend and elongate its legs it
  results from this that the longcontinued habit that this bird and
  the others of its race contract of extending and continually
  elongating their legs is the cause of the individuals of this
  race being raised as if on stilts having gradually acquired long
  naked legs which are denuded of feathers up to the thighs and often
  above them systme des animaux sans vertbres p 16
  we also perceive that the same bird wishing to catch fish without
  wetting its body is obliged to make continual efforts to lengthen
  its neck now the results of these habitual efforts in this
  individual and in those of its race have enabled them after a
  time to singularly elongate themas indeed is proved by the long
  neck of all shore birds
  if any swimming birds such as the swan and the goose whose legs
  are short nevertheless have a very long neck it is because these
  birds in swimming on the surface of the water have the habit of
  plunging their head down as far as they can to catch aquatic larv
  and different animalcules for food and because they make no effort
  to lengthen their legs
  when an animal to satisfy its wants makes repeated efforts to
  elongate its tongue it will acquire a considerable length the
  anteater green woodpecker when it is obliged to seize anything
  with this same organ then its tongue will divide and become forked
  that of the hummingbirds which seize with their tongue and that
  of the lizard and serpents which use it to feel and examine objects
  in front of them are proofs of what i advocate
  wants always occasioned by circumstances and followed by
  sustained efforts to satisfy them are not limited in results in
  modifyingthat is to say in increasing or diminishingthe extent
  and the faculties of organs but they also come to displace these
  same organs when certain of these wants become a necessity
  the fishes which habitually swim in large bodies of water having
  need of seeing laterally have in fact their eyes placed on the
  sides of the head their bodies more or less flattened according to
  the species have their sides perpendicular to the plane of the
  water and their eyes are placed in such a way that there is an eye
  on each flattened side but those fishes whose habits place them
  under the necessity of constantly approaching the shores and
  especially the shelving banks or where the slope is slight have
  been forced to swim on their flattened faces so as to be able to
  approach nearer the edge of the water in this situation receiving
  more light from above than from beneath and having a special need
  of being always attentive to what is going on above them this need
  has forced one of their eyes to undergo a kind of displacement and
  to assume the very singular situation which is familiar to us in the
  soles turbots dabs etc pleuronectes and achirus the
  situation of these eyes is asymmetrical because this results from
  an incomplete change now this change is entirely completed in the
  rays where the transverse flattening of the body is entirely
  horizontal as also the head also the eyes of the rays both
  situated on the upper side have become symmetrical
  the serpents which glide along the surface of the ground are
  obliged chiefly to see elevated objects or what are above their
  eyes this necessity has brought an influence to bear on the
  situation of the organs of vision in these animals and in fact
  they have the eyes placed in the lateral and upper parts of the
  head so as to easily perceive what is above or at their sides but
  they only see for a short distance what is in front of them
  moreover forced to supply the lack of ability to see and recognize
  what is in front of their head and which might injure them they
  need only to feel such objects with the aid of their tongue which
  they are obliged to dart out with all their power this habit has
  not only contributed to render the tongue slender very long and
  retractile but has also led in a great number of species to its
  division so as to enable them to feel several objects at once it
  has likewise allowed them to form an opening at the end of their
  head to enable the tongue to dart out without their being obliged
  to open their jaws
  nothing is more remarkable than the result of habits in the
  herbivorous mammals
  the quadruped to whom circumstances and the wants which they have
  created have given for a long period as also to others of its race
  the habit of browsing on grass only walks on the ground and is
  obliged to rest there on its four feet the greater part of its life
  moving about very little or only to a moderate extent the
  considerable time which this sort of creature is obliged to spend
  each day to fill itself with the only kind of food which it
  requires leads it to move about very little so that it uses its
  legs only to stand on the ground to walk or run and they never
  serve to seize hold of or to climb trees
  from this habit of daily consuming great amounts of food which
  distend the organs which receive it and of only moving about to a
  limited extent it has resulted that the bodies of these animals are
  thick clumsy and massive and have acquired a very great volume
  as we see in elephants rhinoceroses oxen buffaloes horses etc
  the habit of standing upright on their four feet during the greater
  part of the day to browse has given origin to a thick hoof which
  envelops the extremity of the digits of their feet and as their
  toes are not trained to make any movement and because they have
  served no other use than as supports as also the rest of the leg
  the most of them are short are reduced in size and even have ended
  by totally disappearing thus in the pachyderms some have five
  toes enveloped in horn and consequently their foot is divided into
  five parts others have only four and still others only three but
  in the ruminants which seem to be the most ancient of mammals
  which are limited only to standing on the ground there are only two
  digits on each foot and only a single one is to be found in the
  solipedes the horse the ass
  moreover among these herbivorous animals and especially among the
  ruminants it has been found that from the circumstances of the
  desert countries they inhabit they are incessantly exposed to be
  the prey of carnivorous animals and find safety only in precipitous
  flight necessity has forced them to run swiftly and from the habit
  they have thus acquired their body has become slenderer and their
  limbs much more delicate we see examples in the antelopes the
  gazelles etc
  other dangers in our climate to which are continually exposed the
  deer the roebuck the fallowdeer of perishing from the chase made
  by man have reduced them to the same necessity restrained them to
  similar habits and have given rise to the same results
  the ruminating animals only using their legs as supports and not
  having strong jaws which are only exercised in cutting and browsing
  on grass can only fight by striking with the head by directing
  against each other the vertex of this part
  in their moments of anger which are frequent especially among the
  males their internal feelings by their efforts more strongly urge
  the fluids toward this part of their head and it there secretes the
  corneous matter in some and osseous matter mixed with corneous
  matter in others which gives origin to solid protuberances hence
  the origin of horns and antlers with which most of these animals
  have the head armed
  as regards habits it is curious to observe the results in the
  special form and height of the giraffe camelopardalis we know
  that this animal the tallest of mammals inhabits the interior of
  africa and that it lives in localities where the earth almost
  always arid and destitute of herbage obliges it to browse on the
  foliage of trees and to make continual efforts to reach it it has
  resulted from this habit maintained for a long period in all the
  individuals of its race that its forelegs have become longer than
  the hinder ones and that its neck is so elongated that the
  giraffe without standing on its hind legs raises its head and
  reaches six meters in height almost twenty feet
  among the birds the ostriches deprived of the power of flight
  and raised on very long legs probably owe their singular
  conformation to analogous circumstances
  the result of habits is as remarkable in the carnivorous mammals as
  it is in the herbivorous but it presents effects of another kind
  indeed those of these mammals which are habituated as their race
  both to climb as well as to scratch or dig in the ground or to tear
  open and kill other animals for food have been obliged to use the
  digits of their feet moreover this habit has favored the
  separation of their digits and has formed the claws with which they
  are armed
  but among the carnivores there are some which are obliged to run in
  order to overtake their prey moreover since these need and
  consequently have the habit of daily tearing with their claws and
  burying them deeply in the body of another animal to seize and then
  to tear the flesh and have been enabled by their repeated efforts
  to procure for these claws a size and curvature which would greatly
  interfere in walking or running on stony soil it has resulted in
  this case that the animal has been obliged to make other efforts to
  draw back these too salient and curved claws which would impede it
  and hence there has resulted the gradual formation of those special
  sheaths in which the cats tigers lions etc withdraw their claws
  when not in action
  thus the efforts in any direction whatever maintained for a long
  time or made habitually by certain parts of a living body to satisfy
  necessities called out by nature or by circumstances develop these
  parts and make them acquire dimensions and a shape which they never
  would have attained if these efforts had not become the habitual
  action of the animals which have exercised them the observations
  made on all the animals known will everywhere furnish examples
  can any of them be more striking than that which the kangaroo
  offers us this animal which carries its young in its abdominal
  pouch has adopted the habit of holding itself erect standing only
  on its hind feet and tail and only changing its position by a
  series of leaps in which it preserves its erect attitude so as not
  to injure its young
  let us see the result
  1 its fore legs of which it makes little use and on which it
  rests only during the instant when it leaves its erect attitude
  have never reached a development proportionate to that of the other
  parts and have remained thin very small and weak
  2 the hind legs almost continually in action both for supporting
  the body and for leaping have on the contrary obtained a
  considerable development and have become very large and strong
  3 finally the tail which we see is of much use in supporting the
  animal and in the performance of its principal movements has
  acquired at its base a thickness and a strength extremely
  remarkable
  these wellknown facts are assuredly well calculated to prove what
  results from the habitual use in the animals of any organ or part
  and if when there is observed in an animal an organ especially well
  developed strong and powerful it is supposed that its habitual
  use has not produced it that its continual disuse will make it lose
  nothing and finally that this organ has always been such since
  the creation of the species to which this animal belongs i will ask
  why our domestic ducks cannot fly like wild ducksin a word i
  might cite a multitude of examples which prove the differences in us
  resulting from the exercise or lack of use of such of our organs
  although these differences might not be maintained in the
  individuals which follow them genetically for then their products
  would be still more considerable
  i shall prove in the second part that when the will urges an
  animal to any action the organs which should execute this action
  are immediately provoked by the affluence of subtile fluids the
  nervous fluid which then become the determining cause which calls
  for the action in question a multitude of observations prove this
  fact which is now indisputable
  it results that the multiplied repetitions of these acts of
  organization strengthen extend develop and even create the organs
  which are necessary it is only necessary attentively to observe
  that which is everywhere occurring to convince ourselves of the
  wellgrounded basis of this cause of organic developments and
  changes
  moreover every change acquired in an organ by a habit of use
  sufficient to have produced it is then preserved by heredity
  gnration if it is common to the individuals which in
  fecundation unite in the reproduction of their species finally
  this change is propagated and thus is transmitted to all the
  individuals which succeed and which are submitted to the same
  circumstances unless they have been obliged to acquire it by the
  means which have in reality created it
  besides in reproductive unions the crossings between the
  individuals which have different qualities or forms are necessarily
  opposed to the continuous propagation of these qualities and these
  forms we see that in man who is exposed to so many diverse
  circumstances which exert an influence on him the qualities or the
  accidental defects which he has been in the way of acquiring are
  thus prevented from being preserved and propagated by generation
  if when some particular features of form or any defects are
  acquired two individuals under this condition should always pair
  they would reproduce the same features and the successive
  generations being confined to such unions a special and distinct
  race would then be formed but perpetual unions between individuals
  which do not have the same peculiarities of form would cause all the
  characteristics acquired by special circumstances to disappear
  from this we can feel sure that if distances of habitation did not
  separate men the intermixture by generation would cause the general
  characteristics which distinguish the different nations to
  disappear
  if i should choose to pass in review all the classes all the
  orders all the genera and all the species of animals which exist
  i should show that the structure of individuals and their parts
  their organs their faculties etc etc are in all cases the sole
  result of the circumstances in which each species is found to be
  subjected by nature and by the habits which the individuals which
  compose it have been obliged to contract and which are only the
  product of a power primitively existing which has forced the
  animals into their wellknown habits
  we know that the animal called the ai or the sloth bradypus
  tridactylus is throughout life in a condition so very feeble that
  it is very slow and limited in its movements and that it walks on
  the ground with much difficulty its movements are so slow that it
  is thought that it cannot walk more than fifty steps in a day it is
  also known that the structure of this animal is in direct relation
  with its feeble state or its inaptitude for walking and that should
  it desire to make any other movements than those which it is seen to
  make it could not do it
  therefore supposing that this animal had received from nature its
  wellknown organization it is said that this organization has
  forced it to adopt the habits and the miserable condition it is in
  i am far from thinking so because i am convinced that the habits
  which the individuals of the race of the ai were originally
  compelled to contract have necessarily brought their organization
  into its actual state
  since continual exposure to dangers has at some time compelled the
  individuals of this species to take refuge in trees and to live in
  them permanently and then feed on their leaves it is evident that
  then they would give up making a multitude of movements that animals
  which live on the ground perform
  all the needs of the ai would then be reduced to seizing hold of
  the branches to creeping along them or to drawing them in so as to
  reach the leaves and then to remain on the tree in a kind of
  inaction so as to prevent falling besides this kind of
  sluggishness would be steadily provoked by the heat of the climate
  for in warmblooded animals the heat urges them rather to repose
  than to activity
  moreover during a long period of time the individuals of the race
  of the ai having preserved the habit of clinging to trees and of
  making only slow and slightly varied movements just sufficient for
  their needs their organization has gradually become adapted to
  their new habits and from this it will result
  1 that the arms of these animals making continual efforts readily
  to embrace the branches of trees would become elongated
  2 that the nails of their digits would acquire much length and a
  hooked shape by the continued efforts of the animal to retain its
  hold
  3 that their digits never having been trained to make special
  movements would lose all mobility among themselves would become
  united and would only preserve the power of bending or of
  straightening out all together
  4 that their thighs continually embracing both the trunks and the
  larger branches of trees would contract a condition of habitual
  separation which would tend to widen the pelvis and to cause the
  cotyloid cavities to be directed backward
  5 finally that a great number of their bones would become fused
  and hence several parts of their skeleton would assume an
  arrangement and a figure conformed to the habits of these animals
  and contrary to what would be necessary for them to have for other
  habits
  indeed this can never be denied because in fact nature on a
  thousand other occasions shows us in the power exercised by
  circumstances on habits and in that of the influence of habits on
  forms dispositions and the proportion of the parts of animals
  truly analogous facts
  a great number of citations being unnecessary we now see to what
  the case under discussion is reduced
  the fact is that divers animals have each according to their genus
  and their species special habits and in all cases an organization
  which is perfectly adapted to these habits
  from the consideration of this fact it appears that we should be
  free to admit either one or the other of the following conclusions
  and that only one of them is susceptible of proof
  conclusion admitted up to this day nature or its author in
  creating the animals has foreseen all the possible kinds of
  circumstances in which they should live and has given to each
  species an unchanging organization as also a form determinate and
  invariable in its different parts which compels each species to
  live in the places and in the climate where we find it and has
  there preserved its known habits
  my own conclusion nature in producing in succession every
  species of animal and beginning with the least perfect or the
  simplest to end her work with the most perfect has gradually
  complicated their structure and these animals spreading generally
  throughout all the inhabitable regions of the globe each species
  has received through the influence of circumstances to which it has
  been exposed the habits which we have observed and the
  modifications in its organs which observation has shown us it
  possesses
  the first of these two conclusions is that believed up to the
  present daynamely that held by nearly every one it implies in
  each animal an unchanging organization and parts which have never
  varied and which will never vary it implies also that the
  circumstances of the places which each species of animal inhabits
  will never vary in these localities for should they vary the same
  animals could not live there and the possibility of discovering
  similar forms elsewhere and of transporting them there would be
  forbidden
  the second conclusion is my own it implies that owing to the
  influence of circumstances on habits and as the result of that of
  habits on the condition of the parts and even on that of the
  organization each animal may receive in its parts and its
  organization modifications susceptible of becoming very
  considerable and of giving rise to the condition in which we find
  all animals
  to maintain that this second conclusion is unfounded it is
  necessary at first to prove that each point of the surface of the
  globe never varies in its nature its aspect its situation whether
  elevated or depressed its climate etc etc and likewise to
  prove that any part of animals does not undergo even at the end of
  a long period any modification by changes of circumstances and by
  the necessity which directs them to another kind of life and action
  than that which is habitual to them
  moreover if a single fact shows that an animal for a long time
  under domestication differs from the wild form from which it has
  descended and if in such a species in domesticity we find a great
  difference in conformation between the individuals submitted to
  such habits and those restricted to different habits then it will
  be certain that the first conclusion does not conform to the laws of
  nature and that on the contrary the second is perfectly in accord
  with them
  everything combines then to prove my assertionnamely that it is
  not the form either of the body or of its parts which gives rise
  to habits and to the mode of life among animals but that it is on
  the contrary the habits the manner of living and all the other
  influencing circumstances which have after a time constituted the
  form of the body and of the parts of animals with the new forms
  new faculties have been acquired and gradually nature has come to
  form the animals as we actually see them
  can there be in natural history a consideration more important and
  to which we should give more attention than that which i have just
  stated
  we will end this first part with the principles and the exposition
  of the natural classification of animals
in the fourth chapter of the third part vol ii pp 276301 lamarck
treats of the internal feelings of certain animals which provoke wants
besoins this is the subject which has elicited so much adverse
criticism and ridicule and has in many cases led to the wholesale
rejection of all of lamarcks views it is generally assumed or stated
by lamarcks critics who evidently did not read his book carefully
that while he claimed that the plants were evolved by the direct action
of the physical factors that in the case of all the animals the process
was indirect but this is not correct he evidently as we shall see
places the lowest animals those without or what he supposed to be
without a nervous system in the same category as the plants he
distinctly states at the outset that only certain animals and man are
endowed with this singular faculty which consists in being able to
experience internal emotions which provoke the wants and different
external or internal causes and which give birth to the power which
enables them to perform different actions
the nervous fluid he says can then undergo movements in certain
parts of its mass as well as in every part at once moreover it is
these latter movements which constitute the general movements
branlements of this fluid and which we now proceed to consider
  the general movements of the nervous fluid are of two kinds
  namely
  1 partial movements branlements which finally become general
  and end in a reaction it is the movements of this sort which
  produce feeling we have treated of them in the third chapter
  2 the movements which are general from the time they begin and
  which form no reaction it is these which constitute internal
  emotions and it is of them alone of which we shall treat
  but previously it is necessary to say a word regarding the
  feeling of existence because this feeling is the source from
  which the inner emotions originate
  on the feeling of existence
  the feeling of existence sentiment dexistence which i shall
  call inner feeling183 so as to separate from it the idea of a
  general condition gnralit which it does not possess since it
  is not common to all living beings and not even to all animals is
  a very obscure feeling with which are endowed those animals
  provided with a nervous system sufficiently developed to give them
  the faculty of feeling
  this sentiment very obscure as it is is nevertheless very
  powerful for it is the source of inner emotions which test
  prouvent the individuals possessing it and as the result
  this singular force urges these individuals to themselves produce
  the movements and the actions which their wants require moreover
  this feeling considered as a very active motor only acts thus by
  sending to the muscles which necessarily cause these movements and
  actions the nervous fluid which excites them
  indeed as the result of organic or vital movements which are
  produced in every animal that which possesses a nervous system
  sufficiently developed has physical sensibility and continually
  receives in every inner and sensitive part impressions which
  continually affect it and which it feels in general without being
  able to distinguish any single one
  the sentiment of existence consciousness is general since almost
  every sensitive part of the body shares in it it constitutes this
  me moi with which all animals which are only sensitive are
  penetrated without perceiving it but which those possessing a
  brain are able to notice having the power of thought and of giving
  attention to it finally it is in all the source of a power which
  is aroused by wants which acts effectively only by emotion and
  through which the movements and actions derive the force which
  produces them
  finally the inner feeling only manifests its power and causes
  movements when there exists a system for muscular movement which
  is always dependent on the nervous system and cannot take place
  without it
the author then states that these emotions of the organic sense may
operate in the animals and in man either without or with an act of their
will
  from what has been said we cannot doubt but that the inner and
  general feeling which urges the animals possessing a nervous system
  fitted for feeling should be susceptible of being aroused by the
  causes which affect it moreover these causes are always the need
  both of satisfying hunger of escaping dangers of avoiding pain of
  seeking pleasure or that which is agreeable to the individual etc
  the emotions of the inner feeling can only be recognized by man
  who alone pays attention to them but he only perceives those which
  are strong which excite his whole being such as a view from a
  precipice a tragic scene etc
lamarck then divides the emotions into physical and moral the latter
arising from our ideas thoughtsin short our intellectual actsin
the account of which we need not follow him
in the succeeding chapter v the author dilates on the force which
causes actions in animals we know he says that plants can satisfy
their needs without moving since they find their food in the environing
milieux but it is not the same with animals which are obliged to
move about to procure their sustenance moreover most of them have
other wants to satisfy which require other kinds of movements and
acts this matter is discussed in the authors often leisurely and
prolix way with more or less repetition which we will condense
the lowest animalsthose destitute of a nervous systemmove in
response to a stimulus from without nature has gradually created the
different organs of animals varying the structure and situation of
these organs according to circumstances and has progressively improved
their powers she has begun by borrowing from without so to speakfrom
the environmentthe productive force both of organic movements and
those of the external parts she has thus transported this force the
result of heat electricity and perhaps others p 307 into the
animal itself and finally in the most perfect animals she has placed
a great part of this force at their disposal as i will soon show
this force incessantly introduced into the lowest animals sets in motion
the visible fluids of the body and excites the irritability of their
contained parts giving rise to different contractile movements which we
observe hence the appearance of an irresistible propensity penchant
which constrains them to execute those movements which by their
continuity or their repetition give rise to habits
the most imperfect animals such as the infusoria especially the
monads are nourished by absorption and by an internal inhibition of
absorbed matters they have he says no power of seeking their
food they have not even the power of recognizing it but they absorb it
because it comes in contact with every side of them avec tous les
points de leur individu and because the water in which they live
furnishes it to them in sufficient abundance
these frail animals in which the subtile fluids of the environing
milieux constitute the stimulating cause of the orgasm of
irritability and of organic movements execute as i have said
contractile movements which provoked and varied without ceasing by this
stimulating cause facilitate and hasten the absorptions of which i have
just spoken 
on the transportation of the forceproducing movements in the interior
of animals
  if nature were confined to the employment of its first
  meansnamely of a force entirely external and foreign to the
  animalits work would have remained very important the animals
  would have remained machines totally passive and she would never
  have given origin in any of these living beings to the admirable
  phenomena of sensibility of inmost feelings of existence which
  result therefrom of the power of action finally of ideas by
  which she can create the most wonderful of all that of thoughtin
  a word intelligence
  but wishing to attain these grand results she has by slow degrees
  prepared the means in gradually giving consistence to the internal
  parts of animals in differentiating the organs and in multiplying
  and farther forming the fluids contained etc after which she has
  transported into the interior of these animals that force productive
  of movements and of actions which in truth it would not dominate at
  first but which she has come to place in great part at their
  disposition when their organization should become very much more
  perfect
  indeed from the time that the animal organization had sufficiently
  advanced in its structure to possess a nervous systemeven slightly
  developed as in insectsthe animals provided with this
  organization were endowed with an intimate sense of their existence
  and from that time the force productive of movements was conveyed
  into the very interior of the animal
  i have already made it evident that this internal force which
  produces movements and actions should derive its origin in the
  intimate feeling of existence which animals with a nervous system
  possess and that this feeling solicited or aroused by needs
  should then start into motion the subtile fluid contained in the
  nerves and carry it to the muscles which should act this producing
  the actions which the needs require
  moreover every want felt produces an emotion in the inner feeling
  of the individual which experiences it and from this emotion of the
  feeling in question arises the force which gives origin to the
  movement of the parts which are placed in activity
  thus in the animals which possess the power of actingnamely the
  force productive of movements and actionsthe inner feeling which
  on each occasion originates this force being excited by some need
  places in action the power or force in question excites the
  movement of displacement in the subtile fluid of the nerveswhich
  the ancients called animal spirits directs this fluid towards
  that of its organs which any want impels to action finally makes
  this same fluid flow back into its habitual reservoirs when the
  needs no longer require the organ to act
  the inner feeling takes the place of the will for it is now
  important to consider that every animal which does not possess the
  special organ in which or by which it executes thoughts judgments
  etc has in reality no will does not make a choice and
  consequently cannot control the movements which its inner feeling
  excites instinct directs these actions and we shall see that
  this direction always results from emotions of the inner feeling in
  which intelligence has no part and from the organization even which
  the habits have modified in such a manner that the needs of animals
  which are in this category being necessarily limited and always
  the same in the same species the inner feeling and consequently
  the power of acting always produces the same actions
  it is not the same in animals which besides a nervous system have a
  brain the author meaning the higher vertebrates and which make
  comparisons judgments thoughts etc these same animals control
  more or less their power of action according to the degree of
  perfection of their brain and although they are still strongly
  subjected to the results of their habits which have modified their
  structure they enjoy more or less freedom of the will can choose
  and can vary their acts or at least some of them
lamarck then treats of the consumption and exhaustion of the nervous
fluid in the production of animal movements resulting in fatigue
he next occupies himself with the origin of the inclination to the same
actions and of instinct in animals
  the cause of the wellknown phenomenon which constrains almost all
  animals to always perform the same acts and that which gives rise
  in man to a propensity penchant to repeat every action becoming
  habitual assuredly merits investigation
  the animals which are only sensible184namely which possess
  no brain cannot think reason or perform intelligent acts and
  their perceptions being often very confuseddo not reason and can
  scarcely vary their actions they are then invariably bound by
  habits thus the insects which of all animals endowed with feeling
  have the least perfect nervous system185 have perceptions of
  objects which affect them and seem to have memory of them when they
  are repeated yet they can vary their actions and change their
  habits though they do not possess the organ whose acts could give
  them the means
  on the instincts of animals
  we define instinct as the sum ensemble of the decisions
  dterminations of animals in their actions and indeed some
  have thought that these determinations were the product of a
  rational choice and consequently the fruit of experience others
  says cabanis may think with the observers of all ages that several
  of these decisions should not be ascribed to any kind of reasoning
  and that without ceasing as for that to have their source in
  physical sensibility they are most often formed without the will of
  the individuals able to have any other part than in better directing
  the execution it should be added without the will having any part
  in it for when it does not act it does not of course direct the
  execution
  if it had been considered that all the animals which enjoy the
  power of sensation have their inner feeling susceptible of being
  aroused by their needs and that the movements of their nervous
  fluids which result from these emotions are constantly directed by
  this inner sentiment and by habits then it has been felt that in
  all the animals deprived of intelligence all the decisions of action
  can never be the result of a rational choice of judgment of
  profitable experiencein a word of willbut that they are
  subjected to needs which certain sensations excite and which awaken
  the inclinations which urge them on
  in the animals even which enjoy the power of performing certain
  intelligent acts it is still more often the inner feeling and the
  inclinations originating from habits which decide without choice
  the acts which animals perform
  moreover although the executing power of movements and of actions
  as also the cause which directs them should be entirely internal
  it is not well as has been done186 to limit to internal
  impressions the primary cause or provocation of these acts with the
  intention to restrict to external impressions that which provokes
  intelligent acts for from what few facts are known bearing on
  these considerations we are convinced that either way the causes
  which arouse and provoke acts are sometimes internal and sometimes
  external that these same causes give rise in reality to impressions
  all of which act internally
  according to the idea generally attached to the word instinct the
  faculty which this word expresses is considered as a light which
  illuminates and guides animals in their actions and which is with
  them what reason is to us no one has shown that instinct can be a
  force which calls into action that this force acts effectively
  without any participation of the will and that it is constantly
  directed by acquired inclinations
there are the author states two kinds of causes which can arouse the
inner feeling organic sensenamely those which depend on
intellectual acts and those which without arising from it immediately
excite it and force it to direct its power of acting in the direction of
acquired inclinations
  these are the only causes of this last kind which constitute all
  the acts of instinct and as these acts are not the result of
  deliberation of choice of judgment the actions which arise from
  them always satisfy surely and without error the wants felt and
  the propensities arising from habits
  hence instinct in animals is an inclination which necessitates
  that from sensations provoked while giving rise to wants the animal
  is impelled to act without the participation of any thought or any
  act of the will
  this propensity owes to the organization what the habits have
  modified in its favor and it is excited by impressions and wants
  which arouse the organic sense of the individual and put it in the
  way of sending the nervous fluid in the direction which the
  propensity in activity needs to the muscles to be placed in action
  i have already said that the habit of exercising such an organ or
  such a part of the body to satisfy the needs which often spring up
  should give to the subtile fluid which changes its place where is to
  be operated the power which causes action so great a facility in
  moving towards this organ where it has been so often employed that
  this habit should in a way become inherent in the nature of the
  individual which is unable to change it
  moreover the wants of animals possessing a nervous system being
  in each case dependent on the structure of these organisms are
  1 of obtaining any kind of food
  2 of yielding to sexual fecundation which excites in them certain
  sensations
  3 of avoiding pain
  4 of seeking pleasure or happiness
  to satisfy these wants they contract different kinds of habits
  which are transformed into so many propensities which they can
  neither resist nor change from this originate their habitual
  actions and their special propensities to which we give the name
  of instinct187
  this propensity of animals to preserve their habits and to renew
  the actions resulting from them being once acquired is then
  propagated by means of reproduction or generation which preserves
  the organization and the disposition of parts in the state thus
  attained so that this same propensity already exists in the new
  individuals even before they have exercised it
  it is thus that the same habits and the same instinct are
  perpetuated from generation to generation in the different species
  or races of animals without offering any notable variation188 so
  long as it does not suffer change in the circumstances essential to
  the mode of life
  on the industry of certain animals
  in those animals which have no brain that which we call industry
  as applied to certain of their actions does not deserve such a name
  for it is a mistake to attribute to them a faculty which they do not
  possess
  propensities transmitted and received by heredity gnration
  habits of performing complicated actions and which result from
  these acquired propensities finally different difficulties
  gradually and habitually overcome by as many emotions of the organic
  sense sentiment intrieur constitute the sum of actions which
  are always the same in the individuals of the same race to which we
  inconsiderately give the name of industry
  the instinct of animals being formed by the habit of satisfying the
  four kinds of wants mentioned above and resulting from the
  propensities acquired for a long time which urge them on in a way
  determined for each species there comes to pass in the case of
  some only a complication in the actions which can satisfy these
  four kinds of wants or certain of them and indeed only the
  different difficulties necessary to be overcome have gradually
  compelled the animal to extend and make contrivances and have led
  it without choice or any intellectual act but only by the emotions
  of the organic sense to perform such and such acts
  hence the origin in certain animals of different complicated
  actions which has been called industry and which are so
  enthusiastically admired because it has always been supposed at
  least tacitly that these actions were contrived and deliberately
  planned which is plainly erroneous they are evidently the fruit of
  a necessity which has expanded and directed the habits of the
  animals performing them and which renders them such as we observe
  what i have just said is especially applicable to the invertebrate
  animals in which there enters no act of intelligence none of
  these can indeed freely vary its actions none of them has the power
  of abandoning what we call its industry to adopt any other kind
  there is then nothing wonderful in the supposed industry of the
  antlion myrmeleon formicaleo which having thrown up a
  hillock of movable sand waits until its booty is thrown down to the
  bottom of its funnel by the showers of sand to become its victim
  also there is none in the manoeuvre of the oyster which to
  satisfy all its wants does nothing but open and close its shell so
  long as their organization is not changed they will always both of
  them do what we see them do and they will do it neither
  voluntarily nor rationally
  this is not the case with the vertebrate animals and it is among
  them especially in the birds and mammals that we observe in their
  actions traces of a true industry because in difficult cases
  their intelligence in spite of their propensity to habits can aid
  them in varying their actions these acts however are not common
  and are only slightly manifested in certain races which have
  exercised them more as we have had frequent occasion to remark
lamarck then chapter vi examines into the nature of the will which
he says is really the principle underlying all the actions of animals
the will he says is one of the results of thought the result of a
reflux of a portion of the nervous fluid towards the parts which are to
act
he compares the brain to a register on which are imprinted ideas of all
kinds acquired by the individual so that this individual provokes at
will an effusion of the nervous fluid on this register and directs it
to any particular page the remainder of the second volume
chapter vii is devoted to the understanding its origin and that of
ideas the following additions relative to chapters vii and viii of
the first part of this work are from vol ii pp 451466
in the last of june 1809 the menagerie of the museum of natural
history having received a phoca phoca vitulina lamarck as he says
had the opportunity of observing its movements and habits after
describing its habits in swimming and moving on land and observing its
relation to the clawed mammals he says his main object is to remark
that the seals do not have the hind legs arranged in the same direction
as the axis of their body because these animals are constrained to
habitually use them to form a caudal fin closing and widening by
spreading their digits the paddle palette which results from their
union
  the morses on the contrary which are accustomed to feed on grass
  near the shore never use their hind feet as a caudal fin but their
  feet are united together with the tail and cannot separate thus in
  animals of similar origin we see a new proof of the effect of habits
  on the form and structure of organs
he then turns to the flying mammals such as the flying squirrel
sciurus volans robates petaurista sagitta and
volucella and then explains the origin of their adaptation for
flying leaps
  these animals more modern than the seals having the habit of
  extending their limbs while leaping to form a sort of parachute
  can only make a very prolonged leap when they glide down from a
  tree or spring only a short distance from one tree to another now
  by frequent repetitions of such leaps in the individuals of these
  races the skin of their sides is expanded on each side into a loose
  membrane which connects the hind and fore legs and which
  enclosing a volume of air prevents their sudden falling these
  animals are moreover without membranes between the fingers and
  toes
  the galeopithecus lemur volans undoubtedly a more ancient form
  but with the same habits as the flying squirrel pteromys geoff
  has the skin of the flancs more ample still more developed
  connecting not only the hinder with the fore legs but in addition
  the fingers and the tail with the hind feet moreover they leap
  much farther than the flying squirrels and even make a sort of
  flight189
  finally the different bats are probably mammals still older than
  the galeopithecus in the habit of extending their membrane and even
  their fingers to encompass a greater volume of air so as to sustain
  their bodies when they fly out into the air
  by these habits for so long a period contracted and preserved the
  bats have obtained not only lateral membranes but also an
  extraordinary elongation of the fingers of their fore feet with the
  exception of the thumb between which are these very ample
  membranes uniting them so that these membranes of the hands become
  continuous with those of the flanks and with those which connect
  the tail with the two hind feet forming in these animals great
  membranous wings with which they fly perfectly as everybody knows
  such is then the power of habits which have a singular influence
  on the conformation of parts and which give to the animals which
  have for a long time contracted certain of them faculties not found
  in other animals
  as regards the amphibious animals of which i have often spoken it
  gives me pleasure to communicate to my readers the following
  reflections which have arisen from an examination of all the objects
  which i have taken into consideration in my studies and seen more
  and more to be confirmed
  i do not doubt but that the mammals have in reality originated from
  them and that they are the veritable cradle berceau of the
  entire animal kingdom
  indeed we see that the least perfect animals and they are the
  most numerous live only in the water hence it is probable as i
  have said vol ii p 85 that it is only in the water or in very
  humid places that nature causes and still forms under favorable
  conditions direct or spontaneous generations which have produced
  the simplest animalcules and those from which have successively been
  derived all the other animals
  we know that the infusoria the polyps and the radiata only live
  in the water that the worms even only live some in the water and
  others in very damp places
  moreover regarding the worms which seem to form an initial branch
  of the animal scale since it is evident that the infusoria form
  another branch we may suppose that among those of them which are
  wholly aquaticnamely which do not live in the bodies of other
  animals such as the gordius and many others still unknownthere
  are doubtless a great many different aquatic forms and that among
  these aquatic worms those which afterwards habitually expose
  themselves to the air have probably produced amphibious insects
  such as the mosquitoes the ephemeras etc etc which have
  successively given origin to all the insects which live solely in
  the air but several races of these having changed their habits by
  the force of circumstances and having formed habits of a life
  solitary retired or hidden have given rise to the arachnides
  almost all of which also live in the air
  finally those of the arachnides which have frequented the water
  which have consequently become progressively habituated to live in
  it and which finally cease to expose themselves to the airthis
  indicates the relations which connecting the scolopendr to julus
  this to the oniscus and the last to asellus shrimps etc have
  caused the existence of all the crustacea
  the other aquatic worms which are never exposed to the air
  multiplying and diversifying their races with time and gradually
  making progress in the complication of their structure have caused
  the formation of the annelida cirripedia and molluscs which
  together form an uninterrupted portion of the animal scale
  in spite of the considerable hiatus which we observe between the
  known molluscs and the fishes the molluscs whose origin i have
  just indicated have by the intermediation of those yet remaining
  unknown given origin to the fishes as it is evident that the
  latter have given rise to the reptiles
  in continuing to consult the probabilities on the origin of
  different animals we cannot doubt but that the reptiles by two
  distinct branches which circumstances have brought about have given
  rise on one side to the formation of birds and on the other to
  that of amphibious mammals which have given in their turn origin to
  all the other mammals190
  indeed the fishes having caused the formation of batrachia and
  these of the ophidian reptiles both having only one auricle in the
  heart nature has easily come to give a heart with a double auricle
  to other reptiles which constitute two special branches finally
  she has easily arrived at the end of forming in the animals which
  had originated from each of these branches a heart with two
  ventricles
  thus among the reptiles whose heart has a double auricle on the
  one side the chelonians seem to have given origin to the birds if
  independently of several relations which we cannot disregard i
  should place the head of a tortoise on the neck of certain birds i
  should perceive almost no disparity in the general physiognomy of
  the factitious animal and on the other side the saurians
  especially the planicaudes such as the crocodiles seem to have
  given origin to the amphibious mammals
  if the branch of the chelonians has given rise to birds we can yet
  presume that the palmipede aquatic birds especially the
  brevipennes such as the penguins and the manchots have given
  origin to the monotremes
  finally if the branch of saurians has given rise to the amphibious
  mammals it will be most probable that this branch is the source
  whence all the mammals have taken their origin
  i therefore believe myself authorized to think that the terrestrial
  mammals originally descended from those aquatic mammals that we call
  amphibia because the latter being divided into three branches by
  the diversity of the habits which with the lapse of time they have
  adopted some have caused the formation of the cetacea others that
  of the ungulated mammals and still others that of the unguiculate
  mammals
  for example those of the amphibia which have preserved the habit
  of frequenting the shores differ in the manner of taking their food
  some among them accustoming themselves to browse on herbage such as
  the morses and lamatines gradually gave origin to the ungulate
  mammals such as the pachyderms ruminants etc the others such
  as the phocid contracting the habit of feeding on fishes and
  marine animals caused the existence of the unguiculate mammals by
  means of races which while becoming differentiated became entirely
  terrestrial
  but those aquatic mammals which would form the habit of never
  leaving the water and only rising to breathe at the surface would
  probably give origin to the different known cetaceans moreover the
  ancient and complete habitation of the cetacea in the ocean has so
  modified their structure that it is now very difficult to recognize
  the source whence they have derived their origin
  indeed since the enormous length of time during which these
  animals have lived in the depths of the sea never using their hind
  feet in seizing objects their disused feet have wholly disappeared
  as also their skeleton and even the pelvis serving as their
  attachment
  the alteration which the cetaceans have undergone in their limbs
  owing to the influence of the medium in which they live and the
  habits which they have there contracted manifests itself also in
  their fore limbs which entirely enveloped by the skin no longer
  show externally the fingers in which they end so that they only
  offer on each side a fin which contains concealed within it the
  skeleton of a hand
  assuredly the cetaceans being mammals it entered into the plan of
  their structure to have four limbs like the others and
  consequently a pelvis to sustain their hind legs but here as
  elsewhere that which is lacking in them is the result of atrophy
  brought about at the end of a long time by the want of use of the
  parts which were useless
  if we consider that in the phoc where the pelvis still exists
  this pelvis is impoverished narrowed and with no projections on
  the hips we see that the lessened mdiocre use of the hind feet
  of these animals must be the cause and that if this use should
  entirely cease the hind limbs and even the pelvis would in the end
  disappear
  the considerations which i have just presented may doubtless appear
  as simple conjectures because it is possible to establish them only
  on direct and positive proofs but if we pay any attention to the
  observations which i have stated in this work and if then we
  examine carefully the animals which i have mentioned as also the
  result of their habits and their surroundings we shall find that
  these conjectures will acquire after this examination an eminent
  probability
  the following tableau191 will facilitate the comprehension of
  what i have just stated it will be seen that in my opinion the
  animal scale begins at least by two special branches and that in
  the course of its extent some branchlets rameaux would seem to
  terminate in certain places
  this series of animals beginning with two branches where are
  situated the most imperfect the first of these branches received
  their existence only by direct or spontaneous generation
  a strong reason prevents our knowing the changes successively
  brought about which have produced the condition in which we observe
  them it is because we are never witnesses of these changes thus we
  see the work when done but never watching them during the process
  we are naturally led to believe that things have always been as we
  see them and not as they have progressively been brought about
  among the changes which nature everywhere incessantly produces in
  her ensemble and her laws remain always the same such of these
  changes as to bring about do not need much more time than the
  duration of human life are easily understood by the man who
  observes them but he cannot perceive those which are accomplished
  at the end of a considerable time
  if the duration of human life only extended to the length of a
  second and if there existed one of our actual clocks mounted and
  in movement each individual of our species who should look at the
  hourhand of this clock would never see it change its place in the
  course of his life although this hand would really not be
  stationary the observations of thirty generations would never learn
  anything very evident as to the displacement of this hand because
  its movement only being that made during half a minute would be
  too slight to make an impression and if observations much more
  ancient should show that this same hand had really moved those who
  should see the statement would not believe it and would suppose
  there was some error each one having always seen the hand on the
  same point of the dialplate
  i leave to my readers all the applications to be made regarding
  this supposition
  nature that immense totality of different beings and bodies in
  every part of which exists an eternal circle of movements and
  changes regulated by law totality alone unchangeable so long as it
  pleases its sublime author to make it exist should be regarded as a
  whole constituted by its parts for a purpose which its author alone
  knows and not exclusively for any one of them
  each part necessarily is obliged to change and to cease to be one
  in order to constitute another with interests opposed to those of
  all and if it has the power of reasoning it finds this whole
  imperfect in reality however this whole is perfect and
  completely fulfils the end for which it was designed
the last work in which lamarck discussed the theory of descent was in
his introduction to the animaux sans vertbres but here the only
changes of importance are his four laws which we translate and a
somewhat different phylogeny of the animal kingdom
the four laws differ from the two given in the philosophie zoologique
in his theory the second law accounting for the origin of a new organ
the result of a new need
  first law life by its proper forces continually tends to
  increase the volume of every body which possesses it and to
  increase the size of its parts up to a limit which it brings about
  second law the production of a new organ in an animal body
  results from the supervention of a new want besoin which
  continues to make itself felt and of a new movement which this want
  gives rise to and maintains
  third law the development of organs and their power of action
  are constantly in ratio to the employment of these organs
  fourth law everything which has been acquired impressed upon
  or changed in the organization of individuals during the course of
  their life is preserved by generation and transmitted to the new
  individuals which have descended from those which have undergone
  those changes
in explaining the second law he says
  the foundation of this law derives its proof from the third in
  which the facts known allow of no doubt for if the forces of
  action of an organ by their increase further develop this
  organnamely increase its size and power as is constantly proved
  by factswe may be assured that the forces by which it acts just
  originated by a new want felt would necessarily give birth to the
  organ adapted to satisfy this new want if this organ had not before
  existed
  in truth in animals so low as not to be able to feel it cannot
  be that we should attribute to a felt want the formation of a new
  organ this formation being in such a case the product of a
  mechanical cause as that of a new movement produced in a part of
  the fluids of the animal
  it is not the same in animals with a more complicated structure
  and which are able to feel they feel wants and each want felt
  exciting their inner feeling forthwith sets the fluids in motion
  and forces them towards the point of the body where an action may
  satisfy the want experienced now if there exists at this point an
  organ suitable for this action it is immediately cited to act and
  if the organ does not exist and only the felt want be for instance
  pressing and continuous gradually the organ originates and is
  developed on account of the continuity and energy of its employment
  if i had not been convinced 1 that the thought alone of an action
  which strongly interests it suffices to arouse the inner feeling
  of an individual 2 that a felt want can itself arouse the feeling
  in question 3 that every emotion of inner feeling resulting
  from a want which is aroused directs at the same instant a mass of
  nervous fluid to the points to be set in activity that it also
  creates a flow thither of the fluids of the body and especially
  nutrient ones that finally it then places in activity the organs
  already existing or makes efforts for the formation of those which
  would not have existed there and which a continual want would
  therefore render necessaryi should have had doubts as to the
  reality of the law which i have just indicated
  but although it may be very difficult to verify this law by
  observation i have no doubt as to the grounds on which i base it
  the necessity of its existence being involved in that of the third
  law which is now well established
  i conceive for example that a gasteropod mollusc which as it
  crawls along finds the need of feeling the bodies in front of it
  makes efforts to touch those bodies with some of the foremost parts
  of its head and sends to these every time supplies of nervous
  fluids as well as other fluidsi conceive i say that it must
  result from this reiterated afflux towards the points in question
  that the nerves which abut at these points will by slow degrees be
  extended now as in the same circumstances other fluids of the
  animal flow also to the same places and especially nourishing
  fluids it must follow that two or more tentacles will appear and
  develop insensibly under those circumstances on the points referred
  to
  this is doubtless what has happened to all the races of
  gasteropods whose wants have compelled them to adopt the habit of
  feeling bodies with some part of their head
  but if there occur among the gasteropods any races which by
  the circumstances which concern their mode of existence or life do
  not experience such wants then their head remains without
  tentacles it has even no projection no traces of tentacles and
  this is what has happened in the case of bulla bulla and
  chiton
in the supplment  la distribution gnrale des animaux
introduction p 342 concerning the real order of origin of the
invertebrate classes lamarck proposes a new genealogical tree he
states that the order of the animal series is far from simple that it
is branching and seems even to be composed of several distinct series
though farther on p 456 he adds
  je regarde lordre de la production des animaux comme form de
  deux sries distinctes
  ainsi je soumets  la mditation des zoologistes lordre prsum
  de la formation des animaux tel que lexprime le tableau
  suivant
in the matter of the origin of instinct as in evolution in general
lamarck appears to have laid the foundation on which darwins views
though he throws aside lamarcks factors must rest the inherited
habit theory is thus stated by lamarck
instinct he claims is not common to all animals since the lowest
forms like plants are entirely passive under the influences of the
surrounding medium they have no wants are automata
  but animals with a nervous system have wants ie they feel
  hunger sexual desires they desire to avoid pain or to seek
  pleasure etc to satisfy these wants they contract habits which
  are gradually transformed into so many propensities which they can
  neither resist nor change hence arise habitual actions and special
  propensities to which we give the name of instinct
  these propensities are inherited and become innate in the young so
  that they act instinctively from the moment of birth thus the same
  habits and instincts are perpetuated from one generation to another
  with no notable variations so long as the species does not
  suffer change in the circumstances essential to its mode of life
the same views are repeated in the introduction to the animaux sans
vertbres 1815 and again in 1820 in his last work and do not need
to be translated as they are repetitions of his previously published
views in the philosophie zoologique
unfortunately to illustrate his thoughts on instinct lamarck does not
give us any examples nor did he apparently observe to any great extent
the habits of animals in these days one cannot follow him in drawing a
lineas regards the possession of instinctsbetween the lowest
organisms or protozoa and the groups provided with a nervous system
lamarcks meaning of the word besoins or wants or needslamarcks
use of the word wants or needs besoins has we think been greatly
misunderstood and at times caricatured or pronounced as absurd the
distinguished french naturalist quatrefages although he was not
himself an evolutionist has protested against the way lamarcks views
have been caricatured by nearly all authors he is represented as
claiming that by simply willing or desiring the individual bird or
other animal radically and with more or less rapidity changed its shape
or that of some particular organ or part of the body this is as we
have seen by no means what he states in no instance does he speak of
an animal as simply desiring to modify an organ in any way the
doctrine of appetency attributed to lamarck is without foundation in
all the examples given he intimates that owing to changes in
environment leading to isolation in a new area separating a large
number of individuals from their accustomed habitat they are driven by
necessity besoin or new needs to adopt a new or different mode of
lifenew habits these efforts whatever they may besuch as attempts
to fly swim wade climb burrow etc continued for a long time in
all the individuals of its species or the great number forced by
competition to migrate and become segregated from the others of the
original speciesfinally owing to the changed surroundings affect the
mass of individuals thus isolated and their organs thus exercised in a
special direction undergo a slow modification
even so careful a writer as dr alfred r wallace does not quite fairly
or with exactness state what lamarck says when in his classical essay
of 1858 he represents lamarck as stating that the giraffe acquired its
long neck by desiring to reach the foliage of the more lofty shrubs
and constantly stretching its neck for the purpose on the contrary he
does not use the word desiring at all what lamarck does say is that
  the giraffe lives in dry desert places without herbage so that
  it is obliged to browse on the leaves of trees and is continually
  forced to reach up to them it results from this habit continued
  for a long time in all the individuals of its species that its fore
  limbs have become so elongated that the giraffe without raising
  itself erect on its hind legs raises its head and reaches six
  meters high almost twenty feet192
we submit that this mode of evolution of the giraffe is quite as
reasonable as the very hypothetical one advanced by mr wallace193
ie that a variety occurred with a longer neck than usual and these
at once secured a fresh range of pasture over the same ground as their
shorternecked companions and on the first scarcity of food were
thereby enabled to outlive them mr wallaces account also of
lamarcks general theory appears to us to be onesided inadequate and
misleading he states it thus the hypothesis of lamarckthat
progressive changes in species have been produced by the attempts of
animals to increase the development of their own organs and thus modify
their structure and habits this is a caricature of what lamarck really
taught wants needs besoins volitions desires are not mentioned
by lamarck in his two fundamental laws see p 303 and when the word
besoins is introduced it refers as much to the physiological needs as
to the emotions of the animal resulting from some new environment which
forces it to adopt new habits such as means of locomotion or of
acquiring food
it will be evident to one who has read the original or the foregoing
translations of lamarcks writings that he does not refer so much to
mental desires or volitions as to those physiological wants or needs
thrust upon the animal by change of circumstances or by competition and
his besoins may include lust hunger as well as the necessity of
making muscular exertions such as walking running leaping climbing
swimming or flying
as we understand lamarck when he speaks of the incipient giraffe or
longnecked bird as making efforts to reach up or outwards the efforts
may have been as much physiological reflex or instinctive as mental a
recent writer dr r t jackson curiously and yet naturally enough
uses the same phraseology as lamarck when he says that the long siphon
of the common clam mya was brought about by the effort to reach the
surface induced by the habit of deep burial in its hole194
on the other hand can we in the higher vertebrates entirely dissociate
the emotional and mental activities from their physiological or
instinctive acts mr darwin in his expressions of the emotions in man
and animals discusses in an interesting and detailed way the effects
of the feelings and passions on some of the higher animals
it is curious also that dr erasmus darwin went at least as far as
lamarck in claiming that the transformations of animals are in part
produced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires and
aversions of their pleasures and their pains or of irritations or of
associations
cope in the final chapter of his primary factors of organic
evolution entitled the functions of consciousness goes to much
farther extremes than the french philosopher has been accused of doing
and unhesitatingly attributes consciousness to all animals whatever be
its nature he says the preliminary to any animal movement which is
not automatic is an effort hence he regards effort as the immediate
source of all movement and considers that the control of muscular
movements by consciousness is distinctly observable in fact he even
goes to the length of affirming that reflex acts are the product of
conscious acts whereas it is plain enough that reflex acts are always
the result of some stimulus
another case mentioned by lamarck in his animaux sans vertbres which
has been pronounced as absurd and ridiculous and has aided in throwing
his whole theory into disfavor is his way of accounting for the
development of the tentacles of the snail which is quoted on p 348
this account is a very probable and in fact the only rational
explanation the initial cause of such structures is the intermittent
stimulus of occasional contact with surrounding objects the irritation
thus set up causing a flow of the blood to the exposed parts receiving
the stimuli the general cause is the same as that concerned in the
production of horns and other hard defensive projections on the heads of
various animals
in commenting on this case of the snail professor cleland in his just
and discriminating article on lamarck says
  however absurd this may seem it must be admitted that unlimited
  time having been once granted for organs to be developed in series
  of generations the objections to their being formed in the way here
  imagined are only such as equally apply to the theory of their
  origin by natural selection in judging the reasonableness of the
  second law of lamarck referring to new wants see p 346 as
  compared with more modern and now widely received theories it must
  be observed that it is only an extension of his third law and that
  third law is a fact the strengthening of the blacksmiths arm by
  use is proverbially notorious it is therefore only the
  sufficiency of the lamarckian hypothesis to explain the first
  commencement of new organs which is in question if evolution by the
  mere operation of forces acting in the organic world be granted and
  surely the darwinian theory is equally helpless to account for the
  beginning of a new organ while it demands as imperatively that
  every stage in the assumed hereditary development of an organ must
  have been useful lamarck gave great importance to the influence
  of new wants acting indirectly by stimulating growth and use darwin
  has given like importance to the effects of accidental variations
  acting indirectly by giving advantage in the struggle for existence
  the speculative writings of darwin have however been interwoven
  with a vast number of beautiful experiments and observations bearing
  on his speculations though by no means proving his theory of
  evolution while the speculations of lamarck lie apart from his
  wonderful descriptive labors unrelieved by intermixture with other
  matters capable of attracting the numerous class who provided they
  have new facts set before them are not careful to limit themselves
  to the conclusions strictly deducible therefrom but those who read
  the philosophie zoologique will find how many truths often
  supposed to be far more modern are stated with abundant clearness in
  its pages encyc brit art lamarck

180 lamarcks idea of the animal series was that of a branched one as
shown by his genealogical tree on p 193 and he explains that the
series begins at least by two special branches these ending in
branchlets he thus breaks entirely away from the old idea of a
continuous ascending series of his predecessors bonnet and others
professor r hertwig therefore makes a decided mistake and does lamarck
a great injustice in his zology where he states lamarck in
agreement with the then prevailing conceptions regarded the animal
kingdom as a series grading from the lowest primitive animal up to man
p 26 and again on the next page he speaks of the theory of
geoffroy sthilaire and lamarck as having in it as a fundamental
error the doctrine of the serial arrangement of the animal world
english trans hertwig is in error and could never have carefully
read what lamarck did say or have known that he was the first to throw
aside the serial arrangement and to sketch out a genealogical tree

183 the expression sentiment intrieur may be nearly equivalent to
the organic sense of modern psychologists but more probably
corresponds to our word consciousness
184 lamarcks division of animaux sensibles comprises the insects
arachnids crustacea annelids cirrhipedes and molluscs
185 rather a strange view to take as the brain of insects is now
known to be nearly as complex as that of mammals
186 richerand physiologie vol ii p 151
187 as all animals do not have the power of performing voluntary
acts so in like manner instinct is not common to all animals for
those lacking the nervous system also want the organic sense and can
perform no instinctive acts
these imperfect animals are entirely passive they do nothing of
themselves they have no wants and nature as regards them treats them
as she does plants but as they are irritable in their parts the means
which nature employs to maintain their existence enables them to execute
movements which we call actions
it thus appears that lamarck practically regards the lowest animals as
automata but we must remember that the line he draws between animals
with and without a nervous system is an artificial one as some of the
forms which he supposed to be destitute of a nervous system are now
known to possess one
188 it should be noticed that lamarck does not absolutely state that
there are no variations whatever in instinct his words are much less
positive sans offrer de variation notable this dues not exclude
the fact discovered since his time that instincts are more or less
variable thus affording grounds for darwins theory of the origin of
new kinds of instincts from the accidental variation of instincts
professor james otherwise excellent version of lamarcks view is
inexact and misleading when he makes lamarck say that instincts are
perpetuated without variation from one generation to another so long
as the outward conditions of existence remain the same the principles
of psychology vol ii p 678 1890 he leaves out the word notable
the italics are ours farther on p 337 it will be seen that lamarck
acknowledges that in birds and mammals instinct is variable
189 it is interesting to compare with this darwins theory of the
origin of the same animals the flying squirrels and galeopithecus
origin of species 5th edition new york pp 173174 and see how
he invokes the lamarckian factors of change of climate and vegetation
and changing conditions of life to originate the variations before
natural selection can act his account is a mixture of lamarckism with
the added darwinian factors of competition and natural selection we
agree with this view that the change in environment and competition
sets the ball in motion the work being finished by the selective
process the act of springing and the first attempts at flying also
involve strong emotions and mental efforts and it can hardly be denied
that these lamarckian factors came into continual play during the
process of evolution of these flying creatures
190 this sagacious though crude suggestion of the origin of birds and
mammals from the reptiles is now after the lapse of nearly a century
being confirmed by modern morphologists and palontologists

lamarcks theory as to the evolution of man
lamarcks views on the origin of man are contained in his recherches
sur lorganisation des corps vivans 1802 and his philosophie
zoologique published in 1809 we give the following literal
translation in full of the views he presented in 1802 and which were
probably first advanced in lectures to his classes
  as to man his origin his peculiar nature i have already stated
  in this book that i have not kept these subjects in view in making
  these observations his extreme superiority over the other living
  creatures indicates that he is a privileged being who has in common
  with the animals only that which concerns animal life
  in truth we observe a sort of gradation in the intelligence of
  animals like what exists in the gradual improvement of their
  organization and we remark that they have ideas memory that they
  think choose love hate that they are susceptible of jealousy
  and that by different inflexions of their voice and by signs they
  communicate with and understand each other it is not less evident
  that man alone is endowed with reason and that on this account he
  is clearly distinguished from all the other productions of nature
  however were it not for the picture that so many celebrated men
  have drawn of the weakness and lack of human reason were it not
  that independently of all the freaks into which the passions of man
  almost constantly allure him the ignorance which makes him the
  opinionated slave of custom and the continual dupe of those who wish
  to deceive him were it not that his reason has led him into the
  most revolting errors since we actually see him so debase himself
  as to worship animals even the meanest of addressing to them his
  prayers and of imploring their aid were it not i say for these
  considerations should we feel authorized to raise any doubts as to
  the excellence of this special light which is the attribute of man
  an observation which has for a long time struck me is that having
  remarked that the habitual use and exercise of an organ
  proportionally develops its size and functions as the lack of
  employment weakens in the same proportion its power and even more
  or less completely atrophies it i am apprised that of all the
  organs of mans body which is the most strongly submitted to this
  influence that is to say in which the effects of exercise and of
  habitual use are the most considerable is it not the organ of
  thoughtin a word is it not the brain of man
  compare the extraordinary difference existing in the degree of
  intelligence of a man who rarely exercises his powers of thought
  who has always been accustomed to see but a small number of things
  only those related to his ordinary wants and to his limited desires
  who at no time thinks about these same objects because he is
  obliged to occupy himself incessantly with providing for these same
  wants finally who has few ideas because his attention
  continually fixed on the same things makes him notice nothing that
  he makes no comparisons that he is in the very heart of nature
  without knowing it that he looks upon it almost in the same way as
  do the beasts and that all that surrounds him is nothing to him
  compare i say the intelligence of this individual with that of the
  man who prepared at the outset by education has contracted the
  useful practice of exercising the organ of his thought in devoting
  himself to the study of the principal branches of knowledge who
  observes and compares everything he sees and which affects him who
  forgets himself in examining everything he can see who insensibly
  accustoms himself to judge of everything for himself instead of
  giving a blind assent to the authority of others finally who
  stimulated by reverses and especially by injustice quietly rises by
  reflection to the causes which have produced all that we observe
  both in nature and in human society then you will appreciate how
  enormous is the difference between the intelligence of the two men
  in question
  if newton bacon montesquieu voltaire and so many other men have
  done honor to the human species by the extent of their intelligence
  and their genius how nearly does the mass of brutish ignorant men
  approach the animal becoming a prey to the most absurd prejudices
  and constantly enslaved by their habits this mass forming the
  majority of all nations
  search deeply the facts in the comparison i have just made you
  will see how in one part the organ which serves for acts of thought
  is perfected and acquires greater size and power owing to sustained
  and varied exercise especially if this exercise offers no more
  interruptions than are necessary to prevent the exhaustion of its
  powers and on the other hand you will perceive how the
  circumstances which prevent an individual from exercising this
  organ or from exercising it habitually only while considering a
  small number of objects which are always of the same nature impede
  the development of his intellectual faculties
  after what i have just stated as to the results in man of a slight
  exercise of the organ by which he thinks we shall no longer be
  astonished to see that in the nations which have come to be the most
  distinguished because there is among them a small number of men who
  have been able by observation and reflection to create or advance
  the higher sciences the multitude in these same nations have not
  been for all that exempted from the most absurd errors and have not
  the less always been the dupe of impostors and victims of their
  prejudices
  such is in fact the fatality attached to the destiny of man that
  with the exception of a small number of individuals who live under
  favorable though special circumstances the multitude forced to
  continually busy itself with providing for its needs remains
  permanently deprived of the knowledge which it should acquire in
  general exercises to a very slight extent the organ of its
  intelligence preserves and propagates a multitude of prejudices
  which enslave it and cannot be as happy as those who guiding it
  are themselves guided by reason and justice
  as to the animals besides the fact that they in descending order
  have the brain less developed they are otherwise proportionally
  more limited in the means of exercising and of varying their
  intellectual processes they each exercise them only on a single or
  on some special points on which they become more or less expert
  according to their species and while their degree of organization
  remains the same and the nature of their needs besoins does not
  vary they can never extend the scope of their intelligence nor
  apply it to other objects than to those which are related to their
  ordinary needs
  some among them whose structure is a little more perfect than in
  others have also greater means of varying and extending their
  intellectual faculties but it is always within limits circumscribed
  by their necessities and habits
  the power of habit which is found to be still so great in man
  especially in one who has but slightly exercised the organ of his
  thought is among animals almost insurmountable while their physical
  state remains the same nothing compels them to vary their powers
  because they suffice for their wants and these require no change
  hence it is constantly the same objects which exercise their degree
  of intelligence and it results that these actions are always the
  same in each species
  the sole acts of variation ie the only acts which rise above
  the limits of habits and which we see performed in animals whose
  organization allows them to are acts of imitation i only speak
  of actions which they perform voluntarily or freely actions quils
  font de leur plein gr
  birds very limited in this respect in the powers which their
  structure furnishes can only perform acts of imitation with their
  vocal organ this organ by their habitual efforts to render the
  sounds and to vary them becomes in them very perfect thus we know
  that several birds the parrot starling raven jay magpie canary
  bird etc imitate the sounds they hear
  the monkeys which are next to man the animals by their structure
  having the best means to this end are most excellent imitators and
  there is no limit to the things they can mimic
  in man infants which are still of the age when simple ideas are
  formed on various subjects and who think but little forming no
  complex ideas are also very good imitators of everything which they
  see or hear
  but if each order of things in animals is dependent on the state
  of organization occurring in each of them which is not doubted
  there is no occasion for thinking that in these same animals the
  order which is superior to all the others in organization is
  proportionally so also in extent of means invariability of actions
  and consequently in intellectual powers
  for example in the mammals which are the most highly organized
  the quadrumana which form a part of them have besides the
  advantages over other mammals a conformation in several of their
  organs which considerably increases their powers which allows of a
  great variability in their actions and which extends and even makes
  predominant their intelligence enabling them to deal with a greater
  variety of objects with which to exercise their brain it will
  doubtless be said but although man may be a true mammal in his
  general structure and although among the mammals the quadrumana
  are most nearly allied to him this will not be denied not only
  that man is strongly distinguished from the quadrumana by a great
  superiority of intelligence but he is also very considerably so in
  several structural features which characterize him
  first the occipital foramen being situated entirely at the base of
  the cranium of man and not carried up behind as in the other
  vertebrates causes his head to be posed at the extremity of the
  vertebral column as on a pivot not bowed down forward his face not
  looking towards the ground this position of the head of man who
  can easily turn it to different sides enables him to see better a
  larger number of objects at one time than the much inclined
  position of the head of other mammals allows them to see
  secondly the remarkable mobility of the fingers of the hand of
  man which he employs either all together or several together or
  each separately according to his pleasure and besides the sense
  of touch highly developed at the extremity of these same fingers
  enables him to judge the nature of the bodies which surround him to
  recognize them to make use of themmeans which no other animals
  possess to such a degree
  thirdly by the state of his organization man is able to hold
  himself up and walk erect he has for this attitude which is
  natural to him large muscles at the lower extremities which are
  adapted to this end and it would thus be as difficult to walk
  habitually on his four extremities as it would be for the other
  mammals and even for the quadrumana to walk so habitually erect
  on the soles of their feet
  moreover man is not truly quadrumanous for he has not like the
  monkeys an almost equal facility in using the fingers of his feet
  and of seizing objects with them in the feet of man the thumbs are
  not in opposition to the other fingers to use in grasping as in
  monkeys etc
  i appreciate all these reasons and i see that man although near
  the quadrumana is so distinct that he alone represents a separate
  order belonging to a single genus and species offering however
  many different varieties this order may be if it is desired that
  of the bimana
  however if we consider that all the characteristics which have
  been cited are only differences in degree of structure may we not
  suppose that this special condition of organization of man has been
  gradually acquired at the close of a long period of time with the
  aid of circumstances which have proved favorable195 what a
  subject for reflection for those who have the courage to enter into
  it
  if the quadrumana have not the occipital opening situated
  directly at the base of the cranium as in man it is assuredly much
  less raised posteriorly than in the dog cat and all the other
  mammals thus they all may quite often stand erect although this
  attitude for them is very irksome
  i have not observed the situation of the occipital opening of the
  jacko or orangoutang simia satyrus l but as i know that this
  animal almost habitually walks erect though it has no strength in
  its legs i suppose that the occipital foramen is not situated so
  far from the base of the skull as in the other quadrumana
  the head of the negro less flattened in front than that of the
  european man necessarily has the occipital foramen central
  the more should the jacko contract the habit of walking about the
  less mobility would he have in his toes so that the thumbs of the
  feet which are already much shorter than the other digits would
  gradually cease to be placed in opposition to the other toes and to
  be useful in grasping the muscles of its lower extremities would
  acquire proportionally greater thickness and strength then the
  increased or more frequent exercise of the fingers of its hands
  would develop nervous masses at their extremities thus rendering
  the sense of touch more delicate this is what our train of
  reasoning indicates from the consideration of a multitude of facts
  and observations which support it196
the subject is closed by a quotation from grandpr on the habits of the
chimpanzee it is not of sufficient importance to be here reproduced
seven years after the publication of these views lamarck again returns
to the subject in his philosophie zoologique which we translate
  some observations relative to man
  if man were distinguished from the animals by his structure alone
  it would be easy to show that the structural characters which place
  him with his varieties in a family by himself are all the product
  of former changes in his actions and in the habits which he has
  adopted and which have become special to the individuals of his
  species
  indeed if any race whatever of quadrumana especially the most
  perfect should lose by the necessity of circumstances or from any
  other cause the habit of climbing trees and of seizing the
  branches with the feet as with the hands to cling to them and if
  the individuals of this race during a series of generations should
  be obliged to use their feet only in walking and should cease to
  use their hands as feet there is no doubt from the observations
  made in the preceding chapter that these quadrumana would be
  finally transformed into bimana and that the thumbs of their feet
  would cease to be shorter than the fingers their feet only being of
  use for walking
  moreover if the individuals of which i speak were impelled by the
  necessity of rising up and of looking far and wide of endeavoring
  to stand erect and of adopting this habit constantly from
  generation to generation there is no doubt that their feet would
  gradually and imperceptibly assume a conformation adapted for an
  erect posture that their legs would develop calves and that these
  creatures would not afterwards walk as they do now painfully on
  both hands and feet
  also if these same individuals should cease using their jaws for
  biting in selfdefence tearing or seizing or using them like
  nippers in cutting leaves for food and should they only be used in
  chewing food there is no doubt that their facial angle would become
  higher that their muzzle would become shorter and shorter and that
  in the end this being entirely effaced their incisor teeth would
  become vertical
  now supposing that a race of quadrumana as for example the most
  perfect had acquired by habits constant in every individual the
  structure i have just described and the power of standing erect and
  of walking upright and that as the result of this it had come to
  dominate the other races of animals we should then conceive
  1 that this race farther advanced in its faculties having arrived
  at the stage when it lords it over the others will be spread over
  the surface of the globe in every suitable place
  2 that it will hunt the other higher races of animals and will
  struggle with them for preminence lui disputer les biens de la
  terre and that it will force them to take refuge in regions which
  it does not occupy
  3 that being injured by the great multiplication of closely allied
  races and having banished them into forests or other desert places
  it will arrest the progress of improvement in their faculties while
  its own self the ruler of the region over which it spreads will
  increase in population without hindrance on the part of others and
  living in numerous tribes will in succession create new needs which
  should stimulate industry and gradually render still more perfect
  its means and powers
  4 that finally this preminent race having acquired an absolute
  supremacy over all the others there arose between it and the
  highest animals a difference and indeed a considerable interval
  thus the most perfect race of quadrumana will have been enabled
  to become dominant to change its habits as the result of the
  absolute dominion which it will have assumed over the others and
  with its new needs by progressively acquiring modifications in its
  structure and its new and numerous powers to keep within due limits
  the most highly developed of the other races in the state to which
  they had advanced and to create between it and these last very
  remarkable distinctions
  the angola orang simia troglodytes lin is the highest animal
  it is much more perfect than the orang of the indies simia
  satyrus lin which is called the orangoutang and nevertheless
  as regards their structure they are both very inferior to man in
  bodily faculties and intelligence these animals often stand erect
  but this attitude is not habitual their organization not having
  been sufficiently modified so that standing still station is
  painful for them
  it is known from the accounts of travellers especially in regard
  to the orang of the indies that when immediate danger obliges it to
  fly it immediately falls on all fours this betrays they tell us
  the true origin of this animal since it is obliged to abandon the
  alien unaccustomed partially erect attitude which is thrust upon it
  without doubt this attitude is foreign to it since in its change
  of locality it makes less use of it which shows that its
  organization is less adapted to it but though it has become easier
  for man to stand up straight is the erect posture wholly natural to
  him
  although man who by his habits maintained in the individuals of
  his species during a great series of generations can stand erect
  only while changing from one place to another this attitude is not
  less in his case a condition of fatigue during which he is able to
  maintain himself in an upright position only during a limited time
  and with the aid of the contraction of several of his muscles
  if the vertebral column of the human body should form the axis of
  this body and sustain the head in equilibrium as also the other
  parts the man standing would be in a state of rest but who does
  not know that this is not so that the head is not articulated at
  its centre of gravity that the chest and stomach as also the
  viscera which these cavities contain weigh heavily almost entirely
  on the anterior part of the vertebral column that the latter rests
  on an oblique base etc also as m richerand observes there is
  needed in standing a force active and watching without ceasing to
  prevent the body from falling over the weight and disposition of
  parts tending to make the body fall forward
  after having developed the considerations regarding the standing
  posture of man the same savant then expresses himself the
  relative weight of the head of the thoracic and abdominal viscera
  tends therefore to throw it in front of the line according to which
  all the parts of the body bear down on the ground sustaining it a
  line which should be exactly perpendicular to this ground in order
  that the standing position may be perfect the following fact
  supports this assertion i have observed that infants with a large
  head the stomach protruding and the viscera loaded with fat
  accustom themselves with difficulty to stand up straight and it is
  not until the end of their second year that they dare to surrender
  themselves to their proper forces they stand subject to frequent
  falls and have a natural tendency to revert to the quadrupedal
  state physiologie vol ii p 268
  this disposition of the parts which cause the erect position of
  man being a state of activity and consequently fatiguing instead
  of being a state of rest would then betray in him an origin
  analogous to that of the mammals if his organization alone should
  be taken into consideration
  now in order to follow in all its particulars the hypothesis
  presented in the beginning of these observations it is fitting to
  add the following considerations
  the individuals of the dominant race previously mentioned having
  taken possession of all the inhabitable places which were suitable
  for them and having to a very considerable extent multiplied their
  necessities in proportion as the societies which they formed became
  more numerous were able equally to increase their ideas and
  consequently to feel the need of communicating them to their
  fellows we conceive that there would arise the necessity of
  increasing and of varying in the same proportion the signs adopted
  for the communication of these ideas it is then evident that the
  members of this race would have to make continual efforts and to
  employ every possible means in these efforts to create multiply
  and render sufficiently varied the signs which their ideas and
  their numerous wants would render necessary
  it is not so with any other animals because although the most
  perfect among them such as the quadrumana live mostly in troops
  since the eminent supremacy of the race mentioned they have remained
  stationary as regards the improvement of their faculties having
  been driven out from everywhere and banished to wild desert
  usually restricted regions whither miserable and restless they
  are incessantly constrained to fly and hide themselves in this
  situation these animals no longer contract new needs they acquire
  no new ideas they have but a small number of them and it is always
  the same ones which occupy their attention and among these ideas
  there are very few which they have need of communicating to the
  other individuals of their species there are then only very few
  different signs which they employ among their fellows so that
  some movements of the body or of certain of its parts certain
  hisses and cries raised by the simple inflexions of the voice
  suffice them
  on the contrary the individuals of the dominant race already
  mentioned having had need of multiplying the signs for the rapid
  communication of their ideas now become more and more numerous
  and no longer contented either with pantomimic signs or possible
  inflexions of their voice to represent this multitude of signs now
  become necessary would succeed by different efforts in forming
  articulated sounds at first they would use only a small number
  conjointly with the inflexions of their voice as the result they
  would multiply vary and perfect them according to their
  increasing necessities and according as they would be more
  accustomed to produce them indeed the habitual exercise of their
  throat their tongue and their lips to make articulate sounds will
  have eminently developed in them this faculty
  hence for this particular race the origin of the wonderful power of
  speech and as the distance between the regions where the
  individuals composing it would be spread would favor the corruption
  of the signs fitted to express each idea from this arose the origin
  of languages which must be everywhere diversified
  then in this respect necessities alone would have accomplished
  everything they would give origin to efforts and the organs fitted
  for the articulation of sounds would be developed by their habitual
  use
  such would be the reflections which might be made if man
  considered here as the preminent race in question were
  distinguished from the animals only by his physical characters and
  if his origin were not different from theirs
this is certainly for the time it was written an original
comprehensive and bold attempt at explaining in a tentative way or at
least suggesting the probable origin of man from some arboreal creature
allied to the apes it is as regards the actual evolutional steps
supposed to have been taken by the simian ancestors of man a more
detailed and comprehensive hypothesis than that offered by darwin in his
descent of man197 which lamarck has anticipated darwin does not
refer to this theory of lamarck and seems to have entirely overlooked
it as have others since his time the theory of the change from an
arboreal life and climbing posture to an erect one and the
transformation of the hinder pair of hands into the feet of the erect
human animal remind us of the very probable hypothesis of mr herbert
spencer as to the modification of the quadrumanous posterior pair of
hands to form the plantigrade feet of man

lamarcks thoughts on morals and on the relation between science and
religion
one who has read the writings of the great french naturalist who may be
regarded as the founder of evolution will readily realize that
lamarcks mind was essentially philosophic comprehensive and
synthetic he looked upon every problem in a large way his breadth of
view his moral and intellectual strength his equably developed nature
generous in its sympathies and aspiring in its tendencies naturally led
him to take a conservative position as to the relations between science
and religion he should as may be inferred from his frequent references
to the author of nature be regarded as a deist
when a very young man he was for a time a friend of the erratic and
gifted rousseau and was afterwards not unknown to condorcet the
secretary of the french academy of sciences so liberal in his views and
so bitter an enemy of the church and though constantly in contact with
the radical views and burning questions of that day lamarck throughout
his life preserved his philosophic calm and maintained his lofty tone
and firm temper we find no trace in his writings of sentiments other
than the most elevated and inspiring and we know that in character he
was pure and sweet selfsacrificing selfdenying and free from
selfassertion
the quotations from his philosophie zoologique published in 1809
given below will show what were the results of his meditations on the
relations between science and religion had his way of looking at this
subject prevailed how much misunderstanding and illfeeling between
theologians and savants would have been avoided had his spirit and
breadth of view animated both parties there would not have been the
constant and needless opposition on the part of the church to the grand
results of scientific discovery and philosophy or too hasty dogmatism
and scepticism on the part of some scientists
in lamarck at the opening of the past century we behold the spectacle
of a man devoting over fifty years of his life to scientific research in
biology and insisting on the doctrine of spontaneous generation of the
immense length of geological time so opposed to the views held by the
church the evolution of plants and animals from a single germ and even
the origin of man from the apes yet as earnestly claiming that nature
has its author who in the beginning established the order of things
giving the initial impulse to the laws of the universe
as duval says after quoting the passage given below deux faits son 
noter dans ce passage dune part les termes dignes et conciliants dans
lesquels lamarck tablit la part de la science et de la religion cela
vaut mieux mme en tenant compte des diffrences depoques que les
abjurations de buffon198
the passage quoted by m duval is the following one
  surely nothing exists except by the will of the sublime author of
  all things but can we not assign him laws in the execution of his
  will and determine the method which he has followed in this
  respect has not his infinite power enabled him to create an order
  of things which has successively given existence to all that we see
  as well as to that which exists and that of which we have no
  knowledge as regards the decrees of this infinite wisdom i have
  confined myself to the limits of a simple observer of nature199
in other places we find the following expressions
  there is then for the animals as for the plants an order which
  belongs to nature and which results as also the objects which this
  order makes exist from the power which it has received from the
  supreme author of all things she is herself only the general and
  unchangeable order that this sublime author has created throughout
  and only the totality of the general and special laws to which this
  order is subject by these means whose use it continues without
  change it has given and will perpetually give existence to its
  productions it varies and renews them unceasingly and thus
  everywhere preserves the whole order which is the result of
  it200
                                   
  to regard nature as eternal and consequently as having existed
  from all time is to me an abstract idea baseless limitless
  improbable and not satisfactory to my reason being unable to know
  anything positive in this respect and having no means of reasoning
  on this subject i much prefer to think that all nature is only a
  result hence i suppose and i am glad to admit it a first cause
  in a word a supreme power which has given existence to nature and
  which has made it in all respects what it is201
                                   
  nature that immense totality of different beings and bodies in
  every part of which exists an eternal circle of movements and
  changes regulated by law totality alone unchangeable so long as it
  pleases its sublime author to cause its existence should be
  regarded as a whole constituted by its parts for a purpose which
  its author alone knows and not exclusively for any one of them
  each part is necessarily obliged to change and to cease to be one
  in order to constitute another with interests opposed to those of
  all and if it has the power of reasoning it finds this whole
  imperfect in reality however this whole is perfect and completely
  fulfils the end for which it was designed202
lamarcks work on general philosophy203 was written near the end of
his life in 1820 he begins his discours prliminaire by referring to
the sudden loss of his eyesight his work on the invertebrate animals
being thereby interrupted the book was he says rapidly dictated to
his daughter and the ease with which he dictated was due he says to
his longcontinued habit of meditating on the facts he had observed
in the principes primordiaux he considers man as the only being who
has the power of observing nature and the only one who has perceived
the necessity of recognizing a superior and only cause creator of the
order of the wonders of the world of life by this he is led to raise
his thoughts to the supreme author of all that exists
  in the creation of his works and especially those we can observe
  this omnipotent being has undoubtedly been the ruling power in
  pursuing the method which has pleased him namely his will has
  been
  either to create instantaneously and separately every particular
  living being observed by us to personally care for and watch over
  them in all their changes their movements or their actions to
  unremittingly care for each one separately and by the exercise of
  his supreme will to regulate all their life
  or to reduce his creations to a small number and among these to
  institute an order of things general and continuous pervaded by
  ceaseless activity mouvement especially subject to laws by
  means of which all the organisms of whatever nature all the changes
  they undergo all the peculiarities they present and all the
  phenomena that many of them exhibit may be produced
  in regard to these two modes of execution if observation taught us
  nothing we could not form any opinion which would be well grounded
  but it is not so we distinctly see that there exists an order of
  things truly created vritablement cr as unchangeable as its
  author allows acting on matter alone and which possesses the power
  of producing all visible beings of executing all the changes all
  the modifications even the extinctions so also the renewals or
  recreations that we observe among them it is to this order of
  things that we have given the name of nature the supreme author
  of all that exists is then the immediate creator of matter as also
  of nature but he is only indirectly the creator of what nature can
  produce
  the end that god has proposed to himself in creating matter which
  forms the basis of all bodies and nature which divides divise
  this matter forms the bodies makes them vary modifies them
  changes them and renews them in different ways can be easily known
  to us for the supreme being cannot meet with any obstacle to his
  will in the execution of his works the general results of these
  works are necessarily the object he had in view thus this end could
  be no other than the existence of nature of which matter alone
  forms the sphere and should not be that causing the creation of any
  special being
  do we find in the two objects created ie matter and
  nature the source of the good and evil which have almost always
  been thought to exist in the events of this world to this question
  i shall answer that good and evil are only relative to particular
  objects that they never affect by their temporary existence the
  general result expected prvu and that for the end which the
  creator designed there is in reality neither good nor evil because
  everything in nature perfectly fulfils its object
  has god limited his creations to the existence of only matter and
  nature this question is vain and should remain without an answer
  on our part because being reduced to knowing anything only through
  observation and to bodies alone also to what concerns them these
  being for us the only observable objects it would be rash to speak
  affirmatively or negatively on this subject
  what is a spiritual being it is what with the aid of the
  imagination one would naturally suppose lon vaudra supposer
  indeed it is only by means of opposing that which is material that
  we can form the idea of spirit but as this hypothetical being is
  not in the category of objects which it is possible for us to
  observe we do not know how to take cognizance of it the idea that
  we have of it is absolutely without base
  we only know physical objects and only objects relative to these
  beings tres such is the condition of our nature if our
  thoughts our reasonings our principles have been considered as
  metaphysical objects these objects then are not beings tres
  they are only relations or consequences of relations rapports
  or only results of observed laws
  we know that relations are distinguished as general and special
  among these last are regarded those of nature form dimension
  solidity size quantity resemblance and difference and if we add
  to these objects the being observed and the consideration of known
  laws as also that of conventional objects we shall have all the
  materials on which our thoughts are based
  thus being able to observe only the phenomena of nature as well as
  the laws which regulate these phenomena also the products of these
  last in a word only bodies corps and what concerns them all
  that which immediately proceeds from supreme power is
  incomprehensible to us as it itself ie supreme power is to
  our minds to create or to make anything out of nothing this is an
  idea we cannot conceive of for the reason that in all that we can
  know we do not find any model which represents it god alone then
  can create while nature can only produce we must suppose that in
  his creations the divinity is not restricted to the use of any
  time while on the other hand nature can effect nothing without
  the aid of long periods of time
without translating more of this remarkable book which is very rare
much less known than the philosophie zoologique the spirit of the
remainder may be imagined from the foregoing extracts
the author refers to the numerous evils resulting from ignorance false
knowledge lack of judgment abuse of power demonstrating the necessity
of our confining ourselves within the circle of the objects presented by
nature and never to go beyond them if we do not wish to fall into
error because the profound study of nature and of the organization of
man alone and the exact observation of facts alone will reveal to us
the truths most important for us to know in order to avoid the
vexations the perfidies the injustices and the oppressions of all
sorts and incalculable disorders which arise in the social body in
this way only shall we discover and acquire the means of obtaining the
enjoyment of the advantages which we have a right to expect from our
state of civilization the author endeavors to state what science can
and should render to society he dwells on the sources from which man
has drawn the knowledge which he possesses and from which he can obtain
many otherssources the totality of which constitutes for him the field
of realities
lamarck also in this work has built up a system for moral philosophy
selflove he says perfectly regulated gives rise
1 to moral force which characterizes the laborious man so that the
length and difficulties of a useful work do not repel him
2 to the courage of him who knowing the danger exposes himself when
he sees that this would be useful
3 to love of wisdom
wisdom according to lamarck consists in the observance of a certain
number of rules or virtues these we cite in a slightly abridged form
love of truth in all things the need of improving ones mind
moderation in desires decorum in all actions a wise reserve in
unessential wants indulgence toleration humanity good will towards
all men love of the public good and of all that is necessary to our
fellows contempt for weakness a kind of severity towards ones self
which preserves us from that multitude of artificial wants enslaving
those who give up to them resignation and if possible moral
impassibility in suffering reverses injustices oppression and losses
respect for order for public institutions civil authorities laws
morality and religion
the practice of these maxims and virtues says lamarck characterizes
true philosophy
and it may be added that no one practised these virtues more than
lamarck like cuviers his life was blameless and though he lived a
most retired life and was not called upon to fill any public station
other than his chair of zology at the jardin des plantes we may feel
sure that he had the qualities of courage independence and patriotism
which would have rendered such a career most useful to his country
as bourguin eloquently asserts lamarck was the brave man who never
deserted a dangerous post the laborious man who never hesitated to meet
any difficulty the investigating spirit firm in his convictions
tolerant of the opinions of others the simple man moderate in all
things the enemy of weakness devoted to the public good imperturbable
under the attaints of fortune of suffering and of unjust and
passionate attacks

the relations between lamarckism and darwinism neolamarckism
since the appearance of darwins origin of species and after the
great naturalist had converted the world to a belief in the general
doctrine of evolution there has arisen in the minds of many working
naturalists a conviction that natural selection or darwinism as such
is only one of other evolutionary factors while there are some who
entirely reject the selective principle darwin moreover assumed a
tendency to fortuitous variation and did not attempt to explain its
cause fully persuaded that he had discovered the most efficient and
practically sole cause of the origin of species he carried the doctrine
to its extreme limits and after over twenty years of observation and
experiment along this single line pushing entirely aside the
erasmusdarwin and lamarckian factors of change of environment though
occasionally acknowledging the value of use and disuse he triumphantly
broke over all opposition and lived to see his doctrine generally
accepted he had besides the support of some of the strongest men in
science wallace in a twin paper advocated the same views spencer
lyell huxley hooker haeckel bates semper wyman gray leidy and
other representative men more or less endorsed darwins views or at
least some form of evolution and owing largely to their efforts in
scientific circles and in the popular press the doctrine of descent
rapidly permeated every avenue of thought and became generally accepted
meanwhile the general doctrine of evolution thus proved and the
survival of the fittest an accomplished fact the next step was to
ascertain how as cope asked the fittest originated it was felt by
some that natural selection alone was not adequate to explain the first
steps in the origin of genera families orders classes and branches
or phyla it was perceived by some that natural selection by itself was
not a vera causa an efficient agent but was passive and rather
expressed the results of the operations of a series of factors the
transforming should naturally precede the action of the selective
agencies
we were then in our quest for the factors of organic evolution
obliged to fall back on the action of the physicochemical forces such
as light or its absence heat cold change of climate and the
physiological agencies of food or in other words on changes in the
physical environment as well as in the biological environment lamarck
was the first one who owing to his many years training in systematic
botany and zology and his philosophic breadth had stated more fully
and authoritatively than any one else the results of changes in the
action of the primary factors of evolution hence a return on the part
of many in europe and especially in america to lamarckism or its
modern form neolamarckism lamarck had already so far as he could
without a knowledge of modern morphology embryology cytology and
histology suggested those fundamental principles of transformism on
which rests the selective principle
had his works been more accessible or where available more carefully
read and his views more fairly represented had he been favored in his
lifetime by a single supporter rather than been unjustly criticised by
cuvier science would have made more rapid progress for it is an
axiomatic truth that the general acceptance of a working evolutionary
theory has given a vast impetus to biology
we will now give a brief historical summary of the history of opinion
held by lamarckians regarding the causes of the origin of the fittest
the rise of variations and the appearance of a population of plant and
animal forms sufficiently extensive and differentiated to allow for the
play of the competitive forces and of the more passive selective
agencies which began to operate in precambrian times or as soon as the
earth became fitted for the existence of living beings
the first writer after lamarck to work along the lines he laid down was
mr herbert spencer in 186671 in his epochal and remarkably
suggestive principles of biology the doctrine of use and disuse is
implicated in his statements as to the effects of motion on structure in
general204 and in his theory as to the origin of the notochord and
of the segmentation of the vertebral column and the segmental
arrangement of the muscles by muscular strains205 he laid the
foundations for future work along this line he also drew attention in
the same work to the complementary development of parts and likewise
instanced the decreased size of the jaws in the civilized races of
mankind as a change not accounted for by the natural selection of
favorable variations206 in fact this work is largely based on the
lamarckian principles as affording the basis for the action of natural
selection and thirty years later we find him affirming the direct
action of the medium was the primordial factor of organic
evolution207 in his wellknown essay on the inadequacy of natural
selection 1893 the great philosopher with his accustomed vigor and
force criticises the arguments of those who rely too exclusively on
darwinism alone and especially neodarwinism as a sufficient factor to
account for the origin of special structures as well as species
the first german author to appreciate the value of the lamarckian
factors was that fertile and comprehensive philosopher and investigator
ernst haeckel who also harmonized lamarckism and darwinism in these
words
  we should on account of the grand proofs just enumerated have to
  adopt lamarcks theory of descent for the explanation of biological
  phenomena even if we did not possess darwins theory of selection
  the one is so completely and directly proved by the other and
  established by mechanical causes that there remains nothing to be
  desired the laws of inheritance and adaptation are universally
  acknowledged physiological facts the former traceable to
  propagation the latter to the nutrition of organisms on the
  other hand the struggle for existence is a biological fact
  which with mathematical necessity follows from the general
  disproportion between the average number of organic individuals and
  the numerical excess of their germs208
a number of american naturalists at about the same date as the result
of studies in different directions unbiassed by a too firm belief in
the efficacy of natural selection and relying on the inductive method
alone worked away at the evidence in favor of the primary factors of
evolution along lamarckian lines though quite independently for at
first neither hyatt nor cope had read lamarcks writings
in 1866 professor a hyatt published the first of a series of classic
memoirs on the genetic relations of the fossil cephalopods his labors
so rich in results have now been carried on for forty years and are
supplemented by careful prolonged work on the sponges on the tertiary
shells of steinheim and on the land shells of the hawaiian islands
his first paper was on the parallelism between the different stages of
life in the individual and those of the ammonites carrying out
dorbignys discovery of embryonic youthful adult and oldage stages
in ammonites209 and showing that these forms are due to an
acceleration of growth in the mature forms and a retardation in the
senile forms
in a memoir on the biological relations of the jurassic
ammonites210 he assigns the causes of the progressive changes in
these forms the origination of new genera and the production of young
mature and senile forms to the favorable nature of the physical
surroundings primarily producing characteristic changes which become
perpetuated and increased by inheritance within the group
the study of the modifications of the tertiary forms of planorbis at
steinheim begun by hilgendorf led among others nine in all to the
following conclusions
  first that the unsymmetrical spiral forms of the shells of these
  and of all the mollusca probably resulted from the action of the
  laws of heredity modified by gravitation
  second that there are many characteristics in these shells and in
  other groups which are due solely to the uniform action of the
  physical influence of the immediate surroundings varying with every
  change of locality but constant and uniform within each locality
  third that the darwinian law of natural selection does not explain
  these relations but applies only to the first stages in the
  establishment of the differences between forms or species in the
  same locality that its office is to fix these in the organization
  and bring them within the reach of the laws of heredity
these views we find reiterated in his later palontological papers
hyatts views on acceleration were adopted by neumayr211 waagen212
from his studies on the jurassic cephalopods concludes that the factors
in the evolution of these forms were changes in external conditions
geographical isolation competition and that the fundamental law was
not that of darwin but the law of development hyatt has also shown
that at first evolution was rapid the evolution is a purely mechanical
problem in which the action of the habitat is the working agent of all
the major changes first acting upon the adult stages as a rule and
then through heredity upon the earlier stages in successive
generations he also shows that as the primitive forms migrated and
occupied new before barren areas where they met with new conditions
the organisms changed their habits and structures rapidly to accord
with these new conditions213
while the palontological facts afford complete and abundant proofs of
the modifying action of changes in the environment hyatt in 1877 from
his studies on sponges214 shows that the origin of their endless
forms can only be explained by the action of physical surroundings
directly working upon the organization and producing by such direct
action the modifications or common variations above described
mr a agassiz remarks that the effect of the nature of the bottom of
the sea on sponges and rhizopods is an allimportant factor in
modifying the organism215
while hyatts studies were chiefly on the ammonites molluscs and
existing sponges cope was meanwhile at work on the batrachians his
origin of genera appeared shortly after hyatts first paper but in
the same year 1866 this was followed by a series of remarkably
suggestive essays based on his extensive palontological work which are
in part reprinted in his origin of the fittest 1887 while in his
epochmaking book the primary factors of organic evolution 1896 we
have in a condensed shape a clear exposition of some of the lamarckian
factors in their modern neolamarckian form
in the introduction p 9 he remarks
  in these papers by professor hyatt and myself is found the first
  attempt to show by concrete examples of natural taxonomy that the
  variations that result in evolution are not multifarious or
  promiscuous but definite and direct contrary to the method which
  seeks no origin for variations other than natural selection in
  other words these publications constitute the first essays in
  systematic evolution that appeared by the discovery of the
  paleontologic succession of modifications of the articulations of
  the vertebrate and especially mammalian skeleton i first
  furnished an actual demonstration of the reality of the lamarckian
  factor of use or motion as friction impact and strain as an
  efficient cause of evolution216
the discussion in copes work of kinetogenesis or of the effects of use
and disuse affords an extensive series of facts in support of these
factors of lamarcks as these two books are accessible to every one we
need only refer the reader to them as storehouses of facts bearing on
neolamarckism
the present writer from a study of the development and anatomy of
limulus and of arthropod ancestry was early 1870217 led to adopt
lamarckian views in preference to the theory of natural selection which
never seemed to him adequate or sufficiently comprehensive to explain
the origin of variations
in the following year218 from a study of the insects and other
animals of mammoth cave we claimed that the characters separating the
genera and species of animals are those inherited from adults modified
by their physical surroundings and adaptations to changing conditions of
life inducing certain alterations in parts which have been transmitted
with more or less rapidity and become finally fixed and habitual
in an essay entitled the ancestry of insects219 1873 we adopted
the lamarckian factors of change of habits and environment of use and
disuse to account for the origin of the appendages while we attributed
the origin of the metamorphoses of insects to change of habits or of the
temperature of the seasons and of climates particularly the change in
the earths climates from the earlier ages of the globe when the
temperature of the earth was nearly the same the world over to the
times of the present distribution of heat and cold in zones
from further studies on cave animals published in 1877220 we wrote
as follows
  in the production of these cave species the exceptional phenomena
  of darkness want of sufficient food and unvarying temperature
  have been plainly enough ver caus to say that the principle of
  natural selection accounts for the change of structure is no
  explanation of the phenomena the phrase has to the mind of the
  writer no meaning in connection with the production of these cave
  forms and has as little meaning in accounting for the origination
  of species and genera in general darwins phrase natural
  selection or herbert spencers term survival of the fittest
  expresses simply the final result while the process of the
  origination of the new forms which have survived or been selected
  by nature is to be explained by the action of the physical
  environments of the animals coupled with inheritanceforce it has
  always appeared to the writer that the phrases quoted above have
  been misused to state the cause when they simply express the result
  of the action of a chain of causes which we may with herbert
  spencer call the environment of the organism undergoing
  modification and thus a form of lamarckianism greatly modified by
  recent scientific discoveries seems to meet most of the
  difficulties which arise in accounting for the origination of
  species and higher groups of organisms certainly natural
  selection or the survival of the fittest is not a vera causa
  though the struggle for existence may show us the causes which
  have led to the preservation of species while changes in the
  environment of the organism may satisfactorily account for the
  original tendency to variation assumed by mr darwin as the
  startingpoint where natural selection begins to act
in our work on the cave animals of north america221 after stating
that darwin in his origin of species attributed the loss of eyes
wholly to disuse remarking p 142 that after the more or less
perfect obliteration of the eyes natural selection will often have
effected other changes such as an increase in the length of the antenn
or palpi as a compensation for blindness we then summed up as follows
the causes of the production of cave faun in general
  1 change in environment from light even partial to twilight or
  total darkness and involving diminution of food and compensation
  for the loss of certain organs by the hypertrophy of others
  2 disuse of certain organs
  3 adaptation enabling the more plastic forms to survive and
  perpetuate their stock
  4 isolation preventing intercrossing with outofdoor forms
  thus insuring the permanency of the new varieties species or
  genera
  5 heredity operating to secure for the future the permanence of
  the newly originated forms as long as the physical conditions remain
  the same
  natural selection perhaps expresses the total result of the working
  of these five factors rather than being an efficient cause in
  itself or at least constitutes the last term in a series of causes
  hence lamarckism in a modern form or as we have termed it
  neolamarckism seems to us to be nearer the truth than darwinism
  proper or natural selection222
in an attempt to apply lamarcks principle of the origin of the spines
and horns of caterpillars and other insects as well as other animals to
the result of external stimuli223 we had not then read what he says
on the subject see p 316 having however been led to examine into
the matter from the views held by recent observers especially henslow
and it appearing that lamarck was substantially correct in supposing
that the blood his fluids would flow to parts on the exposed
portions of the body and thus cause the origin of horns on the
principle of the saying ubi irritatio ibi affluxus we came to the
following conclusions
  the lamarckian factors 1 change both direct and indirect in the
  milieu 2 need and 3 habit and the now generally adopted
  principle that a change of function induces change in organs224
  and in some or many cases actually induces the hypertrophy and
  specialization of what otherwise would be indifferent parts or
  organsthese factors are allimportant in the evolution of the
  colors ornaments and outgrowths from the cuticle of caterpillars
our present views as to the relations between the lamarckian factors and
the darwinian one of natural selection are shown by the following
summary at the end of this essay
  1 the more prominent tubercles and spines or bristles arising
  from them are hypertrophied piliferous warts the warts with the
  seta or hair which they bear being common to all caterpillars
  2 the hypertrophy or enlargement was probably we should rather
  say possibly primarily due to a change of station from herbs to
  trees involving better air a more equable temperature perhaps a
  different and better food
  3 the enlarged and specialized tubercles developed more rapidly on
  certain segments than on others especially the more prominent
  segments because the nutritive fluids would tend more freely to
  supply parts most exposed to external stimuli
  4 the stimuli were in great part due to the visits of insects and
  birds resulting in a mimicry of the spines and projections on the
  trees the colors lines and spots were due to light or shade
  with the general result of protective mimicry or adaptation to
  treelife
  5 as the result of some unknown factor some of the hypodermic
  cells at the base of the spines became in certain forms specialized
  so as to secrete a poisonous fluid
  6 after such primitive forms members of different families had
  become established on trees a process of arboreal segregation or
  isolation would set in and intercrossing with lowfeeders would
  cease
  7 heredity or the unknown factors of which heredity is the
  result would go on uninterruptedly the result being a succession
  of generations perfectly adapted to arboreal life
  8 finally the conservative agency of natural selection operates
  constantly tending towards the preservation of the new varieties
  species and genera and would not cease to act in a given
  direction so long as the environment remained the same
  9 thus in order to account for the origin of a species genus
  family order or even a class the first steps causing the
  origination of variations were in the beginning due to the primary
  direct and indirect factors of evolution neolamarckism and the
  final stages were due to the secondary factors segregation and
  natural selection darwinism
from a late essay225 we take the following extracts explaining our
views
  in seeking to explain the causes of a metamorphosis in animals one
  is compelled to go back to the primary factors of organic
  evolution such as the change of environment whether the factors be
  cosmical gravity physical changes in temperature effects of
  increased or diminished light and shade under or overnutrition
  and the changes resulting from the presence or absence of enemies
  or from isolation the action of these factors whether direct or
  indirect is obvious when we try to explain the origin or causes of
  the more marked metamorphoses of animals then come in the other
  lamarckian factors of use and disuse new needs resulting in new
  modes of life habits or functions which bring about the
  origination development and perfection of new organs as in new
  species and genera etc or which in metamorphic forms may result
  in a greater increase in the number of and an exaggeration of the
  features characterizing the stages of larval life
  vi the adequacy of neolamarckism
  it is not to be denied that in many instances all through the
  ceaseless operation of these fundamental factors there is going on a
  process of sifting or of selection of forms best adapted to their
  surroundings and best fitted to survive but this factor though
  important is quite subordinate to the initial causes of variation
  and of metamorphic changes
  neolamarckism226 as we understand this doctrine has for its
  foundation a combination of the factors suggested by the buffon and
  geoffroy st hilaire school which insisted on the direct action of
  the milieu and of lamarck who relied both on the direct plants
  and lowest animals and on the indirect action of the environment
  adding the important factors of need and of change of habits
  resulting either in the atrophy or in the development of organs by
  disuse or use with the addition of the hereditary transmission of
  characters acquired in the lifetime of the individual
  lamarcks views owing to the early date of his work which was
  published in 1809 before the foundation of the sciences of
  embryology cytology palontology zogeography and in short all
  that distinguishes modern biology were necessarily somewhat crude
  though the fundamental factors he suggested are those still invoked
  by all thinkers of lamarckian tendencies
  neolamarckism gathers up and makes use of the factors both of the
  st hilaire and lamarckian schools as containing the more
  fundamental causes of variation and adds those of geographical
  isolation or segregation wagner and gulick the effects of
  gravity the effects of currents of air and of water of fixed or
  sedentary as opposed to active modes of life the results of strains
  and impacts ryder cope and osborn the principle of change of
  function as inducing the formation of new structures dohrn the
  effects of parasitism commensalism and of symbiosisin short the
  biological environment together with geological extinction natural
  and sexual selection and hybridity
  it is to be observed that the neolamarckian in relying mainly on
  these factors does not overlook the value of natural selection as a
  guiding principle and which began to act as soon as the world
  became stocked with the initial forms of life but he simply seeks
  to assign this principle to its proper position in the hierarchy of
  factors
  natural selection as the writer from the first has insisted is
  not a vera causa an initial or impelling cause in the origination
  of new species and genera it does not start the ball in motion it
  only so to speak guides its movements down this or that incline
  it is the expression like that of the survival of the fittest of
  herbert spencer of the results of the combined operation of the
  more fundamental factors in certain cases we cannot see any room
  for its action in some others we cannot at present explain the
  origin of species in any other way its action increased in
  proportion as the world became more and more crowded with diverse
  forms and when the struggle for existence had become more unceasing
  and intense it certainly cannot account for the origination of the
  different branches classes or orders of organized beings it in
  the main simply corresponds to artificial selection in the latter
  case man selects forms already produced by domestication the
  latter affording sports and varieties due to change in the
  surroundings that is soil climate food and other physical
  features as well as education
  in the case also of heredity which began to operate as soon as the
  earliest life forms appeared we have at the outset to invoke the
  principle of the heredity of characters acquired during the lifetime
  of lowest organisms
  finally it is noticeable that when one is overmastered by the
  dogma of natural selection he is apt perhaps unconsciously to give
  up all effort to work out the factors of evolution or to seek to
  work out this or that cause of variation trusting too implicitly to
  the supposed vera causa one may close his eyes to the effects of
  change of environment or to the necessity of constant attempts to
  discover the real cause of this or that variation the reduction or
  increase in size of this or that organ or become insensible to the
  value of experiments were the dogma of natural selection to become
  universally accepted further progress would cease and biology
  would tend to relapse into a stage of atrophy and degeneration on
  the other hand a revival of lamarckism in its modern form and a
  critical and doubting attitude towards natural selection as an
  efficient cause will keep alive discussion and investigation and
  especially if resort be had to experimentation will carry up to a
  higher plane the status of philosophical biology
although now the leader of the neodarwinians and fully assured of the
allsufficiency of natural selection the veteran biologist weismann
whose earlier works were such epochmaking contributions to insect
embryology was when active as an investigator a strong advocate of
the lamarckian factors in his masterly work studies in the theory of
descent227 1875 although accepting darwins principle of natural
selection he also relied on the transforming influence of direct
action as upheld by lamarck although he adds its extent cannot as
yet be estimated with any certainty he concluded from his studies in
seasonal dimorphism that differences of specific value can originate
through the direct action of external conditions of life only while
conceding that sexual selection plays a very important part in the
markings and coloring of butterflies he adds that a change produced
directly by climate may be still further increased by sexual selection
he also inquired into the origin of variability and held that it can be
elucidated by seasonal dimorphism he thus formulated the chief results
of his investigations a species is only caused to change through the
influence of changing external conditions of life this change being in
a fixed direction which entirely depends on the physical nature of the
varying organism and is different in different species or even in the
two sexes of the same species
the influence of changes of climate on variation has been studied to
especial advantage in north america owing to its great extent and to
the fact that its territory ranges from the polar to the tropical
regions and from the atlantic to the pacific ocean as respects
climatic variation in birds professor baird first took up the inquiry
which was greatly extended with especial relation to the formation of
local varieties by dr j a allen228 who was the first to ascertain
by careful measurements and by a study of the difference in plumage and
pelage of individuals inhabiting distant portions of a common habitat
the variations due to climatic and local causes
that varieties he says may and do arise by the action of climatic
influences and pass on to become species and that species become in
like manner differentiated into genera is abundantly indicated by the
facts of geographical distribution and the obvious relation of local
forms to the conditions of environment the present more or less
unstable condition of the circumstances surrounding organic beings
together with the known mutations of climate our planet has undergone in
past geological ages point clearly to the agency of physical conditions
as one of the chief factors in the evolution of new forms of life so
long as the environing conditions remain stable just so long will
permanency of character be maintained but let changes occur however
gradual or minute and differentiations begin he inclines to regard
the modifications as due rather to the direct action of the conditions
of environment than to the roundabout process of natural selection
he also admits that change of habits and food use and disuse are
factors
the same kind of inquiry though on far less complete data was extended
by the present writer229 in 1873 to the moths careful measurements of
twentyfive species of geometrid moths common to the atlantic and
pacific coasts of north america showing that there is an increase in
size and variation in shape of the wings and in some cases in color in
the pacific coast over eastern or atlantic coast individuals of the same
species the differences being attributed to the action of climatic
causes the same law holds good in the few notodontian moths common to
both sides of our continent similar studies the results depending on
careful measurements of many individuals have recently been made by
c h eigenmann 189596 w j moenkhaus 1896 and h c bumpus
189698
the discoveries of owen gaudry huxley kowalevsky cope marsh
filhol osborn scott wortmann and many others abundantly prove that
the lines of vertebrate descent must have been the result of the action
of the primary factors of organic evolution including the principles of
migration isolation and competition the selective principle being
secondary and preservative rather than originative
important contributions to dynamic evolution or kinetogenesis are the
essays of cope ryder dall osborn jackson scott and wortmann
ryder began in 1877 to publish a series of remarkably suggestive essays
on the mechanical genesis through strains of the vertebrate limbs
and teeth including the causes of the reduction of digits in
discussing the origin of the great development of the incisor teeth of
rodents he suggested that the more severe strains to which they were
subjected by enforced or intelligently assumed changes of habit were
the initiatory agents in causing them to assume their present forms
such forms as were best adapted to resist the greatest strains without
breaking230
he afterwards231 claimed that the articulations of the cartilaginous
finrays of the trout salmo fontinalis are due to the mechanical
strains experienced by the rays in use as motors of the body of the fish
in the water
in the line of inquiry opened up by cope and by ryder are the essays of
osborn232 on the mechanical causes for the displacement of the
elements of the feet in the mammals and the phylogeny of the teeth
also professor w b scott thus expresses the results of his
studies233
  to sum up the results of our examination of certain series of
  fossil mammals one sees clearly that transformation whether in the
  way of the addition of new parts or the reduction of those already
  present acts just as if the direct action of the environment and
  the habits of the animal were the efficient cause of the change and
  any explanation which excludes the direct action of such agencies is
  confronted by the difficulty of an immense number of the most
  striking coincidences so far as i can see the theory of
  determinate variations and of useinheritance is not antagonistic
  but supplementary to natural selection the latter theory attempting
  no explanation of the causes of variation nor is it pretended for
  a moment that use and disuse are the sole or even the chief factors
  in variation
as early as 1868 the lamarckian factor of isolation due to migration
into new regions was greatly extended and shown by moritz wagner234
to be a most important agent in the limitation and fixation of varieties
and species
  darwins work he says neither satisfactorily explains the
  external cause which gives the first impulse to increased individual
  variability and consequently to natural selection nor that
  condition which in connection with a certain advantage in the
  struggle for life renders the new characteristics indispensable
  the latter is according to my conviction solely fulfilled by the
  voluntary or passive migration of organisms and colonization which
  depends in a great measure upon the configuration of the country so
  that only under favorable conditions would the home of a new species
  be founded
this was succeeded by rev j t gulicks profound essays on diversity
of evolution under one set of external conditions235 1872 and on
divergent evolution through cumulative segregation236 1887
these and later papers are based on his studies on the land shells of
the hawaiian islands the cause of their extreme diversity of local
species is he claims not due to climatic conditions food enemies or
to natural selection but to the action of what he calls the law of
segregation
fifteen years later mr romanes published his theory of physiological
selection which covered much the same ground
a very strong little book by an ornithologist of wide experience
charles dixon237 and refreshing to read since it is packed with
facts is lamarckian throughout the chief factor in the formation of
local species is he thinks isolation the others are climatic
influences especially the glacial period use and disuse and sexual
selection as well as chemical agency dixon insists on the vast
importance of isolation in the modification of many forms of life
without the assistance of natural selection again he says natural
selection as has often been remarked can only preserve a beneficial
variationit cannot originate it it is not a cause of variation on
the other hand the use or disuse of organs is a direct cause of
variation and can furnish natural selection with abundance of material
to work upon p 49 the book like the papers of allen ridgway
gulick and others shows the value of isolation or segregation in
special areas as a factor in the origination of varieties and species
the result being the prevention of interbreeding which would otherwise
swamp the incipient varieties
here might be cited delboeufs law238
  when a modification is produced in a very small number of
  individuals this modification even were it advantageous would be
  destroyed by heredity as the favored individuals would be obliged
  to unite with the unmodified individuals il nen est rien
  cependant however great may be the number of forms similar to it
  and however small may be the number of dissimilar individuals which
  would give rise to an isolated individual we can always while
  admitting that the different generations are propagated under the
  same conditions meet with a number of generations at the end of
  which the sum total of the modified individuals will surpass that of
  the unmodified individuals giard adds that this law is capable of
  mathematical demonstration thus the continuity or even the
  periodicity of action of a primary factor such for example as a
  variation of the milieu shows us the necessary and sufficient
  condition under which a variety or species originates without the
  aid of any secondary factor
semper239 an eminent zologist and morphologist who also was the
first in 1863 to criticise darwins theory of the mode of formation of
coral atolls though not referring to lamarck published a strong
catholic and original book which is in general essentially lamarckian
while not undervaluing darwins principle of natural selection it
appears to me he says in the preface that of all the properties of
the animal organism variability is that which may first and most easily
be traced by exact investigation to its efficient causes
  by a rearrangement of the materials of his argument however we
  obtain as i conceive convincing proof that external conditions can
  exert not only a very powerful selective force but a transforming
  one as well although it must be the more limited of the two
  an organ no longer needed for its original purpose may adapt itself
  to the altered circumstances and alter correspondingly if it
  contains within itself as i have explained above the elements of
  such a change then the influence exerted by the changed conditions
  will be transforming not selective
  this last view may seem somewhat bold to those readers who know
  that darwin in his theory of selection has almost entirely set
  aside the direct transforming influence of external circumstances
  yet he seems latterly to be disposed to admit that he had
  undervalued the transforming as well as the selective influence of
  external conditions and it seems to me that his objection to the
  idea of such an influence rested essentially on the method of his
  argument which seemed indispensable for setting his theory of
  selection and his hypothesis as to the transformation of species in
  a clear light and on a firm footing p 37
dr h de varigny has carried on much farther the kind of experiments
begun by semper in his experimental evolution he employs the
lamarckian factors of environment and use and disuse regarding the
selective factors as secondary
the lamarckian factors are also depended upon by the late professor
eimer in his works on the variation of the walllizard and on the
markings of birds and mammals 188188 his final views being comprised
in his general work240 the essence of his point of view may be seen
by the following quotation
  according to my conception the physical and chemical changes which
  organisms experience during life through the action of the
  environment through light or want of light air warmth cold
  water moisture food etc and which they transmit by heredity
  are the primary elements in the production of the manifold variety
  of the organic world and in the origin of species from the
  materials thus supplied the struggle for existence makes its
  selection these changes however express themselves simply as
  growth p 22
in a later paper241 eimer proposes the term orthogenesis or direct
development in rigorous conformity to law in a few definite
directions although this is simply and wholly lamarckism eimer claims
that it is not for he strangely enough says lamarck ascribed no
efficiency whatever to the effects of outward influences on the animal
body and very little to their effects upon vegetable organisms
whereas if he had read his lamarck carefully he would have seen that
the french evolutionist distinctly states that the environment acts
directly on plants and the lower animals but indirectly on those
animals with a brain meaning the higher vertebrates the same
antiselection views are held by eimers pupil piepers242 who
explains organic evolution by laws of growth  uncontrolled by any
process of selection
dr cunningham likewise in the preface to his translation of eimers
work gives his reasons for adopting neolamarckian views concluding
that the theory of selection can never get over the difficulty of the
origin of entirely new characters that selection whether natural or
artificial could not be the essential cause of the evolution of
organisms in an article on the new darwinism westminster review
july 1891 he claims that weismanns theory of heredity does not
explain the origin of horns venomous teeth feathers wings of insects
or mammary glands phosphorescent organs etc which have arisen on
animals whose ancestors never had anything similar
discussing the origin of whales and other aquatic mammals w kkenthal
suggests that the modifications are partially attributable to mechanical
principles annals and mag nat hist february 1891
from his studies on the variation of butterflies karl jordan243
proposes the term mechanical selection to account for them but he
points out that this factor can only work on variations produced by
other factors certain cases as the similar variation in the same
locality of two species of different families but with the same wing
pattern tell in favor of the direct action of the local surroundings on
the markings of the wings
in the same direction are the essays of schroeder244 on the markings
of caterpillars which he ascribes to the colors of the surroundings of
fischer245 on the transmutations of butterflies as the result of
changes of temperature and also dormeisters246 earlier paper
steinach247 attributes the color of the lower vertebrates to the
direct influence of the light on the pigment cells as does
biedermann248
in his address on evolution and the factors of evolution professor a
giard249 has given due credit to lamarck as the creator of
transformism and to the position to be assigned to natural selection
as a secondary factor he quotes at length lamarcks views published in
1806 after enumerating the primary factors of organic evolution he
places natural selection among his secondary factors such as heredity
segregation amixia etc on the other hand he states that lamarck was
not happy in the choice of the examples which he gave to explain the
action of habits and use of parts je ne rappellerai par lhistoire
tant de fois critique du cou de la giraffe et des cornes de lescargot
another important factor in the evolution of the metazoa or manycelled
animals from the sponges and polyps upward from the onecelled forms or
protozoa is the principle of animal aggregation or colonization
advanced by professor perrier as civilization and progressive
intelligence in mankind arose from the aggregation of men into tribes or
peoples which lived a sedentary life so the agricultural building and
other arts forthwith sprang up and as the social insects owe their
higher degree of intelligence to their colonial mode of life so as soon
as unicellular organisms began to become fixed and form aggregates the
sponge and polyp types of organization resulted this leading to the
gastra or ancestral form from which all the higher phyla may have
originated
m perrier appears to fully accept lamarcks views including his
speculations as to wants and use and disuse he however refuses to
accept lamarcks extreme view as to the origin through effort of
entirely new organs as he says unfortunately if lamarck succeeded in
explaining in a plausible way the modification of organs already
existing their adaptation to different uses or even their
disappearance from disuse in regard to the appearance of new organs he
made hypotheses so venturesome that they led to the momentary
forgetfulness of his other forceful conceptions250
the popular idea of lamarckism and which from the first has been
prejudicial to his views is that an animal may acquire an organ by
simply wishing for or desiring it or as his french critics put it un
animal finit toujours par possder un organe quand il le veut such
says perrier251 is not the idea of lamarck who simply attributes
the transformations of species to the stimulating action of external
conditions construing it under the expression of wants besoins and
explaining by that word what we now call adaptations thus the long
neck of the giraffe results from the fact that the animal inhabits a
country where the foliage is situated at the tops of high trees the
long legs of the wading birds have originated from the fact that these
birds are obliged to seek their food in the water without wetting
themselves etc see p 350
  many cases says perrier may be added today to those which
  lamarck has cited to support his first law pp 303 346 the only
  point which is open to discussion is the extent of the changes which
  an organ may undergo through the use it is put to by the animal it
  is a simple question of measurement the possibility of the creation
  of an organ in consequence of external stimuli is itself a matter
  which deserves to be studied and which we have no right to reject
  without investigation without observations or to treat as a
  ridiculous dream lamarck would doubtless have made it more readily
  accepted if he had not thought it well to pass over the
  intermediate steps by means of wants it is incontestable that by
  lack of exercise organs atrophy and disappear
  finally says perrier without doubt the real mechanism of the
  improvement perfectionnement of organisms has escaped him
  lamarck but neither has darwin explained it the law of natural
  selection is not the indication of a process of transformation of
  animals it is the expression of the total results it states these
  results without showing us how they have been brought about we
  indeed see that it tends to the preservation of the most perfect
  organisms but darwin does not show us how the organisms themselves
  originated this is a void which we have only during these later
  years tried to fill p 90
dr j a jeffries author of an essay on the epidermal system of
birds in a later paper252 thus frankly expresses his views as to the
relations of natural selection to the lamarckian factors referring to
darwins case of the leg bones of domestic ducks compared with those of
wild ducks and the atrophy of disused organs he adds
  in this case as with most of lamarcks laws darwin has taken them
  to himself wherever natural selection sexual selection and the
  like have fallen to the ground
  darwins natural selection does not depend as is popularly
  supposed on direct proof but is adduced as an hypothesis which
  gains its strength from being compatible with so many facts of
  correlation between an organism and its surroundings yet the same
  writer who considers natural selection proved will call for positive
  experimental proof of lamarcks theory and refuse to accept its
  general compatibility with the facts as support almost any case
  where natural selection is held to act by virtue of advantage gained
  by use of a part is equally compatible with lamarcks theory of use
  and development the wings of birds of great power of flight the
  relations of insects to flowers the claws of beasts of prey are
  all cases in point
professor j a thomsons useful synthetic summary of the influence of
the environment upon the organism 1887 takes for its text spencers
aphorism that the direct action of the medium was the primordial factor
of organic evolution professor geddes relies on the changes in the soil
and climate to account for the origin of spines in plants
the botanist sachs in his physiology of plants 1887 remarks a
far greater portion of the phenomena of life are is called forth by
external influences than one formerly ventured to assume
certain botanists are now strong in the belief that the species of
plants have originated through the direct influence of the environment
of these the most outspoken is the rev professor g henslow his view
is that selfadaptation by response to the definite action of changed
conditions of life is the true origin of species in 1894253 he
insisted in the strictest sense of the term that natural selection
is not wanted as an aid or a means in originating species in a
later paper254 he reasserts that all variations are definite that
there are no indefinite variations and that natural selection can take
no part in the origination of varieties he quotes with approval the
conclusion of mr herbert spencer in 1852 published
  seven years before darwin and dr wallace superadded natural
  selection as an aid in the origin of species he saw no necessity
  for anything beyond the natural power of change with adaptation and
  i venture now to add my own testimony based upon upwards of a
  quarter of a centurys observations and experiments which have
  convinced me that mr spencer was right and darwin was wrong his
  words are as follows the supporters of the development hypothesis
  can show  that any existing species animal or vegetable when
  placed under conditions different from its previous ones
  immediately begins to undergo certain changes of structure fitting
  it for the new conditions  that in the successive generations
  these changes continue until ultimately the new conditions become
  the natural ones they can show that throughout all organic
  nature there is at work a modifying influence of the kind they
  assign as the causes of specific differences an influence which
  though slow in its action does in time if the circumstances demand
  it produce marked changes255
mr henslow adduces observations and experiments by buckman bailey
lesage lothelier costantin bonnier and others all demonstrating
that the environment acts directly on the plant
henslow also suggests that endogens have originated from exogenous
plants through selfadaptation to an aquatic habit256 which is in
line with our idea that certain classes of animals have diverged from
the more primitive ones by change of habit although this has led to the
development of new classcharacteristics by use and disuse phenomena
which naturally do not operate in plants owing to their fixed
conditions
other botanistsfrench german and englishhave also been led to
believe in the direct influence of the milieu or environment such
are viet257 and scott elliot258 who attributes the growth of bulbs
to the direct influence of the climate
in a recent work costantin259 shares the belief emphatically held by
some german botanists in the direct influence of the environment not
only as modifying the form but also as impressing without the aid of
natural selection that form on the species or part of its inherited
stock and one chapter is devoted to an attempt to establish the thesis
that acquired characters are inherited
in his essay on dynamic influences in evolution w h dall260 holds
the view that
  the environment stands in a relation to the individual such as the
  hammer and anvil bear to the blacksmiths hot iron the organism
  suffers during its entire existence a continuous series of
  mechanical impacts none the less real because invisible or
  disguised by the fact that some of them are precipitated by
  voluntary effort of the individual itself it is probable that
  since the initiation of life upon the planet no two organisms have
  ever been subjected to exactly the same dynamic influences during
  their development the reactions of the organism against the
  physical forces and mechanical properties of its environment are
  abundantly sufficient if we are granted a single organism with a
  tendency to grow to begin with time for the operation of the
  forces and the principle of the survival of the fittest
in his paper on the hinge of pelecypod molluscs and its development he
has pointed out a number of the particular ways in which the dynamics of
the environment may act on the characters of the hinge and shell of
bivalve molluscs he has also shown that the initiation and development
of the columellar plaits in voluta mitra and other gasteropod molluscs
are the necessary mechanical result of certain comparatively simple
physical conditions and that the variations and peculiarities connected
with these plaits perfectly harmonize with the results which follow
within organic material subjected to analogous stresses
in the same line of study is dr r t jacksons261 work on the
mechanical origin of characters in the lamellibranch molluscs the
bivalve nature of the shell doubtless arose he says from the
splitting on the median line of a primitive univalvular ancestor and
he adds a parallel case is seen in the development of a bivalve shell
in ancient crustaceans in both types of shells the form is induced by
the mechanical conditions of the case the adductor muscles of bivalve
molluscs and crustaceans are he shows plainly the necessary
consequence of the bivalvular condition
in his theory as to the origin of the siphon of the clam mya
arenaria he explains it in a manner identical with lamarcks
explanations of the origin of the wading and swimming birds etc even
to the use of the words effort and habit
  in mya arenaria we find a highly elongated siphon in the young
  the siphon hardly extends beyond the borders of the valves and then
  the animal lives at or close to the surface in progressive growth
  as the animal burrows deeper the siphon elongates until it attains
  a length many times the total length of the valves
  the ontogeny of the individual and the paleontology of the family
  both show that mya came from a form with a very abbreviated siphon
  and it seems evident that the long siphon of this genus was brought
  about by the effort to reach the surface induced by the habit of
  deep burial
  the tendency to equalize the form of growth in a horizontal plane
  or the geomalic tendency of professor hyatt262 is seen markedly
  in pelecypods in forms which crawl on the free borders of the
  valves the right and left growth in relation to the perpendicular
  is obvious and agrees with the right and left sides of the animal
  in pecten the animal at rest lies on the right valve and swims or
  flies with the right valve lowermost here equalization to the right
  and left of the perpendicular line passing through the centre of
  gravity is very marked especially in the vola division of the
  group but the induced right and left aspect corresponds to the
  dorsal and ventral sides of the animal not the right and left
  sides as in the former case lima a near ally of pecten swims
  with the edges of the valves perpendicular in this case the
  geomalic growth corresponds to the right and left sides of the
  animal
  the oyster has a deep or spoonshaped attached valve and a flat or
  flatter free valve this form or a modification of it we find to
  be characteristic of all pelecypods which are attached to a foreign
  object of support by the cementation of one valve all are highly
  modified and are strikingly different from the normal form seen in
  locomotive types of the group the oyster may be taken as the type
  of the form adopted by attached pelecypods the two valves are
  unequal the attached valve being concave the free valve flat but
  they are not only unequal they are often very dissimilaras
  different as if they belonged to a distinct type in what would be
  considered typical forms this is remarkable as a case of acquired
  and inherited characteristics finding very different expression in
  the two valves of a group belonging to a class typically
  equivalvular the attached valve is the most highly modified and
  the free is least modified retaining more fully ancestral
  characters therefore it is to the free young before fixation takes
  place and to the free leastmodified valve that we must turn in
  tracing genetic relations of attached groups another characteristic
  of attached pelecypods is camerated structure which is most
  frequent and extensive in the thick attached valve the form as
  above described is characteristic of the ostreid hinnites
  spondylus and plicatula dimya pernostrea aetheria and mulleria
  and chama and its near allies these various genera though
  ostreiform in the adult are equivalvular and of totally different
  form in the free young the several types cited are from widely
  separated families of pelecypods yet all under the same given
  conditions adopt a closely similar form which is strong proof that
  common forces acting on all alike have induced the resulting form
  what the forces are that have induced this form it is not easy to
  see from the study of this form alone but the ostrean form is the
  base of a series from the summit of which we get a clearer view
  amer nat pp 1820
here we see plainly brought out by jacksons researches that the
lamarckian factors of change of environment and consequently of habit
effort use and disuse or mechanical strains resulting in the
modifications of some and even the appearance of new organs as the
adductor muscles have originated new characters which are peculiar to
the class and thus a new class has been originated the mollusca
indeed show to an unusual extent the influence of a change in
environment and of use and disuse in the formation of classes
langs treatment in his textbook of comparative anatomy 1888 of
the subjects of the musculature of worms and crustacea and of the
mechanism of the motion of the segmented body in the arthropoda is of
much value in relation to the mechanical genesis of the body segments
and limbs of the members of this type dr b sharp has also discussed
the same subject american naturalist 1893 p 89 also graber in
his works while the present writer in his textbook of entomology
1898 has attempted to treat of the mechanical origin of the segments
of insects and of the limbs and their jointed structure along the
lines laid down by herbert spencer lang sharp and graber
w roux263 has inquired how natural selection could have determined
the special orientation of the sheets of spongy tissue of bone he
contends that the selection of accidental variation could not originate
species because such variations are isolated and because to
constitute a real advantage they should rest on several characters
taken together his example is the transformation of aquatic into
terrestrial animals
g pfeffer264 opposes the efficacy of natural selection as do c
emery265 and o hertwig the essence of hertwigs the biological
problem of today 1894 is that in obedience to different external
influences the same rudiments may give rise to different adult
structures p 128 delage in his thories sur lhrdit
summarizes under seven heads the objections of these distinguished
biologists species arise he says from general variations due to
change in the conditions of life such as food climate use and disuse
very rarely individual variations such as sports or aberrations which
are more or less the result of disease
mention should also be made of the essays and works of h driesch266
de varigny267 danilewsky268 verworn269 davenport270
gadow271 and others
in his address on neodarwinism and neolamarckism mr lester f ward
the palobotanist says
  i shall be obliged to confine myself almost exclusively to the one
  great mind who far more than all others combined paved the way for
  the new science of biology to be founded by darwin namely
  lamarck after showing that lamarck established the functional or
  what we would call the dynamic factors he goes on to say that
  lamarck although he clearly grasped the law of competition or the
  struggle for existence the law of adaptation or the correspondence
  of the organism to the changing environment the transmutation of
  species and the genealogical descent of all organic beings the
  more complex from the more simple he nevertheless failed to
  conceive the selective principle as formulated by darwin and
  wallace which so admirably complemented these great laws272
as is well known huxley was if we understand his expressions aright
not fully convinced of the entire adequacy of natural selection
  there is no fault to be found with mr darwins method then but
  it is another question whether he has fulfilled all the conditions
  imposed by that method is it satisfactorily proved in fact that
  species may be originated by selection that there is such a thing
  as natural selection that none of the phenomena exhibited by
  species are inconsistent with the origin of species in this way
                                   
  after much consideration with assuredly no bias against
  mr darwins views it is our clear conviction that as the evidence
  stands it is not absolutely proven that a group of animals having
  all the characters exhibited by species in nature has ever been
  originated by selection whether artificial or natural groups
  having the morphological character of species distinct and
  permanent races in fact have been so produced over and over again
  but there is no positive evidence at present that any group of
  animals has by variation and selective breeding given rise to
  another group which was even in the least degree infertile with the
  first mr darwin is perfectly aware of this weak point and brings
  forward a multitude of ingenious and important arguments to diminish
  the force of the objection273
we have cited the foregoing conclusions and opinions of upwards of forty
working biologists many of whom were brought up so to speak in the
darwinian faith to show that the pendulum of evolutionary thought is
swinging away from the narrow and restricted conception of natural
selection pure and simple as the sole or most important factor and
returning in the direction of lamarckism
we may venture to say of lamarck what huxley once said of descartes
that he expressed the thoughts which will be everybodys two or three
centuries after him only the change of belief due to the rapid
accumulation of observed facts has come in a period shorter than two
or three centuries for at the end of the very century in which
lamarck whatever his crudities vagueness and lack of observations and
experiments published his views wherein are laid the foundations on
which natural selection rests the consensus of opinion as to the direct
and indirect influence of the environment and the inadequacy of natural
selection as an initial factor was becoming stronger and deeperrooted
each year
we must never forget or underestimate however the inestimable value of
the services rendered by darwin who by his patience industry and rare
genius for observation and experiment and his powers of lucid
exposition convinced the world of the truth of evolution with the
result that it has transformed the philosophy of our day we are all of
us evolutionists though we may differ as to the nature of the efficient
causes

226 in 1885 in the introduction to the standard natural history we
proposed the term neolamarckianism or lamarckism in its modern form to
designate the series of factors of organic evolution and we take the
liberty to quote the passage in which the word first occurs we may add
that the briefer form neolamarckism is the more preferable
in the united states a number of naturalists have advocated what may be
called neolamarckian views of evolution especially the conception that
in some cases rapid evolution may occur the present writer contrary to
pure darwinians believes that many species but more especially types
of genera and families have been produced by changes in the environment
acting often with more or less rapidity on the organism resulting at
times in a new genus or even a family type natural selection acting
through thousands and sometimes millions of generations of animals and
plants often operates too slowly there are gaps which have been so to
speak intentionally left by nature moreover natural selection was as
used by some writers more an idea than a vera causa natural
selection also begins with the assumption of a tendency to variation
and presupposes a world already tenanted by vast numbers of animals
among which a struggle for existence was going on and the few were
victorious over the many but the entire inadequacy of darwinism to
account for the primitive origin of life forms for the original
diversity in the different branches of the tree of life forms the
interdependence of the creation of ancient faunas and floras on
geological revolutions and consequent sudden changes in the environment
of organisms has convinced us that darwinism is but one of a number of
factors of a true evolution theory that it comes in play only as the
last term of a series of evolutionary agencies or causes and that it
rather accounts as first suggested by the duke of argyll for the
preservation of forms than for their origination we may in fact
compare darwinism to the apex of a pyramid the larger mass of the
pyramid representing the complex of theories necessary to account for
the world of life as it has been and now is in other words we believe
in a modified and greatly extended lamarckianism or what may be called
neolamarckianism
