preface
as in many other of these studies and perhaps more than in most the
task attempted in the present volume is mainly of a tentative and
preliminary character there is here little scope yet for the presentation
of definite scientific results however it may be in the physical
universe in the cosmos of science our knowledge must be nebulous before
it constellates into definitely measurable shapes and nothing is gained
by attempting to anticipate the evolutionary process thus it is that
here for the most part we have to content ourselves at present with the
task of mapping out the field in broad and general outlines bringing
together the facts and considerations which indicate the direction in
which more extended and precise results will in the future be probably
found
in his famous descent of man wherein he first set forth the doctrine of
sexual selection darwin injured an essentially sound principle by
introducing into it a psychological confusion whereby the physiological
sensory stimuli through which sexual selection operates were regarded as
equivalent to sthetic preferences this confusion misled many and it is
only within recent years as has been set forth in the analysis of the
sexual impulse in the previous volume of these studies that the
investigations and criticisms of numerous workers have placed the doctrine
of sexual selection on a firm basis by eliminating its hazardous sthetic
element love springs up as a response to a number of stimuli to
tumescence the object that most adequately arouses tumescence being that
which evokes love the question of sthetic beauty although it develops
on this basis is not itself fundamental and need not even be consciously
present at all when we look at these phenomena in their broadest
biological aspects love is only to a limited extent a response to beauty
to a greater extent beauty is simply a name for the complexus of stimuli
which most adequately arouses love if we analyze these stimuli to
tumescence as they proceed from a person of the opposite sex we find that
they are all appeals which must come through the channels of four senses
touch smell hearing and above all vision when a man or a woman
experiences sexual love for one particular person from among the multitude
by which he or she is surrounded this is due to the influences of a group
of stimuli coming through the channels of one or more of these senses
there has been a sexual selection conditioned by sensory stimuli this is
true even of the finer and more spiritual influences that proceed from one
person to another although in order to grasp the phenomena adequately
it is best to insist on the more fundamental and less complex forms which
they assume in this sense sexual selection is no longer a hypothesis
concerning the truth of which it is possible to dispute it is a
selfevident fact the difficulty is not as to its existence but as to
the methods by which it may be most precisely measured it is
fundamentally a psychological process and should be approached from the
psychological side this is the reason for dealing with it here obscure
as the psychological aspects of sexual selection still remain they are
full of fascination for they reveal to us the more intimate sides of
human evolution of the process whereby man is molded into the shapes we
know

sexual selection in man
the external sensory stimuli affecting selection in man the four senses
involved
touch
i
the primitive character of the skin its qualities touch the earliest
source of sensory pleasure the characteristics of touch as the alpha and
omega of affection the sexual organs a special adaptation of touch
sexual attraction as originated by touch sexual hypersthesia to touch
the sexual associations of acne
ii
ticklishness its origin and significance the psychology of tickling
laughter laughter as a kind of detumescence the sexual relationships of
itching the pleasure of tickling its decrease with age and sexual
activity
iii
the secondary sexual skin centres orificial contacts cunnilingus and
fellatio the kiss the nipples the sympathy of the breasts with the
primary sexual centres this connection operative both through the nerves
and through the blood the influence of lactation on the sexual centres
suckling and sexual emotion the significance of the association between
suckling and sexual emotion the association as a cause of sexual
perversity
iv
the bath antagonism of primitive christianity to the cult of the skin
its cult of personal filth the reasons which justified this attitude the
worldwide tendency to association between extreme cleanliness and sexual
licentiousness the immorality associated with public baths in europe down
to modern times
v
summary fundamental importance of touch the skin the mother of all the
other senses
smell
i
the primitiveness of smell the anatomical seat of the olfactory centres
predominance of smell among the lower mammals its diminished importance
in man the attention paid to odors by savages
ii
rise of the study of olfaction cloquet zwaardemaker the theory of
smell the classification of odors the special characteristics of
olfactory sensation in man smell as the sense of imagination odors as
nervous stimulants vasomotor and muscular effects odorous substances as
drugs
iii
the specific body odors of various peoples the negro etc the european
the ability to distinguish individuals by smell the odor of sanctity the
odor of death the odors of different parts of the body the appearance of
specific odors at puberty the odors of sexual excitement the odors of
menstruation body odors as a secondary sexual character the custom of
salutation by smell the kiss sexual selection by smell the alleged
association between size of nose and sexual vigor the probably intimate
relationship between the olfactory and genital spheres reflex influences
from the nose reflex influences from the genital sphere olfactory
hallucinations in insanity as related to sexual states the olfactive
type the sense of smell in neurasthenic and allied states in certain
poets and novelists olfactory fetichism the part played by olfaction in
normal sexual attraction in the east etc in modern europe the odor of
the armpit and its variations as a sexual and general stimulant body
odors in civilization tend to cause sexual antipathy unless some degree
of tumescence is already present the question whether men or women are
more liable to feel olfactory influences women usually more attentive to
odors the special interest in odors felt by sexual inverts
iv
the influence of perfumes their aboriginal relationship to sexual body
odors this true even of the fragrance of flowers the synthetic
manufacture of perfumes the sexual effects of perfumes perfumes perhaps
originally used to heighten the body odors the special significance of
the musk odor its wide natural diffusion in plants and animals and man
musk a powerful stimulant its widespread use as a perfume peau
despagne the smell of leather and its occasional sexual effects the
sexual influence of the odors of flowers the identity of many plant odors
with certain normal and abnormal body odors the smell of semen in this
connection
v
the evil effects of excessive olfactory stimulation the symptoms of
vanillism the occasional dangerous results of the odors of flowers
effects of flowers on the voice
vi
the place of smell in human sexual selections it has given place to the
predominance of vision largely because in civilized man it fails to act at
a distance it still plays a part by contributing to the sympathies or the
antipathies of intimate contact
hearing
i
the physiological basis of rhythm rhythm as a physiological stimulus the
intimate relation of rhythm to movement the physiological influence of
music on muscular action circulation respiration etc the place of
music in sexual selection among the lower animals its comparatively small

influence of music in morals education and medicine its therapeutic
uses significance of the romantic interest in music at puberty men
comparatively insusceptible to the specifically sexual influence of music
rarity of sexual perversions on the basis of the sense of hearing the
part of music in primitive human courtship women notably susceptible to
the specifically sexual influence of music and the voice

summary why the influence of music in human sexual selection is
comparatively small
vision
i
primacy of vision in man beauty as a sexual allurement the objective
element in beauty ideals of feminine beauty in various parts of the
world savage women sometimes beautiful from european point of view
savages often admire european beauty the appeal of beauty to some extent
common even to animals and man
ii
beauty to some extent consists primitively in an exaggeration of the
sexual characters the sexual organs mutilations adornments and
garments sexual allurement the original object of such devices the
religious element unsthetic character of the sexual organs importance
of the secondary sexual characters the pelvis and hips steatopygia
obesity gait the pregnant woman as a medival type of beauty the ideals

histories of sexual development
sexual selection in man
the external sensory stimuli affecting selection in manthe four senses
involved
tumescencethe process by which the organism is brought into the physical
and psychic state necessary to insure conjugation and detumescenceto
some extent comes about through the spontaneous action of internal forces
to that extent it is analogous to the physical and psychic changes which
accompany the gradual filling of the bladder and precede its evacuation
but even among animals who are by no means high in the zological scale
the process is more complicated than this external stimuli act at every
stage arousing or heightening the process of tumescence and in normal
human beings it may be said that the process is never completed without
the aid of such stimuli for even in the autoerotic sphere external
stimuli are still active either actually or in imagination
the chief stimuli which influence tumescence and thus direct sexual choice
come chieflyindeed exclusivelythrough the four senses of touch
smell hearing and sight all the phenomena of sexual selection so far
as they are based externally act through these four senses1 the
reality of the influence thus exerted may be demonstrated statistically
even in civilized man and it has been shown that as regards for
instance eyecolor conjugal partners differ sensibly from the unmarried
persons by whom they are surrounded when therefore we are exploring the
nature of the influence which stimuli acting through the sensory
channels exert on the strength and direction of the sexual impulse we
are intimately concerned with the process by which the actual form and
color not alone of living things generally but of our own species have
been shaped and are still being shaped at the same time it is probable
we are exploring the mystery which underlies all the subtle appreciations
all the emotional undertones which are woven in the web of the whole
world as it appeals to us through those sensory passages by which alone it
can reach us we are here approaching therefore a fundamental subject of
unsurpassable importance a subject which has not yet been accurately
explored save at a few isolated points and one which it is therefore
impossible to deal with fully and adequately yet it cannot be passed
over for it enters into the whole psychology of the sexual instinct
of the four sensestouch smell hearing and sightwith which we are
here concerned touch is the most primitive and it may be said to be the
most important though it is usually the last to make its appeal felt
smell which occupies the chief place among many animals is of
comparatively less importance though of considerable interest in man it
is only less intimate and final than touch sight occupies an intermediate
position and on this account and also on account of the very great part
played by vision in life generally as well as in art it is the most
important of all the senses from the human sexual point of view hearing
from the same point of view is the most remote of all the senses in its
appeal to the sexual impulse and on that account it is when it
intervenes among the first to make its influence felt

touch and smell even in those abnormal sexual acts in which it may seem
to be affected taste could scarcely have any influence most of our
tasting as waller puts it is done by the nose which in man is in
specially close relationship posteriorly with the mouth there are at
most four taste sensationssweet bitter salt and sourif even all of
these are simple tastes what commonly pass for taste sensations as shown

we are accustomed to regard the skin as mainly owing its existence to the
need for the protection of the delicate vessels nerves viscera and
muscles underneath undoubtedly it performs and by its tough and elastic
texture is well fitted to perform this extremely important service but
the skin is not merely a method of protection against the external world
it is also a method of bringing us into sensitive contact with the
external world it is thus as the organ of touch the seat of the most
widely diffused sense we possess and moreover the sense which is the
most ancient and fundamental of allthe mother of the other senses
it is scarcely necessary to insist that the primitive nature of the
sensory function of the skin with the derivative nature of the other
senses is a well ascertained and demonstrable fact the lower we descend
in the animal scale the more varied we find the functions of the skin to
be and if in the higher animals much of the complexity has disappeared
that is only because the specialization of the various skin regions into
distinct organs has rendered this complexity unnecessary even yet
however in man himself the skin still retains in a more or less latent
condition much of its varied and primary power and the analysis of
pathological and even normal phenomena serves to bring these old powers
into clear light
    woods hutchinson studies in human and comparative pathology
    1901 chapters vii and viii has admirably set forth the immense
    importance of the skin as in the first place a tissue which is
    silk to the touch the most exquisitely beautiful surface in the
    universe to the eye and yet a wall of adamant against hostile
    attack impervious alike by virtue of its wonderful responsive
    vitality to moisture and drought cold and heat electrical
    changes hostile bacteria the most virulent of poisons and the
    deadliest of gases it is one of the real wonders of the world
    more beautiful than velvet softer and more pliable than silk
    more impervious than rubber and more durable under exposure than
    steel wellnigh as resistant to electric currents as glass it
    is one of the toughest and most dangerproof substances in the
    three kingdoms of nature although as this author adds we
    hardly dare permit it to see the sunlight or breathe the open
    air but it is more than this it is as woods hutchinson
    expresses it the creator of the entire body its embryonic
    infoldings form the alimentary canal the brain the spinal cord
    while every sense is but a specialization of its general organic
    activity it is furthermore a kind of skinheart promoting the
    circulation by its own energy it is the great heatregulating
    organ of the body it is an excretory organ only second to the
    kidneys which descend from it and finally it still remains the
    seat of touch
    it may be added that the extreme beauty of the skin as a surface
    is very clearly brought out by the inadequacy of the comparisons
    commonly used in order to express its beauty snow marble
    alabaster ivory milk cream silk velvet and all the other
    conventional similes furnish surfaces which from any point of
    view are incomparably inferior to the skin itself cf stratz
    die schnheit des weiblichen krpers chapter xii
    with reference to the extraordinary vitality of the skin
    emphasized by woods hutchinson it may be added that when
    experimenting on the skin with the electric current waller found
    that healthy skin showed signs of life ten days or more after
    excision it has been found also that fragments of skin which
    have been preserved in sterile fluid for even as long as nine
    months may still be successfully transplanted on to the body
    british medical journal july 19 1902
    everything indicates remark stanley hall and donaldson motor
    sensations in the skin mind 1885 that the skin is not
    only the primeval and most reliable source of our knowledge of
    the external world or the archological field of psychology but
    a field in which work may shed light on some of the most
    fundamental problems of psychic action groos spiele der
    menschen pp 816 also deals with the primitive character of
    touch sensations
    touch sensations are without doubt the first of all the sensory
    impressions to prove pleasurable we should indeed expect this
    from the fact that the skin reflexes have already appeared before
    birth while a pleasurable sensitiveness of the lips is doubtless
    a factor in the childs response to the contact of the maternal
    nipple very early memories of sensory pleasure seem to be
    frequently perhaps most frequently tactile in character though
    this fact is often disguised in recollection owing to tactile
    impression being vague and diffused there is thus in elizabeth
    potwins study of early memories psychological review
    november 1901 no separate group of tactile memories and the
    more elaborate investigation by colegrove individual memories
    american journal of psychology january 1899 yields no
    decisive results under this head see however stanley halls
    valuable study some aspects of the early sense of self
    american journal of psychology april 1898 klpe has a
    discussion of the psychology of cutaneous sensations outlines
    of psychology english translation pp 87 et seq
    harriet martineau at the beginning of her autobiography
    referring to the vivid character of tactile sensations in early
    childhood remarks concerning an early memory of touching a
    velvet button that the rapture of the sensation was really
    monstrous and a lady tells me that one of her earliest memories
    at the age of 3 is of the exquisite sensation of the casual
    contact of a cool stone with the vulva in the act of urinating
    such sensations of course cannot be termed specifically sexual
    though they help to furnish the tactile basis on which the
    specifically sexual sensations develop
    the elementary sensitiveness of the skin is shown by the fact
    that moderate excitation suffices to raise the temperature while
    heidenhain and others have shown that in animals cutaneous
    stimuli modify the sensibility of the brain cortex slight
    stimulus increasing excitability and strong stimulus diminishing
    it fr has shown that the slight stimulus to the skin furnished
    by placing a piece of metal on the arm or elsewhere suffices to
    increase the output of work with the ergograph fr comptes

    emotions pp 40 et seq
    fr found that the application of a mustard plaster to the skin
    or an icebag or a hotwater bottle or even a light touch with a
    painters brush all exerted a powerful effect in increasing
    muscular work with the ergograph the tonic effect of cutaneous
    excitation he remarks throws light on the psychology of the
    caress it is always the most sensitive parts of the body which
    seek to give or to receive caresses many animals rub or lick
    each other the mucous surfaces share in this irritability of the
    skin the kiss is not only an expression of feeling it is a
    means of provoking it cataglottism is by no means confined to
    pigeons the tonic value of cutaneous stimulation is indeed a
    commonly accepted idea wrestlers rub their hands or limbs and
    the handshake also is not without its physiological basis
    cutaneous excitations may cause painful sensations to cease many
    massage practices which favor work act chiefly as sensorial
    stimulants on this account many nervous persons cannot abandon
    them and the greeks and romans found in massage not only health
    but pleasure lauder brunton regards many common manoeuvres like
    scratching the head and pulling the mustache as methods of
    dilating the bloodvessels of the brain by stimulating the facial
    nerve the motor reactions of cutaneous excitations favor this
    hypothesis fr travail et plaisir chapter xv influence
    des excitations du toucher sur le travail
the main characteristics of the primitive sense of touch are its wide
diffusion over the whole body and the massive vagueness and imprecision of
the messages it sends to the brain this is the reason why it is of all
the senses the least intellectual and the least sthetic it is also the
reason why it is of all the senses the mostprofoundly emotional
touch wrote bain in his emotions and will is both the alpha and the
omega of affection and he insisted on the special significance in this
connection of tendernessa characteristic emotional quality of
affection which is directly founded on sensations of touch if tenderness
is the alpha of affection even between the sexes its omega is to be
found in the sexual embrace which may be said to be a method of
obtaining through a specialized organization of the skin the most
exquisite and intense sensations of touch
    we believe nothing is so exciting to the instinct or mere
    passions as the presence of the hand or those tactile caresses
    which mark affection states the anonymous author of an article
    on woman in her psychological relations in the journal of
    psychological medicine 1851 they are the most general stimuli
    in lower animals the first recourse in difficulty or danger and
    the primary solace in anguish for woman is the bosom of her
    husband or her lover she seeks solace and protection and repose
    on that part of the body where she herself places the objects of
    her own affection woman appears to have the same instinctive
    impulse in this respect all over the world
it is because the sexual orgasm is founded on a special adaptation and
intensification of touch sensations that the sense of touch generally is
to be regarded as occupying the very first place in reference to the
sexual emotions fr mantegazza penta and most other writers on this
question are here agreed touch sensations constitute a vast gamut for the
expression of affection with at one end the note of minimum personal
affection in the brief and limited touch involved by the conventional
handshake and the conventional kiss and at the other end the final and
intimate contact in which passion finds the supreme satisfaction of its
most profound desire the intermediate region has its great significance
for us because it offers a field in which affection has its full scope
but in which every road may possibly lead to the goal of sexual love it
is the intimacy of touch contacts their inevitable approach to the
threshold of sexual emotion which leads to a jealous and instinctive
parsimony in the contact of skin and skin and to the tendency with the
increased sensitiveness of the nervous system involved by civilization to
restrain even the conventional touch manifestation of ordinary affection
and esteem in china fathers leave off kissing their daughters while they
are still young children in england the kiss as an ordinary greeting
between men and womena custom inherited from classic and early christian
antiquitystill persisted to the beginning of the eighteenth century in
france the same custom existed in the seventeenth century but in the
middle of that century was beginning to be regarded as dangerous2 while
at the present time the conventional kiss on the cheek is strictly
differentiated from the kiss on the mouth which is reserved for lovers
touch contacts between person and person other than those limited and
defined by custom tend to become either unpleasantas an undesired
intrusion into an intimate sphereor else when occurring between man and
woman at some peculiar moment they may make a powerful reverberation in
the emotional and more specifically sexual sphere one man falls in love
with his future wife because he has to carry her upstairs with a sprained
ankle another dates his lovestory from a romp in which his cheek
accidentally came in contact with that of his future wife a woman will
sometimes instinctively strive to attract the attention of the man who
appeals to her by a peculiar and prolonged pressure of the handthe only
touch contact permitted to her dante as penta has remarked refers to
sight or touch as the two channels through which a womans love is
revived purgatorio viii 76 even the handshake of a sympathetic man
is enough in some chaste and sensitive women to produce sexual excitement
or sometimes even the orgasm the cases in which love arises from the
influence of stimuli coming through the sense of touch are no doubt
frequent and they would be still more frequent if it were not that the
very proximity of this sense to the sexual sphere causes it to be guarded
with a care which in the case of the other senses it is impossible to
exercise this intimacy of touch and the reaction against its sexual
approximations leads to what james has called the antisexual instinct
the instinct of personal isolation the actual repulsiveness to us of the
idea of intimate contact with most of the persons we meet especially
those of our own sex he refers in this connection to the unpleasantness
of the sensation felt on occupying a seat still warm from the body of
another person3 the catholic church has always recognized the risks of
vuluptuous emotion involved in tactile contacts and the facility with
which even the most innocent contacts may take on a libidinous
character4
    the following observations were written by a lady aged 30 who
    has never had sexual relationships i am only conscious of a
    very sweet and pleasurable emotion when coming in contact with
    honorable men and consider that a comparison can be made between
    the idealism of such emotions and those of music of beauties of
    nature and of productions of art while studying and writing
    articles upon a new subject i came in contact with a specialist
    who rendered me considerable aid and one day while jointly
    correcting a piece of work he touched my hand this produced a
    sweet and pure sensation of thrill through the whole system i
    said nothing in fact was too thrilled for speech and never to
    this day have shown any responsive action but for months at
    certain periods generally twice a month i have experienced the
    most pleasurable emotions i have seen this friend twice since
    and have a curious feeling that i stand on one side of a hedge
    while he is on the other and as neither makes an approach
    pleasure of the highest kind is experienced but not allowed to
    go beyond reasonable and healthgiving bounds in some moments i
    feel overcome by a sense of mastery by this man and yet feeling
    that any approach would be undignified some pleasure is
    experienced in restraining and keeping within proper bounds this
    passional emotion all these thrills of pleasurable emotion
    possess a psychic value and so long as the nervous system is
    kept in perfect health they do not seem to have the power to
    injure but rather one is able to utilize the passionate emotions
    as weapons for pleasure and work
    various parts of the skin surface appear to have special sexual
    sensitiveness peculiarly marked in many individuals especially
    women so that as fr remarks linstinct sexuel second
    edition 1902 p 130 contact stimulation of the lips lobe of
    ear nape of neck little finger knee etc may suffice even to
    produce the orgasm some sexually hypersthetic women as has
    already been noted experience this when shaking hands with a man
    who is attractive to them in some neurotic persons this
    sensibility as fr shows may exist in so morbid a degree that
    even the contact of the sensitive spot with unattractive persons
    or inanimate objects may produce the orgasm in this connection
    reference may be made to the wellknown fact that in some
    hysterical subjects there are socalled erogenous zones simple
    pressure on which suffices to evoke the complete orgasm there
    is perhaps some significance from our present point of view
    in the fact that as emphasized by savill hysterical skin
    symptoms lancet january 30 1904 the skin is one of the
    very best places to study hysteria
    the intimate connection between the skin and the sexual sphere is
    also shown in pathological conditions of the skin especially in
    acne as well as simple pimples on the face the sexual
    development of puberty involves a development of hair in various
    regions of the body which previously were hairless as however
    the sebaceous glands on the face and elsewhere are the vestiges
    of former hairs and survive from a period when the whole body was
    hairy they also tend to experience in an abortive manner this
    same impulse thus we may say that with the development of the
    sexual organs at puberty there is correlated excitement of the
    whole pilosebaceous apparatus in the regions where this
    apparatus is vestigial and notably in the face this abortive
    attempt of the hairfollicles and their sebaceous appendages to
    produce hairs tends only to disorganization and simple
    comedones or pustular acne pimples are liable to occur as a
    rule acne appears about puberty and dies out slowly during
    adolescence while fairly common in young women it is usually
    much less severe but tends to be exacerbated at the menstrual
    periods it is also apt to appear at the change of life stephen
    mackenzie the etiology and treatment of acne vulgaris
    british medical journal september 29 1894 laycock nervous
    diseases of women 1840 p 23 pointed out that acne occurs
    chiefly in those parts of the surface covered by sexual hair a
    lucid account of the origin of acne will be found in woods
    hutchinsons studies in human and comparative pathology pp
    179184 gj engelmann the hysteroneuroses gyncological
    transactions 1887 pp 124 et seq discusses various
    pathological disorders of the skin as reflex disturbances
    originating in the sexual sphere
    the influence of menstruation in exacerbating acne has been
    called in question but it seems to be well established thus
    bulkley relation between certain diseases of the skin and the
    menstrual function transactions of the medical society of new
    york 1901 p 328 found that in 510 cases of acne in women
    145 or nearly onethird were worse about the monthly period
    sometimes it only appeared during menstruation the exacerbation
    occurred much more frequently just before than just after the
    period there was usually some disturbance of menstruation
    various other disorders of the skin show a similar relationship
    to menstruation
    it has been asserted that masturbation is a frequent or constant
    cause of acne at puberty see eg discussion in british
    medical journal july 1882 this cannot be accepted acne very
    frequently occurs without masturbation and masturbation is very
    frequently practiced without producing acne at the same time we
    may well believe that at the period of puberty when the
    pilosebaceous system is already in sensitive touch with the
    sexual system the shock of frequently repeated masturbation may
    in the same way as disordered menstruation have its
    repercussion on the skin thus a lady has informed me that at
    about the age of 18 she found that frequently repeated
    masturbation was followed by the appearance of comedones

relationships of itchingthe pleasure of ticklingits decrease with age
and sexual activity
touch as has already been remarked is the least intellectual of the
senses there is however one form of touch sensationthat is to say
ticklishnesswhich is of so special and peculiar a nature that it has
sometimes been put aside in a class apart from all other touch sensations
scaliger proposed to class titillation as a sixth or separate sense
alrutz of upsala regards tickling as a milder degree of itching and
considers that the two together constitute a sensation of distinct quality
with distinct endorgans for the mediation of that quality5 however we
may regard this extreme view tickling is certainly a specialized
modification of touch and it is at the same time the most intellectual
mode of touch sensation and that with the closest connection with the
sexual sphere to regard tickling as an intellectual manifestation may
cause surprise more especially when it is remembered that ticklishness is
a form of sensation which reaches full development very early in life and
it has to be admitted that as compared even with the messages that may be
sent through smell and taste the intellectual element in ticklishness
remains small but its presence here has been independently recognized by
various investigators groos points out the psychic factor in tickling as
evidenced by the impossibility of selftickling6 louis robinson
considers that ticklishness appears to be one of the simplest
developments of mechanical and automatic nervous processes in the
direction of the complex functioning of the higher centres which comes
within the scope of psychology7 stanley hall and allin remark that
these minimal touch excitations represent the very oldest stratum of
psychic life in the soul8 hirman stanley in a somewhat similar
manner pushes the intellectual element in ticklishness very far back and
associates it with tentacular experience by temporary selfextension
he remarks even low amoeboid organisms have slight but suggestive
touch experiences that stimulate very general and violent reactions and
in higher organisms extended touchorgans as tentacles antenn hair
etc become permanent and very delicately sensitive organs where minimal
contacts have very distinct and powerful reactions thus ticklishness
would be the survival of long passed ancestral tentacular experience
which originally a stimulation producing intense agitation and alarm has
now become merely a play activity and a source of keen pleasure9
we need not however go so far back in the zological series to explain
the origin and significance of tickling in the human species sir jy
simpson suggested in an elaborate study of the position of the child in
the womb that the extreme excitomotory sensibility of the skin in various
regions such as the sole of the foot the knee the sides which already
exists before birth has for its object the excitation and preservation of
the muscular movements necessary to keep the foetus in the most favorable
position in the womb10 it is in fact certainly the case that the
stimulation of all the ticklish regions in the body tends to produce
exactly that curled up position of extreme muscular flexion and general
ovoid shape which is the normal position of the foetus in the womb we may
well believe that in this early developed reflex activity we have the
basis of that somewhat more complex ticklishness which appears somewhat
later
the mental element in tickling is indicated by the fact that even a child
in whom ticklishness is highly developed cannot tickle himself so that
tickling is not a simple reflex this fact was long ago pointed out by
erasmus darwin and he accounted for it by supposing that voluntary
exertion diminishes the energy of sensation11 this explanation is
however inadmissible for although we cannot easily tickle ourselves by
the contact of the skin with our own fingers we can do so with the aid of
a foreign body like a feather we may perhaps suppose that as
ticklishness has probably developed under the influence of natural
selection as a method of protection against attack and a warning of the
approach of foreign bodies its end would be defeated if it involved a
simple reaction to the contact of the organism with itself this need of
protection it is which involves the necessity of a minimal excitation
producing a maximal effect though the mechanism whereby this takes place
has caused considerable discussion we may it is probable best account
for it by invoking the summationirradiation theory of painpleasure the
summation of the stimuli in their course through the nerves aided by
capillary congestion leading to irradiation due to anastomoses between
the tactile corpuscles not to speak of the much wider irradiation which
is possible by means of central nervous connections
    prof cl herrick adopts this explanation of the phenomena of
    tickling and rests it in part on dogiels study of the tactile
    corpuscles psychological corollaries of modern neurological
    discoveries journal of comparative neurology march 1898
    the following remarks of prof a allin may also be quoted in
    further explanation of the same theory so far as ticklishness
    is concerned a very important factor in the production of this
    feeling is undoubtedly that of the summation of stimuli in a
    research of stirlings carried on under ludwigs direction it
    was shown that reflex contractions only occur from repeated
    shocks to the nervecentresthat is through summation of
    successive stimuli that this result is also due in some degree
    to an alternating increase in the sensibility of the various
    areas in question from altered supply of blood is reasonably
    certain as a consequence of this summationprocess there would
    result in many cases and in cases of excessive nervous discharge
    the opposite of pleasure namely pain a number of instances
    have been recorded of death resulting from tickling and there is
    no reason to doubt the truth of the statement that simon de
    montfort during the persecution of the albigenses put some of
    them to death by tickling the soles of their feet with a feather
    an additional causal factor in the production of tickling may lie
    in the nature and structure of the nervous process involved in
    perception in general according to certain histological
    researches of recent years we know that between the senseorgans
    and the central nervous system there exist closely connected
    chains of conductors or neurons along which an impression
    received by a single sensory cell on the periphery is propagated
    avalanchelike through an increasing number of neurons until the
    brain is reached if on the periphery a single cell is excited
    the avalanchelike process continues until finally hundreds or
    thousands of nervecells in the cortex are aroused to
    considerable activity golgi ramn y cajal koelliker held
    retzius and others have demonstrated the histological basis of
    this law for vision hearing and smell and we may safely assume
    from the phenomena of tickling that the sense of touch is not
    lacking in a similar arrangement may not a suggestion be
    offered with some plausibility that even in ideal or
    representative tickling where tickling results say from
    someone pointing a finger at the ticklish places this
    avalanchelike process may be incited from central centres thus
    producing although in a modified degree the pleasant phenomena
    in question as to the deepest causal factor i should say that
    tickling is the result of vasomotor shock a allin on
    laughter psychological review may 1903
the intellectual element in tickling conies out in its connection with
laughter and the sense of the comic of which it may be said to constitute
the physical basis while we are not here concerned with laughter and the
comic sensea subject which has lately attracted considerable
attentionit may be instructive to point out that there is more than an
analogy between laughter and the phenomena of sexual tumescence and
detumescence the process whereby prolonged tickling with its nervous
summation and irradiation and accompanying hypermia finds sudden relief
in an explosion of laughter is a real example of tumescenceas it has
been defined in the study in another volume entitled an analysis of the
sexual impulseresulting finally in the orgasm of detumescence the
reality of the connection between the sexual embrace and tickling is
indicated by the fact that in some languages as in that of the
fuegians12 the same word is applied to both that ordinary tickling is
not sexual is due to the circumstances of the case and the regions to
which the tickling is applied if however the tickling is applied within
the sexual sphere then there is a tendency for orgasm to take place
instead of laughter the connection which through the phenomena of
tickling laughter thus bears to the sexual sphere is well indicated as
groos has pointed out by the fact that in sexuallyminded people sexual
allusions tend to produce laughter this being the method by which they
are diverted from the risks of more specifically sexual detumescence13
    reference has been made to the view of alrutz according to which
    tickling is a milder degree of itching it is more convenient and
    probably more correct to regard itching or pruritus as it is
    termed in its pathological forms as a distinct sensation for it
    does not arise under precisely the same conditions as tickling
    nor is it relieved in the same way there is interest however
    in pointing out in this connection that like tickling itching
    has a real parallelism to the specialized sexual sensations
    bronson who has very ably interpreted the sensations of itching
    new york neurological society october 7 1890 medical news
    february 14 1903 and summarized in the british medical
    journal march 7 1903 and elsewhere regards it as a
    perversion of the sense of touch a dyssthesia due to obstructed
    nerveexcitation with imperfect conduction of the generated force
    into correlated nervous energy the scratching which relieves
    itching directs the nervous energy into freer channels sometimes
    substituting for the pruritus either painful or voluptuous
    sensations such voluptuous sensations may be regarded as a
    generalized aphrodisiac sense comparable to the specialized
    sexual orgasm bronson refers to the significant fact that
    itching occurs so frequently in the sexual region and states
    that sexual neurasthenia is sometimes the only discoverable cause
    of genital and anal pruritus cf discussion on pruritus
    british medical journal november 30 1895 gilman again
    american journal of psychology vi p 22 considers that
    scratching as well as sneezing is comparable to coitus
the sexual embrace has an intimate connection with the phenomena of
ticklishness which could not fail to be recognized this connection is
indeed the basis of spinozas famous definition of loveamor est
titillatio qudam concomitante idea caus externa statement which
seems to be reflected in chamforts definition of love as lchange de
deux fantaisies et le contact de deux epidermes the sexual act says
gowers is in fact a skin reflex14 the sexual parts hall and allin
state have a ticklishness as unique as their function and as keen as
their importance herrick finds the supreme illustration of the summation
and irradiation theory of tickling in the phenomena of erotic excitement
and points out that in harmony with this the skin of the sexual region is
as dogiel has shown that portion of the body in which the tactile
corpuscles are most thoroughly and elaborately provided with anastomosing
fibres it has been pointed out15 that when ordinary tactile
sensibility is partially abolishedespecially in hemiansthesia in the
insanesome sexual disturbance is specially apt to be found in
association
in young children in girls even when they are no longer children and
occasionally in men tickling may be a source of acute pleasure which in
very early life is not sexual but later tends to become so under
circumstances predisposing to the production of erotic emotion and
especially when the nervous system is keyed up to a high tone favorable
for the production of the maximum effect of tickling
    when young writes a lady aged 28 i was extremely fond of
    being tickled and i am to some extent still between the ages of
    10 and 12 it gave me exquisite pleasure which i now regard as
    sexual in character i used to bribe my younger sister to tickle
    my feet until she was tired
    stanley hall and allin in their investigation of the phenomena of
    tickling largely carried out among young women teachers found
    that in 60 clearly marked cases ticklishness was more marked at
    one time than another as when they have been carrying on or
    are in a happy mood are nervous or unwell after a good meal
    when being washed when in perfect health when with people they
    like etc hall and allin tickling and laughter american
    journal of psychology october 1897 it will be observed that
    most of the conditions mentioned are such as would be favorable
    to excitations of an emotionally sexual character
    the palms of the hands may be very ticklish during sexual
    excitement especially in women and moll kontrre
    sexualempfindung p 180 remarks that in some men titillation
    of the skin of the back of the feet and even of the forehead
    evokes erotic feelings
    it may be added that as might be expected titillation of the
    skin often has the same significance in animals as in man in
    some animals remarks louis robinson art ticklishness
    dictionary of psychological medicine local titillation of
    the skin though in parts remote from the reproductive organs
    plainly acts indirectly upon them as a stimulus thus harvey
    records that by stroking the back of a favorite parrot which he
    had possessed for years and supposed to be a male he not only
    gave the bird gratificationwhich was the sole intention of the
    illustrious physiologistbut also caused it to reveal its sex
    by laying an egg
the sexual significance of tickling is very clearly indicated by the fact
that the general ticklishness of the body which is so marked in children
and in young girls greatly diminishes as a rule after sexual
relationships have been established dr gina lombroso who investigated
the cutaneous reflexes found that both the abdominal and plantar
reflexes which are well marked in childhood and in young people between
the ages of 15 and 18 were much diminished in older persons and to a
greater extent in women than in men to a greater extent in the abdominal
region than on the soles of the feet16 her results do not directly show
the influence of sexual relationship but they have an indirect bearing
which is worth noting
the difference in ticklishness between the unmarried woman and the married
woman corresponds to their difference in degree of modesty both modesty
and ticklishness may be said to be characters which are no longer needed
from this point of view the general ticklishness of the skin is a kind of
body modesty it is so even apart from any sexual significance of
tickling and louis robinson has pointed out that in young apes puppies
and other like animals the most ticklish regions correspond to the most
vulnerable spots in a fight and that consequently in the mock fights of
early life skill in defending these spots is attained
    in iceland according to margarethe filhs as quoted by max
    bartels zeitschrift fr ethnologie 1900 ht 23 p 57 it
    may be known whether a youth is pure or a maid is intact by their
    susceptibility to tickling it is considered a bad sign if that
    is lost
    i am indebted to a medical correspondent for the following
    communication married women have told me that they find that
    after marriage they are not ticklish under the arms or on the
    breasts though before marriage any tickling or touching in these
    regions especially by a man would make them jump or get
    hysterical or queer as they call it before coitus the sexual
    energy seems to be dissipated along all the nervechannels and
    especially along the secondary sexual routesthe breasts nape
    of neck eyebrows lips cheeks armpits and hair thereon
    etcbut after marriage the surplus energy is diverted from
    these secondary channels and response to tickling is diminished
    i have often noted in insane cases especially mania in
    adolescent girls that they are excessively ticklish again in
    ordinary routine practice i have observed that though married
    women show no ticklishness during auscultation and percussion of
    the chest this is by no means always so in young girls perhaps
    ticklishness in virgins is natures selfprotection against rape
    and sexual advances and the young girl instinctively wishing to
    hide the armpits breasts and other ticklish regions tucks
    herself up to prevent these parts being touched the married
    woman being in love with a man does not shut up these parts as
    she reciprocates the advances that he makes she no longer
    requires ticklishness as a protection against sexual aggression

the secondary sexual skin centresorificial contactscunnilingus and

primary sexual centresthis connection operative both through the nerves
and through the bloodthe influence of lactation on the sexual
centressuckling and sexual emotionthe significance of the association
between suckling and sexual emotionthis association as a cause of sexual
perversity
we have seen that the skin generally has a high degree of sensibility
which frequently tends to be in more or less definite association with the
sexual centres we have seen also that the central and specific sexual
sensation the sexual embrace itself is in large measure a specialized
kind of skin reflex between the generalized skin sensations and the great
primary sexual centre of sensation there are certain secondary sexual
centres which on account of their importance may here be briefly
considered
these secondary centres have in common the fact that they always involve
the entrances and the exits of the bodythe regions that is where skin
merges into mucous membrane and where in the course of evolution
tactile sensibility has become highly refined it may indeed be said
generally of these frontier regions of the body that their contact with
the same or a similar frontier region in another person of opposite sex
under conditions otherwise favorable to tumescence will tend to produce a
minimum and even sometimes a maximum degree of sexual excitation contact
of these regions with each other or with the sexual region itself so
closely simulates the central sexual reflex that channels are set up for
the same nervous energy and secondary sexual centres are constituted
it is important to remember that the phenomena we are here concerned with
are essentially normal many of them are commonly spoken of as
perversions in so far however as they are aids to tumescence they must
be regarded as coming within the range of normal variation they may be
considered unsthetic but that is another matter it has moreover to be
remembered that sthetic values are changed under the influence of sexual
emotion from the lovers point of view many things are beautiful which
are unbeautiful from the point of view of him who is not a lover and the
greater the degree to which the lover is swayed by his passion the greater
the extent to which his normal sthetic standard is liable to be modified
a broad consideration of the phenomena among civilized and uncivilized
peoples amply suffices to show the fallacy of the tendency so common
among unscientific writers on these subjects to introduce normal sthetic
standards into the sexual sphere from the normal standpoint of ordinary
daily life indeed the whole process of sex is unsthetic except the
earlier stages of tumescence17
so long as they constitute a part of the phase of tumescence the
utilization of the sexual excitations obtainable through these channels
must be considered within the normal range of variation as we may
observe indeed among many animals when however such contacts of the
orifices of the body other than those of the male and female sexual
organs proper are used to procure not merely tumescence but
detumescence they become in the strict and technical sense perversions
they are perversions in exactly the same sense as are the methods of
intercourse which involve the use of checks to prevent fecundation the
sthetic question however remains the same as if we were dealing with
tumescence it is necessary that this should be pointed out clearly even
at the risk of misapprehension as confusions are here very common
    the essentially sexual character of the sensitivity of the
    orificial contacts is shown by the fact that it may sometimes be
    accidentally developed even in early childhood this is well
    illustrated in a case recorded by fr a little girl of 4 of
    nervous temperament and liable to fits of anger in which she
    would roll on the ground and tear her clothes once ran out into
    the garden in such a fit of temper and threw herself on the lawn
    in a halfnaked condition as she lay there two dogs with whom
    she was accustomed to play came up and began to lick the
    uncovered parts of the body it so happened that as one dog
    licked her mouth the other licked her sexual parts she
    experienced a shock of intense sensation which she could never
    forget and never describe accompanied by a delicious tension of
    the sexual organs she rose and ran away with a feeling of shame
    though she could not comprehend what had happened the impression
    thus made was so profound that it persisted throughout life and
    served as the point of departure of sexual perversions while the
    contact of a dogs tongue with her mouth alone afterward sufficed
    to evoke sexual pleasure fr archives de neurologie 1903

    i do not purpose to discuss here either cunnilingus the
    apposition of the mouth to the female pudendum or fellatio
    the apposition of the mouth to the male organ the agent in the
    former case being in normal heterosexual relationships a man
    in the latter a woman they are not purely tactile phenomena but
    involve various other physical and psychic elements
    cunnilingus was a very familiar manifestation in classic times
    as shown by frequent and mostly very contemptuous references in
    aristophanes juvenal and many other greek and roman writers
    the greeks regarded it as a phoenician practice just as it is
    now commonly considered french it tends to be especially
    prevalent at all periods of high civilization fellatio has
    also been equally well known in both ancient and modern times
    especially as practiced by inverted men it may be accepted that
    both cunnilingus and fellatio as practiced by either sex
    are liable to occur among healthy or morbid persons in
    heterosexual or homosexual relationships they have little
    psychological significance except to the extent that when
    practiced to the exclusion of normal sexual relationships they
    become perversions and as such tend to be associated with
    various degenerative conditions although such associations are
    not invariable
    the essentially normal character of cunnilingus and fellatio
    when occurring as incidents in the process of tumescence is
    shown by the fact that they are practiced by many animals this
    is the case for instance among dogs moll points out that not
    infrequently the bitch while under the dog but before
    intromission will change her position to lick the dogs
    penisapparently from an instinctive impulse to heighten her own
    and his excitementand then return to the normal position while
    cunnilingus is of constant occurrence among animals and on
    account of its frequency among dogs was called by the greeks

    the occurrence of cunnilingus as a sexual episode of tumescence
    among lower human races is well illustrated by a practice of the
    natives of the caroline islands as recorded by kubary in his
    ethnographic study of this people and quoted by ploss and
    bartels das weib vol i it is here customary for a man to
    place a piece of fish between the labia while he stimulates the
    latter by his tongue and teeth until under stress of sexual
    excitement the woman urinates this is regarded as an indication
    that the proper moment for intercourse has arrived such a
    practice rests on physiologically sound facts whatever may be
    thought of it from an sthetic standpoint
    the contrast between the normal sthetic standpoint in this
    matter and the lovers is well illustrated by the following
    quotations dr ab holder in the course of his description of
    the american indian bot remarks concerning fellatio of
    all the many varieties of sexual perversion this it seems to
    me is the most debased that could be conceived of on the other
    hand in a communication from a writer and scholar of high
    intellectual distinction occurs the statement i affirm that of
    all sexual acts fellatio is most an affair of imagination and
    sympathy it must be pointed out that there is no contradiction
    in these two statements and that each is justified according as
    we take the point of view of the ordinary onlooker or of the
    impassioned lover eager to give a final proof of his or her
    devotion it must be added that from a scientific point of view
    we are not entitled to take either side
of the whole of this group of phenomena the most typical and the most
widespread example is certainly the kiss we have in the lips a highly
sensitive frontier region between skin and mucous membrane in many
respects analogous to the vulvovaginal orifice and reinforcible
moreover by the active movements of the still more highly sensitive
tongue close and prolonged contact of these regions therefore under
conditions favorable to tumescence sets up a powerful current of nervous
stimulation after those contacts in which the sexual regions themselves
take a direct part there is certainly no such channel for directing
nervous force into the sexual sphere as the kiss this is nowhere so well
recognized as in france where a young girls lips are religiously kept
for her lover to such an extent indeed that young girls sometimes come
to believe that the whole physical side of love is comprehended in a kiss
on the mouth so highly intelligent a woman as madam adam has described
the agony she felt as a girl when kissed on the lips by a man owing to
the conviction that she had thereby lost her virtue although the lips
occupy this highly important position as a secondary sexual focus
in the sphere of touch the kiss isunlike cunnilingus and
fellatioconfined to man and indeed to a large extent to civilized
man it is the outcome of a compound evolution which had its beginning
outside the sphere of touch and it would therefore be out of place to
deal with the interesting question of its development in this place it
will be discussed elsewhere18
there is yet another orificial frontier region which is a highly important
tactile sexual focus the nipple the breasts raise indeed several
interesting questions in their intimate connection with the sexual sphere
and it may be worth while to consider them at this point
the breasts have from the present point of view this special significance
among the sexual centres that they primarily exist not for the contact of
the lover but the contact of the child this is doubtless indeed the
fundamental fact on which all the touch contacts we are here concerned
with have grown up the sexual sensitivity of the lovers lips to
orificial contacts has been developed from the sensitivity of the infants
lips to contact with his mothers nipple it is on the ground of that
evolution that we are bound to consider here the precise position of the
breasts as a sexual centre
as the great secreting organs of milk the function of the breasts must
begin immediately the child is cut off from the nutrition derived from
direct contact with his mothers blood it is therefore essential that the
connection between the sexual organs proper more especially the womb and
the breasts should be exceedingly intimate so that the breasts may be in
a condition to respond adequately to the demand of the childs sucking
lips at the earliest moment after birth as a matter of fact this
connection is very intimate so intimate that it takes place in two
totally distinct waysby the nervous system and by the blood
    the breasts of young girls sometimes become tender at puberty in
    sympathy with the evolution of the sexual organs although the
    swelling of the breasts at this period is not normally a
    glandular process at the recurring periods of menstruation
    again sensations in the breasts are not uncommon
    it is not however until impregnation occurs that really
    decisive changes take place in the breasts as soon as the ovum
    is impregnated that is to say within a few days as wda
    griffith states it the diagnosis of pregnancy british
    medical journal april 11 1903 the changes begin to occur in
    the breast changes which are just as well worked out as are the
    changes in the uterus and the vagina which from the
    commencement of pregnancy prepare for the labor which ought to
    follow nine months afterward these are changes in the direction
    of marked activity of function an organ which was previously
    quite passive without activity of circulation and the effects of
    active circulation begins to grow and continues to grow in
    activity and size as pregnancy progresses
    the association between breasts and womb is so obvious that it
    has not escaped many savage peoples who are often indeed
    excellent observers among one primitive people at least the
    activity of the breast at impregnation seems to be clearly
    recognized the sinangolo of british new guinea says seligmann
    journal of the anthropological institute julydecember 1902
    p 298 believe that conception takes place in the breasts on
    this account they hold that coitus should never take place before
    the child is weaned or he might imbibe semen with the milk
    it is natural to assume that this connection between the activity
    of the womb and the glandular activity of the breasts is a
    nervous connection by means of the spinal cord and such a
    connection certainly exists and plays a very important part in
    the stimulating action of the breasts on the sexual organs but
    that there is a more direct channel of communication even than
    the nervous system is shown by the fact that the secretion of
    milk will take place at parturition even when the nervous
    connection has been destroyed mironoff found that when the
    mammary gland is completely separated from the central nervous
    system secretion though slightly diminished still continued
    in two goats he cut the nerves shortly before parturition and
    after birth the breasts still swelled and functioned normally

    again cut out the mammary gland of a young rabbit and

    young and the gland secreted milk freely the case has been
    reported of a woman whose spinal cord was destroyed by an
    accident at the level of the fifth and sixth dorsal vertebr
    yet lactation was perfectly normal british medical journal
    august 5 1899 p 374 we are driven to suppose that there is
    some chemical change in the blood some internal secretion from
    the uterus or the ovaries which acts as a direct stimulant to
    the breasts see a comprehensive discussion of the phenomena of
    the connection between the breasts and sexual organs though the
    conclusions are not unassailable by temesvary journal of
    obstetrics and gyncology of the british empire june 1903
    that this hypothetical secretion starts from the womb rather than
    the ovaries seems to be indicated by the fact that removal of
    both ovaries during pregnancy will not suffice to prevent
    lactation in favor of the ovaries see beatson lancet july
    1896 in favor of the uterus armand routh on the interaction
    between the ovaries and the mammary glands british medical
    journal september 30 1899
while however the communications from the sexual organs to the breast
are of a complex and at present ill understood character the
communication from the breasts to the sexual organs is without doubt
mainly and chiefly nervous when the child is put to the breast after
birth the suction of the nipple causes a reflex contraction of the womb
and it is held by many though not all authorities that in a woman who
does not suckle her child there is some risk that the womb will not return
to its normal involuted size it has also been asserted that to put a
child to the breast during the early months of pregnancy causes so great a
degree of uterine contraction that abortion may result
    freund found in germany that stimulation of the nipples by an
    electrical cupping apparatus brought about contraction of the
    pregnant uterus at an earlier period it was recommended to
    irritate the nipple in order to excite the uterus to parturient

    the influence of lactation over the womb in preventing the return
    of menstruation during its continuance is well known according
    to remfrys investigation of 900 cases in england in 57 per
    cent of cases there is no menstruation during lactation l
    remfry in paper read before obstetrical society of london
    summarized in the british medical journal january 11 1896 p
    86 bendix in germany found among 140 cases that in about 40
    per cent there was no menstruation during lactation paper read
    before dsseldorf meeting of the society of german naturalists
    and physicians 1899 when the child is not suckled menstruation
    tends to reappear about six months after parturition
    it is possible that the divergent opinions of authorities
    concerning the necessarily favorable influence of lactation in
    promoting the return of the womb to its normal size may be due to
    a confusion of two distinct influences the reflex action of the
    nipple on the womb and the effects of prolonged glandular
    secretion of the breasts in debilitated persons the act of
    suckling undoubtedly tends to promote uterine contraction and in
    healthy women during lactation the womb may even according to
    vineberg be temporarily reduced to a smaller size than before
    impregnation thus producing what is known as lactation
    atrophy in debilitated women however the strain of
    milkproduction may lead to general lack of muscular tone and
    involution of the womb thus be hindered rather than aided by
    lactation
on the objective side then the nipple is to be regarded as an erectile
organ richly supplied with nerves and vessels which under the
stimulation of the infants lipsor any similar compression and even
under the influence of emotion or coldbecomes firm and projects mainly
as a result of muscular contraction for unlike the penis and the
clitoris the nipple contains no true erectile tissue and little capacity
for vascular engorgement19 we must then suppose that an impetus tends
to be transmitted through the spinal cord to the sexual organs setting up
a greater or less degree of nervous and muscular excitement with uterine
contraction these being the objective manifestations what manifestations
are to be noted on the subjective side
it is a remarkable proof of the general indifference with which in europe
even the fairly constant and prominent characteristics of the psychology
of women have been treated until recent times that so far as i am
awarethough i have made no special research to this endno one before
the end of the eighteenth century had recorded the fact that the act of
suckling tends to produce in women voluptuous sexual emotions cabanis in
1802 in the memoir on influence des sexes in his rapports du physique
et du moral de lhomme wrote that several suckling women had told him
that the child in sucking the breast made them experience a vivid
sensation of pleasure shared in some degree by the sexual organs there
can be no doubt that in healthy suckling women this phenomenon is
exceedingly common though in the absence of any methodical and precise
investigation it cannot be affirmed that it is experienced by every woman
in some degree and it is highly probable that this is not the case one
lady perfectly normal states that she has had stronger sexual feelings
in suckling her children than she has ever experienced with her husband
but that so far as possible she has tried to repress them as she regards
them as brutish under these circumstances many other women state
generally that suckling is the most delicious physical feeling they have
ever experienced in most cases however it does not appear to lead to a
desire for intercourse and some of those who make this statement have no
desire for coitus during lactation though they may have strong sexual
needs at other times it is probable that this corresponds to the normal
condition and that the voluptuous sensations aroused by suckling are
adequately gratified by the child it may be added that there are probably
many women who could say with a lady quoted by fr20 that the only
real pleasures of sex they have ever known are those derived from their
suckling infants
it is not difficult to see why this normal association of sexual emotion
with suckling should have come about it is essential for the preservation
of the lives of young mammals that the mothers should have an adequate
motive in pleasurable sensation for enduring the trouble of suckling the
most obvious method for obtaining the necessary degree of pleasurable
sensation lay in utilizing the reservoir of sexual emotion with which
channels of communication might already be said to be open through the
action of the sexual organs on the breasts during pregnancy the
voluptuous element in suckling may thus be called a merciful provision of
nature for securing the maintenance of the child
    cabanis seems to have realized the significance of this
    connection as the basis of the sympathy between mother and child
    and more recently lombroso and ferrero have remarked la donna
    delinquente p 438 on the fact that maternal love has a sexual
    basis in the element of venereal pleasure though usually
    inconsiderable experienced during suckling houzeau has referred
    to the fact that in the majority of animals the relation between
    mother and offspring is only close during the period of
    lactation and this is certainly connected with the fact that it
    is only during lactation that the female animal can derive
    physical gratification from her offspring when living on a farm
    i have ascertained that cows sometimes though not frequently
    exhibit slight signs of sexual excitement with secretion of
    mucus while being milked so that as the dairymaid herself
    observed it is as if they were being bulled the sow like
    some other mammals often eats her own young after birth
    mistaking them it is thought for the placenta which is
    normally eaten by most mammals it is said that the sow never
    eats her young when they have once taken the teat
    it occasionally happens that this normal tendency for suckling to
    produce voluptuous sexual emotions is present in an extreme
    degree and may lead to sexual perversions it does not appear
    that the sexual sensations aroused by suckling usually culminate
    in the orgasm this however was noted in a case recorded by
    fr of a slightly neurotic woman in whom intense sexual
    excitement occurred during suckling especially if prolonged so
    far as possible she shortened the periods of suckling in order
    to prevent not always successfully the occurrence of the orgasm
    fr archives de neurologie no 30 1903 icard refers to
    the case of a woman who sought to become pregnant solely for the
    sake of the voluptuous sensations she derived from suckling and
    yellowlees art masturbation dictionary of psychological
    medicine speaks of the overwhelming character of the storms of
    sexual feeling sometimes observed during lactation
    it may be remarked that the frequency of the association between
    lactation and the sexual sensations is indicated by the fact
    that as savage remarks lactational insanity is often
    accompanied by fancies regarding the reproductive organs
when we have realized the special sensitivity of the orificial regions and
the peculiarly close relationships between the breasts and the sexual
organs we may easily understand the considerable part which they normally
play in the art of love as one of the chief secondary sexual characters
in women and one of her chief beauties a womans breasts offer
themselves to the lovers lips with a less intimate attraction than her
mouth only because the mouth is better able to respond on her side such
contact is often instinctively desired just as the sexual disturbance of
pregnancy is accompanied by a sympathetic disturbance in the breasts so
the sexual excitement produced by the lovers proximity reacts on the
breasts the nipple becomes turgid and erect in sympathy with the
clitoris the woman craves to place her lover in the place of the child
and experiences a sensation in which these two supreme objects of her
desire are deliciously mingled
    the powerful effect which stimulation of the nipple produces on
    the sexual sphere has led to the breasts playing a prominent part
    in the erotic art of those lands in which this art has been most
    carefully cultivated thus in india according to vatsyayana
    many authors are of the opinion that in approaching a woman a
    lover should begin by sucking the nipples of her breasts and in
    the songs of the bayaderes of southern india sucking the nipple
    is mentioned as one of the natural preliminaries of coitus
    in some cases and more especially in neurotic persons the
    sexual pleasure derived from manipulation of the nipple passes
    normal limits and being preferred even to coitus becomes a
    perversion in girls schools it is said especially in france
    sucking and titillation of the breasts are not uncommon in men
    also titillation of the nipples occasionally produces sexual
    sensations fr linstinct sexuel second edition p 132
    hildebrandt recorded the case of a young woman whose nipples had
    been sucked by her lover by constantly drawing her breasts she
    became able to suck them herself and thus attained extreme sexual
    pleasure aj bloch of new orleans has noted the case of a
    woman who complained of swelling of the breasts the gentlest
    manipulation produced an orgasm and it was found that the
    swelling had been intentionally produced for the sake of this
    manipulation moraglia in italy knew a very beautiful woman who
    was perfectly cold in normal sexual relationships but madly
    excited when her husband pressed or sucked her breasts lombroso
    archivio di psichiatria 1885 fasc iv has described the
    somewhat similar case of a woman who had no sexual sensitivity in
    the clitoris vagina or labia and no pleasure in coitus except
    in very strange positions but possessed intense sexual feelings
    in the right nipple as well as in the upper third of the thigh
    it is remarkable that not only is suckling apt to be accompanied
    by sexual pleasure in the mother but that in some cases the
    infant also appears to have a somewhat similar experience this
    is at all events indicated in a remarkable case recorded by
    fr linstinct sexuel second edition p 257 a female
    infant child of slightly neurotic heredity was weaned at the age
    of 14 months but so great was her affection for her mothers
    breasts though she had already become accustomed to other food
    that this was only accomplished with great difficulty and by
    allowing her still to caress the naked breasts several times a
    day this went on for many months when the mother becoming
    again pregnant insisted on putting an end to it so jealous was
    the child however that it was necessary to conceal from her the
    fact that her younger sister was suckled at her mothers breasts
    and once at the age of 3 when she saw her father aiding her
    mother to undress she became violently jealous of him this
    jealousy as well as the passion for her mothers breasts
    persisted to the age of puberty though she learned to conceal
    it at the age of 13 when menstruation began she noticed in
    dancing with her favorite girl friends that when her breasts came
    in contact with theirs she experienced a very agreeable
    sensation with erection of the nipples but it was not till the
    age of 16 that she observed that the sexual region took part in
    this excitement and became moist from this period she had erotic
    dreams about young girls she never experienced any attraction
    for young men but eventually married though having much esteem
    and affection for her husband she never felt any but the
    slightest sexual enjoyment in his arms and then only by evoking
    feminine images this case in which the sensations of an infant
    at the breast formed the point of departure of a sexual
    perversion which lasted through life is so far as i am aware

the bathantagonism of primitive christianity to the cult of the
skinits cult of personal filththe reasons which justified this
attitudethe worldwide tendency to association between extreme
cleanliness and sexual licentiousnessthe immorality associated with
public baths in europe down to modern times
the hygiene of the skin as well as its special cult consists in bathing
the bath as is well known attained under the romans a degree of
development which in europe at all events it has never reached before or
since and the modern visitor to rome carries away with him no more
impressive memory than that of the baths of caracalla since the coming of
christianity the cult of the skin and even its hygiene have never again
attained the same general and unquestioned exaltation the church killed
the bath st jerome tells us with approval that when the holy paula noted
that any of her nuns were too careful in this matter she would gravely
reprove them saying that the purity of the body and its garments means
the impurity of the soul21 or as the modern monk of mount athos still
declares a man should live in dirt as in a coat of mail so that his
soul may sojourn more securely within
    our knowledge of the bathing arrangements of roman days is
    chiefly derived from pompeii three public baths two for both
    men and women who were also probably allowed to use the third
    occasionally have so far been excavated in this small town as
    well as at least three private bathing establishments at least
    one of them for women while about a dozen houses contain
    complete baths for private use even in a little farm house at
    boscoreale two miles out of pompeii there was an elaborate
    series of bathing rooms it may be added that pompeii was well
    supplied with water all houses but the poorest had flowing
    jets and some houses had as many as ten jets see mans
    pompeii chapters xxvixxviii
    the church succeeded to the domination of imperial rome and
    adopted many of the methods of its predecessor but there could
    be no greater contrast than is presented by the attitude of
    paganism and of christianity toward the bath
    as regards the tendencies of the public baths in imperial rome
    some of the evidence is brought together in the section on this
    subject in rosenbaums geschichte der lustseuche im alterthume
    as regards the attitude of the earliest christian ascetics in
    this matter i may refer the reader to an interesting passage in
    leckys history of european morals vol ii pp 107112 in
    which are brought together a number of highly instructive
    examples of the manner in which many of the most eminent of the
    early saints deliberately cultivated personal filth
    in the middle ages when the extreme excesses of the early
    ascetics had died out and monasticiam became regulated monks
    generally took two baths a year when in health in illness they
    could be taken as often as necessary the rules of cluny only
    allowed three towels to the community one for the novices one
    for the professed and one for the lay brothers at the end of
    the seventeenth century madame de mazarin having retired to a
    convent of visitandines one day desired to wash her feet but
    the whole establishment was set in an uproar at such an idea and
    she received a direct refusal in 1760 the dominican richard
    wrote that in itself the bath is permissible but it must be
    taken solely for necessity not for pleasure the church taught
    and this lesson is still inculcated in convent schools that it
    is wrong to expose the body even to ones own gaze and it is not
    surprising that many holy persons boasted that they had never
    even washed their hands most of these facts have been taken
    from a franklin les soins de toilette one of the vie prive
    dautrefois series in which further details may be found
    in sixteenthcentury italy a land of supreme elegance and
    fashion superior even to france the conditions were the same
    and how little water found favor even with aristocratic ladies we
    may gather from the contemporary books on the toilet which
    abound with recipes against itch and similar diseases it should
    be added that burckhardt die cultur der renaissance in
    italien eighth edition volume ii p 92 considers that in
    spite of skin diseases the italians of the renaissance were the
    first nation in europe for cleanliness
    it is unnecessary to consider the state of things in other
    european countries the aristocratic conditions of former days
    are the plebeian conditions of today so far as england is
    concerned such documents as chadwicks report on the sanitary
    condition of the laboring population of great britain 1842
    sufficiently illustrate the ideas and the practices as regards
    personal cleanliness which prevailed among the masses during the
    nineteenth century and which to a large extent still prevail
a considerable amount of opprobrium has been cast upon the catholic church
for its direct and indirect influence in promoting bodily uncleanliness
nietzsche sarcastically refers to the facts and mr frederick harrison
asserts that the tone of the middle ages in the matter of dirt was a form
of mental disease it would be easy to quote many other authors to the
same effect
it is necessary to point out however that the writers who have committed
themselves to such utterances have not only done an injustice to
christianity but have shown a lack of historical insight christianity
was essentially and fundamentally a rebellion against the classic world
against its vices and against their concomitant virtues against both its
practices and its ideals it sprang up in a different part of the
mediterranean basin from a different level of culture it found its
supporters in a new and lower social stratum the cult of charity
simplicity and faith while not primarily ascetic became inevitably
allied with asceticism because from its point of view sexuality was the
very stronghold of the classic world in the second century the genius of
clement of alexandria and of the great christian thinkers who followed him
seized on all those elements in classic life and philosophy which could be
amalgamated with christianity without as they trusted destroying its
essence but in the matter of sexuality there could be no compromise and
the condemnation of sexuality involved the condemnation of the bath it
required very little insight and sagacity for the christians to
seethough we are now apt to slur over the factthat the cult of the
bath was in very truth the cult of the flesh22 however profound their
ignorance of anatomy physiology and psychology might be they had
before them ample evidence to show that the skin is an outlying sexual
zone and that every application which promoted the purity brilliance and
healthfulness of the skin constituted a direct appeal feeble or strong as
the case might be to those passions against which they were warring the
moral was evident better let the temporary garment of your flesh be
soaked with dirt than risk staining the radiant purity of your immortal
soul if christianity had not drawn that moral with clear insight and
relentless logic christianity would never have been a great force in the
world
    if any doubt is felt as to the really essential character of the
    connection between cleanliness and the sexual impulse it may be
    dispelled by the consideration that the association is by no
    means confined to christian europe if we go outside europe and
    even christendom altogether to the other side of the world we
    find it still well marked the wantonness of the luxurious people
    of tahiti when first discovered by european voyagers is
    notorious the areoi of tahiti a society largely constituted on
    a basis of debauchery is a unique institution so far as
    primitive peoples are concerned cook after giving one of the
    earliest descriptions of this society and its objects at tahiti
    hawkesworth an account of voyages etc 1775 vol ii p
    55 immediately goes on to describe the extreme and scrupulous
    cleanliness of the people of tahiti in every respect they not
    only bathed their bodies and clothes every day but in all
    respects they carried cleanliness to a higher point than even
    the politest assembly in europe another traveler bears similar
    testimony the inhabitants of the society isles are among all
    the nations of the south seas the most cleanly and the better
    sort of them carry cleanliness to a very great length they
    bathe morning and evening in the sea he remarks and afterward
    in fresh water to remove the particles of salt wash their hands
    before and after meals etc jr forster observations made
    during a voyage round the world 1798 p 398 and william
    ellis in his detailed description of the people of tahiti
    polynesian researches 1832 vol i especially chapters vi
    and ix while emphasizing their extreme cleanliness every
    person of every class bathing at least once or twice a day
    dwells on what he considers their unspeakable moral debasement
    notwithstanding the apparent mildness of their disposition and
    the cheerful vivacity of their conversation no portion of the
    human race was ever perhaps sunk lower in brutal licentiousness
    and moral degradation
    after leaving tahiti cook went on to new zealand here he found
    that the people were more virtuous than at tahiti and also he
    found less clean
it is however a mistake to suppose that physical uncleanliness ruled
supreme through medival and later times it is true that the eighteenth
century which saw the birth of so much that marks our modern world
witnessed a revival of the old ideal of bodily purity but the struggle
between two opposing ideals had been carried on for a thousand years or
more before this the church indeed was in this matter founded on an
impregnable rock but there never has been a time when influences outside
the church have not found a shelter somewhere those traditions of the
classic world which christianity threw aside as useless or worse quietly
reappeared in no respect was this more notably the case than in regard to
the love of pure water and the cult of the bath islam adopted the
complete roman bath and made it an institution of daily life a necessity
for all classes granada is the spot in europe where today we find the
most exquisite remains of mohammedan culture and though the fury of
christian conquest dragged the harrow over the soil of granada even yet
streams and fountains spring up there and gush abundantly and one seldom
loses the sound of the plash of water the flower of christian chivalry
and christian intelligence went to palestine to wrest the holy sepulchre
from the hands of pagan mohammedans they found there many excellent
things which they had not gone out to seek and the crusaders produced a
kind of premature and abortive renaissance the shadow of lost classic
things reflected on christian europe from the mirror of islam
    yet it is worth while to point out as bearing on the
    associations of the bath here emphasized that even in islam we
    may trace the existence of a religious attitude unfavorable to
    the bath before the time of mohammed there were no public baths
    in arabia and it was and is believed that baths are specially
    haunted by the djinnthe evil spirits mohammed himself was at
    first so prejudiced against public baths that he forbade both men
    and women to enter them afterward however he permitted men to
    use them provided they wore a cloth round the loins and women
    also when they could not conveniently bathe at home among the
    prophets sayings is found the assertion whatever woman enters
    a bath the devil is with her and all the earth is given to me
    as a place of prayer and as pure except the burial ground and
    the bath see eg ew lane arabian society in the middle
    ages 1883 pp 179183 although therefore the bath or
    hammam on grounds of ritual ablution hygiene and enjoyment
    speedily became universally popular in islam among all classes
    and both sexes mohammed himself may be said to have opposed it
among the discoveries which the crusaders made and brought home with them
one of the most notable was that of the bath which in its more elaborate
forms seems to have been absolutely forgotten in europe though roman
baths might everywhere have been found underground all authorities seem
to be agreed in finding here the origin of the revival of the public bath
it is to rome first and later to islam the lineal inheritor of classic
culture that we owe the cult of water and of physical purity even today
the turkish bath which is the most popular of elaborate methods of
bathing recalls by its characteristics and its name the fact that it is a
mohammedan survival of roman life
from the twelfth century onward baths have repeatedly been introduced from
the east and reintroduced afresh in slightly modified forms and have
flourished with varying degrees of success in the thirteenth century they
were very common especially in paris and though they were often used
more especially in germany by both sexes in common every effort was made
to keep them orderly and respectable these efforts were however always
unsuccessful in the end a bath always tended in the end to become a
brothel and hence either became unfashionable or was suppressed by the
authorities it is sufficient to refer to the reputation in england of
hothouses and bagnios it was not until toward the end of the
eighteenth century that it began to be recognized that the claims of
physical cleanliness were sufficiently imperative to make it necessary
that the fairly avoidable risks to morality in bathing should be avoided
and the unavoidable risks bravely incurred at the present day now that
we are accustomed to weave ingeniously together in the texture of our
lives the conflicting traditions of classic and christian days we have
almost persuaded ourselves that the pagan virtue of cleanliness comes next
after godliness and we bathe forgetful of the great moral struggle which
once went on around the bath but we refrain from building ourselves
palaces to bathe in and for the most part we bathe with exceeding
moderation23 it is probable that we may best harmonize our conflicting
traditions by rejecting not only the christian glorification of dirt but
also save for definitely therapeutic purposes the excessive heat
friction and stimulation involved by the classic forms of bathing our
reasonable ideal should render it easy and natural for every man woman
and child to have a simple bath tepid in winter cold in summer all the
year round

    outside the church there was a greater amount of cleanliness
    than we are sometimes apt to suppose it may indeed be said
    that the uncleanliness of holy men and women would have attracted
    no attention if it had corresponded to the condition generally
    prevailing before public baths were established bathing in
    private was certainly practiced thus ordericus vitalis in
    narrating the murder of mabel the countess de montgomery in
    normandy in 1082 casually mentions that she was lying on the bed
    after her bath ecclesiastical history book v chapter xiii
    in warm weather it would appear medival ladies bathed in
    streams as we may still see countrywomen do in russia bohemia
    and occasionally nearer home the statement of the historian
    michelet therefore that percival iseult and the other
    ethereal personages of medival times certainly never washed
    la sorcire p 110 requires some qualification
    in 1292 there were twentysix bathing establishments in paris
    and an attendant would go through the streets in the morning
    announcing that they were ready one could have a vapor bath only
    or a hot bath to succeed it as in the east no woman of bad
    reputation leper or vagabond was at this time allowed to
    frequent the baths which were closed on sundays and feastdays
    by the fourteenth century however the baths began to have a
    reputation for immorality as well as luxury and according to
    dufour the baths of paris rivaled those of imperial rome love
    prostitution and debauchery attracted the majority to the
    bathing establishments where everything was covered by a decent
    veil he adds that notwithstanding the scandal thus caused and
    the invectives of preachers all went to the baths young and
    old rich and poor and he makes the statement which seems to
    echo the constant assertion of the early fathers that a woman
    who frequented the baths returned home physically pure only at
    the expense of her moral purity
    in germany there was even greater freedom of manners in bathing
    though it would seem less real licentiousness even the
    smallest towns had their baths which were frequented by all
    classes as soon as the horn blew to announce that the baths were
    ready all hastened along the street the poorer folk almost
    completely undressing themselves before leaving their homes
    bathing was nearly always in common without any garment being
    worn women attendants commonly rubbed and massaged both sexes
    and the dressing room was frequently used by men and women in
    common this led to obvious evils the germans as weinhold
    points out die deutschen frauen im mittelalter 1882 bd ii
    pp 112 et seq have been fond of bathing in the open air in
    streams from the days of tacitus and csar until comparatively
    modern times when the police have interfered it was the same in
    switzerland poggio early in the sixteenth century found it the
    custom for men and women to bathe together at baden and said
    that he seemed to be assisting at the floralia of ancient rome
    or in platos republic snancour who quotes the passage de
    lamour 1834 vol i p 313 remarks that at the beginning of
    the nineteenth century there was still great liberty at the baden
    baths
    of the thirteenth century in england thomas wright homes of
    other days 1871 p 271 remarks the practice of warm bathing
    prevailed very generally in all classes of society and is
    frequently alluded to in the medival romances and stories for
    this purpose a large bathingtub was used people sometimes
    bathed immediately after rising in the morning and we find the
    bath used after dinner and before going to bed a bath was also
    often prepared for a visitor on his arrival from a journey and
    what seems still more singular in the numerous stories of
    amorous intrigues the two lovers usually began their interviews
    by bathing together
    in england the association between bathing and immorality was
    established with special rapidity and thoroughness baths were
    here officially recognized as brothels and this as early as the
    twelfth century under henry ii these organized bathbrothels
    were confined to southwark outside the walls of the city a
    quarter which was also given up to various sports and amusements
    at a later period hothouses bagnios and hummums the
    eastern hammam were spread all over london and remained
    closely identified with prostitution these names indeed
    constantly tending to become synonymous with brothels t
    wright homes of other days 1871 pp 494496 gives an
    account of them
    in france the baths being anathematized by both catholics and
    huguenots began to lose vogue and disappear morality gained
    remarks franklin but cleanliness lost even the charming and
    elegant margaret of navarre found it quite natural for a lady to
    mention incidentally to her lover that she had not washed her
    hands for a week then began an extreme tendency to use
    cosmetics essences perfumes and a fierce war with vermin up
    to the seventeenth century when some progress was made and
    persons who desired to be very elegant and refined were
    recommended to wash their faces nearly every day even in 1782
    however while a linen cloth was advised for the purpose of
    cleaning the face and hands the use of water was still somewhat
    discountenanced the use of hot and cold baths was now however
    beginning to be established in paris and elsewhere and the
    bathing establishments at the great european health resorts were
    also beginning to be put on the orderly footing which is now
    customary when casanova in the middle of the eighteenth
    century went to the public baths at berne he was evidently
    somewhat surprised when he found that he was invited to choose
    his own attendant from a number of young women and when he
    realized that these attendants were in all respects at the
    disposition of the bathers it is evident that establishments of
    this kind were then already dying out although it may be added
    that the customs described by casanova appear to have persisted
    in budapest and st petersburg almost or quite up to the present
    the great european public baths have long been above suspicion in
    this respect though homosexual practices are not quite
    excluded while it is well recognized that many kinds of hot
    baths now in use produce a powerfully stimulating action upon the
    sexual system and patients taking such baths for medical
    purposes are frequently warned against giving way to these
    influences
    the struggle which in former ages went on around bathing
    establishments has now been in part transferred to massage
    establishments massage is an equally powerful stimulant to the
    skin and the sexual sphereacting mainly by friction instead of
    mainly by heatand it has not yet attained that position of
    general recognition and popularity which in the case of bathing
    establishments renders it bad policy to court disrepute
    like bathing massage is a hygienic and therapeutic method of
    influencing the skin and subjacent tissues which together with
    its advantages has certain concomitant disadvantages in its
    liability to affect the sexual sphere this influence is apt to
    be experienced by individuals of both sexes though it is perhaps
    specially marked in women jouin quoted in paris journal de
    mdecine april 23 1893 found that of 20 women treated by

summaryfundamental importance of touchthe skin the mother of all the
other senses
the sense of touch is so universally diffused over the whole skin and in
so many various degrees and modifications and it is moreover so truly
the alpha and the omega of affection that a broken and fragmentary
treatment of the subject has been inevitable
the skin is the archological field of human and prehuman experience the
foundation on which all forms of sensory perception have grown up and as
sexual sensibility is among the most ancient of all forms of sensibility
the sexual instinct is necessarily in the main a comparatively slightly
modified form of general touch sensibility this primitive character of
the great region of tactile sensation its vagueness and diffusion the
comparatively unintellectual as well as unsthetic nature of the mental
conceptions which arise on the tactile basis make it difficult to deal
precisely with the psychology of touch the very same qualities however
serve greatly to heighten the emotional intensity of skin sensations so
that of all the great sensory fields the field of touch is at once the
least intellectual and the most massively emotional these qualities as
well as its intimate and primitive association with the apparatus of
tumescence and detumescence make touch the readiest and most powerful
channel by which the sexual sphere may be reached
in disentangling the phenomena of tactile sensibility ticklishness has
been selected for special consideration as a kind of sensation founded on
reflexes developing even before birth which is very closely related to
sexual phenomena it is as it were a play of tumescence on which
laughter supervenes as a play of detumescence it leads on to the more
serious phenomena of tumescence and it tends to die out after
adolescence at the period during which sexual relationships normally
begin such a view of ticklishness as a kind of modesty of the skin
existing merely to be destroyed need only be regarded as one of its
aspects ticklishness certainly arose from a nonsexual startingpoint
and may well have protective uses in the young animal
the readiness with which tactile sensibility takes on a sexual character
and forms reflex channels of communication with the sexual sphere proper
is illustrated by the existence of certain secondary sexual foci only
inferior in sexual excitability to the genital region we have seen that
the chief of these normal foci are situated in the orificial regions where
skin and mucous membrane meet and that the contact of any two orificial
regions between two persons of different sex brought together under
favorable conditions is apt when prolonged to produce a very intense
degree of sexual erethism this is a normal phenomenon in so far as it is
a part of tumescence and not a method of obtaining detumescence the kiss
is a typical example of these contacts while the nipple is of special
interest in this connection because we are thereby enabled to bring the
psychology of lactation into intimate relationship with the psychology of
sexual love
the extreme sensitiveness of the skin the readiness with which its
stimulation reverberates into the sexual sphere clearly brought out by
the present study enable us to understand better a very ancient
contestthe moral struggle around the bath there has always been a
tendency for the extreme cultivation of physical purity to lead on to the
excessive stimulation of the sexual sphere so that the christian ascetics
were entirely justified on their premises in fighting against the bath
and in directly or indirectly fostering a cult of physical uncleanliness
while however in the past there has clearly been a general tendency for
the cult of physical purity to be associated with moral licentiousness
and there are sufficient grounds for such an association it is important
to remember that it is not an inevitable and fatal association a
scrupulously clean person is by no means necessarily impelled to
licentiousness a physically unclean person is by no means necessarily
morally pure when we have eliminated certain forms of the bath which must
be regarded as luxuries rather than hygienic necessities though they
occasionally possess therapeutic virtues we have eliminated the most
violent appeals of the bath to the sexual impulse so imperative are the
demands of physical purity now becoming in general opinion that such
small risks to moral purity as may still remain are constantly and wisely
disregarded and the immoral traditions of the bath now for the most
part belong to the past
smell

the primitiveness of smellthe anatomical seat of the olfactory
centrespredominance of smell among the lower mammalsits diminished
importance in manthe attention paid to odors by savages
the first more highly organized sense to arise on the diffused tactile
sensitivity of the skin is in most cases without doubt that of smell at
first indeed olfactory sensibility is not clearly differentiated from
general tactile sensibility the pit of thickened and ciliated epithelium
or the highly mobile antenn which in many lower animals are sensitive to
odorous stimuli are also extremely sensitive to tactile stimuli this is
for instance the case with the snail in whom at the same time olfactive
sensibility seems to be spread over the whole body24 the sense of smell
is gradually specialized and when taste also begins to develop a kind of
chemical sense is constituted the organ of smell however speedily
begins to rise in importance as we ascend the zological scale in the
lower vertebrates when they began to adopt a life on dry land the sense
of smell seems to have been that part of their sensory equipment which
proved most useful under the new conditions and it developed with
astonishing rapidity edinger finds that in the brain of reptiles the
area olfactoria is of enormous extent covering indeed the greater
part of the cortex though it may be quite true as herrick remarks that
while smell is preponderant it is perhaps not correct to attribute an
exclusively olfactory tone to the cerebral activities of the sauropsida
or even the ichthyopsida among most mammals however in any case
smell is certainly the most highly developed of the senses it gives the
first information of remote objects that concern them it gives the most
precise information concerning the near objects that concern them it is
the sense in terms of which most of their mental operations must be
conducted and their emotional impulses reach consciousness among the apes
it has greatly lost importance and in man it has become almost
rudimentary giving place to the supremacy of vision
    prof g elliot smith a leading authority on the brain has well
    summarized the facts concerning the predominance of the olfactory
    region in the mammal brain and his conclusions may be quoted it
    should be premised that elliot smith divides the brain into
    rhinencephalon and neopallium rhinencephalon designates the
    regions which are preeminently olfactory in function the
    olfactory bulb its peduncle the tuberculum olfactorium and
    locus perforatus the pyriform lobe the paraterminal body and
    the whole hippocampal formation the neopallium is the dorsal cap
    of the brain with frontal parietal and occipital areas
    comprehending all that part of the brain which is the seat of the
    higher associative activities reaching its fullest development
    in man
    in the early mammals the olfactory areas form by far the greater
    part of the cerebral hemisphere which is not surprising when it
    is recalled that the forebrain is in the primitive brain
    essentially an appendage so to speak of the smell apparatus
    when the cerebral hemisphere comes to occupy such a dominant
    position in the brain it is perhaps not unnatural to find that
    the sense of smell is the most influential and the chief source
    of information to the animal or perhaps it would be more
    accurate to say that the olfactory sense which conveys general
    information to the animal such as no other sense can bring
    concerning its prey whether near or far hidden or exposed is
    much the most serviceable of all the avenues of information to
    the lowly mammal leading a terrestrial life and therefore
    becomes predominant and its particular domainthe
    forebrainbecomes the ruling portion of the nervous system
    this early predominance of the sense of smell persists in most
    mammals unless an aquatic mode of life interferes and deposes
    it compare the cetacea sirenia and pinnipedia for
    example even though a large neopallium develops to receive
    visual auditory tactile and other impressions pouring into the
    forebrain in the anthropoidea alone of nonaquatic mammals the
    olfactory regions undergo an absolute and not only relative as
    in the carnivora and ungulata dwindling which is equally
    shared by the human brain in common with those of the other
    simiid the cercopithecid and the cebid but all the
    parts of the rhinencephalon which are so distinct in macrosmatic
    mammals can also be recognized in the human brain the small
    ellipsoidal olfactory bulb is moored so to speak on the
    cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone by the olfactory nerves so
    that as the place of attachment of the olfactory peduncle to the
    expanding cerebral hemisphere becomes removed as a result of the
    forward extension of the hemisphere progressively farther and
    farther backward the peduncle becomes greatly stretched and
    elongated and as this stretching involves the gray matter
    without lessening the number of nervefibres in the olfactory
    tract the peduncle becomes practically what it is usually
    calledie the olfactory tract the tuberculum olfactorium
    becomes greatly reduced and at the same time flattened so that
    it is not easy to draw a line of demarcation between it and the
    anterior perforated space the anterior rhinal fissure which is
    present in the early human foetus vanishes almost if not
    altogether in the adult part of the posterior rhinal fissure is
    always present in the incisura temporalis and sometimes
    especially in some of the noneuropean races the whole of the
    posterior rhinal fissure is retained in that typical form which
    we find in the anthropoid apes g elliot smith in
    descriptive and illustrated catalogue of the physiological
    series of comparative anatomy contained in the museum of the
    royal college of surgeons of england second edition vol ii
    a full statement of elliot smiths investigations with diagrams
    is given by bullen journal of mental science july 1899 it
    may be added that the whole subject of the olfactory centres has
    been thoroughly studied by elliot smith as well as by edinger
    mayer and cl herrick in the journal of comparative
    neurology edited by the last named numerous discussions and
    summaries bearing on the subject will be found from 1896 onward
    regarding the primitive senseorgans of smell in the various
    invertebrate groups some information will be found in ab
    griffithss physiology of the invertebrata chapter xi
the predominance of the olfactory area in the nervous system of the
vertebrates generally has inevitably involved intimate psychic
associations between olfactory stimuli and the sexual impulse for most
mammals not only are all sexual associations mainly olfactory but the
impressions received by this sense suffice to dominate all others an
animal not only receives adequate sexual excitement from olfactory
stimuli but those stimuli often suffice to counterbalance all the
evidence of the other senses
    we may observe this very well in the case of the dog thus a
    young dog well known to me who had never had connection with a
    bitch but was always in the society of its father once met the
    latter directly after the elder dog had been with a bitch he
    immediately endeavored to behave toward the elder dog in spite
    of angry repulses exactly as a dog behaves toward a bitch in
    heat the messages received by the sense of smell were
    sufficiently urgent not only to set the sexual mechanism in
    action but to overcome the experiences of a lifetime there is
    an interesting chapter on the sense of smell in the mental life
    of the dog in giesslers psychologie des geruches 1894
    chapter xi passy in the appendix to his memoir on olfaction
    lanne psychologique 1895 gives the result of some
    interesting experiments as to the effects of perfume on dogs
    civet and castoreum were found to have the most powerfully
    exciting effect
    the influences of smell are equally omnipotent in the sexual life
    of many insects thus fr has found that in cockchafers sexual
    coupling failed to take place when the antenn which are the
    organs of smell were removed he also found that males after
    they had coupled with females proved sexually attractive to
    other males comptes rendus de la socit de biologie may 21
    1898 fr similarly found that in a species of bombyx males
    after contact with females sometimes proved attractive to other
    males although no abnormal relationships followed soc de
    biol july 30 1898
with the advent of the higher apes and especially of man all this has
been changed the sense of smell indeed still persists universally and
it is still also exceedingly delicate though often neglected25 it is
moreover a useful auxiliary in the exploration of the external world
for in contrast to the very few sensations furnished to us by touch and
by taste we are acquainted with a vast number of smells though the
information they give us is frequently vague an experienced perfumer
says piesse will have two hundred odors in his laboratory and can
distinguish them all to a sensitive nose nearly everything smells passy
goes so far as to state that he has never met with any object that is
really inodorous when one pays attention to it not even excepting glass
and though we can scarcely accept this statement absolutelyespecially
in view of the careful experiments of ayrton which show that contrary
to a common belief metals when perfectly clean and free from traces of
contact with the skin or with salt solutions have no smellodor is still
extremely widely diffused this is especially the case in hot countries
and the experiments of the cambridge anthropological expedition on the
sense of smell of the papuans were considerably impeded by the fact that
at torres straits everything even water seemed to have a smell savages
are often accused more or less justly of indifference to bad odors they
are very often however keenly alive to the significance of smells and
their varieties though it does not appear that the sense of smell is
notably more developed in savage than in civilized peoples odors also
continue to play a part in the emotional life of man more especially in
hot countries nevertheless both in practical life and in emotional life
in science and in art smell is at the best under normal conditions
merely an auxiliary if the sense of smell were abolished altogether the
life of mankind would continue as before with little or no sensible
modification though the pleasures of life and especially of eating and
drinking would be to some extent diminished

    and fish which are becoming high like popoya which smells

    which are beginning to go bad seem the best to them while the
    fresh and natural odors which we prefer seem merely to say to
    them we are not yet eatable a taste for putrefying food
    common among savages by no means necessarily involves a distaste
    for agreeable scents and even among europeans there is a
    widespread taste for offensively smelling and putrid foods
    especially cheese and game
    the natives of torres straits were carefully examined by dr cs
    myers with regard to their olfactory acuteness and olfactory
    preferences it was found that acuteness was if anything
    slightly greater than among europeans this appeared to be
    largely due to the careful attention they pay to odors the
    resemblances which they detected among different odorous
    substances were frequently found to rest on real chemical
    affinities the odors they were observed to dislike most
    frequently were asafoetida valerianic acid and civet the last

smellthe classification of odorsthe special characteristics of
olfactory sensation in mansmell as the sense of imaginationodors as
nervous stimulantsvasomotor and muscular effectsodorous substances as
drugs
during the eighteenth century a great impetus was given to the
physiological and psychological study of the senses by the philosophical
doctrines of locke and the english school generally which then prevailed
in europe these thinkers had emphasized the immense importance of the
information derived through the senses in building up the intellect so
that the study of all the sensory channels assumed a significance which it
had never possessed before the olfactory sense fully shared in the
impetus thus given to sensory investigation at the beginning of the
nineteenth century a distinguished french physician hippolyte cloquet a
disciple of cabanis devoted himself more especially to this subject
after publishing in 1815 a preliminary work he issued in 1821 his
osphrsiologie ou trait des odeurs du sens et des organes de
lolfaction a complete monograph on the anatomy physiology psychology
and pathology of the olfactory organ and its functions and a work that
may still be consulted with profit if indeed it can even yet be said to
be at every point superseded after cloquets time the study of the sense
of smell seems to have fallen into some degree of discredit for more than
half a century no important progress was made in this field serious
investigators seemed to have become shy of the primitive senses generally
and the subject of smell was mainly left to those interested in curious
subjects many interesting observations were however incidentally made
thus laycock who was a pioneer in so many bypaths of psychology and
anthropology showed a special interest in the olfactory sense and
frequently touched on it in his nervous diseases of women and
elsewhere the writer who more than any other has in recent years restored
the study of the sense of smell from a bypath to its proper position as a
highway for investigation is without doubt professor zwaardemaker of
utrecht the invention of his first olfactometer in 1888 and the
appearance in 1895 of his great work die physiologie des geruchs have
served to give the physiology of the sense of smell an assured status and
to open the way anew for much fruitful investigation while a number of
inquirers in many countries have had their attention directed to the
elucidation of this sense
notwithstanding however the amount of work which has been done in this
field during recent years it cannot be said that the body of assured
conclusions so far reached is large the most fundamental principles of
olfactory physiology and psychology are still somewhat vague and
uncertain although sensations of smell are numerous and varied in this
respect approaching the sensations of vision and hearing smell still
remains close to touch in the vagueness of its messages while the most
sensitive of the senses remarks passy it is the least precise the
difficulty of classifying them the impossibility of so controlling them
as to found upon them any art it seems better therefore not to attempt
to force the present study of a special aspect of olfaction into any
general scheme which may possibly not be really valid
    the earliest and most general tendency in regard to the theory of
    smell was to regard it as a kind of chemical sense directly
    stimulated by minute particles of solid substance a vibratory
    theory of smell however making it somewhat analogous to
    hearing easily presents itself when i first began the study of
    physiology in 1881 a speculation of this kind presented itself
    to my mind long before philipp von walther a professor at
    landshut had put forward a dynamic theory of olfaction
    physiologie des menschen 18078 vol ii p 278 it is a
    purely dynamic operation of the odorous substance in the
    olfactory organ he stated odor is conveyed by the air he
    believed in the same way as heat it must be added that his
    reasons for this theory will not always bear examination more
    recently a similar theory has been seriously put forward in
    various quarters sir william ramsay tentatively suggested such a
    theory nature vol xxv p 187 in analogy with light and
    sound haycraft proceedings of the royal society of edinburgh
    188387 and brain 188788 largely starting from
    mendelieffs law of periodicity similarly sought to bring smell
    into line with the higher senses arguing that molecules with the
    same vibration have the same smell rutherford nature august
    11 1892 p 343 attaching importance to the evidence brought
    forward by von brunn showing that the olfactory cells terminate
    in very delicate short hairs also stated his belief that the
    different qualities of smell result from differences in the
    frequency and form of the vibrations initiated by the action of
    the chemical molecules on these olfactory cells though he
    admitted that such a conception involved a very subtle conception
    of molecular vibration vaschide and van melle paris academy of
    sciences december 26 1899 have again argued that smell is
    produced by rays of short wavelengths analogous to lightrays
    rntgen rays etc chemical action is however a very important
    factor in the production of odors this has been well shown by
    ayrton nature september 8 1898 we seem to be forced in the
    direction of a chemicovibratory theory as pointed out by
    southerden nature march 26 1903 the olfactory cells being
    directly stimulated not by the ordinary vibrations of the
    molecules but by the agitations accompanying chemical changes
    the vibratory hypothesis of the action of odors has had some
    influence on the recent physiologists who have chiefly occupied
    themselves with olfaction it is probable zwaardemaker writes
    lanne psychologique 1898 that aroma is a
    physicochemical attribute of the molecules he points out that
    there is an intimate analogy between color and odor and remarks
    that this analogy leads us to suppose in an aroma ether
    vibrations of which the period is determined by the structure of
    the molecule
    since the physiology of olfaction is yet so obscure it is not
    surprising that we have no thoroughly scientific classification
    of smells notwithstanding various ambitious attempts to reach a
    classification the classification adopted by zwaardemaker is
    founded on the ancient scheme of linnus and may here be
    reproduced
    i ethereal odors chiefly esters rimmels fruity series
    ii aromatic odors terpenes camphors and the spicy
    herbaceous rosaceous and almond series the chemical types are
    well determined cineol eugenol anethol geraniol
    benzaldehyde
    iii the balsamic odors chiefly aldehydes rimmels jasmin
    violet and balsamic series with the chemical types terpineol

    on this subject will be found in the second volume of lanne

    for 1898 zwaardemaker presents a full summary of his work and
    views les sensations olfactives leurs combinaisons et leurs
    compensations a convenient but less authoritative summary of
    the facts of normal and pathological olfaction will be found in a
    little volume of the actualits mdicales series by dr collet
    lodorat et ses troubles 1904 in a little book entitled
    wegweiser zu einer psychologie des geruches 1894 giessler has
    sought to outline a psychology of smell but his sketch can only
    be regarded as tentative and provisional
at the outset nevertheless it seems desirable that we should at least
have some conception of the special characteristics which mark the great
and varied mass of sensations reaching the brain through the channel of
the olfactory organ the main special character of olfactory images seems
to be conditioned by the fact that they are intermediate in character
between those of touch or taste and those of sight or sound that they
have much of the vagueness of the first and something of the richness and
variety of the second sthetically also they occupy an intermediate
position between the higher and the lower senses26 they are at the
same time less practically useful than either the lower or the higher
senses they furnish us with a great mass of what we may call
bysensations which are of little practical use but inevitably become
intimately mixed with the experiences of life by association and thus
acquire an emotional significance which is often very considerable their
emotional force it may well be is connected with the fact that their
anatomical seat is the most ancient part of the brain they lie in a
remote almost disused storehouse of our minds and show the fascination or
the repulsiveness of all vague and remote things it is for this reason
that they areto an extent that is remarkable when we consider that they
are much more precise than touch sensationssubject to the influence of
emotional associations the very same odor may be at one moment highly
pleasant at the next moment highly unpleasant in accordance with the
emotional attitude resulting from its associations visual images have no
such extreme flexibility they are too definite to be so easily
influenced our feelings about the beauty of a flower cannot oscillate so
easily or so far as may our feelings about the agreeableness of its odor
our olfactory experiences thus institute a more or less continuous series
of bysensations accompanying us through life of no great practical
significance but of considerable emotional significance from their
variety their intimacy their associational facility their remote
ancestral reverberations through our brains
it is the existence of these characteristicsat once so vague and so
specific so useless and so intimatewhich led various writers to
describe the sense of smell as above all others the sense of
imagination no sense has so strong a power of suggestion the power of
calling up ancient memories with a wider and deeper emotional
reverberation while at the same time no sense furnishes impressions which
so easily change emotional color and tone in harmony with the recipients
general attitude odors are thus specially apt both to control the
emotional life and to become its slaves with the use of incense religions
have utilized the imaginative and symbolical virtues of fragrance all the
legends of the saints have insisted on the odor of sanctity that exhales
from the bodies of holy persons especially at the moment of death under
the conditions of civilization these primitive emotional associations of
odor tend to be dispersed but on the other hand the imaginative side of
the olfactory sense becomes accentuated and personal idiosyncrasies of
all kinds tend to manifest themselves in the sphere of smell
    rousseau in emile bk ii regarded smell as the sense of the
    imagination so also at an earlier period it was termed
    according to cloquet by cardano cloquet frequently insisted on
    the qualities of odors which cause them to appeal to the
    imagination on their irregular and inconstant character on
    their power of intoxicating the mind on some occasions on the
    curious individual and racial preferences in the matter of odors
    he remarked on the fact that the persians employed asafoetida as
    a seasoning while valerian was accounted a perfume in antiquity
    cloquet osphrsiologie pp 28 45 71 112 it may be
    added as a curious example familiar to most people of the
    dependence of the emotional tone of a smell on its associations
    that while the exhalations of other peoples bodies are
    ordinarily disagreeable to us such is not the case with our own
    this is expressed in the crude and vigorous dictum of the
    elizabethan poet marston every mans dung smell sweet i his
    own nose there are doubtless many implications moral as well
    as psychological in that statement
    the modern authorities on olfaction passy and zwaardemaker both
    alike insist on the same characteristics of the sense of smell
    its extreme acuity and yet its vagueness we live in a world of
    odor zwaardemaker remarks lanne psychologique 1898 p
    203 as we live in a world of light and of sound but smell
    yields us no distinct ideas grouped in regular order still less
    that are fixed in the memory as a grammatical discipline
    olfactory sensations awake vague and halfunderstood perceptions
    which are accompanied by very strong emotion the emotion
    dominates us but the sensation which was the cause of it remains
    unperceived even in the same individual there are wide
    variations in the sensitiveness to odors at different times more
    especially as regards faint odors passy lanne
    psychologique 1895 p 387 brings forward some observations on
    this point
    maudsley noted the peculiarly suggestive power of odors there
    are certain smells he remarked which never fail to bring back
    to me instantly and visibly scenes of my boyhood many of us
    could probably say the same another writer e dillon a
    neglected sense nineteenth century april 1894 remarks that
    no sense has a stronger power of suggestion
    ribot has made an interesting investigation as to the prevalence
    and nature of the emotional memory of odors psychology of the
    emotions chapter xi by emotional memory is meant the
    spontaneous or voluntary revivability of the image olfactory or
    other for the general question see an article by f pillon
    la mmoire affective son importance thorique et pratique
    revue philosophique february 1901 also paulhan sur la
    mmoire affective revue philosophique december 1902 and
    january 1903 ribot found that 40 per cent of persons are
    unable to revive any such images of taste or smell 48 per cent
    could revive some 12 per cent declared themselves capable of
    reviving all or nearly all at pleasure in some persons there
    is no necessary accompanying revival of visual or tactile
    representations but in the majority the revived odor ultimately
    excites a corresponding visual image the odors most frequently
    recalled were pinks musk violets heliotrope carbolic acid
    the smell of the country of grass etc piron revue
    philosophique december 1902 has described the special power
    possessed by vague odors in his own case of evoking ancient
    impressions
    dr jn mackenzie american journal of the medical sciences
    january 1886 considers that civilization exerts an influence in
    heightening or encouraging the influence of olfaction as it
    affects our emotions and judgment and that in the same way as
    we ascend the social scale the more readily our minds are
    influenced and perhaps perverted by impressions received through
    the sense of smell
odors are powerful stimulants to the whole nervous system causing like
other stimulants an increase of energy which if excessive or prolonged
leads to nervous exhaustion thus it is well recognized in medicine that
the aromatics containing volatile oils such as anise cinnamon
cardamoms cloves coriander and peppermint are antispasmodics and
ansthetics and that they stimulate digestion circulation and the
nervous system in large doses producing depression the carefully
arranged plethysmographic experiments of shields at the johns hopkins
university have shown that olfactory sensations by their action on the
vasomotor system cause an increase of blood in the brain and sometimes in
addition stimulation of the heart musk wintergreen wood violet and
especially heliotrope were found to act strongly in these ways27
frs experiments with the dynamometer and the ergograph have greatly
contributed to illustrate the stimulating effects of odors thus he found
that smelling musk suffices to double muscular effort with a number of
odorous substances he has found that muscular work is temporarily
heightened when taste stimulation was added the increase of energy
notably when using lemon was colossal a kind of sensorial
intoxication could be produced by the inhalation of odors and the whole
system stimulated to greater activity the visual acuity was increased
and electric and general excitability heightened28 such effects may be
obtained in perfectly healthy persons though both shields and fr have
found that in highly nervous persons the effects are liable to be much
greater it is doubtless on this account that it is among civilized
peoples that attention is chiefly directed to perfumes and that under the
conditions of modern life the interest in olfaction and its study has been
revived
it is the genuinely stimulant qualities of odorous substances which led to
the widespread use of the more potent among them by ancient physicians
and has led a few modern physicians to employ them still thus vanilla
according to eloy deserves to be much more frequently used
therapeutically than it is on account of its excitomotor properties he
states that its qualities as an excitant of sexual desire have long been
recognized and that fonssagrives used to prescribe it for sexual
frigidity29

odors felt by sexual inverts
in approaching the specifically sexual aspect of odor in the human species
we may start from the fundamental facta fact we seek so far as possible
to disguise in our ordinary social relationsthat all men and women are
odorous this is marked among all races the powerful odor of many though
not all negroes is well known it is by no means due to uncleanly habits
and joest remarks that it is even increased by cleanliness which opens
the pores of the skin according to sir h johnston it is most marked in
the armpits and is stronger in men than in women pruner bey describes it
as ammoniacal and rancid it is like the odor of the hegoat the odor
varies not only individually but according to the tribe castellani
states that the negress of the congo has merely a slight got de
noisette which is agreeable rather than otherwise monbuttu women
according to parke have a strong gorgonzola perfume and emin told parke
that he could distinguish the members of different tribes by their
characteristic odor in the same way the nicobarese according to man can
distinguish a member of each of the six tribes of the archipelago by
smell the odor of australian blacks is less strong than that of negroes
and has been described as of a phosphoric character the south american
indians dorbigny stated have an odor stronger than that of europeans
though not as strong as most negroes it is marked latcham states even
among those who like the araucanos bathe constantly the chinese have a
musky odor the odor of many peoples is described as being of garlic30
a south sea islander we are told by charles de varigny on coming to
sydney and seeing the ladies walking about the streets and apparently
doing nothing expressed much astonishment adding with a gesture of
contempt and they have no smell it is by no means true however that
europeans are odorless they are indeed considerably more odorous than
are many other racesfor instance the japaneseand there is doubtless
some association between the greater hairiness of europeans and their
marked odor since the sebaceous glands are part of the hair apparatus a
japanese anthropologist adachi has published an interesting study on the
odor of europeans31 which he describes as a strong and pungent
smellsometimes sweet sometimes bitterof varying strength in
different individuals absent in children and the aged and having its
chief focus in the armpits which however carefully they are washed
immediately become odorous again adachi has found that the sweatglands
are larger in europeans than in the japanese among whom a strong personal
odor is so uncommon that armpit stink is a disqualification for the
army it is certainly true that the white races smell less strongly than
most of the dark races odor seeming to be correlated to some extent with
intensity of pigmentation as well as with hairiness but even the most
scrupulously clean europeans all smell this fact may not always be
obvious to human nostrils apart from intimate contact but it is well
known to dogs to whom their masters are recognizable by smell when hue
traveled in tibet in chinese disguise he was not detected by the natives
but the dogs recognized him as a foreigner by his smell and barked at him
many chinese can tell by smell when a european has been in a room32
there are however some europeans who can recognize and distinguish their
friends by smell the case has been recorded of a man who with bandaged
eyes could recognize his acquaintances at the distance of several paces
the moment they entered the room in another case a deaf and blind mute
woman in massachusetts knew all her acquaintances by smell and could sort
linen after it came from the wash by the odor alone governesses have been
known to be able when blindfolded to recognize the ownership of their
pupils garments by smell such a case is known to me such odor is
usually described as being agreeable but not one person in fifty it is
stated is able to distinguish it with sufficient precision to use it as a
method of recognition among some races however this aptitude would
appear to be better developed dr cs myers at sarawak noted that his
malay boy sorted the clean linen according to the skinodor of the
wearer33 chinese servants are said to do the same as well as
australians and natives of luzon34
    although the distinctively individual odor of most persons is not
    sufficiently marked to be generally perceptible there are cases
    in which it is more distinct to all nostrils the most famous
    case of this kind is that of alexander the great who according
    to plutarch exhaled so sweet an odor that his tunics were soaked
    with aromatic perfume convivalium disputationum lib i
    quest 6 malherbe cujas and haller are said to have diffused
    a musky odor the agreeable odor of walt whitman has been
    remarked by kennedy and others the perfume exhaled by many holy
    men and women so often noted by ancient writers discussed by
    grres in the second volume of his christliche mystik and
    which has entered into current phraseology as a merely
    metaphorical odor of sanctity was doubtless due as hammond
    first pointed out to abnormal nervous conditions for it is well
    known that such conditions affect the odor and in insanity for
    instance the presence is noted of bodily odors which have
    sometimes even been considered of diagnostic importance jb
    friedreich allgemeine diagnostik der psychischen krankheiten
    second edition 1832 pp 910 quotes passages from various
    authors on this point which he accepts various writers of more
    recent date have made similar observations
    the odor of sanctity was specially noted at death and was
    doubtless confused with the odor mortis which frequently
    precedes death and by some is regarded as an almost certain
    indication of its approach in the british medical journal for
    may and june 1898 will be found letters from several
    correspondents substantiating this point one of these
    correspondents dr tuckey of tywardwreath cornwall mentions
    that he has in cornwall often seen ravens flying over houses in
    which persons lay dying evidently attracted by a characteristic
    odor
it must be borne in mind however that while every person has to a
sensitive nose a distinguishing odor we must regard that odor either as
but one of the various sensations given off by the body or else as a
combination of two or more of these emanations the body in reality gives
off a number of different odors the most important of these are 1 the
general skin odor a faint but agreeable fragrance often to be detected
on the skin even immediately after washing 2 the smell of the hair and
scalp 3 the odor of the breath 4 the odor of the armpit 5 the
odor of the feet 6 the perineal odor 7 in men the odor of the
preputial smegma 8 in women the odor of the mons veneris that of
vulvar smegma that of vaginal mucus and the menstrual odor all these
are odors which may usually be detected though sometimes only in a very
faint degree in healthy and wellwashed persons under normal conditions
it is unnecessary here to take into account the special odors of various
secretions and excretions35
it is a significant fact both as regards the ancestral sexual connections
of the body odors and their actual sexual associations today that as
hippocrates long ago noted it is not until puberty that they assume their
adult characteristics the infant the adult the aged person each has
his own kind of smell and as monin remarks it might be possible within
certain limits to discover the age of a person by his odor jorg in 1832
pointed out that in girls the appearance of a specific smell of the
excreta indicates the establishment of puberty and kaan in his
psychopathia sexualis remarked that at puberty the sweat gives out a
more acrid odor resembling musk in both sexes puberty adolescence
early manhood and womanhood are marked by a gradual development of the
adult odor of skin and excreta in general harmony with the secondary
sexual development of hair and pigment venturi indeed has not without
reason described the odor of the body as a secondary sexual
character36 it may be added that as is the case with the pigment in
various parts of the body in women some of these odors tend to become
exaggerated in sympathy with sexual and other emotional states
    the odor of the infant is said to be of butyric acid that of old
    people to resemble dry leaves continent young men have been said
    by many ancient writers to smell more strongly than the unchaste
    and some writers have described as seminal odoran odor
    resembling that of animals in heat faintly recalling that of the
    hegoat according to venturithe exhalations of the skin at
    such times
    during sexual excitement as women can testify a man very
    frequently if not normally gives out an odor which as usually
    described proceeds from the skin the breath or both grimaldi
    states that it is as of rancid butter others say it resembles
    chloroform it is said to be sometimes perceptible for a distance
    of several feet and to last for several hours after coitus
    various quotations are given by gould and pyle anomalies and
    curiosities of medicine section on human odors pp 397403
    st philip neri is said to have been able to recognize a chaste
    man by smell
    during menstruation girls and young women frequently give off an
    odor which is quite distinct from that of the menstrual fluid
    and is specially marked in the breath which may smell of
    chloroform or violets pouchet confirmed by raciborski trait
    de la menstruation 1868 p 74 stated that about a day before
    the onset of menstruation a characteristic smell is exuded
    menstruating girls are also said sometimes to give off a smell of
    leather aubert of lyons as quoted by galopin describes the
    odor of the skin of a woman during menstruation as an agreeable
    aromatic or acidulous perfume of chloroform character by some
    this is described as emanating especially from the armpits
    sandras quoted by raciborski knew a lady who could always tell
    by a sensation of faintness and malaiseapparently due to a
    sensation of smellwhen she was in contact with a menstruating
    woman i am acquainted with a man having strong olfactory
    sympathies and antipathies who detects the presence of
    menstruation by smell it is said that hortense bar who
    accompanied her lover the botanist commerson to the pacific
    disguised as a man was recognized by the natives as a woman by
    means of smell
    women like men frequently give out an odor during coitus or
    strong sexual excitement this odor may be entirely different
    from that normally emanating from the woman of an acid or
    hircine character and sufficiently strong to remain in a room
    for a considerable period many of the ancient medical writers
    as quoted by schurigius parthenologia p 286 described the
    goaty smell produced by venery especially in women they
    regarded it as specially marked in harlots and in the newly
    married and sometimes even considered it a certain sign of
    defloration the case has been recorded of a woman who emitted a
    rose odor for two days after coitus mcbride quoted by kiernan
    in an interesting summary odor in pathology doctors
    magazine december 1900 there was it is said journal des
    savans 1684 p 39 quoting from the journal dangleterre a
    monk in prague who could recognize by smell the chastity of the
    women who approached him this monk it is added when he died
    was composing a new science of odors
    gustav klein as quoted by adler die mangelhafte
    geschlechtsempfindungen des weibes p 25 argues that the
    special function of the glands at the vulvar orificethe
    glandul vestibulares majoresis to give out an odorous
    secretion to act as an attraction to the male this relic of
    sexual periodicity no longer however playing an important part
    in the human species the vulvar secretion however it may be
    added still has a more aromatic odor than the vaginal secretion
    with its simple mucous odor very clearly perceived during
    parturition
    it may be added that we still know extremely little concerning
    the sexual odors of women among primitive peoples ploss and
    bartels are only able to bring forward das weib 1901 bd 1
    p 218 a statement concerning the women of new caledonia who
    according to moncelon when young and ardent give out during
    coitus a powerful odor which no ablution will remove in abnormal
    states of sexual excitement such odor may be persistent and
    according to an ancient observation a nymphomaniac whose
    periods of sexual excitement lasted all through the springtime
    at these periods always emitted a goatlike odor it has been said
    g tourdes art aphrodisie dictionnaire encyclopdique des
    sciences mdicales that the erotic temperament is characterized
    by a special odor
if the body odors tend to develop at puberty to be maintained during
sexual life especially in sympathy with conditions of sexual disturbance
and to become diminished in old age being thus a kind of secondary sexual
character we should expect them to be less marked in those cases in which
the primary sexual characters are less marked it is possible that this is
actually the case hagen in his sexuelle osphrsiologie quotes from
roubauds trait de limpuissance the statement that the body odor of
the castrated differs from that of normal individuals burdach had
previously stated that the odor of the eunuch is less marked than that of
the normal man
it is thus possible that defective sexual development tends to be
associated with corresponding olfactory defect heschl37 has reported a
case in which absence of both olfactory nerves coincided with defective
development of the sexual organs fr remarks that the impotent show a
repugnance for sexual odors dr kiernan informs me that in women after
ophorectomy he has noted a tendency to diminished and occasionally
increased sense of smell these questions however await more careful
and extended observation
a very significant transition from the phenomena of personal odor to those
of sexual attraction by personal odor is to be found in the fact that
among the peoples inhabiting a large part of the worlds surface the
ordinary salutation between friends is by mutual smelling of the person
in some form or another the method of salutation by applying the nose to
the nose face or hand of a friend in greeting is found throughout a
large part of the pacific among the papuans the eskimo the hill tribes
of india in africa and elsewhere38 thus among a certain hill tribe
in india according to lewin they smell a friends cheek in their
language they do not say give me a kiss but they say smell me and
on the gambia according to f moore when the men salute the women
they instead of shaking their hands put it up to their noses and smell
twice to the back of it here we have very clearly a recognition of the
emotional value of personal odor widely prevailing throughout the world
the salutation on an olfactory basis may indeed be said to be more
general than the salutation on a tactile basis on which european
handshaking rests each form involving one of the two most intimate and
emotional senses the kiss may be said to be a development proceeding both
from the olfactory and the tactile bases with perhaps some other elements
as well and is too complex to be regarded as a phenomenon of either
purely tactile or purely olfactory origin39
as the sole factor in sexual selection olfaction must be rare it is said
that asiatic princes have sometimes caused a number of the ladies to race
in the seraglio garden until they were heated their garments have then
been brought to the prince who has selected one of them solely by the
odor40 there was here a sexual selection mainly by odor any exclusive
efficacy of the olfactory sense is rare not so much because the
impressions of this sense are inoperative but because agreeable personal
odors are not sufficiently powerful and the olfactory organ is too
obtuse to enable smell to take precedence of sight nevertheless in many
people it is probable that certain odors especially those that are
correlated with a healthy and sexually desirable person tend to be
agreeable they are fortified by their association with the loved person
sometimes to an irresistible degree and their potency is doubtless
increased by the fact to which reference has already been made that many
odors including some bodily odors are nervous stimulants
it is possible that the sexual associations of odors have been still
further fortified by a tendency to correlation between a high development
of the olfactory organ and a high development of the sexual apparatus an
association between a large nose and a large male organ is a very ancient
observation and has been verified occasionally in recent times there is
normally at puberty a great increase in the septum of the nose and it is
quite conceivable in view of the sympathy which as we shall see
certainly exists between the olfactory and sexual region that the two
regions may develop together under a common influence
    the romans firmly believed in the connection between a large nose
    and a large penis noscitur e naso quanta sit hasta viro
    stated ovid this belief continued to prevail especially in
    italy through the middle ages the physiognomists made much of
    it and licentious women like joanna of naples were it
    appears accustomed to bear it in mind although disappointment
    is recorded often to have followed see eg the quotations and
    references given by jn mackenzie physiological and
    pathological relations between the nose and the sexual apparatus
    in man johns hopkins hospital bulletin no 82 january
    1898 also hagen sexuelle osphrsiologie pp 1519 a
    similar belief as to the association between the sexual impulse
    in women and a long nose was evidently common in england in the
    sixteenth century for in massingers emperor of the east act
    ii scene i we read
        her nose which by its length assures me
        of storms at midnight if i fail to pay her
        the tribute she expects
    at the present day a proverb of the venetian people still
    embodies the belief in the connection between a large nose and a
    large sexual member
    the probability that such an association tends in many cases to
    prevail is indicated not only by the beliefs of antiquity when
    more careful attention was paid to these matters but by the
    testimony of various modern observers although it does not
    appear that any series of exact observations have yet been made
    it may be noted that marro in his careful anthropological study
    of criminals i caratteri dei delinquenti found no class of
    criminals with so large a proportion alike of anomalies of the
    nose and anomalies of the genital organs as sexual offenders
however this may be it is less doubtful that there is a very intimate
relation both in men and women between the olfactory mucous membrane of
the nose and the whole genital apparatus that they frequently show a
sympathetic action that influences acting on the genital sphere will
affect the nose and occasionally it is probable influences acting on
the nose reflexly affect the genital sphere to discuss these
relationships would here be out of place since specialists are not
altogether in agreement concerning the matter a few are inclined to
regard the association as extremely intimate so that each region is
sensitive even to slight stimuli applied to the other region while on
the other hand many authorities ignore altogether the question of the
relationship it would appear however that there really is in a
considerable number of people at all events a reflex connection of this
kind it has especially been noted that in many cases congestion of the
nose precedes menstruation
bleeding of the nose is specially apt to occur at puberty and during
adolescence while in women it may take the place of menstruation and is
sometimes more apt to occur at the menstrual periods disorders of the
nose have also been found to be aggravated at these periods it has even
been possible to control bleeding of the nose both in men and women by
applying ice to the sexual regions in both men and women again cases
have been recorded in which sexual excitement whether of coitus or
masturbation has been followed by bleeding of the nose in numerous cases
it is followed by slight congestive conditions of the nasal passages and
especially by sneezing various authors have referred to this phenomenon
i am acquainted with a lady in whom it is fairly constant41 fr
records the case of a lady a nervous subject who began to experience
intense spontaneous sexual excitement shortly after marriage accompanied
by much secretion from the nose42 jn mackenzie is acquainted with a
number of such cases and he considers that the popular expression
brides cold indicates that this effect of strong sexual excitement is
widely recognized
    the late professor hack of freiburg in 1884 called general
    medical attention to the intimate connection between the nose and
    states of nervous hyperexcitability in various parts of the body
    although such a connection had been recognized for many centuries
    in medical literature while hack and his disciples thus gave
    prominence to this association they undoubtedly greatly
    exaggerated its importance and significance sir felix semon
    british medical journal november 9 1901 even many workers
    who have more recently further added to our knowledge have also
    as sometimes happens with enthusiasts unduly strained their own
    data starting from the fact that in women during menstruation
    examination of the nose reveals a degree of congestion not found
    during the rest of the month fliess die beziehungen zwischen
    nase und weiblichen geschlechtsorganen 1897 with the help of
    a number of elaborate and prolonged observations has reached
    conclusions which while they seem to be hazardous at some
    points have certainly contributed to build up our knowledge of
    this obscure subject schiff wiener klinische wochenschrift
    1900 p 58 summarized in british medical journal february
    16 1901 starting from a skeptical standpoint has confirmed
    some of fliesss results and in a large number of cases
    controlled painful menstruation by painting with cocaine the
    socalled genital spots in the nose all possibility of
    suggestion being avoided ries of chicago has been similarly
    successful with the method of fliess american gyncology vol
    iii no 4 1903 benedikt wiener medicinische wochenschrift
    no 8 1901 summarized in journal of medical science october
    1901 while pointing out that the nose is not the only organ in
    sympathetic relation with the sexual sphere suggests that the
    mechanism of the relationship is involved in the larger problem
    of the harmony in growth and in nutrition of the different parts
    of the organism in this way probably we may attach
    considerable significance to the existence of a kind of erectile
    tissue in the nose
    an interesting example of a reflex influence from the nose
    affecting the genital sphere has been brought forward by dr es
    talbot of chicago a 56yearold man was operated on
    september 1 1903 for the removal of the left cartilage of the
    septum of the nose owing to a previous traumatic fracture at the
    sixteenth year no pain was experienced until two years ago when
    a continual soreness occurred at the apical end of the fracture
    during the winter months the operation was decided upon fearing
    more serious complications the parts were cocainized no pain
    was experienced in the operation except at one point at the lower
    posterior portion near the floor of the nose a profound shock to
    the general system followed the reflex influence of the pain
    upon the genital organs caused semen to flow continually for
    three weeks treatment of general motor irritability with camphor
    monobromate and conium on consultation with dr kiernan checked
    the flow the discharge produced spinal neurasthenia the legs
    and feet felt heavy erythromelalgia caused uneasiness the
    patient walked with difficulty the tired feeling in the feet and

the intimate association between the sexual centers and the olfactory
tract is well illustrated by the fact that this primitive and ancient
association tends to come to the surface in insanity it is recognized by
many alienists that insanity of a sexual character is specially liable to
be associated with hallucinations of smell
    many eminent alienists in various countries are very decidedly of
    the opinion that there is a special tendency to the association
    of olfactory hallucinations with sexual manifestations and
    although one or two authorities have expressed doubt on the
    matter the available evidence clearly indicates such an
    association hallucinations of smell are comparatively rare as
    compared to hallucinations of sight and hearing they are
    commoner in women than in men and they not infrequently occur at
    periods of sexual disturbance at adolescence in puerperal
    fever at the change of life in women with ovarian troubles and
    in old people troubled with sexual desires or remorse for such
    desires they have often been noted as specially frequent in
    cases of excessive masturbation

    various sexual states considers that they are directly dependent
    on sexual excitement allgemeine zeitschrift fr psychiatrie

    savage is also impressed by the close association between sexual
    disturbance or changes in the reproductive organs and
    hallucinations of smell as well as of touch he has found that
    persistent hallucinations of smell disappeared when a diseased
    ovary was removed although the patient remained insane he

    the hallucination then constituted the aura comptes rendus de
    la socit de biologie december 1896 the prevalence of a
    sexual element in olfactory hallucinations has been investigated
    by bullen who examined into 95 cases of hallucinations of smell
    among the patients in several asylums in a few cases there were
    reasons for believing that peripheral conditions existed which
    would render these hallucinations more strictly illusions of
    these 64 were women sixteen of the women were climacteric
    cases and 3 of them had sexual hallucinations or delusions
    fourteen other women chiefly cases of chronic delusional
    insanity had sexual delusions altogether 31 men and women had
    sexual delusions this is a large proportion bullen is not
    however inclined to admit any direct connection between the
    reproductive system and the sense of smell he finds that other
    hallucinations are very frequently associated with the olfactory
    hallucinations and considers that the coexistence of olfactory
    and sexual troubles simply indicates a very deep and widespread
    nervous disturbance f st john bullen olfactory
    hallucinations in the insane journal of mental science july
    1899 in order to elucidate the matter fully we require further
    precise inquiries on the lines bullen has laid down
    it may be of interest to note in this connection that smell and
    taste hallucinations appear to be specially frequent in forms of
    religious insanity thus dr zurcher in her inaugural
    dissertation on joan of arc jeanne darc leipzig 1895 p
    72 estimates that on the average in such insanity nearly 50 per
    cent of the hallucinations affect smell and taste she refers
    also to the olfactory hallucinations of great religious leaders
    francis of assisi katherina emmerich lazzaretti and the
    anabaptists
it may well be as zwaardemaker has suggested in his physiologie des
geruchs that the nasal congestion at menstruation and similar phenomena
are connected with that association of smell and sexuality which is
observable throughout the whole animal world and that the congestion
brings about a temporary increase of olfactory sensitiveness during the
stage of sexual excitation43 careful investigation of olfactory
acuteness would reveal the existence of such menstrual heightening of its
acuity
in a few exceptional but still quite healthy people smell would appear
to possess an emotional predominance which it cannot be said to possess in
the average person these exceptional people are of what binet in his
study of sexual fetichism calls olfactive type such persons form a group
which though of smaller size and less importance is fairly comparable to
the wellknown groups of visual type of auditory type and of psychomotor
type such people would be more attentive to odors more moved by
olfactory sympathies and antipathies than are ordinary people for these
it may well be the supremacy accorded to olfactory influences in jgers
entdeckung der seele though extravagantly incorrect for ordinary
persons may appear quite reasonable
it is certain also that a great many neurasthenic people and
particularly those who are sexually neurasthenic are peculiarly
susceptible to olfactory influences a number of eminent poets and
novelistsespecially it would appear in franceseem to be in this
case baudelaire of all great poets has most persistently and most
elaborately emphasized the imaginative and emotional significance of odor
the fleurs du mal and many of the petits pomes en prose are from
this point of view of great interest there can be no doubt that in
baudelaires own imaginative and emotional life the sense of smell played
a highly important part and that in his own words odor was to him what
music is to others throughout zolas novelsand perhaps more especially
in la faute de labb mouretthere is an extreme insistence on odors of
every kind prof leopold bernard wrote an elaborate study of this aspect
of zolas work44 he believed that underlying zolas interest in odors
there was an abnormally keen olfactory sensibility and large development
of the olfactory region of the brain such a supposition is however
unnecessary and as a matter of fact a careful examination of zolas
olfactory sensibility conducted by m passy showed that it was somewhat
below normal45 at the same time it was shown that zola was really a
person of olfactory psychic type with a special attention to odors and a
special memory for them as is frequently the case with perfumers with
less than normal olfactory acuity he possessed a more than normal power of
discriminating odors it is possible that in early life his olfactory
acuity may also have been above normal in the same way nietzsche in his
writings shows a marked sensibility and especially antipathy as regards
odors which has by some been regarded as an index to a real physical
sensibility of abnormal keenness according to mbius however there was
no reason for supposing this to be the case46 huysmans who throughout
his books reveals a very intense preoccupation with the exact shades of
many kinds of sensory impressions and an apparently abnormally keen
sensibility to them has shown a great interest in odors more especially
in an oftquoted passage in a rebours the blind milton of paradise
lost as the late mr grant allen once remarked to me dwells much on
scents in this case it is doubtless to the blindness and not to any
special organic predisposition that we must attribute this direction of
sensory attention47 among our older english poets also herrick
displays a special interest in odors with a definite realization of their
sexual attractiveness48 shelley who was alive to so many of the
unusual sthetic aspects of things often shows an enthusiastic delight in
odors more especially those of flowers it may indeed be said that most
poetsthough to a less degree than those i have mentioneddevote a
special attention to odors and since it has been possible to describe
smell as the sense of imagination this need not surprise us that
shakespeare for instance ranked this sense very high indeed is shown by
various passages in his works and notably by sonnet liv o how much more
doth beauty beauteous seemin which he implicitly places the attraction
of odor on at least as high a level as that of vision49
a neurasthenic sensitiveness to odors specially sexual odors is
frequently accompanied by lack of sexual vigor in this way we may account
for the numerous cases in which old men in whom sexual desire survives the
loss of virile powersprobably somewhat abnormal persons at the
outsetfind satisfaction in sexual odors here also we have the basis
for olfactory fetichism in such fetichism the odor of the woman alone
whoever she may be and however unattractive she may be suffices to
furnish complete sexual satisfaction in many although not all of those
cases in which articles of womens clothing become the object of
fetichistic attraction there is certainly an olfactory element due to the
personal odor attaching to the garments50
    olfactory influences play a certain part in various sexually
    abnormal tendencies and practices which do not proceed from an
    exclusively olfactory fascination thus cunnilingus and
    fellatio derive part of their attraction more especially in
    some individuals from a predilection for the odors of the sexual
    parts see eg moll untersuchungen ber die libido
    sexualis bd 1 p 134 in many cases smell plays no part in
    the attraction i enjoy cunnilingus if i like the girl very
    much a correspondent writes in spite of the smell we may
    associate this impulse with the prevalence of these practices
    among sexual inverts in whom olfactory attractions are often
    specially marked those individuals also who are sexually
    affected by the urinary and alvine excretions renifleurs
    stereoraires etc are largely though not necessarily
    altogether moved by olfactory impressions the attraction was
    however exclusively olfactory in the case of the young woman
    recorded by moraglia archivio di psichiatria 1892 p 267
    who was irresistibly excited by the odor of the fermented urine
    of men and possibly also in the case narrated to moraglia by
    prof l bianchi ib p 568 in which a wife required flatus
    from her husband
    the sexual pleasure derived from partial strangulation discussed
    in the study of love and pain in a previous volume may be
    associated with heightened olfactory sexual excitation dr
    kiernan who points this out to me has investigated a few
    neuropathic patients who like to have their necks squeezed as
    they express it and finds that in the majority the olfactory
    sensibility is thus intensified
even in ordinary normal persons however there can be no doubt that
personal odor tends to play a not inconsiderable part in sexual
attractions and sexual repulsions as a sexual excitant indeed it comes
far behind the stimuli received through the sense of sight the
comparative bluntness of the sense of smell in man makes it difficult for
olfactory influence to be felt as a rule until the preliminaries of
courtship are already over so that it is impossible for smell ever to
possess the same significance in sexual attraction in man that it
possesses in the lower animals with that reservation there can be no
doubt that odor has a certain favorable or unfavorable influence in sexual
relationships in all human races from the lowest to the highest the
polynesian spoke with contempt of those women of european race who have
no smell and in view of the pronounced personal odor of so many savage
peoples as well as of the careful attention which they so often pay to
odors we may certainly assume even in the absence of much definite
evidence that smell counts for much in their sexual relationships this
is confirmed by such practices as that found among some primitive
peoplesas it is stated in the philippinesof lovers exchanging their
garments to have the smell of the loved one about them in the barbaric
stages of society this element becomes selfconscious and is clearly
avowed personal odors are constantly described with complacency
sometimes as mingled with the lavish use of artificial perfumes in much
of the erotic literature produced in the highest stages of barbarism
especially by eastern peoples living in hot climates it is only necessary
to refer to the song of songs the arabian nights and the indian
treatises on love even in some parts of europe the same influence is
recognized in the crudest animal form and krauss states that among the
southern slavs it is sometimes customary to leave the sexual parts
unwashed because a strong odor of these parts is regarded as a sexual
stimulant under the usual conditions of life in europe personal odor has
sunk into the background this has been so equally under the conditions of
classic medival and modern life personal odor has been generally
regarded as unsthetic it has for the most part only been mentioned to
be reprobated and even those poets and others who during recent centuries
have shown a sensitive delight and interest in odorsherrick shelley
baudelaire zola and huysmanshave seldom ventured to insist that a
purely natural and personal odor can be agreeable the fact that it may be
so and that for most people such odors cannot be a matter of indifference
in the most intimate of all relationships is usually only to be learned
casually and incidentally there can be no doubt however that as
kiernan points out the extent to which olfaction influences the sexual
sphere in civilized man has been much underestimated we need not
therefore be surprised at the greater interest which has recently been
taken in this subject as usually happens indeed there has been in some
writers a tendency to run to the opposite extreme and we cannot with
gustav jger regard the sexual instinct as mainly or altogether an
olfactory matter

    literature recognizing bodily smell as a sexual attraction ovid
    in his ars amandi book iii says it is scarcely necessary to
    remind a lady that she must not keep a goat in her armpits ne
    trux caper iret in alas mulier tum bene olet ubi nihil
    olet is an ancient dictum and in the sixteenth century
    montaigne still repeated the same saying with complete approval
    a different current of feeling began to appear with the new
    emotional movement during the eighteenth century rousseau called
    attention to the importance of the olfactory sense and in his
    educational work emile bk ii he referred to the odor of a
    womans cabinet de toilette as not so feeble a snare as is
    commonly supposed in the same century casanova wrote still more
    emphatically concerning the same point in the preface to his
    mmoires he states i have always found sweet the odor of the
    women i have loved and elsewhere there is something in the
    air of the bedroom of the woman one loves something so intimate
    so balsamic such voluptuous emanations that if a lover had to
    choose between heaven and this place of delight his hesitation
    would not last for a moment mmoires vol iii in the
    previous century in england sir kenelm digby in his
    interesting and remarkable private memoirs when describing a
    visit to lady venetia stanley afterward his wife touches on
    personal odor as an element of attraction he had found her
    asleep in bed and on her breasts did glisten a few drops of
    sweatlike diamond sparks and had a more fragrant odor than the
    violets or primroses whose season was newly passed
    in 1821 cadetdevaux published in the revue encyclopdique a
    study entitled de latmosphre de la femme et de sa puissance
    which attracted a great deal of attention in germany as well as
    in france he considered that the exhalations of the feminine
    body are of the first importance in sexual attraction
    prof a galopin in 1886 wrote a semiscientific book le parfum
    de la femme in which the sexual significance of personal odor
    is developed to its fullest he writes with enthusiasm concerning
    the sweet and healthgiving character of the natural perfume of a
    beloved woman and the mischief done both to health and love by
    the use of artificial perfumes the purest marriage that can be
    contracted between a man and a woman he asserts p 157 is
    that engendered by olfaction and sanctioned by a common
    assimilation in the brain of the animated molecules due to the
    secretion and evaporation of two bodies in contact and sympathy
    in a book written during the first half of the nineteenth century
    which contains various subtle observations on love we read with
    reference to the sweet odor which poets have found in the breath
    of women in reality many women have an intoxicatingly agreeable
    breath which plays no small part in the lovecompelling
    atmosphere which they spread around them eros oder wrterbuch
    ber die physiologie 1849 bd 1 p 45
    most of the writers on the psychology of love at this period
    however seem to have passed over the olfactory element in sexual
    attraction regarding it probably as too unsthetic it receives
    no emphasis either in snancours de lamour or stendhals de
    lamour or michelets lamour
    the poets within recent times have frequently referred to odors
    personal and other but the novelists have more rarely done so
    zola and huysmans the two novelists who have most elaborately
    and insistently developed the olfactory side of life have dwelt
    more on odors that are repulsive than on those that are
    agreeable it is therefore of interest to note that in a few
    remarkable novels of recent times the attractiveness of personal
    odor has been emphasized this is notably so in tolstoys war
    and peace in which count peter suddenly resolves to marry
    princess helena after inhaling her odor at a ball in
    dannunzios trionfo della morte the seductive and consoling
    odor of the beloved womans skin is described in several
    passages thus when giorgio kissed ippolitas arms and
    shoulders we are told he perceived the sharp and yet delicate
    perfume of her the perfume of the skin that in the hour of joy
    became intoxicating as that of the tuberose and a terrible lash
    to desire
when we are dealing with the sexual significance of personal odors in man
there is at the outset an important difference to be noticed in comparison
with the lower mammals not only is the significance of odor altogether
very much less but the focus of olfactory attractiveness has been
displaced the centre of olfactory attractiveness is not as usually among
animals in the sexual region but is transferred to the upper part of the
body in this respect the sexual olfactory allurement in man resembles
what we find in the sphere of vision for neither the sexual organs of man
nor of woman are usually beautiful in the eyes of the opposite sex and
their exhibition is not among us regarded as a necessary stage in
courtship the odor of the body like its beauty in so far as it can be
regarded as a possible sexual allurement has in the course of development
been transferred to the upper parts the careful concealment of the sexual
region has doubtless favored this transfer it has thus happened that when
personal odor acts as a sexual allurement it is the armpit in any case
normally the chief focus of odor in the body which mainly comes into
play together with the skin and the hair
    aubert of lyons noted that during menstruation the odor of the
    armpits may become more powerful and describes it as being at
    this time an aromatic odor of acidulous or chloroform character
    galopin remarks that while some womens armpits smell of sheep
    in rut others when exposed to the air have a fragrance of
    ambergris or violet dark persons according to gould and pyle
    are said sometimes to exhale a prussic acid odor and blondes
    more frequently musk galopin associates the ambergris odor more
    especially with blondes
    while some european poets have faintly indicated the womans
    armpit as a centre of sexual attraction it is among eastern
    poets that we may find the idea more directly and naturally
    expressed thus in a chinese drama the transmigration of
    yochow mercure de france no 8 1901 we find a learned
    young doctor addressing the following poem to his  betrothed
        when i have climbed to the bushy summit of mount chao
        i have still not reached to the level of your odorous armpit
        i must needs mount to the sky
        before the breeze brings to me
        the perfume of that embalsamed nest
    this poet seems however to have been carried to a pitch of
    enthusiasm unusual even in china for his future motherinlaw
    after expressing her admiration for the poem remarks but who
    would have thought one could find so many beautiful things under
    my daughters armpit
    the odor of the armpit is the most powerful in the body
    sufficiently powerful to act as a muscular stimulant even in the
    absence of any direct sexual association this is indicated by an
    observation made by fr who noticed when living opposite a
    laundry that an old woman who worked near the window would
    toward the close of the day introduce her right hand under the
    sleeve of the other to the armpit and then hold it to her nose
    this she would do about every five minutes it was evident that
    the odor acted as a stimulant to her failing energies fr has
    been informed by others who have had occasion to frequent
    workrooms that this proceeding is by no means uncommon among
    persons of both sexes fr linstinct sexuel second
    edition p 135 i have myself noticed the same gesture very
    deliberately made in the street by a young english woman of the
    working class under circumstances which suggested that it acted
    as an immediate stimulant in fatigue
    huysmanswho in his novels has insisted on odors both those of
    a personal kind and perfumes with great precisionhas devoted
    one of the sketches le gousset in his croquis parisiens
    1880 to the varying odors of womens armpits i have followed
    this fragrance in the country he remarks behind a group of
    women gleaners under the bright sun it was excessive and
    terrible it stung your nostrils like an unstoppered bottle of
    alkali it seized you irritating your mucous membrane with a
    rough odor which had in it something of the relish of wild duck
    cooked with olives and the sharp odor of the shallot on the
    whole it was not a vile or repugnant emanation it united as an
    anticipated thing with the formidable odors of the landscape it
    was the pure note completing with the human animals cry of heat
    the odorous melody of beasts and woods he goes on to speak of
    the perfume of feminine arms in the ballroom there the aroma
    is of ammoniated valerian of chlorinated urine brutally
    accentuated sometimes even with a slight scent of prussic acid
    about it a faint whiff of overripe peaches these
    spiceboxes however huysmans continues are more seductive
    when their perfume is filtered through the garments the appeal
    of the balsam of their arms is then less insolent less cynical
    than at the ball where they are more naked but it more easily
    uncages the animal in man various as the color of the hair the
    odor of the armpit is infinitely divisible its gamut covers the
    whole keyboard of odors reaching the obstinate scents of syringa
    and elder and sometimes recalling the sweet perfume of the
    rubbed fingers that have held a cigarette audacious and
    sometimes fatiguing in the brunette and the black woman sharp
    and fierce in the red woman the armpit is heady as some sugared
    wines in the blondes it will be noted that this very exact
    description corresponds at various points with the remarks of
    more scientific observers
    sometimes the odor of the armpit may even become a kind of fetich
    which is craved for its own sake and in itself suffices to give
    pleasure fr has recorded such a case in a friend of his own
    a man of 60 with whom at one time he used to hunt of robust
    health and belonging to a healthy family on these hunting
    expeditions he used to tease the girls and women he met
    sometimes even rather old women in a surprising manner when he
    came upon them walking in the fields with their shortsleeved
    chemises exposed when he had succeeded in introducing his hand
    into the womans armpit he went away satisfied and frequently
    held the hand to his nose with evident pleasure after long
    hesitation fr asked for an explanation which was frankly
    given as a child he had liked the odor without knowing why as
    a young man women with strong odors had stimulated him to
    extraordinary sexual exploits and now they were the only women
    who had any influence on him he professed to be able to
    recognize continence by the odor as well as the most favorable
    moment for approaching a woman throughout life a cold in the
    head had always been accompanied by persistent general
    excitement fr linstinct sexuel 1902 p 134
we not only have to recognize that in the course of evolution the specific
odors of the sexual region have sunk into the background as a source of
sexual allurements we have further to recognize the significant fact that
even those personal odors which are chiefly liable under normal
circumstances to come occasionally within the conscious sexual sphere and
indeed purely personal odors of all kinds fail to exert any attraction
but rather tend to cause antipathy unless some degree of tumescence has
already been attained that is to say our olfactory experiences of the
human body approximate rather to our tactile experiences of it than to our
visual experiences sight is our most intellectual sense and we trust
ourselves to it with comparative boldness without any undue dread that its
messages will hurt us by their personal intimacy we even court its
experiences for it is the chief organ of our curiosity as smell is of a
dogs but smell with us has ceased to be a leading channel of
intellectual curiosity personal odors do not as vision does give us
information that is very largely intellectual they make an appeal that is
mainly of an intimate emotional imaginative character they thus tend
when we are in our normal condition to arouse what james calls the
antisexual instinct

    mantegazza discusses the strength of olfactory antipathies
    fisiologia dell odio p 101 and mentions that once when

    records the case of a neuropathic man who was constantly rendered
    impotent by his antipathy to personal body odors it had very
    frequently happened to him to be attracted by the face and
    appearance of a girl but at the last moment potency was
    inhibited by the perception of personal odor
    in the case of a man of distinguished ability known to me
    belonging to a somewhat neuropathic family there is extreme
    sensitiveness to the smell of a woman which is frequently the
    most obvious thing to him about her he has seldom known a woman
    whose natural perfume entirely suits him and his olfactory
    impressions have frequently been the immediate cause of a rupture
    of relationships
    it was formerly discussed whether strong personal odor
    constituted adequate ground for divorce hagen who brings
    forward references on this point sexuelle osphrsiologie pp
    7583 considers that the body odors are normally and naturally
    repulsive because they are closely associated with the capryl
    group of odors which are those of many of the excretions
    olfactory antipathies are however often strictly subordinated
    to the individuals general emotional attitude toward the object
    from which they emanate this is illustrated in the case known
    to me of a man who on a hot day entering a steamboat with a
    woman to whom he was attached seated himself between her and a
    man a stranger he soon became conscious of an axillary odor
    which he concluded to come from the man and which he felt as
    disagreeable but a little later he realized that it proceeded
    from his own companion and with this discovery the odor at once
    lost its disagreeable character
    in this respect a personal odor resembles a personal touch two
    intimate touches of the hand though of precisely similar
    physical quality may in their emotional effects be separated by
    an immeasurable interval in dependence on our attitude toward
    the person from whom they proceed
personal odor in order to make its allurement felt and not to arouse
antipathy must in normal persons have been preceded by conditions which
have inhibited the play of the antisexual instinct a certain degree of
tumescence must already have been attained it is even possible when we
bear in mind the intimate sympathy between the sexual sphere and the nose
that the olfactory organ needs to have its sensibility modified in a form
receptive to sexual messages though such an assumption is by no means
necessary it is when such a faint preliminary degree of tumescence has
been attained however it may have been attainedfor the methods of
tumescence as we know are innumerablethat a sympathetic personal odor
is enabled to make its appeal if we analyze the cases in which olfactory
perceptions have proved potent in love we shall nearly always find that
they have been experienced under circumstances favorable for the
occurrence of tumescence when this is not the case we may reasonably
suspect the presence of some degree of perversion
    in the oftquoted case of the austrian peasant who found that he
    was aided in seducing young women by dancing with them and then
    wiping their faces with a handkerchief he had kept in his armpit
    we may doubtless regard the preliminary excitement of the dance
    as an essential factor in the influence produced
    in the same way i am acquainted with the ease of a lady not
    usually sensitive to simple body odors though affected by
    perfumes and flowers who on one occasion when already in a
    state of sexual erethism was highly excited when perceiving the
    odor of her lovers axilla
    the same influence of preliminary excitement may be seen in
    another instance known to me that of a gentlemen who when
    traveling abroad fell in with three charming young ladies during
    a long railway journey he was conscious of a pleasurable
    excitement caused by the prolonged intimacy of the journey but
    this only became definitely sexual when the youngest of the
    ladies stretching before him to look out of the window and
    holding on to the rack above accidentally brought her axilla
    into close proximity with his face whereupon erection was
    caused although he himself regards personal odors at all events
    when emanating from strangers as indifferent or repulsive
    a medical correspondent referring to the fact that with many men
    indeed women also sexual excitement occurs after dancing for a
    considerable time remarks that he considers the odor of the
    womans sweat is here a considerable factor
the characteristics of olfaction which our investigation has so far
revealed have not on the whole been favorable to the influence of
personal odors as a sexual attraction in civilized men it is a primitive
sense which had its flowering time before men arose it is a comparatively
unsthetic sense it is a somewhat obtuse sense which among europeans is
usually incapable of perceiving the odor of the human flowerto use
goethes phraseexcept on very close contact and on this account and on
account of the fact that it is a predominantly emotional sense personal
odors in ordinary social intercourse are less likely to arouse the sexual
instinct than the antisexual instinct if a certain degree of tumescence
is required before a personal odor can exert an attractive influence a
powerful personal odor strong enough to be perceived before any degree of
tumescence is attained will tend to cause repulsion and in so doing
tend consciously or unconsciously to excite prejudice against personal
odor altogether this is actually the case in civilization and most
people it would appear view with more or less antipathy the personal
odors of those persons to whom they are not sexually attracted while
their attitude is neutral in this respect toward the individuals to whom
they are sexually attracted51 the following statement by a
correspondent seems to me to express the experience of the majority of men
in this respect i do not notice that different people have different
smells certain women i have known have been in the habit of using
particular scents but no associations could be aroused if i were to smell
the same scent now for i should not identify it as a boy i was very fond
of scent and i associate this with my marked sexual proclivities i like
a woman to use a little scent it rouses my sexual feelings but not to
any large extent i dislike the smell of a womans vagina while the last
statement seems to express the feeling of many if not most men it may be
proper to add that there seems no natural reason why the vulvar odor of a
clean and healthy woman should be other than agreeable to a normal man who
is her lover
in literature it is the natural odor of women rather than men which
receives attention we should expect this to be the case since literature
is chiefly produced by men the question as to whether men or women are
really more apt to be sexually influenced in this way cannot thus be
decided among animals it seems probable both sexes are alike influenced
by odors for while it is usually the male whose sexual regions are
furnished with special scent glands when such occur the peculiar odor of
the female during the sexual season is certainly not less efficacious as
an allurement to the male if we compare the general susceptibility of men
and women to agreeable odors apart from the question of sexual
allurement there can be little doubt that it is most marked among women
as groos points out even among children little girls are more interested
in scents than boys and the investigations of various workers especially
garbini have shown that there is actually a greater power of
discriminating odors among girls than among boys marro has gone further
and in an extended series of observations on girls before and after the
establishment of pubertywhich is of considerable interest from the point
of view of the sexual significance of olfactionhe has shown reason to
believe that girls acquire an increased susceptibility to odors when
sexual life begins although they show no such increased powers as regards
the other senses52 on the whole it would appear that while women are
not apt to be seriously affected in the absence of any preliminary
excitation by crude body odors they are by no means insusceptible to the
sexual influence of olfactory impressions it is probable indeed that
they are more affected and more frequently affected in this way than
are men
    edouard de goncourt in his novel chriethe intimate history
    of a young girl founded he states on much personal
    observationdescribes chapter lxxxv the delight with which
    sensuous but chaste young girls often take in strong perfumes
    perfume and love he remarks impart delights which are
    closely allied in an earlier chapter xliv he writes of his
    heroine at the age of 15 the intimately happy emotion which the
    young girl experienced in reading paul et virginie and other
    honestly amorous books she sought to make more complete and
    intense and penetrating by soaking the book with scent and the
    lovestory reached her senses and imagination through pages moist
    with liquid perfume
    carbini archivio per lantropologia 1896 fasc 3 in a very
    thorough investigation of a large number of children found that
    the earliest osmogustative sensations occurred in the fourth
    week in girls the fifth week in boys the first real and
    definite olfactory sensations appeared in the fifteenth month in
    girls in the sixteenth in boys while experiments on several
    hundred children between the ages of 3 and 6 years showed the
    girls slightly but distinctly superior to the boys it may of
    course be argued that these results merely show a somewhat
    greater precocity of girls i have summarized the main
    investigations into this question in man and woman revised and
    enlarged edition 1904 pp 134138 on the whole they seem to
    indicate greater olfactory acuteness on the part of women but
    the evidence is by no means altogether concordant in this sense
    popular and general scientific opinion is also by no means always
    in harmony thus tardif in his book on odors in relation to the
    sexual instinct throughout assumes as a matter of course that
    the sense of smell is most keen in men while on the other hand
    i note that in a pamphlet by mr martin perls a manufacturing
    perfumer it is stated with equal confidence that it is a
    wellknown fact that ladies have even without a practice of long
    standing a keener sense of smell than men and on this account
    he employs a staff of young ladies for testing perfumes by smell
    in the laboratory by the glazed paper test
    it is sometimes said that the use of strong perfumes by women
    indicates a dulled olfactory organ on the other hand it is said
    that the use of tobacco deadens the sensitiveness of the
    masculine nose both these statements seem to be without
    foundation the use of a large amount of perfume is rather a
    question of taste than a question of sensory acuteness not to
    mention that those who live in an atmosphere of perfume are of
    course only faintly conscious of it and the chemist perfumer
    in his laboratory surrounded by strong odors can distinguish them
    all with great delicacy as regards tobacco in spain the
    cigarreras are women and girls who live perpetually in an
    atmosphere of tobacco and seora pardo bazan who knows them
    well remarks in her novel la tribuna which deals with life
    in a tobacco factory that the acuity of the sense of smell of
    the cigarreras is notable and it would seem that instead of
    blunting the nasal membrane the tobacco makes the olfactory
    nerves keener
    it was the same as if i was in a sweet apple garden from the
    sweetness that came to me when the light wind passed over them
    and stirred their clothes a woman is represented as saying
    concerning a troop of handsome men in the irish sagas cuchulain
    of muirthemne p 161 the pleasure and excitement experienced
    by a woman in the odor of her lover is usually felt concerning a
    vague and mixed odor which may be characteristic but is not
    definitely traceable to any specific bodily sexual odor the
    general odor of the man she loves one woman states is highly
    sometimes even overwhelmingly attractive to her but the
    specific odor of the male sexual organs which she describes as
    fishy has no attraction a man writes that in his relations with
    women he has never been able to detect that they were influenced
    by the axillary or other specific odors a woman writes to me
    any personal odor as that of perspiration is very disagreeable
    and the healthy naked human body is very free from any odor
    fresh perspiration has no disagreeable smell it is only by
    retention in the clothing that it becomes objectionable the
    faint smell of smoke which lingers round men who smoke much is
    rather exciting to me but only when it is very faint if at
    all strong it becomes disagreeable as most of the men who have
    attracted me have been great smokers there is doubtless a direct
    association of ideas it has only once occurred to me that an
    indifferent unpleasant smell became attractive in connection with
    some particular person in this case it was the scent of stale
    tobacco such as comes from the end of a cold cigar or cigarette
    it was and is now very disagreeable to me but for the time
    and in connection with a particular person it seemed to me more
    delightful and exciting than the most delicious perfume i think
    however only a very strong attraction could overcome a dislike
    of this sort and i doubt if i could experience such a
    twistround if it had been a personal odor stale tobacco though
    nasty conveys no mentally disagreeable idea i mean it does not
    suggest dirt or unhealthiness
    it is probably significant of the somewhat considerable part
    which in one way or another odors and perfumes play in the
    emotional life of women that of the 4 women whose sexual
    histories are recorded in appendix b of vol iii of these
    studies all are liable to experience sexual effects from
    olfactory stimuli 3 of them from personal odors though this
    fact is not in every case brought out in the histories as
    recorded while of the 8 men not one has considered his
    olfactory experiences in this respect as worthy of mention
    the very marked sexual fascination which odor associated with
    the men they love exerts on women has easily passed unperceived
    since women have not felt called upon to proclaim it in sexual
    inversion however when the woman takes a more active and
    outspoken part than in normal love it may very clearly be
    traced here indeed it is often exaggerated in consequence of
    the common tendency for neurotic and neurasthenic persons to be
    more than normally susceptible to the influence of odors in the
    majority of inverted women it may safely be said the odor of
    the beloved person plays a very considerable part thus one
    inverted woman asks the woman she loves to send her some of her
    hair that she may intoxicate herself in solitude with its perfume

    again a young girl with some homosexual tendencies was apt to
    experience sexual emotions when in ordinary contact with
    schoolfellows whose body odor was marked fr linstinct
    sexuel p 260 such examples are fairly typical
    that the body odor of men may in a large number of cases be
    highly agreeable and sexually attractive is shown by the
    testimony of male sexual inverts there is abundant evidence to
    this effect raffalovich luranisme et lunisexualit p 126
    insists on the importance of body odors as a sexual attraction to
    the male invert and is inclined to think that the increased odor
    of the mans own body during sexual excitement may have an
    autoaphrodisiacal effect which is reflected on the body of the
    loved person the odor of peasants of men who work in the open
    air is specially apt to be found attractive moll mentions the
    case of an inverted man who found the forest mosslike odor of
    a schoolfellow irresistibly attractive
    the following passage from a letter written by an italian marquis
    has been sent to me bonifazio stripped one evening to give me
    pleasure he has the full rounded flesh and amber coloring which
    painters of the giorgione school gave to their s sebastians
    when he began to dress i took up an old fascia or girdle of
    netted silk which was lying under his breeches and which still
    preserved the warmth of his body i buried my face in it and was
    half inebriated by its exquisite aroma of young manhood and fresh
    hay he told me he had worn it for two years no wonder it was
    redolent of him i asked him to let me keep it as a souvenir he
    smiled and said you like it because it has lain so long upon my
    panoia yes just so i replied whenever i kiss it thus
    and thus it will bring you back to me sometimes i tie it round
    my naked waist before i go to bed the smell of it is enough to
    cause a powerful erection and the contact of its fringes with my
    testicles and phallus has once or twice produced an involuntary
    emission
    i may here reproduce a communication which has reached me
    concerning the attractiveness of the odor of peasants one
    predominant attraction of these men is that they are pure and
    clean their bodies in a state of healthy normal function then
    they possess if they are temperate what the greek poet straton
    called the phydik chrtos a quality which according to this
    authority is never found in women this natural fair perfume
    of the flesh is a peculiar attribute of young men who live in
    the open air and deal with natural objects even their
    perspiration has an odor very different from that of girls in
    ballrooms more refined ethereal pervasive delicate and
    difficult to seize when they have handled hayin the time of
    hayharvest or in winter when they bring hay down from mountain
    hutsthe youthful peasants carry about with them the smell of a
    field the lord hath blessed their bodies and their clothes
    exhale an indefinable fragrance of purity and sex combined every
    gland of the robust frame seems to have accumulated scent from
    herbs and grasses which slowly exudes from the cool fresh skin
    of the lad you do not perceive it in a room you must take the
    young mans hands and bury your face in them or be covered with
    him under the same blanket in one bed to feel this aroma no
    sensual impression on the nerves of smell is more poignantly
    impregnated with spiritual poetrythe poetry of adolescence and
    early hours upon the hills and labor cheerfully accomplished
    and the harvest of gods gifts to man brought home by human
    industry it is worth mentioning that aristophanes in his
    description of the perfect athenian ephebus dwells upon his
    being redolent of natural perfumes
    in a passage in the second part of faust goethe who appears to
    have felt considerable interest in the psychology of smell makes
    three women speak concerning the ambrosiacal odor of young men
    in this connection also i note a passage in a poem appleton
    house by our own english poet marvell which it is of interest
    to  quote
        and now the careless victors play
        dancing the triumphs of the hay
        when every mowers wholesome heat
        smells like an alexanders sweat
        their females fragrant as the mead
        which they in fairy circles tread
        when at their dances end they kiss

so far we have been mainly concerned with purely personal odors it is
however no longer possible to confine the discussion of the sexual
significance of odor within the purely animal limit the various
characteristics of personal odor which have been notedalike those which
tend to make it repulsive and those which tend to make it attractivehave
led to the use of artificial perfumes to heighten the natural odor when
it is regarded as attractive to disguise it when it is regarded as
repellent while at the same time happily covering both of these
impulses has developed the pure delight in perfume for its own
agreeableness the sthetic side of olfaction in this wayalthough in a
much less constant and less elaborate mannerthe body became adorned to
the sense of smell just as by clothing and ornament it is adorned to the
sense of sight
butand this is a point of great significance from our present
standpointwe do not really leave the sexual sphere by introducing
artificial perfumes the perfumes which we extract from natural products
or as is now frequently the case produce by chemical synthesis are
themselves either actually animal sexual odors or allied in character or
composition to the personal odors they are used to heighten or disguise
musk is the product of glands of the male moschus moschiferus which
correspond to preputial sebaceous glands castoreum is the product of
similar sexual glands in the beaver and civet likewise from the civet
ambergris is an intestinal calculus found in the rectum of the
cachelot53 not only however are nearly all the perfumes of animal
origin in use by civilized man odors which have a specially sexual
object among the animals from which they are derived but even the
perfumes of flowers may be said to be of sexual character they are given
out at the reproductive period in the lives of plants and they clearly
have very largely as their object an appeal to the insects who secure
plant fertilization such appeal having as its basis the fact that among
insects themselves olfactory sensibility has in many cases been developed
in their own mating54 there is for example a moth in which both sexes
are similarly and inconspicuously marked but the males diffuse an
agreeable odor said to be like pineapple which attracts the females55
if therefore the odors of flowers have developed because they proved
useful to the plant by attracting insects or other living creatures it is
obvious that the advantage would lie with those plants which could put
forth an animal sexual odor of agreeable character since such an odor
would prove fascinating to animal creatures we here have a very simple
explanation of the fundamental identity of odors in the animal and
vegetable worlds it thus comes about that from a psychological point of
view we are not really entering a new field when we begin to discuss the
influence of perfumes other than those of the animal body we are merely
concerned with somewhat more complex or somewhat more refined sexual
odors they are not specifically different from the human odors and they
mingle with them harmoniously popular language bears witness to the
truth of this statement and the normal and abnormal human odors as we
have already seen are constantly compared to artificial animal and
plant odors to chloroform to musk to violet to mention only those
similitudes which seem to occur most frequently
    the methods now employed for obtaining the perfumes universally
    used in civilized lands are three 1 the extraction of
    odoriferous compounds from the neutral products in which they
    occur 2 the artificial preparation of naturally occurring
    odoriferous compounds by synthetic processes 3 the manufacture
    of materials which yield odors resembling those of pleasant
    smelling natural objects see eg natural and artificial
    perfumes nature december 27 1900 the essential principles
    of most of our perfumes belong to the complex class of organic
    compounds known as terpenes during recent years a number of the
    essential elements of natural perfumes have been studied in many
    cases the methods of preparing them artificially discovered and
    they are largely replacing the use of natural perfumes not only
    for soaps etc but for scent essences though it appears to be
    very difficult to imitate exactly the delicate fragrance achieved
    by nature artificial musk was discovered accidentally by bauer
    when studying the butyltoluenes contained in a resin extractive
    vanillin the odoriferous principle of the vanilla bean is an
    aldehyde which was first artificially prepared by tiemann and
    haarmann in 1874 by oxidizing coniferin a glucoside contained in
    the sap of various conifer but it now appears to be usually
    manufactured from eugenol a phenol contained in oil of cloves
    piperonal an aldehyde closely allied to vanillin is used in
    perfumery under the name of heliotropin and is prepared from oil
    of sassafras and oil of camphor cumarine the material to which
    tonka bean sweet woodruff and newmown hay owe their
    characteristic odors was synthetically prepared by wh parkin
    in 1868 by heating sodiosalicylic aldehyde with acetic anhydride
    though now more cheaply prepared from an herb growing in florida
    irone which has the perfume of violets was isolated in 1893
    from a ketone contained in orrisroot and ionone another ketone
    which has a very closely similar odor of fresh violets and was
    isolated after some years further work is largely used in the
    preparation of violet perfume irone and ionone are closely
    similar in composition to oil of turpentine which when taken into
    the body is partly converted into perfume and gives a strong odor
    of violets to the urine little has yet been accomplished toward
    ascertaining the relation between the odor and the chemical
    constitution of substances in general hydrocarbons as a class
    possess considerable similarity in odor so also do the organic
    sulphides and to a much smaller extent the ketones the
    subject waits for some one to correlate its various
    physiological psychological and physical aspects in the same way
    that helmholtz did for sound it seems as yet impossible to
    assign any probable reason to the fact that many substances have
    a pleasant odor it may however be worth suggesting that
    certain compounds such as the volatile sulphides and the
    indoles have very unpleasant odors because they are normal
    constituents of mammalian excreta and of putrefied animal
    products the repulsive odors may be simply necessary results of
    evolutionary processes loc cit nature december 27
    1900
    many of the perfumes in use are really combinations of a great
    many different odors in varying proportions such as oil of rose
    lavender oil ylangylang etc the most highly appreciated
    perfumes are often made up of elements which in stronger
    proportion would be regarded as highly unpleasant
    in the study and manufacture of perfumes germany and france have
    taken the lead in recent times the industry is one of great
    importance in france alone the trade in perfumes amounts to
    4000000
it is doubtless largely owing to the essential and fundamental identity of
odorsto the chemical resemblances even of odors from the most widely
remote sourcesthat we find that perfumes in many cases have the same
sexual effects as are primitively possessed by the body odors in northern
countries where the use of perfumes is chiefly cultivated by women it is
by women that this sexual influence is most liable to be felt in the
south and in the east it appears to be at least equally often experienced
by men thus in italy mantegazza remarks that many men of strong sexual
temperament cannot visit with impunity a laboratory of essences and
perfumes56 in the east we find it stated in the islamic book entitled
the perfumed garden of sheik nefzaoui that the use of perfumes by women
as well as by men excites to the generative act it is largely in
reliance on this fact that in many parts of the world especially among
eastern peoples and occasionally among ourselves in europe women have
been accustomed to perfume the body and especially the vulva57
it seems highly probable that as has been especially emphasized by hagen
perfumes were primitively used by women not as is sometimes the case in
civilization with the idea of disguising any possible natural odor but
with the object of heightening and fortifying the natural odor58 if the
primitive man was inclined to disparage a woman whose odor was slight or
imperceptibleturning away from her with contempt as the polynesian
turned away from the ladies of sydney they have no smellwomen would
inevitably seek to supplement any natural defects in this respect and to
accentuate their odorous qualities in the same way as by corsets and
bustles even in civilization they have sought to accentuate the sexual
saliencies of their bodies in this way we may as hagen suggests explain
the fact that until recent times the odors preferred by women have not
been the most delicate or exquisite but the strongest the most animal
the most sexual musk castoreum civet and ambergris
    in that interesting noveldealing with the adventures of a
    jewish maiden at the persian court of xerxeswhich under the
    title of esther has found its way into the old testament we are
    told that it was customary in the royal harem at shushan to
    submit the women to a very prolonged course of perfuming before
    they were admitted to the king six months with oil of myrrh and
    six months with sweet odors esther chapter ii v 12
    in the arabian nights there are many allusions to the use of
    perfumes by women with a more or less definitely stated
    aphrodisiacal intent thus we read in the story of kamaralzaman
    with fine incense i will perfume my breasts my belly my whole
    body so that my skin may melt more sweetly in thy mouth o apple
    of my eye
    even among savages the perfuming of the body is sometimes
    practiced with the object of inducing love in the partner
    schellong states that the papuans of kaiser wilhelms land rub
    various fragrant plants into their bodies for this purpose
    zeitschrift fr ethnologie 1899 ht i p 19 the
    significance of this practice is more fully revealed by haddon
    when studying the papuans of torres straits among whom the
    initiative in courtship is taken by the women it was by scenting
    himself with a pungent odorous substance that a young man
    indicated that he was ready to be sued by the girls a man would
    wear this scent at the back of his neck during a dance in order
    to attract the attention of a particular girl it was believed to
    act with magical certainty after the manner of a charm reports
    of the cambridge anthropological expedition to torres straits
    vol v pp 211 222 and 328
the perfume which is of all perfumes the most interesting from the present
point of view is certainly musk with ambergris musk is the chief member
of linnuss group of odores ambrosiac a group which in sexual
significances as zwaardemaker remarks ranks besides the capryl group of
odors it is a perfume of ancient origin its name is persian59
indicating doubtless the channel whence it reached europe and ultimately
derived from the sanskrit word for testicle in allusion to the fact that
it was contained in a pouch removed from the sexual parts of the male
muskdeer musk odors however often of considerable strength are very
widely distributed in nature alike among animals and plants this is
indicated by the frequency with which the word musk forms part of the
names of animals and plants which are by no means always nearly related
we have the muskox the musky mole several species called muskrat the
muskduct the muskbeetle while among plants which have received their
names from a real or supposed musky odor are besides several that are
called muskplant the muskrose the muskhyacinth the muskmallow the
muskorchid the muskmelon the muskcherry the muskpear the
muskplum muskat and muscatels muskseed musktree muskwood etc60
but a musky odor is not merely widespread in nature among plants and the
lower animals it is peculiarly associated with man incidentally we have
already seen how it is regarded as characteristic of some races of man
especially the chinese moreover the smell of the negress is said to be
musky in character and among europeans a musky odor is said to be
characteristic of blondes laycock in his nervous diseases of women
stated his opinion that the musk odor is certainly the sexual odor of
man and fr states that the musk odor is that among natural perfumes
most nearly approaching the odor of the sexual secretions we have seen
that the chinese poet vaunts the musky odor of his mistresss armpits
while another oriental saying concerning the attractive woman is that her
navel is filled with musk persian literature contains many references to
musk as an attractive body odor and firdusi speaks of a womans hair as
a crown of musk while the arabian poet motannabi says of his mistress
that her hyacinthine hair smells sweeter than scythian musk galopin
stated that he knew women whose natural odor of musk and less frequently
of ambergris was sufficiently strong to impart to a bath in less than an
hour a perfume due entirely to the exhalations of the musky body it must
be added that galopin was an enthusiast in this matter
the special significance of musk from our present point of view lies not
only in the fact that we here have a perfume widely scattered throughout
nature and often in an agreeable form which is at the same time a very
frequent personal odor in man musk is the odor which not only in the
animals to which it has given a name but in many others is a
specifically sexual odor chiefly emitted during the sexual season the
sexual odors indeed of most animals seem to be modifications of musk
the sphinx moth has a musky odor which is confined to the male and is
doubtless sexual some lizards have a musky odor which is heightened at
the sexual season crocodiles during the pairing season emit from their
submaxillary glands a musky odor which pervades their haunts in the same
way elephants emit a musky odor from their facial glands during the
rutting season the odor of the muskduck is chiefly confined to the
breeding season61 the musky odor of the negress is said to be
heightened during sexual excitement
the predominance of musk as a sexual odor is associated with the fact that
its actual nervous influence apart from the presence of sexual
association is very considerable fr found it to be a powerful muscular
stimulant in former times musk enjoyed a high reputation as a cardiac
stimulant it fell into disuse but in recent years its use in asthenic
states has been revived and excellent results it has been claimed have
followed its administration in cases of collapse from asiatic cholera for
sexual torpor in women it still has like vanilla and sandal a certain
degree of reputation though it is not often used and some of the old
arabian physicians especially avicenna recommended it with castoreum
and myrrh for amenorrhoea its powerful action is indicated by the
experience of esquirol who stated that he had seen cases in which sensory
stimulation by musk in women during lactation had produced mania it has
always had the reputation more especially in the mohammedan east of
being a sexual stimulant to men the noblest of perfumes it is called
in el ktab and that which most provokes to venery
it is doubtless a fact significant of the special sexual effects of musk
that as laycock remarked in cases of special idiosyncrasy to odors musk
appears to be that odor which is most liked or disliked thus the old
english physician whytt remarked that several delicate women who could
easily bear the stronger smell of tobacco have been thrown into fits by
musk ambergris or a pale rose62 it may be remarked that in the
perfumed garden of sheik nefzaoui it is stated that it is by their
sexual effects that perfumes tend to throw women into a kind of swoon and
lucretius remarks that a woman who smells castoreum another animal sexual
perfume at the time of her menstrual period may swoon63
not only is musk the most cherished perfume of the islamic world and the
special favorite of the prophet himself who greatly delighted in perfumes
i love your world he is reported to have said in old age for its
women and its perfumes64 it is the only perfume generally used by the
women of a land in which the refinements of life have been carried so far
as japan and they received it from the chinese65
moreover musk is still the most popular of european perfumes it is the
perfumes containing musk piesse states in his wellknown book on the art
of perfumery which sell best it is certainly true that in its simple
form the odor of musk is not nowadays highly considered in europe this
fact is connected with the evergrowing refinement in accordance with
which the specific odors of the sexual regions in human beings tend to
lose their primitive attractiveness and bodily odors generally become
mingled with artificial perfumes and so disguised but although musk in
its simple form and under its ancient name has lost its hold in europe
it is an interesting and significant fact that it is still the perfumes
which contain musk that are the most widely popular
peau despagne may be mentioned as a highly complex and luxurious perfume
often the favorite scent of sensuous persons which really owes a large
part of its potency to the presence of the crude animal sexual odors of
musk and civet it consists of washleather steeped in ottos of neroli
rose santal lavender verbena bergamot cloves and cinnamon
subsequently smeared with civet and musk it is said by some probably
with a certain degree of truth that peau despagne is of all perfumes
that which most nearly approaches the odor of a womans skin whether it
also suggests the odor of leather is not so clear
there is however no doubt that the smell of leather has a curiously
stimulating sexual influence on many men and women it is an odor which
seems to occupy an intermediate place between the natural body odors and
the artificial perfumes for which it sometimes serves as a basis possibly
it is to this fact that its occasional sexual influence is owing for as
we have already seen there is a tendency for sexual allurement to attach
to odors which are not the specific personal body odors but yet are
related to them moll considers no doubt rightly that shoe fetichism
perhaps the most frequent of sexual fetichistic perversions is greatly
favored if indeed it does not owe its origin to the associated odor of
the feet and of the shoes66 he narrates a case of shoe fetichism in a
man in which the perversion began at the age of 6 when for the first time
he wore new shoes having previously used only the leftoff shoes of his
elder brother he felt and smelt these new shoes with sensations of
unmeasured pleasure and a few years later began to use shoes as a method
of masturbation67 ncke has also recorded the case of a shoe fetichist
who declared that the sexual attraction of shoes usually his wifes lay
largely in the odor of the leather68 krafftebing again brings
forward a case of shoe fetichism in which the significant fact is
mentioned that the subject bought a pair of leather cuffs to smell while
masturbating69 restif de la bretonne who was somewhat of a shoe
fetichist appears to have enjoyed smelling shoes it is not probable that
the odor of leather explains the whole of shoe fetichismas we shall see
when in another study this question comes before usand in many cases
it cannot be said to enter at all it is however one of the factors
such a conclusion is further supported by the fact that by many the odor
of new shoes is sometimes desired as an adjuvant to coitus it is in the
experience of prostitutes that such a device is not infrequent ncke
mentions that a colleague of his was informed by a prostitute that several
of her clients desired the odor of new shoes in the room and that she was
accustomed to obtain the desired perfume by holding her shoes for a moment
over the flame of a spirit lamp
the direct sexual influence of the odor of leather is however more
conclusively proved by those instances in which it exists apart from shoes
or other objects having any connection with the human body i have
elsewhere in these studies71 recorded the case of a lady entirely
normal in sexual and other respects who is conscious of a considerable
degree of pleasurable sexual excitement in the presence of the smell of
leather objects more especially of leatherbound ledgers and in shops
where leather objects are sold she thinks this dates from the period
when as a child of 9 she was sometimes left alone for a time on a high
stool in an office a possible explanation in this case lies in the
supposition that on one of these early occasions sexual excitement was
produced by the contact with the stool in a way that is not infrequent in
young girls and that the accidentally associated odor of leather
permanently affected the nervous system while the really significant
contact left no permanent impression even on such a supposition it might
however still be maintained that a real potency of the leather odor is
illustrated by this case and this is likewise suggested by the fact that
the same subject is also sexually affected by various perfumes and odorous
flowers not recalling leather70
it has been suggested to me by a lady that the odor of leather suggests
that of the sexual organs the same suggestion is made by hagen72 and i
find it stated by gould and pyle that menstruating girls sometimes smell
of leather the secret of its influence may thus be not altogether
obscure in the fact that leather is animal skin and that it may thus
vaguely stir the olfactory sensibilities which had been ancestrally
affected by the sexual stimulus of the skin odor lies the probable
foundation of the mystery
in the absence of all suggestion of personal or animal odors in its most
exquisite forms in the fragrance of flowers olfactory sensations are
still very frequently of a voluptuous character mantegazza has remarked
that it is a proof of the close connection between the sense of smell and
the sexual organs that the expression of pleasure produced by olfaction
resembles the expression of sexual pleasures73 make the chastest woman
smell the flowers she likes best he remarks and she will close her eyes
breathe deeply and if very sensitive tremble all over presenting an
intimate picture which otherwise she never shows except perhaps to her
lover he mentions a lady who said i sometimes feel such pleasure in
smelling flowers that i seem to be committing a sin74 it is really the
case that in many personsusually if not exclusively womenthe odor of
flowers produces not only a highly pleasurable but a distinctly and
specifically sexual effect i have met with numerous cases in which this
effect was well marked it is usually white flowers with heavy
penetrating odors which exert this influence thus one lady who is
similarly affected by various perfumes forgetmenots ylangylang
etc finds that a number of flowers produce on her a definite sexual
effect with moistening of the pudenda this effect is especially produced
by white flowers like the gardenia tuberose etc another lady who lives
in india has a similar experience with flowers she writes a scent to
cause me sexual excitement must be somewhat heavy and penetrating
nearly all white flowers so affect me and many indian flowers with heavy
almost pungent scents all the flower scents are quite unconnected with
me with any individual tuberose lilies of the valley and frangipani
flowers have an almost intoxicating effect on me violets roses
mignonette and many others though very delicious give me no sexual
feeling at all for this reason the line the lilies and languors of
virtue for the roses and raptures of vice seems all wrong to me the lily
seems to me a very sensual flower while the rose and its scent seem very
good and countrified and virtuous shelleys description of the lily of
the valley whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale falls in
much more with my ideas i can quite understand she adds that
leather especially of books might have an exciting effect as the smell
has this penetrating quality but i do not think it produces any special
feeling in me this more sensuous character of white flowers is fairly
obvious to many persons who do not experience from them any specifically
sexual effects to some people lilies have an odor which they describe as
sexual although these persons may be quite unaware that hindu authors
long since described the vulvar secretion of the padmini or perfect
woman during coitus as perfumed like the lily that has newly
burst75 it is noteworthy that it was more especially the white
flowerslily tuberose etcwhich were long ago noted by cloquet as
liable to cause various unpleasant nervous effects cardiac oppression and
syncope76
when we are concerned with the fragrances of flowers it would seem that we
are far removed from the human sexual field and that their sexual effects
are inexplicable it is not so the animal and vegetable odors as
indeed we have already seen are very closely connected the recorded
cases are very numerous in which human persons have exhaled from their
skinssometimes in a very pronounced degreethe odors of plants and
flowers of violets of roses of pineapple of vanilla on the other
hand there are various plant odors which distinctly recall not merely
the general odor of the human body but even the specifically sexual
odors a rare garden weed the stinking goosefoot chenopodium vulvaria
it is well known possesses a herring brine or putrid fish odordue it
appears to propylamin which is also found in the flowers of the common
white thorn or mayflower cratgus oxyacantha and many others of the
rosacewhich recalls the odor of the animal and human sexual
regions77 the reason is that both plant and animal odors belong
chemically to the same group of capryl odors linnuss odores hircini
so called from the goat the most important group of odors from the sexual
point of view caproic and capryl acid are contained not only in the odor
of the goat and in human sweat and in animal products as many cheeses
but also in various plants such as herb robert geranium robertianum
and the stinking st johns worts hypericum hircinum as well as the
chenopodium zwaardemaker considers it probable that the odor of the
vagina belongs to the same group as well as the odor of semen which
haller called odor aphrodisiacus which last odor is also found as
cloquet pointed out in the flowers of the common berberry berberis
vulgaris and in the chestnut a very remarkable and significant example
of the same odor seems to occur in the case of the flowers of the henna
plant the whiteflowered lawsonia lawsonia inermis so widely used in
some mohammedan lands for dyeing the nails and other parts of the body
these flowers diffuse the sweetest odor wrote sonnini in egypt a
century ago the women delight to wear them to adorn their houses with
them to carry them to the baths to hold them in their hands and to
perfume their bosoms with them they cannot patiently endure that
christian and jewish women shall share the privilege with them it is very
remarkable that the perfume of the henna flowers when closely inhaled is
almost entirely lost in a very decided spermatic odor if the flowers are
crushed between the fingers this odor prevails and is indeed the only
one perceptible it is not surprising that so delicious a flower has
furnished oriental poetry with many charming traits and amorous similes
such a simile sonnini finds in the song of songs i 131478
the odor of semen has not been investigated but according to
zwaardemaker artificially produced odors like cadaverin resemble it
the odor of the leguminous fenugreek a botanical friend considers
closely approaches the odor given off in some cases by the armpit in
women it is noteworthy that fenugreek contains cumarine which imparts
its fragrance to newmown hay and to various flowers of somewhat similar
odor on some persons these have a sexually exciting effect and it is of
considerable interest to observe that they recall to many the odor of
semen it seems very natural a lady writes that flowers etc should
have an exciting effect as the original and by far the pleasantest way of
lovemaking was in the open among flowers and fields but a more purely
physical reason may i think be found in the exact resemblance between
the scent of semen and that of the pollen of flowering grasses the first
time i became aware of this resemblance it came on me with a rush that
here was the explanation of the very exciting effect of a field of
flowering grasses and perhaps through them of the scents of other
flowers if i am right i suppose flower scents should affect women more
powerfully than men in a sexual way i do not think anyone would be likely
to notice the odor of semen in this connection unless they had been
greatly struck by the exciting effects of the pollen of grasses i had
often noticed it and puzzled over it as pollen is the male sexual
element of flowers its occasionally stimulating effect in this direction
is perhaps but an accidental result of a unity running through the organic
world though it may be perhaps more simply explained as a special form of
that nasal irritation which is felt by so many persons in a hayfield
another correspondent this time a man tells me that he has noted the
resemblance of the odor of semen to that of crushed grasses a scientific
friend who has done much work in the field of organic chemistry tells me
he associates the odor of semen with that produced by diastasic action on
mixing flour and water which he regards as sexual in character this
again brings us to the starchy products of the leguminous plants it is
evident that subtle and obscure as many questions in the physiology and
psychology of olfaction still remain we cannot easily escape from their
sexual associations

use of scents especially those allied to the musky is one of the
luxuries of women and in some constitutions cannot be indulged without
some danger to the morals by the excitement to the ovaria which results
and although less potent as aphrodisiacs in their action on the sexual

the evil effects of excessive olfactory stimulationthe symptoms of
vanillismthe occasional dangerous results of the odors of
flowerseffects of flowers on the voice
the reality of the olfactory influences with which we have been concerned
however slight they may sometimes appear is shown by the fact that odors
both agreeable and disagreeable are stimulants obeying the laws which
hold good for stimulants generally they whip up the nervous energies
momentarily but in the end if the excitation is excessive and prolonged
they produce fatigue and exhaustion this is clearly shown by frs
elaborate experiments on the influences of odors as compared with other
sensory stimulants on the amount of muscular work performed with the
ergograph79 commenting on the remark of bernardin de saintpierre that
man uses perfumes to impart energy to his passion fr remarks but
perfumes cannot keep up the fires which they light their prolonged use
involves fatigue which is not different from that produced by excessive
work and reproduces all the bodily and psychic accompaniments of
excessive work80 it is well known that workers in perfumes are apt to
suffer from the inhalation of the odors amid which they live dealers in
musk are said to be specially liable to precocious dementia the symptoms
generally experienced by the men and women who work in vanilla factories
where the crude fruit is prepared for commerce have often been studied and
are well known they are due to the inhalation of the scent which has all
the properties of the aromatic aldehydes and include skin eruptions81
general excitement sleeplessness headache excessive menstruation and
irritable bladder there is nearly always sexual excitement which may be
very pronounced82
we are here in the presence it may be insisted not of a nervous
influence only but of a direct effect of odor on the vital processes the
experiments of tardif on the influence of perfumes on frogs and rabbits
showed that a poisonous effect was exerted83 while fr by incubating
fowls eggs in the presence of musk found repeatedly that many
abnormalities occurred and that development was retarded even in the
embryos that remained normal while he obtained somewhat similar results
by using essences of lavender cloves etc84 the influence of odors is
thus deeper than is indicated by their nervous effects they act directly
on nutrition we are led as passy remarks to regard odors as very
intimately related to the physiological properties of organic substances
and the sense of smell as a detached fragment of generally sensibility
reacting to the same stimuli as general sensibility but highly
specialized in view of its protective function
    the reality and subtlety of the influence of odors is further
    shown by the cases in which very intense effects are produced
    even by the temporary inhalation of flowers or perfumes or other
    odors such cases of idiosyncrasy in which a personfrequently
    of somewhat neurotic temperamentbecomes acutely sensitive to
    some odor or odors have been recorded in medical literature for
    many centuries in these cases the obnoxious odor produces
    congestion of the respiratory passages sneezing headache
    fainting etc but occasionally it has been recorded even
    death dr jn mackenzie in his interesting and learned paper
    on the production of the socalled rose cold etc american
    journal of medical sciences january 1886 quotes many cases
    and gives a number of references to ancient medical authors see

    an interesting phenomenon of the groupthough it is almost too
    common to be described as an idiosyncrasyis the tendency of the
    odor of certain flowers to affect the voice and sometimes even to
    produce complete loss of voice the mechanism of the process is
    not fully understood but it would appear that congestion and
    paresis of the larynx is produced and spasm of the bronchial
    tube botallus in 1565 recorded cases in which the scent of
    flowers brought on difficulty of breathing and the danger of
    flowers from this point of view is well recognized by
    professional singers joal has studied this question in an
    elaborate paper summarized in the british medical journal
    march 3 1895 and dr cabans has brought together figaro
    january 20 1894 the experiences of a number of wellknown
    singers teachers of singing and laryngologists thus madame
    rene richard of the paris opera has frequently found that when
    her pupils have arrived with a bunch of violets fastened to the
    bodice or even with a violet and iris sachet beneath the corset
    the voice has been marked by weakness and on using the
    laryngoscope she has found the vocal cords congested madame
    calv confirmed this opinion and stated that she was specially
    sensitive to tuberose and mimosa and that on one occasion a
    bouquet of white lilac has caused her for a time complete loss
    of voice the flowers mentioned are equally dangerous to a number
    of other singers the most injurious flower of all is found to be
    the violet the rose is seldom mentioned and artificial perfumes
    are comparatively harmless though some singers consider it
    desirable to be cautious in using them

the place of smell in human sexual selectionsit has given place to the
predominance of vision largely because in civilized man it fails to act at
a distanceit still plays a part by contributing to the sympathies or the
antipathies of intimate contact
when we survey comprehensively the extensive field we have here rapidly
traversed it seems not impossible to gain a fairly accurate view of the
special place which olfactory sensations play in human sexual selection
the special peculiarity of this group of sensations in man and that which
gives them an importance they would not otherwise possess is due to the
fact that we here witness the decadence of a sense which in mans remote
ancestors was the very chiefest avenue of sexual allurement in man even
the most primitive manto some degree even in the apesit has declined
in importance to give place to the predominance of vision85 yet at
that lower threshold of acuity at which it persists in man it still bathes
us in a more or less constant atmosphere of odors which perpetually move
us to sympathy or to antipathy and which in their finer manifestations we
do not neglect but even cultivate with the increase of our civilization
it thus comes about that the grosser manifestations of sexual allurement
by smell belong so far as man is concerned to a remote animal past which
we have outgrown and which on account of the diminished acuity of our
olfactory organs we could not completely recall even if we desired to
the sense of sight inevitably comes into play long before it is possible
for close contact to bring into action the sense of smell but the latent
possibilities of sexual allurement by olfaction which are inevitably
embodied in the nervous structure we have inherited from our animal
ancestors still remain ready to be called into play they emerge
prominently from time to time in exceptional and abnormal persons they
tend to play an unusually larger part in the psychic lives of neurasthenic
persons with their sensitive and comparatively unbalanced nervous
systems and this is doubtless the reason why poets and men of letters
have insisted on olfactory impressions so frequently and to so notable a
degree for the same reason sexual inverts are peculiarly susceptible to
odors for a different reason warmer climates which heighten all odors
and also favor the growth of powerfully odorous plants lead to a
heightened susceptibility to the sexual and other attractions of smell
even among normal persons thus we find a general tendency to delight in
odors throughout the east notably in india among the ancient hebrews
and in mohammedan lands
among the ordinary civilized population in europe the sexual influences of
smell play a smaller and yet not altogether negligible part the
diminished prominence of odors only enables them to come into action as
sexual influences on close contact when in some persons at all events
personal odors may have a distinct influence in heightening sympathy or
arousing antipathy the range of variation among individuals is in this
matter considerable in a few persons olfactory sympathy or antipathy is
so pronounced that it exerts a decisive influence in their sexual
relationships such persons are of olfactory type in other persons smell
has no part in constituting sexual relationships but it comes into play
in the intimate association of love and acts as an additional excitant
when reinforced by association such olfactory impressions may at times
prove irresistible other persons again are neutral in this respect and
remain indifferent either to the sympathetic or antipathetic working of
personal odors unless they happen to be extremely marked it is probable
that the majority of refined and educated people belong to the middle
group of those persons who are not of predominantly olfactory type but
are liable from time to time to be influenced in this manner women are
probably at least as often affected in this manner as men probably more
often
on the whole it may be said that in the usual life of man odors play a
not inconsiderable part and raise problems which are not without interest
but that their demonstrable part in actual sexual selectionwhether in
preferential mating or in assortative matingis comparatively small

the sense of rhythmon which it may be said that the sensory exciting
effects of hearing including music finally restmay probably be
regarded as a fundamental quality of neuromuscular tissue not only are
the chief physiological functions of the body like the circulation and
the respiration definitely rhythmical but our senses insist on imparting
a rhythmic grouping even to an absolutely uniform succession of
sensations it seems probable although this view is still liable to be
disputed that this rhythm is the result of kinsthetic
sensationssensations arising from movement or tension started reflexly
in the muscles by the external stimuliimpressing themselves on the
sensations that are thus grouped86 we may thus say with wilks that
music appears to have had its origin in muscular action87
whatever its exact origin may be rhythm is certainly very deeply
impressed on our organisms the result is that whatever lends itself to
the neuromuscular rhythmical tendency of our organisms whatever tends
still further to heighten and develop that rhythmical tendency exerts
upon us a very decidedly stimulating and exciting influence
all muscular action being stimulated by rhythm in its simple form or in
its more developed form as music rhythm is a stimulant to work it has
even been argued by bcher and by wundt88 that human song had its chief
or exclusive origin in rhythmical vocal accompaniments to systematized
work this view cannot however be maintained systematized work can
scarcely be said to exist even today among most very primitive races
it is much more probable that rhythmical song arose at a period antecedent
to the origin of systematized work in the primitive military religious
and erotic dances such as exist in a highly developed degree among the
australians and other savage races who have not evolved coordinated
systematic labor there can however be no doubt that as soon as
systematic work appears the importance of vocal rhythm in stimulating its
energy is at once everywhere recognized bcher has brought together
innumerable examples of this association and in the march music of
soldiers and the heaving and hoisting songs of sailors we have instances
that have universally persisted into civilization although in
civilization the rhythmical stimulation of work physiologically sound as
is its basis tends to die out even in the laboratory the influence of
simple rhythm in increasing the output of work may be demonstrated and
fr found with the ergograph that a rhythmical grouping of the movements
caused an increase of energy which often more than compensated the loss of
time caused by the rhythm89
rhythm is the most primitive element of music and the most fundamental
wallaschek in his book on primitive music and most other writers on
the subject are agreed on this point rhythm remarks an american
anthropologist90 naturally precedes the development of any fine
perception of differences in pitch of timequality or of tonality
almost if not all indian songs he adds are as strictly developed out
of modified repetitions of a motive as are the movements of a mozart or a
beethoven symphony in all primitive music asserts alice c
fletcher91 rhythm is strongly developed the pulsations of the drum
and the sharp crash of the rattles are thrown against each other and
against the voice so that it would seem that the pleasure derived by the
performers lay not so much in the tonality of the song as in the measured
sounds arrayed in contesting rhythm and which by their clash start the
nerves and spur the body to action for the voice which alone carries the
tone is often subordinated and treated as an additional instrument groos
points out that a melody gives us the essential impression of a voice
that dances92 it is a translation of spatial movement into sound and
as we shall see its physiological action on the organism is a reflection
of that which as we have elsewhere found93 dancing itself produces
and thus resembles that produced by the sight of movement dancing music
and poetry were primitively so closely allied as to be almost identical
they were still inseparable among the early greeks the refrains in our
english ballads indicate the dancers part in them the technical use of
the word foot in metrical matters still persists to show that a poem is
fundamentally a dance
    aristotle seems to have first suggested that rhythm and melodies
    are motions as actions are motions and therefore signs of
    feeling all melodies are motions says helmholtz graceful
    rapidity gravel procession quiet advance wild leaping all
    these different characters of motion and a thousand others can be
    represented by successions of tones and as music expresses these
    motions it gives an expression also to those mental conditions
    which naturally evoke similar motions whether of the body and
    the voice or of the thinking and feeling principle itself

    ellis 1885 p 250
    from another point of view the motor stimulus of music has been
    emphasized by cyples music connects with the only sense that
    can be perfectly manipulated its emotional charm has struck men
    as a great mystery there appears to be no doubt whatever that it
    gets all the marvelous effects it has beyond the mere pleasing of
    the ear from its random but multitudinous summonses of the
    efferent activity which at its vague challenges stirs
    unceasingly in faintly tumultuous irrelevancy in this way music
    arouses aimlessly but splendidly the sheer as yet unfulfilled
    potentiality within us w copies the process of human
    experience p 743
    the fundamental element of transformed motion in music has been
    well brought out in a suggestive essay by goblot la musique
    descriptive revue philosophique july 1901 sung or
    played melody figures to the ear a successive design a moving
    arabesque we talk of ascending and descending the gamut of
    high notes or low notes the higher voice of woman is called
    soprano or above the deeper voice of man is called bass
    grave tones were so called by the greeks because they seemed
    heavy and to incline downward sounds seem to be subject to the
    action of gravity so that some rise and others fall baudelaire
    speaking of the prelude to lohengrin remarks i felt myself
    delivered from the bonds of weight and when wagner sought to
    represent in the highest regions of celestial space the
    apparition of the angels bearing the holy grail to earth he uses
    very high notes and a kind of chorus played exclusively by the
    violins divided into eight parts in the highest notes of their
    register the descent to earth of the celestial choir is rendered
    by lower and lower notes the progressive disappearance of which
    represents the reascension to the ethereal regions
    sounds seem to rise and fall that is a fact it is difficult to
    explain it some have seen in it a habit derived from the usual
    notation by which the height of the note corresponds to its
    height in the score but the impression is too deep and general
    to be explained by so superficial and recent a cause it has been
    suggested also that high notes are generally produced by small
    and light bodies low notes by heavy bodies but that is not
    always true it has been said again that high notes in nature
    are usually produced by highly placed objects while low notes
    arise from caves and low placed regions but the thunder is heard
    in the sky and the murmur of a spring or the song of a cricket
    arise from the earth in the human voice again it is said the
    low notes seem to resound in the chest high notes in the head
    all this is unsatisfactory we cannot explain by such coarse
    analogies an impression which is very precise and more sensible
    this fact has its importance for an interval of half a tone
    than for an interval of an octave it is probable that the true
    explanation is to be found in the still little understood
    connection between the elements of our nervous apparatus
    nearly all our emotions tend to produce movement but education
    renders us economical of our acts most of these movements are
    repressed especially in the adult and civilized man as harmful
    dangerous or merely useless some are not completed others are
    reduced to a faint incitation which externally is scarcely
    perceptible enough remain to constitute all that is expressive
    in our gestures physiognomy and attitudes melodic intervals
    possess in a high degree this property of provoking impulses of
    movement which even when repressed leave behind internal
    sensations and motor images it would be possible to study these
    facts experimentally if we had at our disposition a human being
    who while retaining his sensations and their motor reactions
    was by special circumstances rendered entirely spontaneous like a
    sensitive automaton whose movements were neither intentionally
    produced nor intentionally repressed in this way melodic
    intervals in a hypnotized subject might be very instructive
    a number of experiments of the kind desired by goblot had already
    been made by a de rochas in a book copiously illustrated by
    very numerous instantaneous photographs entitled les
    sentiments la musique et la geste 1900 chapter iii de rochas
    experimented on a single subject lina formerly a model who was
    placed in a condition of slight hypnosis when various simple
    fragments of music were performed recitatives popular airs and
    more especially national dances often from remote parts of the
    world the subjects gestures were exceedingly marked and varied
    in accordance with the character of the music it was found that
    she often imitated with considerable precision the actual
    gestures of dances she could never have seen the same music
    always evoked the same gestures as was shown by instantaneous
    photographs this subject stated to be a chaste and wellbehaved
    girl exhibited no indications of definite sexual emotion under
    the influence of any kind of music some account is given in the
    same volume of other hypnotic experiments with music which were
    also negative as regards specific sexual phenomena
it must be noted that as a physiological stimulus a single musical note
is effective even apart from rhythm as is well shown by frs
experiments with the dynamometer and the ergograph94 it is however
the influence of music on muscular work which has been most frequently
investigated and both on brief efforts with the dynamometer and prolonged
work with the ergograph it has been found to exert a stimulating
influence thus scripture found that while his own maximum thumb and
finger grip with the dynamometer is 8 pounds when the giants motive from
wagners rheingold is played it rises to 8 pounds95 with the
ergograph tarchanoff found that lively music in nervously sensitive
persons will temporarily cause the disappearance of fatigue though slow
music in a minor key had an opposite effect96 the varying influence on
work with the ergograph of different musical intervals and different keys
has been carefully studied by fr with many interesting results there
was a very considerable degree of constancy in the results discords were
depressing most but not all major keys were stimulating and most but
not all minor keys depressing in states of fatigue however the minor
keys were more stimulating than the major an interesting result in
harmony with that stimulating influence of various painful emotions in
states of organic fatigue which we have elsewhere encountered when
investigating sadism97 our musical culture fr remarks only
renders more perceptible to us the unconscious relationships which exist
between musical art and our organisms those whom we consider more endowed
in this respect have a deeper penetration of the phenomena accomplished
within them they feel more profoundly the marvelous reactions between the
organism and the principles of musical art they experience more strongly
that art is within them98 both the higher and the lower muscular
processes the voluntary and the involuntary are stimulated by music
darlington and talbot in titcheners laboratory at cornell university
found that the estimation of relative weights was aided by music99
lombard found when investigating the normal variations in the kneejerk
that involuntary reflex processes are always reinforced by music a
military band playing a lively march caused the kneejerk to increase at
the loud passages and to diminish at the soft passages while remaining
always above the normal level100
with this stimulating influence of rhythm and music on the neuromuscular
systemwhich may or may not be directthere is a concomitant influence
on the circulatory and breathing apparatus during recent years a great
many experiments have been made on man and animals bearing on the effects
of music on the heart and respiration perhaps the earliest of these were
carried out by the russian physiologist dogiel in 1880101 his methods
were perhaps defective and his results at all events as regards man
uncertain but in animals the force and rapidity of the heart were
markedly increased subsequent investigations have shown very clearly the
influence of music on the circulatory and respiratory systems in man as
well as in animals that music has an apparently direct influence on the
circulation of the brain is shown by the observations of patrizi on a
youth who had received a severe wound of the head which had removed a
large portion of the skull wall the stimulus of melody produced an
immediate increase in the afflux of blood to the brain102
in germany the question was investigated at about the same time by
mentz103 observing the pulse with a sphygmograph and marey tambour he
found distinct evidence of an effect on the heart when attention was
given to the music the pulse was quickened in the absence of attention it
was slowed mentz also found that pleasurable sensations tended to slow
the pulse and disagreeable ones to quicken it
binet and courtier made an elaborate series of experiments on the action
of music on the respiration with the double pneumograph the heart and
the capillary circulation with the plethysmograph of hallion and comte
on a single subject a man very sensitive to music and himself a cultured
musician simple musical sounds with no emotional content accelerated the
respiration without changing its regularity or amplitude musical
fragments mostly sung usually well known to the subject and having an
emotional effect on him produced respiratory irregularity either in
amplitude or rapidity of breathing in twothirds of the trials exciting
music such as military marches accelerated the breathing more than sad
melodies but the intensity of the excitation had an effect at least as
great as its quality for intense excitations always produced both
quickened and deeper breathing the heart was quickened in harmony with
the quickened breathing neither breathing nor heart was ever slowed as
regards the capillary pulsation an influence was exerted chiefly if not
exclusively by gay and exciting melodies which produced a shrinking
throughout the experiments it was found that the most profound
physiological effects were exerted by those pieces which the subject found
to be most emotional in their influence on him104
guibaud studied the question on a number of subjects confirming and
extending the conclusions of binet and courtier he found that the
reactions of different individuals varied but that for the same
individual reactions were constant circulatory reaction was more often
manifest than respiratory reaction the latter might be either a
simultaneous modification of depth and of rapidity or of either of these
the circulatory reaction was a peripheral vasoconstriction with diminished
fullness of pulse and slight acceleration of cardiac rhythm there was
never any distinct slowing of heart under the influence of music guibaud
remarks that when people say they feel a shudder at some passage of music
this sensation of cold finds its explanation in the production of a
peripheral vasoconstriction which may be registered by the
plethysmograph105
since music thus directly and powerfully affects the chief vital
processes it is not surprising that it should indirectly influence
various viscera and functions as tarchanoff and others have demonstrated
it affects the skin increasing the perspiration it may produce a
tendency to tears it sometimes produces desire to urinate or even actual
urination as in scaligers case of the gascon gentleman who was always
thus affected on hearing the bagpipes in dogs it has been shown by
tarchanoff and wartanoff that auditory stimulation increases the
consumption of oxygen 20 per cent and the elimination of carbonic acid
17 per cent
in addition to the effects of musical sound already mentioned it may be
added that as epstein of berne has shown106 the other senses are
stimulated under the influence of sound and notably there is an increase
in acuteness of vision which may be experimentally demonstrated it is
probable that this effect of music in heightening the impressions received
by the other senses is of considerable significance from our present point
of view
why are musical tones in a certain order and rhythm pleasurable asked
darwin in the descent of man and he concluded that the question was
insoluble we see that in reality whatever the ultimate answer may be
the immediate reason is quite simple pleasure is a condition of slight
and diffused stimulation in which the heart and breathing are faintly
excited the neuromuscular system receives additional tone the viscera
gently stirred the skin activity increased and certain combinations of
musical notes and intervals act as a physiological stimulus in producing
these effects107
among animals of all kinds from insects upward this physiological action
appears to exist for among nearly all of them certain sounds are
agreeable and attractive and other sounds indifferent and disagreeable
it appears that insects of quite different genera show much appreciation
of the song of the cicada108 birds show intense interest in the singing
of good performers even of other species experiments among a variety of
animals in the zological gardens with performances on various instruments
showed that with the exception of seals none were indifferent and all
felt a discord as offensive many animals showed marked likes and
dislikes thus a tiger who was obviously soothed by the violin was
infuriated by the piccolo the violin and the flute were preferred by most
animals109
    most persons have probably had occasion to observe the
    susceptibility of dogs to music it may here suffice to give one
    personal observation a dog of mixed breed partly collie very
    well known to me on hearing a nocturne of chopin whined and
    howled especially at the more pathetic passages once or twice
    catching and drawing out the actual note played he panted
    walked about anxiously and now and then placed his head on the
    players lap when the player proceeded to a more cheerful piece
    by grieg the dog at once became indifferent sat down yawned
    and scratched himself but as soon as the player returned once
    more to the nocturne the dog at once repeated his accompaniment
there can be no doubt that among a very large number of animals of most
various classes more especially among insects and birds the attraction
of music is supported and developed on the basis of sexual attraction the
musical notes emitted serving as a sexual lure to the other sex the
evidence on this point was carefully investigated by darwin on a very wide
basis110 it has been questioned some writers preferring to adopt the
view of herbert spencer111 that the singing of birds is due to
overflow of energy the relation between courtship and singing being
merely a relation of concomitance this view is no longer tenable
whatever the precise origin of the musical notes of animals may beand
it is not necessary to suppose that sexual attraction had a large part in
their first rudimentary beginningsthere can now be little doubt that
musical sounds and among birds singing play a very large part indeed
in bringing the male and the female together112 usually it would
appear it is the performance of the male that attracts the female it is
only among very simple and primitive musicians like some insects that
the female thus attracts the male113 the fact that it is nearly always
one sex only that is thus musically gifted should alone have sufficed to
throw suspicion on any but a sexual solution of this problem of animal
song
it is however an exceedingly remarkable fact that although among
insects and lower vertebrates the sexual influence of music is so large
and although among mammals and predominantly in man the emotional and
sthetic influence of music is so great yet neither in man nor any of the
higher mammals has music been found to exert a predominant sexual
influence or even in most cases any influence at all darwin while
calling attention to the fact that the males of most species of mammals
use their vocal powers chiefly and sometimes exclusively during the
breedingseason adds that it is a surprising fact that we have not as
yet any good evidence that these organs are used by male mammals to charm
the female114 from a very different standpoint fr in studying the
pathology of the human sexual instinct in the light of a very full
knowledge of the available evidence states that he knows of no detailed
observations showing the existence of any morbid sexual perversions based
on the sense of hearing either in reference to the human voice or to
instrumental music115
when however we consider that not only in the animals most nearly
related to man but in man himself the larynx and the voice undergo a
marked sexual differentiation at puberty it is difficult not to believe
that this change has an influence on sexual selection and sexual
psychology at puberty there is a slight hypermia of the larynx
accompanied by rapid development alike of the larynx itself and of the
vocal cords which become larger and thicker while there is an associated
change in the voice which deepens all these changes are very slight in
girls but very pronounced in boys whose voices are said to break and
then become lower by at least an octave the feminine larynx at puberty
only increases in the proportion of 5 to 7 but the masculine larynx in
the proportion of 5 to 10 the direct dependence of this change on the
general sexual development is shown not merely by its occurrence at
puberty but by the fact that in eunuchs in whom the testicles have been
removed before puberty the voice retains its childlike qualities116
as a matter of fact i believe that we may attach a considerable degree of
importance to the voice and to music generally as a method of sexual
appeal on this point i agree with moll who remarks that the sense of
hearing here plays a considerable part and the stimulation received
through the ears is much larger than is usually believed117 i am not
however inclined to think that this influence is considerable in its
action on men although mantegazza remarks doubtless with a certain
truth that some womens voices cannot be heard with impunity it is
true that the ancients deprecated the sexual or at all events the
effeminating influence of some kinds of music but they seem to have
regarded it as sedative rather than stimulating the kind of music they
approved of as martial and stimulating was the kind most likely to have
sexual effects in predisposed persons
    the chinese and the greeks have more especially insisted on the
    ethical qualities of music and on its moralizing and demoralizing
    effects some three thousand years ago it is stated a chinese
    emperor believing that only they who understood music are
    capable of governing distributed administrative functions in
    accordance with this belief he acted entirely in accordance with
    chinese morality the texts of confucianism see translations in
    the sacred books of the east series show clearly that music
    and ceremony or social ritual in a wide sense are regarded as
    the two main guiding influences of lifemusic as the internal
    guide ceremony as the external guide the former being looked
    upon as the more important
    among the greeks menander said that to many people music is a
    powerful stimulant to love plato in the third book of the
    republic discusses what kinds of music should be encouraged in
    his ideal state he does not clearly state that music is ever a
    sexual stimulant but he appears to associate plaintive music
    mixed lydian and hypolydian with drunkenness effeminacy and
    idleness and considers that such music is useless even to women
    that are to be virtuously given not to say to men he only
    admits two kinds of music one violent and suited to war the
    other tranquil and suited to prayer or to persuasion he sets out
    the ethical qualities of music with a thoroughness which almost
    approaches the great chinese philosopher on these accounts we
    attach such importance to a musical education because rhythm and
    harmony sink most deeply into the recesses of the soul and take
    most powerful hold of it bringing gracefulness in their train
    and making a man graceful if he be rightly nurtured  leading
    him to commend beautiful objects and gladly receive them into
    his soul and feed upon them and grow to be noble and good
    plato is however by no means so consistent and thorough as the
    chinese moralist for having thus asserted that it is the
    influence of music which molds the soul into virtue he proceeds
    to destroy his position with the statement that we shall never
    become truly musical until we know the essential forms of
    temperance and courage and liberality and munificence thus
    moving in a circle it must be added that the greek conception of
    music was very comprehensive and included poetry
    aristotle took a wider view of music than plato and admitted a
    greater variety of uses for it he was less anxious to exclude
    those uses which were not strictly ethical he disapproved
    indeed of the phrygian harmony as the expression of bacchic
    excitement he accepts however the function of music as a
    katharsis of emotion a notion which is said to have originated
    with the pythagoreans for a discussion of aristotles views on
    music see wl newman the politics of aristotle vol i pp
    359369
    athenus in his frequent allusions to music attributes to it
    many intellectual and emotional properties eg book xiv
    chapter xxv and in one place refers to melodies inciting to
    lawless indulgence book xiii chapter lxxv
    we may gather from the priapeia xxvi that cymbals and
    castanets were the special accompaniment in antiquity of wanton
    songs and dances cymbala cum crotalis pruriginis arma
    the ancient belief in the moralizing influence of music has
    survived into modern times mainly in a somewhat more scientific
    form as a belief in its therapeutic effects in disordered nervous
    and mental conditions this also is an ancient belief as
    witnessed by the wellknown example of david playing to saul to
    dispel his melancholia in 1729 an apothecary of oakham richard
    broune published a work entitled medicina musica in which he
    argued that music was beneficial in many maladies in more recent
    days there have been various experiments and cases brought
    forward showing its efficacy in special conditions
    an american physician wf hutchinson has shown that ansthesia
    may be produced with accurately made tuning forks at certain
    rates of vibration summarized in the british medical journal
    june 4 1898 ferrand in a paper read before the paris academy
    of medicine in september 1895 gives reasons for classing some
    kinds of music as powerful antispasmodics with beneficial
    therapeutic action the case was subsequently reported of a child
    in whom nightterrors were eased by calming music in a minor key
    the value of music in lunatic asylums is well recognized see
    eg ncke revue de psychiatrie october 1897 vaschide and
    vurpas comptes rendus de la socit de biologie december 13
    1902 have recorded the case of a girl of 20 suffering from
    mental confusion with excitation and central motor
    disequilibrium whose muscular equilibrium was restored and
    movements rendered more coordinated and adaptive under the
    influence of music
    while there has been much extravagance in the ancient doctrine
    concerning the effects of music the real effects are still
    considerable not only is this demonstrated by the experiments
    already referred to p 118 indicating the efficacy of musical
    sounds as physiological stimulants but also by anatomical
    considerations the roots of the auditory nerves mckendrick has
    pointed out are probably more widely distributed and have more
    extensive connections than those of any other nerve the
    intricate connections of these nerves are still only being
    unraveled this points to an explanation of how music penetrates
    to the very roots of our being influencing by associational
    paths reflex mechanisms both cerebral and somatic so that there
    is scarcely a function of the body that may not be affected by
    the rhythmical pulsations melodic progressions and harmonic
    combinations of musical tones nature june 15 1899 p 164
just as we are not entitled from the ancient belief in the influence of
music on morals or the modern beliefs in its therapeutic influenceeven
though this has sometimes gone to the length of advocating its use in
impotence118to argue that music has a marked influence in exciting the
specifically sexual instincts neither are we entitled to find any similar
argument in the fact that music is frequently associated with the
lovefeelings of youth men are often able to associate many of their
earliest ideas of love in boyhood with women singing or playing but in
these cases it will always be found that the fascination was romantic and
sentimental and not specifically erotic119 in adult life the music
which often seems to us to be most definitely sexual in its appeal such
as much of wagners tristan really produces this effect in part from
the association with the story and in part from the intellectual
realization of the composers effort to translate passion into sthetic
terms the actual effect of the music is not sexual and it can well be
believed that the results of experiments as regards the sexual influence
of the tristan music on men under the influence of hypnotism have been
as reported negative helmholtz goes so far as to state that the
expression of sexual longing in music is identical with that of religious
longing it is quite true again that a soft and gentle voice seems to
every normal man as to lear an excellent thing in woman and that a
harsh or shrill voice may seem to deaden or even destroy altogether the
attraction of a beautiful face but the voice is not usually in itself an
adequate or powerful method of evoking sexual emotion in a man even in
its supreme vocal manifestations the sexual fascination exerted by a great
singer though certainly considerable cannot be compared with that
commonly exerted by the actress cases have indeed been
recordedchiefly occurring it is probable in men of somewhat morbid
nervous dispositionin which sexual attraction was exerted chiefly
through the ear or in which there was a special sexual sensibility to
particular inflections or accents120 fr mentions the case of a young
man in hospital with acute arthritis who complained of painful erections
whenever he heard through the door the very agreeable voice of the young
woman invisible to him who superintended the linen121 but these
phenomena do not appear to be common or at all events very pronounced
so far as my own inquiries go only a small proportion of men would
appear to experience definite sexual feelings on listening to music and
the fact that in woman the voice is so slightly differentiated from that
of the child as well as the very significant fact that among mans
immediate or even remote ancestors the females voice can seldom have
served to attract the male sufficiently account for the small part played
by the voice and by music as a sexual allurement working on men122
it is otherwise with women it may indeed be said at the outset that the
reasons which make it antecedently improbable that men should be sexually
attracted through hearing render it probable that women should be so
attracted the change in the voice at puberty makes the deeper masculine
voice a characteristic secondary sexual attribute of man while the fact
that among mammals generally it is the male that is most vocaland that
chiefly or even sometimes exclusively at the rutting seasonrenders it
antecedently likely that among mammals generally including the human
species there is in the female an actual or latent susceptibility to the
sexual significance of the male voice123 a susceptibility which under
the conditions of human civilization may be transferred to music
generally it is noteworthy that in novels written by women there is a
very frequent attentiveness to the qualities of the heros voice and to
its emotional effects on the heroine124 we may also note the special
and peculiar personal enthusiasm aroused in women by popular musicians a
more pronounced enthusiasm than is evoked in them by popular actors
    as an interesting example of the importance attached by women
    novelists to the effects of the male voice i may refer to george
    eliots mill on the floss probably the most intimate and
    personal of george eliots works in book vi of this novel the
    influence of stephen guest a somewhat commonplace young man
    over maggie tulliver is ascribed almost exclusively to the effect
    of his base voice in singing we are definitely told of maggie
    tullivers sensibility to the supreme excitement of music
    thus on one occasion all her intentions were lost in the vague
    state of emotion produced by the inspiring duetemotion that
    seemed to make her at once strong and weak strong for all
    enjoyment weak for all resistance poor maggie she looked very
    beautiful when her soul was being played on in this way by the
    inexorable power of sound you might have seen the slightest
    perceptible quivering through her whole frame as she leaned a
    little forward clasping her hands as if to steady herself while
    her eyes dilated and brightened into that wideopen childish
    expression of wondering delight which always came back in her
    happiest moments george eliots novels contain many allusions
    to the powerful emotional effects of music
    it is unnecessary to refer to tolstoys kreutzer sonata in
    which music is regarded as the galeotto to bring lovers
    togetherthe connecting bond of music the most refined lust of
    the senses
in primitive human courtship music very frequently plays a considerable
part though not usually the sole part being generally found as the
accompaniment of the song and the dance at erotic festivals125 the
gilas of new mexico among whom courtship consists in a prolonged
serenade day after day with the flute furnish a somewhat exceptional
case savage women are evidently very attentive to music backhouse as
quoted by ling roth126 mentions how a woman belonging to the very
primitive and now extinct tasmanian race when shown a musical box
listened with intensity her ears moved like those of a dog or horse to
catch the sound
i have found little evidence to show that music except in occasional
cases exerts even the slightest specifically sexual effect on men
whether musical or unmusical but i have ample evidence that it very
frequently exerts to a slight but definite extent such an influence on
women even when quite normal judging from my own inquiries it would
indeed seem likely that the majority of normal educated women are liable
to experience some degree of definite sexual excitement from music one
states that orchestral music generally tends to produce this effect
another finds it chiefly from wagners music another from military music
etc others simply statewhat indeed probably expresses the experience
of most persons of either sexthat it heightens ones mood one lady
mentions that some of her friends whose erotic feelings are aroused by
music are especially affected in this way by the choral singing in roman
catholic churches127
in the typical cases just mentioned all fairly normal and healthy women
the sexual effects of music though definite were usually quite slight in
neuropathic subjects they may occasionally be more pronounced thus a
medical correspondent has communicated to me the case of a married lady
with one child a refined very beautiful but highly neurotic woman
married to a man with whom she has nothing in common her tastes lie in
the direction of music she is a splendid pianist and her highly trained
voice would have made a fortune she confesses to strong sexual feelings
and does not understand why intercourse never affords what she knows she
wants but the hearing of beautiful music or at times the excitement of
her own singing will sometimes cause intense orgasm
    vaschide and vurpas who emphasize the sexually stimulating
    effects of music only bring forward one case in any detail and
    it is doubtless significant that this case is a woman while
    listening to a piece of music x changes expression her eyes
    become bright the features are accentuated a smile begins to
    form an expression of pleasure appears the body becomes more

    as she listens to the music she experiences sensations very like
    those of normal intercourse the difference chiefly concerns the
    local genital apparatus for there is no flow of vaginal mucus

    it is sometimes said or implied that a woman or a man sings
    better under the influence of sexual emotion the writer of an
    article already quoted on woman in her psychological relations
    journal of psychological medicine 1851 mentions that a
    young lady remarkable for her musical and poetical talents
    navely remarked to a friend who complimented her upon her
    singing i never sing half so well as when ive had a
    lovefit and george eliot says there is no feeling perhaps
    except the extremes of fear and grief that does not make a man
    sing or play the better while however it may be admitted that
    some degree of general emotional exaltation may exercise a
    favorable influence on the singing voice it is difficult to
    believe that definite physical excitement at or immediately
    before the exercise of the voice can as a rule have anything
    but a deleterious effect on its quality it is recognized that
    tenors whose voices resemble those of women more than basses
    who are not called upon to be so careful in this respect should
    observe rules of sexual hygiene and menstruation frequently has
    a definite influence in impairing the voice h ellis man and
    woman fourth edition p 290 as the neighborhood of
    menstruation is also the period when sexual excitement is most
    likely to be felt we have here a further indication that sexual
    emotion is not favorable to singing i agree with the remarks of
    a correspondent a musical amateur who writes sexual
    excitement and good singing do not appear to be correlated a
    womans emotional capacity in singing or acting may be remotely
    associated with hysterical neuroses but is better evinced for
    art purposes in the absence of disturbing sexual influences a
    woman may indeed fancy herself the heroine of a wanton romance
    and let herself go a little in singing with improved results
    but a memory of sexual ardors will help no woman to make the best
    of her voice in training some women can only sing their best
    when they think of the other women they are outsinging one girl
    lets her soul go out into her voice thinking of jamroll
    another thinking of her lover when she has none and most no
    doubt when they think of nothing but no woman is likely to
    find herself in an artistic sense because she has lost herself
    in another sensenot even if she has done so quite respectably
the reality of the association between the sexual impulse and musicand
indeed art generallyis shown by the fact that the evolution of puberty
tends to be accompanied by a very marked interest in musical and other
kinds of art lancaster in a study of this question among a large number
of young people without reference to difference in sex though they were
largely female found that from 50 to 75 per cent of young people feel an
impulse to art about the period of puberty lasting a few months or at
most a year or two it appears that 464 young people showed an increased
and passionate love for music against only 102 who experienced no change
in this respect the curve culminates at the age of 15 and falls rapidly
after 16 many of these cases were really quite unmusical128

summarywhy the influence of music in human sexual selection is
comparatively small
we have seen that it is possible to set forth in a brief space the facts
at present available concerning the influence on the pairing impulse of
stimuli acting through the ear they are fairly simple and uncomplicated
they suggest few obscure problems which call for analysis they do not
bring before us any remarkable perversions of feeling
at the same time the stimuli to sexual excitement received through the
sense of hearing although very seldom of exclusive or preponderant
influence are yet somewhat more important than is usually believed
primarily the voice and secondarily instrumental music exert a distinct
effect in this direction an effect representing a specialization of a
generally stimulating physiological influence which all musical sounds
exercise upon the organism there is however in this respect a definite
difference between the sexes it is comparatively rare to find that the
voice or instrumental music however powerful its generally emotional
influence has any specifically sexual effect on men on the other hand
it seems probable that the majority of women at all events among the
educated classes are liable to show some degree of sexual sensibility to
the male voice or to instrumental music
it is not surprising to find that music should have some share in arousing
sexual emotion when we bear in mind that in the majority of persons the
development of sexual life is accompanied by a period of special interest
in music it is not unexpected that the specifically sexual effects of the
voice and music should be chiefly experienced by women when we remember
that not only in the human species is it the male in whom the larynx and
voice are chiefly modified at puberty but that among mammals generally it
is the male who is chiefly or exclusively vocal at the period of sexual
activity so that any sexual sensibility to vocal manifestations must be
chiefly or exclusively manifested in female mammals
at the best however although sthetic sensibility to sound is highly
developed and emotional sensibility to it profound and widespread
although women may be thrilled by the masculine voice and men charmed by
the feminine voice it cannot be claimed that in the human species hearing
is a powerful factor in mating this sense has here suffered between the
lower senses of touch and smell on the one hand with their vague and
massive appeal and the higher sense vision on the other hand with its
exceedingly specialized appeal the position of touch as the primary and
fundamental sense is assured smell though in normal persons it has no
decisive influence on sexual attraction acts by virtue of its emotional
sympathies and antipathies while by virtue of the fact that among mans
ancestors it was the fundamental channel of sexual sensibility it
furnishes a latent reservoir of impressions to which nervously abnormal
persons and even normal persons under the influence of excitement or of
fatigue are always liable to become sensitive hearing as a sense for
receiving distant perceptions has a wider field than is in man possessed
by either touch or smell but here it comes into competition with vision
and vision is in man the supreme and dominant sense129 we are always
more affected by what we see than by what we hear men and women seldom
hear each other without speedily seeing each other and then the chief
focus of interest is at once transferred to the visual centre130 in
human sexual selection therefore hearing plays a part which is nearly
always subordinated to that of vision
footnotes
129 nietzsche has even suggested that among primitive men delicacy of
hearing and the evolution of music can only have been produced under
conditions which made it difficult for vision to come into play the ear
the organ of fear could only have developed as it has in the night and
in the twilight of dark woods and caves in the brightness the ear is
less necessary hence the character of music as an art of night and
twilight morgenrthe p 230
130 at a concert most people are instinctively anxious to see the
performers thus distracting the purely musical impression and the
reasonable suggestion of goethe that the performers should be invisible is
still seldom carried into practice
vision
i
primacy of vision in manbeauty as a sexual allurementthe objective
element in beautyideals of feminine beauty in various parts of the
worldsavage women sometimes beautiful from european point of
viewsavages often admire european beautythe appeal of beauty to some
extent common even to animals and man
vision is the main channel by which man receives his impressions to a
large extent it has slowly superseded all the other senses its range is
practically infinite it brings before us remote worlds it enables us to
understand the minute details of our own structure while apt for the most
abstract or the most intimate uses its intermediate range is of universal
service it furnishes the basis on which a number of arts make their
appeal to us and while thus the most sthetic of the senses it is the
sense on which we chiefly rely in exercising the animal function of
nutrition it is not surprising therefore that from the point of view of
sexual selection vision should be the supreme sense and that the
lovethoughts of men have always been a perpetual meditation of beauty
it would be out of place here to discuss comparatively the origins of our
ideas of beauty that is a question which belongs to sthetics not to
sexual psychology and it is a question on which stheticians are not
altogether in agreement we need not even be concerned to make any
definite assertion on the question whether our ideas of sexual beauty have
developed under the influence of more general and fundamental laws or
whether sexual ideals themselves underlie our more general conceptions of
beauty practically so far as man and his immediate ancestors are
concerned the sexual and the extrasexual factors of beauty have been
interwoven from the first the sexually beautiful object must have
appealed to fundamental physiological aptitudes of reaction the
generally beautiful object must have shared in the thrill which the
specifically sexual object imparted there has been an inevitable action
and reaction throughout just as we found that the sexual and the
nonsexual influences of agreeable odors throughout nature are
inextricably mingled so it is with the motives that make an object
beautiful to our eyes131
    the sexual element in the constitution of beauty is well
    recognized even by those writers who concern themselves
    exclusively with the sthetic conception of beauty or with its
    relation to culture it is enough to quote two or three
    testimonies on this point the whole sentimental side of our
    sthetic sensibility remarks santayana without which it
    would be perceptive and mathematical rather than stheticis
    due to our sexual organization remotely stirred if anyone
    were desirous to produce a being with a great susceptibility to
    beauty he could not invent an instrument better designed for
    that object than sex individuals that need not unite for the
    birth and rearing of each generation might retain a savage
    independence for them it would not be necessary that any vision
    should fascinate or that any languor should soften the prying
    cruelty of the eye but sex endows the individual with a dumb and
    powerful instinct which carries his body and soul continually
    toward another makes it one of the dearest enjoyments of his
    life to select and pursue a companion and joins to possession
    the keenest pleasure to rivalry the fiercest rage and to
    solitude an eternal melancholy what more could be needed to
    suffuse the world with the deepest meaning and beauty the
    attention is fixed upon a welldefined object and all the
    effects it produces in the mind are easily regarded as powers or
    qualities of that object to a certain extent this kind of
    interest will center in the proper object of sexual passion and
    in the special characteristics of the opposite sex131 and we
    find accordingly that woman is the most lovely object to man
    and man if female modesty would confess it the most interesting
    to woman but the effects of so fundamental and primitive a
    reaction are much more general sex is not the only object of
    sexual passion when love lacks its specific object when it does
    not yet understand itself or has been sacrificed to some other
    interest we see the stifled fire bursting out in various
    directions passion then overflows and visibly floods those
    neighboring regions which it had always secretly watered for the
    same nervous organization which sex involves with its
    necessarily wide branchings and associations in the brain must
    be partially stimulated by other objects than its specific or
    ultimate one especially in man who unlike some of the lower
    animals has not his instincts clearly distinct and intermittent
    but always partially active and never active in isolation we
    may say then that for man all nature is a secondary object of
    sexual passion and that to this fact the beauty of nature is
    largely due g santayana the sense of beauty pp 5962
    not only is the general fact of sexual attraction an essential
    element of sthetic contemplation as santayana remarks but we
    have to recognize also that specific sexual emotion properly
    comes within the sthetic field it is quite erroneous as groos
    well points out to assert that sexual emotion has no sthetic
    value on the contrary it has quite as much value as the emotion
    of terror or of pity such emotion must however be duly
    subordinated to the total sthetic effect k groos der
    sthetische genuss p 151
    the idea of beauty remy de gourmont says is not an unmixed
    idea it is intimately united with the idea of carnal pleasure
    stendhal obscurely perceived this when he defined beauty as a
    promise of happiness beauty is a woman and women themselves
    have carried docility to men so far as to accept this aphorism
    which they can only understand in extreme sexual perversion
    beauty is so sexual that the only uncontested works of art are
    those that simply show the human body in its nudity by its
    perseverance in remaining purely sexual greek statuary has placed
    itself forever above all discussion it is beautiful because it
    is a beautiful human body such a one as every man or every woman
    would desire to unite with in the perpetuation of the race
    that which inclines to love seems beautiful that which seems
    beautiful inclines to love this intimate union of art and of
    love is indeed the only explanation of art without this
    genital echo art would never have been born and never have been
    perpetuated there is nothing useless in these deep human depths
    everything which has endured is necessary art is the accomplice
    of love when love is taken away there is no art when art is
    taken away love is nothing but a physiological need remy de
    gourmont culture des ides 1900 p 103 and mercure de
    france august 1901 pp 298 et seq
    beauty as incarnated in the feminine body has to some extent
    become the symbol of love even for women colin scott finds that
    it is common among women who are not inverted for female beauty
    whether on the stage or in art to arouse sexual emotion to a
    greater extent than male beauty and this is confirmed by some of
    the histories i have recorded in the appendix to the third
    volume of these studies scott considers that female beauty has
    come to be regarded as typical of ideal beauty and thus tends to
    produce an emotional effect on both sexes alike it is certainly
    rare to find any sthetic admiration of men among women except
    in the case of women who have had some training in art in this
    matter it would seem that woman passively accepts the ideals of
    man objects which excite a mans desire colin scott remarks
    are often if not generally the same as those affecting woman
    the female body has a sexually stimulating effect upon both
    sexes statues of female forms are more liable than those of male
    form to have a stimulating effect upon women as well as men the
    evidence of numerous literary expressions seems to show that
    under the influence of sexual excitement a woman regards her body
    as made for mans gratification and that it is this complex
    emotion which forms the initial stage at least of her own
    pleasure her body is the symbol for her partner and indirectly
    for her through his admiration of it of their mutual joy and
    satisfaction colin scott sex and art american journal of
    psychology vol vii no 2 p 206 also private letter
    at the same time it must be remembered that beauty and the
    conception of beauty have developed on a wider basis than that of
    the sexual impulse only and also that our conceptions of the
    beautiful even as concerns the human form are to some extent
    objective and may thus be in part reduced to law stratz in his
    books on feminine beauty and notably in die schnheit des
    weiblichen krpers insists on the objective element in beauty
    papillault again when discussing the laws of growth and the
    beauty of the face argues that beauty of line in the face is
    objective and not a creation of fancy since it is associated
    with the highest human functions moral and social he remarks on
    the contrast between the prehistoric man of
    chanceladedelicately made with elegant face and high
    foreheadwho created the great magdalenian civilization and
    his seemingly much more powerful but less beautiful
    predecessor the man of spy with enormous muscles and powerful
    jaws bulletin de la socit danthropologie 1899 p 220
    the largely objective character of beauty is further indicated by
    the fact that to a considerable extent beauty is the expression
    of health a well and harmoniously developed body tense muscles
    an elastic and finely toned skin bright eyes grace and
    animation of carriageall these things which are essential to
    beauty are the conditions of health it has not been demonstrated
    that there is any correlation between beauty and longevity and
    the proof would not be easy to give but it is quite probable
    that such a correlation may exist and various indications point
    in this direction one of the most delightful of opies pictures
    is the portrait of pleasance reeve afterward lady smith at the
    age of 17 this singularly beautiful and animated brunette lived
    to the age of 104 most people are probably acquainted with
    similar if less marked cases of the same tendency
the extreme sexual importance of beauty so far at all events as
conscious experience is concerned is well illustrated by the fact that
although three other senses may and often do play a not inconsiderable
part in the constitution of a persons sexual attractivenessthe tactile
element being indeed fundamentalyet in nearly all the most elaborate
descriptions of attractive individuals it is the visible elements that are
in most cases chiefly emphasized whether among the lowest savages or in
the highest civilization the poet and storyteller who seeks to describe
an ideally lovely and desirable woman always insists mainly and often
exclusively on those characters which appeal to the eye the richly laden
word beauty is a synthesis of complex impressions obtained through a
single sense and so simple comparatively and vague are the impressions
derived from the other senses that none of them can furnish us with any
corresponding word
    before attempting to analyze the conception of beauty regarded
    in its sexual appeal to the human mind it may be well to bring
    together a few fairly typical descriptions of a beautiful woman
    as she appears to the men of various nations
    in an australian folklore story taken down from the lips of a
    native some sixty years ago by w dunlop but evidently not in
    the natives exact words we find this description of an
    australian beauty a man took as his wife a beautiful girl who
    had long glossy hair hanging around her face and down her
    shoulders which were plump and round her face was adorned with
    red clay and her person wrapped in a fine large opossum rug
    fastened by a pin formed from the small bone of the kangaroos
    leg and also by a string attached to a wallet made of rushes
    neatly plaited of small strips skinned from their outside after
    they had been for some time exposed to the heat of the fire
    which being thrown on her back the string passing under one arm
    and across her breast held the soft rug in a fanciful position
    of considerable elegance and she knew well how to show to
    advantage her queenlike figure when she walked with her polished
    yam stick held in one of her small hands and her little feet

    the hebrew ideal of feminine beauty is set forth in various
    passages of the song of songs the poem is familiar and it
    will suffice to quote one  passage
         how beautiful are thy feet in sandals o princes daughter
         thy rounded thighs are like jewels
         the work of the hands of a cunning workman
         thy navel is like a rounded goblet
         wherein no mingled wine is wanting
         thy belly is like a heap of wheat
         set about with lilies
         thy two breasts are like two fawns
         they are twins of a roe
         thy neck is like the tower of ivory
         thine eyes as the pools in heshbon by the gate of bathrabbim
         thy nose is like the tower of lebanon
         that looketh toward damascus
         thine head upon thee is like carmel
         and the hair of thine head like purple
         the king is held captive in the tresses thereof
         this thy stature is like to a palmtree
         and thy breasts to clusters of grapes
         and the smell of thy breath like apples
         and thy mouth like the best wine
    and the man is thus described in the same poem

         the chiefest among ten thousand

         his locks are bushy or curling and black as a raven

    a persian treatise on the figurative terms relating to beauty
    shows that the hair should be black abundant and wavy the
    eyebrows dark and arched the eyelashes also must be dark and
    like arrows from the bow of the eyebrows there is however no
    insistence on the blackness of the eyes we hear of four
    varieties of eye the darkgray eye or narcissus eye the
    narrow elongated eye of turkish beauties the languishing or
    loveintoxicated eye and the winecolored eye much stress is
    laid on the quality of brilliancy the face is sometimes
    described as brown but more especially as white and rosy there
    are many references to the down on the lips which is described
    as greenish sometimes bluish and compared to herbage this down

    once
    her face is as white as the day on which friends meet again if

    her cheeks are formed of an anemone divided into two corollas
    they have the purple tinge of wine and her nose is straighter
    and more delicate than the finest swordblade
    her lips are colored agate and coral her tongue secretes
    eloquence her saliva is more desirable than the juice of
    grapes

    bears twin breasts of the purest ivory rounded and that may be

    her belly has dimples full of shade and arranged with the
    harmony of the arabic characters on the seal of a coptic scribe
    in egypt and the belly gives origin to her finely modeled and
    elastic waist

    mass so weighty that it obliges its owner to sit down when she
    has risen and to rise when she lies

    countries describing their ideals of beauty on this collection i

when we survey broadly the ideals of feminine beauty set down by the
peoples of many lands it is interesting to note that they all contain
many features which appeal to the sthetic taste of the modern european
and many of them indeed contain no features which obviously clash with
his canons of taste it may even be said that the ideals of some savages
affect us more sympathetically than some of the ideals of our own medival
ancestors as a matter of fact european travelers in all parts of the
world have met with women who were gracious and pleasant to look on and
not seldom even in the strict sense beautiful from the standpoint of
european standards such individuals have been found even among those
races with the greatest notoriety for ugliness
    even among so primitive and remote a people as the australians
    beauty in the european sense is sometimes found i have on two
    occasions lumholtz states seen what might be called beauties
    among the women of western queensland their hands were small
    their feet neat and well shaped with so high an instep that one
    asked oneself involuntarily where in the world they had acquired
    this aristocratic mark of beauty their figure was above
    criticism and their skin as is usually the case among the young
    women was as soft as velvet when these black daughters of eve
    smiled and showed their beautiful white teeth and when their
    eyes peeped coquettishly from beneath the curly hair which hung
    in quite the modern fashion down their foreheads lumholtz
    realized that even here women could exert the influence ascribed
    by goethe to women generally c lumholtz among cannibals p

    seen on the african continent creatures of pale gold or even red
    copper whose fine and satiny skin rivals the most delicate white
    skins one may indeed find beauties among women of the darkest
    ebony he adds that on the whole there is no comparison with
    white women and that the negress soon becomes hideous
    the very numerous quotations from travelers concerning the women
    of all lands quoted by ploss and bartels das weib seventh
    edition bd i pp 88106 amply suffice to show how frequently
    some degree of beauty is found even among the lowest human races
    cf also mantegazzas survey of the women of different races
    from this point of view fisiologia della donna cap iv
the fact that the modern european whose culture may be supposed to have
made him especially sensitive to sthetic beauty is yet able to find
beauty among even the women of savage races serves to illustrate the
statement already made that whatever modifying influences may have to be
admitted beauty is to a large extent an objective matter the existence
of this objective element in beauty is confirmed by the fact that it is
sometimes found that the men of the lower races admire european women more
than women of their own race there is reason to believe that it is among
the more intelligent men of lower racethat is to say those whose
sthetic feelings are more developedthat the admiration for white women
is most likely to be found

    opportunities for observation not only with the negroes of the
    west coast of africa but with those of the interior who have
    never associated with europeans is convinced that their ideas of
    beauty are on the whole the same as ours and dr rohlfs
    writes to me to the same effect with respect to bornu and the
    countries inhabited by the pullo tribes mr reade found that he
    agreed with the negroes in their estimation of the beauty of the
    native girls and that their appreciation of the beauty of
    european women corresponded with ours the fuegians as i have
    been informed by a missionary who long resided with them

    is fundamentally the same throughout the world and that the
    finest persons among the lower races admire and struggle to
    attain the type which is found commonly and in perfection among
    the white peoples of europe when in japan he found that among

    beautiful three japanese girls who in europe also would have been
    considered pretty in java also when selecting from a large
    number of javanese girls a few suitable for photographing stratz
    was surprised to find that a javanese doctor pointed out as most

    from the chinese racial type stratz further reproduces the
    figure of a buddhistic goddess from java now in the
    archological museum of leyden which represents a type of
    loveliness corresponding to the most refined and classic european
    ideal
not only is there a fundamentally objective element in beauty throughout
the human species but it is probably a significant fact that we may find
a similar element throughout the whole animated world the things that to
man are most beautiful throughout nature are those that are intimately
associated with or dependent upon the sexual process and the sexual
instinct this is the case in the plant world it is so throughout most of
the animal world and as professor poulton in referring to this often
unexplained and indeed unnoticed fact remarks the song or plume which
excites the mating impulse in the hen is also in a high proportion of
cases most pleasing to man himself and not only this but in their past
history so far as it has been traced eg in the development of the
characteristic markings of the male peacock and argus pheasant such
features have gradually become more and more pleasing to us as they have
acted as stronger and stronger stimuli to the hen133

in the constitution of our ideals of masculine and feminine beauty it was
inevitable that the sexual characters should from a very early period in
the history of man form an important element from a primitive point of
view a sexually desirable and attractive person is one whose sexual
characters are either naturally prominent or artificially rendered so the
beautiful woman is one endowed as chaucer expresses it
    with buttokes brode and brests rounde and hye
that is to say she is the woman obviously best fitted to bear children
and to suckle them these two physical characters indeed since they
represent aptitude for the two essential acts of motherhood must
necessarily tend to be regarded as beautiful among all peoples and in all
stages of culture even in high stages of civilization when more refined
and perverse ideals tend to find favor and at pompeii as a decoration on
the east side of the purgatorium of the temple of isis we find a
representation of perseus rescuing andromeda who is shown as a woman with
a very small head small hands and feet but with a fully developed body

to a certain extentand as we shall see to a certain extent onlythe
primary sexual characters are objects of admiration among primitive
peoples in the primitive dances of many peoples often of sexual
significance the display of the sexual organs on the part of both men and
women is frequently a prominent feature even down to medival times in
europe the garments of men sometimes permitted the sexual organs to be
visible in some parts of the world also the artificial enlargement of
the female sexual organs is practised and thus enlarged they are
considered an important and attractive feature of beauty

    it may be added that in various parts of the world mutilations of
    the sexual organs of men and women or operations upon them are
    practiced for reasons which are imperfectly known since it
    usually happens that the people who practice them are unable to
    give the reason for this practice or they assign a reason which
    is manifestly not that which originally prompted the practice

    a passage in the mainz chronicle for 1367 as quoted by
    schultz das hfische leben p 297 shows that at that time
    the tunics of the men were so made that it was always possible
    for the sexual organs to be seen in walking or sitting
this insistence on the naked sexual organs as objects of attraction is
however comparatively rare and confined to peoples in a low state of
culture very much more widespread is the attempt to beautify and call
attention to the sexual organs by tattooing135 by adornment and by
striking peculiarities of clothing the tendency for beauty of clothing to
be accepted as a substitute for beauty of body appears early in the
history of mankind and as we know tends to be absolutely accepted in
civilization136 we exclaim as goethe remarks what a beautiful
little foot when we have merely seen a pretty shoe we admire the lovely
waist when nothing has met out eyes but an elegant girdle our realities
and our traditional ideals are hopelessly at variance the greeks
represented their statues without pubic hair because in real life they had
adopted the oriental custom of removing the hairs we compel our sculptors
and painters to make similar representations though they no longer
correspond either to realities or to our own ideas of what is beautiful
and fitting in real life our artists are themselves equally ignorant and
confused and as stratz has repeatedly shown they constantly reproduce
in all innocence the deformations and pathological characters of defective
models if we were honest we should saylike the little boy before a
picture of the judgment of paris in answer to his mothers question as to
which of the three goddesses he thought most beautifuli cant tell
because they havent their clothes on
the concealment actually attained was not however it would appear
originally sought various authors have brought together evidence to show
that the main primitive purpose of adornment and clothing among savages is
not to conceal the body but to draw attention to it and to render it more
attractive westermarck especially brings forward numerous examples of
savage adornments which serve to attract attention to the sexual regions
of man and woman137 he further argues that the primitive object of
various savage peoples in practicing circumcision as other similar
mutilations is really to secure sexual attractiveness whatever religious
significance they may sometimes have developed subsequently a more recent
view represents the magical influence of both adornment and mutilation as
primary as a method of guarding and insulating dangerous bodily
functions frazer in the golden bough is the most able and brilliant
champion of this view which undoubtedly embodies a large element of
truth although it must not be accepted to the absolute exclusion of the
influence of sexual attractiveness the two are largely woven in
together138
there is indeed a general tendency for the sexual functions to take on a
religious character and for the sexual organs to become sacred at a very
early period in culture generation the reproductive force in man
animals and plants was realized by primitive man to be a fact of the
first magnitude and he symbolized it in the sexual organs of man and
woman which thus attained to a solemnity which was entirely independent
of purposes of sexual allurement phallus worship may almost be said to be
a universal phenomenon it is found even among races of high culture
among the romans of the empire and the japanese today it has indeed
been thought by some that one of the origins of the cross is to be found
in the phallus
    hardly any other object remarks dr richard andree has been
    with such great unanimity represented by nearly all peoples as
    the phallus the symbol of procreative force in the religions of
    the east and an object of veneration at public festivals in the
    moabitic baal peor in the cult of dionysos everywhere indeed
    except in persia we meet with priapic representations and the
    veneration accorded to the generative organ it is needless to
    refer to the great significance of the linga puja the
    procreative organ of the god siva in india a god to whom more
    temples were erected than to any other indian deity our museums
    amply show how common phallic representations are in africa east
    asia the pacific frequently in connection with religious
    worship r andree amerikansche phallusdarstellungen
    zeitschrift fr ethnologie 1895 ht 6 p 678
    women have no external generative organ like the phallus to play
    a large part in life as a sacred symbol there is however some
    reason to believe that the triangle is to some extent such a
    symbol lejeune la representation sexuelle en religion art et

apart from the religions and magical properties so widely accorded to the
primary sexual characters there are other reasons why they should not
often have gained or long retained any great importance as objects of
sexual allurement they are unnecessary and inconvenient for this purpose
the erect attitude of man gives them here indeed an advantage possessed
by very few animals among whom it happens with extreme rarity that the
primary sexual characters are rendered attractive to the eye of the
opposite sex though they often are to the sense of smell the sexual
regions constitute a peculiarly vulnerable spot and remain so even in
man and the need for their protection which thus exists conflicts with
the prominent display required for a sexual allurement this end is far
more effectively attained with greater advantage and less disadvantage
by concentrating the chief ensigns of sexual attractiveness on the upper
and more conspicuous parts of the body this method is wellnigh universal
among animals as well as in man
there is another reason why the sexual organs should be discarded as
objects of sexual allurement a reason which always proves finally
decisive as a people advances in culture they are not sthetically
beautiful it is fundamentally necessary that the intromittent organ of
the male and the receptive canal of the female should retain their
primitive characteristics they cannot therefore be greatly modified by
sexual or natural selection and the exceedingly primitive character they
are thus compelled to retain however sexually desirable and attractive
they may become to the opposite sex under the influence of emotion can
rarely be regarded as beautiful from the point of view of sthetic
contemplation under the influence of art there is a tendency for the
sexual organs to be diminished in size and in no civilized country has
the artist ever chosen to give an erect organ to his representations of
ideal masculine beauty it is mainly because the unsthetic character of a
womans sexual region is almost imperceptible in any ordinary and normal
position of the nude body that the feminine form is a more sthetically
beautiful object of contemplation than the masculine apart from this
character we are probably bound from a strictly sthetic point of view
to regard the male form as more sthetically beautiful139 the female
form moreover usually overpasses very swiftly the period of the climax
of its beauty often only retaining it during a few weeks
    the following communication from a correspondent well brings out
    the divergences of feeling in this matter
    you write that the sex organs in an excited condition cannot
    be called sthetic but i believe that they are a source not
    only of curiosity and wonder to many persons but also objects of
    admiration i happen to know of one man extremely intellectual
    and refined who delights in lying between his mistresss thighs
    and gazing long at the dilated vagina also another man married
    and not intellectual who always tenderly gazes at his wifes
    organs in a strong light before intercourse and kisses her
    there and upon the abdomen the wife though amative confessed
    to another woman that she could not understand the attraction on
    the other hand two married men have told me that the sight of
    their wives genital parts would disgust them and that they have
    never seen them
    if the sexual parts cannot be called sthetic they have still a
    strong charm for many passionate lovers of both sexes though
    not often i believe among the unimaginative and the uneducated
    who are apt to ridicule the organs or to be repelled by them
    many women confess that they are revolted by the sight of even a
    husbands complete nudity though they have no indifference for
    sexual embraces i think that the stupid bungle of nature in
    making the generative organs serve as means of relieving the
    bladder has much to do with this revulsion but some women of
    erotic temperament find pleasure in looking at the penis of a
    husband or lover in handling it and kissing it prostitutes do
    this in the way of business some chaste passionate wives act
    thus voluntarily this is scarcely morbid as the mammalia of
    most species smell and lick each others genitals probably
    primitive man did the same
    brantme vie des dames galantes discours ii has some remarks
    to much the same effect concerning the difference between men
    some of whom take no pleasure in seeing the private parts of
    their wives or mistresses while others admire them and delight
    to kiss them
    i must add that however natural or legitimate the attraction of
    the sexual parts may be to either sex the question of their
    purely sthetic beauty remains unaffected
    remy de gourmont in a discussion of the sthetic element in
    sexual beauty considers that the invisibility of the sexual
    organs is the decisive fact in rendering women more beautiful
    than men sex which is sometimes an advantage is always a
    burden and always a flaw it exists for the race and not for the
    individual in the human male and precisely because of his erect
    attitude sex is the predominantly striking and visible fact the
    point of attack in a struggle at close quarters the point aimed
    at from a distance an obstacle for the eye whether regarded as
    a rugosity on the surface or as breaking the middle of a line
    the harmony of the feminine body is thus geometrically much more
    perfect especially when we consider the male and the female at
    the moment of desire when they present the most intense and
    natural expression of life then the woman whose movements are
    all interior or only visible by the undulation of her curves
    preserves her full sthetic value while the man as it were all
    at once receding toward the primitive state of animality seems
    to throw off all beauty and become reduced to the simple and
    naked condition of a genital organism remy de gourmont
    physique de lamour p 69 remy de gourmont proceeds
    however to point out that man has his revenge after a woman has
    become pregnant and that moreover the proportions of the
    masculine body are more beautiful than those of the feminine
    body
the primary sexual characters of man and woman have thus never at any time
played a very large part in sexual allurement with the growth of culture
indeed the very methods which had been adopted to call attention to the
sexual organs were by a further development retained for the purpose of
concealing them from the first the secondary sexual characters have been
a far more widespread method of sexual allurement than the primary sexual
characters and in the most civilized countries today they still
constitute the most attractive of such methods to the majority of the
population
    the main secondary sexual characters in woman and the type which
    they present in beautiful and welldeveloped persons are
    summarized as follows by stratz who in his book on the beauty of
    the body in woman sets forth the reasons for the characteristics
    here  given
        delicate bony structure
        rounded forms and breasts
        broad pelvis
        long and abundant hair
        low and narrow boundary of pubic hair
        sparse hair in armpit
        no hair on body
        delicate skin
        rounded skull
        small face
        large orbits
        high and slender eyebrows
        low and small lower jaw
        soft transition from cheek to neck
        rounded neck
        slender wrist
        small hand with long index finger
        rounded shoulders
        straight small clavicle
        small and long thorax
        slender waist
        hollow sacrum
        prominent and domed nates
        sacral dimples
        rounded and thick thighs
        low and obtuse pubic arch
        soft contour of knee
        rounded calves
        slender ankle
        small toes
        long second and short fifth toe
        broad middle incisor teeth
    stratz die schnheit des weiblichen krpers fourteenth
    edition 1903 p 200 this statement agrees at most points with
    my own exposition of the secondary sexual characters man and
    woman fourth edition revised and enlarged 1904
thus we find among most of the peoples of europe asia and africa the
chief continents of the world that the large hips and buttocks of women
are commonly regarded as an important feature of beauty this secondary
sexual character represents the most decided structural deviation of the
feminine type from the masculine a deviation demanded by the reproductive
function of women and in the admiration it arouses sexual selection is
thus working in a line with natural selection it cannot be said that
except in a very moderate degree it has always been regarded as at the
same time in a line with claims of purely sthetic beauty the european
artist frequently seeks to attenuate rather than accentuate the
protuberant lines of the feminine hips and it is noteworthy that the
japanese also regard small hips as beautiful nearly everywhere else
large hips and buttocks are regarded as a mark of beauty and the average
man is of this opinion even in the most sthetic countries the contrast
of this exuberance with the more closely knit male form the force of
association and the unquestionable fact that such development is the
condition needed for healthy motherhood have served as a basis for an
ideal of sexual attractiveness which appeals to nearly all people more
strongly than a more narrowly sthetic ideal which must inevitably be
somewhat hermaphroditic in character
broad hips which involve a large pelvis are necessarily a characteristic
of the highest human races because the races with the largest heads must
be endowed also with the largest pelvis to enable their large heads to
enter the world the white race according to bacarisse has the broadest
sacrum the yellow race coming next the black race last the white race
is also stated to show the greatest curvature of the sacrum the yellow
race next while the black race has the flattest sacrum140 the black
race thus possesses the least developed pelvis the narrowest and the
flattest it is certainly not an accidental coincidence that it is
precisely among people of black race that we find a simulation of the
large pelvis of the higher races admired and cultivated in the form of
steatopygia this is an enormously exaggerated development of the
subcutaneous layer of fat which normally covers the buttocks and upper
parts of the thighs in woman and in this extreme form constitutes a kind
of natural fatty tumor steatopygia cannot be said to exist according to
deniker unless the projection of the buttocks exceeds 4 per cent of the
individuals height it frequently equals 10 per cent true steatopygia
only exists among bushman and hottentot women and among the peoples who
are by blood connected with them an unusual development of the buttocks
is however found among the woloffs and many other african peoples141
there can be no doubt that among the black peoples of africa generally
whether true steatopygia exists among them or not extreme gluteal
development is regarded as a very important if not the most important
mark of beauty and burton stated that a somali man was supposed to choose
his wife by ranging women in a row and selecting her who projected
farthest a tergo142 in europe it must be added clothing enables
this feature of beauty to be simulated even by some african peoples the
posterior development has been made to appear still larger by the use of
cushions and in england in the sixteenth century we find the same
practice well recognized and the elizabethan dramatists refer to the
bumroll which in more recent times has become the bustle devices
which bear witness to what watts the painter called the persistent
tendency to suggest that the most beautiful half of humanity is furnished
with tails143 in reality as we see it is simply a tendency not to
simulate an animal character but to emphasize the most human and the most
feminine of the secondary sexual characters and therefore from the
sexual point of view a beautiful feature144
sometimes admiration for this characteristic is associated with admiration
for marked obesity generally and it may be noted that a somewhat greater
degree of fatness may also be regarded as a feminine secondary sexual
character this admiration is specially marked among several of the black
peoples of africa and here to become a beauty a woman must by drinking
enormous quantities of milk seek to become very fat sonnini noted that
to some extent the same thing might be found among the mohammedan women of
egypt after bright eyes and a soft polished hairless skin an egyptian
woman he stated most desired to obtain embonpoint men admired fat
women and women sought to become fat the idea of a very fat woman
sonnini adds is nearly always accompanied in europe by that of softness
of flesh effacement of form and defect of elasticity in the outlines it
would be a mistake thus to represent the women of turkey in general where
all seek to become fat it is certain that the women of the east more
favored by nature preserve longer than others the firmness of the flesh
and this precious property joined to the freshness and whiteness of their
skin renders them very agreeable it must be added that in no part of the
world is cleanliness carried so far as by the women of the east145
the special characteristics of the feminine hips and buttocks become
conspicuous in walking and may be further emphasized by the special method
of walking or carriage the women of some southern countries are famous
for the beauty of their way of walk the goddess is revealed by her
walk as virgil said in spain especially among european countries the
walk very notably gives expression to the hips and buttocks the spine is
in spain very curved producing what is termed ensellure or
saddlebacka characteristic which gives great flexibility to the back
and prominence to the gluteal regions sometimes slightly simulating
steatopygia the vibratory movement naturally produced by walking and
sometimes artificially heightened thus becomes a trait of sexual beauty
outside of europe such vibration of the flanks and buttocks is more
frankly displayed and cultivated as a sexual allurement the papuans are
said to admire this vibratory movement of the buttocks in their women
young girls are practiced in it by their mothers for hours at a time as
soon as they have reached the age of 7 or 8 and the papuan maiden walks
thus whenever she is in the presence of men subsiding into a simpler gait
when no men are present in some parts of tropical africa the women walk
in this fashion it is also known to the egyptians and by the arabs is
called ghung146 as mantegazza remarks the essentially feminine
character of this gait makes it a method of sexual allurement it should
be observed that it rests on feminine anatomical characteristics and that
the natural walk of a femininely developed woman is inevitably different
from that of a man
    in an elaborate discussion of beauty of movement stratz
    summarizes the special characters of the gait in woman as
    follows a womans walk is chiefly distinguished from a mans by
    shorter steps the more marked forward movement of the hips the
    greater length of the phase of rest in relation to the phase of
    motion and by the fact that the compensatory movements of the
    upper parts of the body are less powerfully supported by the
    action of the arms and more by the revolution of the flanks a
    mans walk has a more pushing and active character a womans a
    more rolling and passive character while a man seems to seek to
    catch his fleeing equilibrium a woman seems to seek to preserve
    the equilibrium she has reached a womans walk is beautiful
    when it shows the definitely feminine and rolling character with
    the greatest predominance of the moment of extension over that of
    flexion stratz die schnheit des weiblichen krpers
    fourteenth edition p 275
an occasional development of the idea of sexual beauty as associated with
developed hips is found in the tendency to regard the pregnant woman as
the most beautiful type stratz observes that a woman artist once remarked
to him that since motherhood is the final aim of woman and a woman
reaches her full flowering period in pregnancy she ought to be most
beautiful when pregnant this is so stratz replied if the period of her
full physical bloom chances to correspond with the early months of
pregnancy for with the onset of pregnancy metabolism is heightened the
tissues become active the tone of the skin softer and brighter the
breasts firmer so that the charm of fullest bloom is increased until the
moment when the expansion of the womb begins to destroy the harmony of the
form at one period of european culture howeverat a moment and among a
people not very sensitive to the most exquisite sthetic sensationsthe
ideal of beauty has even involved the character of advanced pregnancy in
northern europe during the centuries immediately preceding the renaissance
the ideal of beauty as we may see by the pictures of the time was a
pregnant woman with protuberant abdomen and body more or less extended
backward this is notably apparent in the work of the van eycks in the
eve in the brussels gallery in the wife of arnolfini in the highly
finished portrait group in the national gallery even the virgins in the
great masterpiece of the van eycks in the cathedral at ghent assume the
type of the pregnant woman
    through all the middle ages down to drer and cranach quite
    truly remarks laura marholm as quoted by i bloch beitrge zur
    tiologie der psychopathia sexualis teil i p 154 we find a
    very peculiar type which has falsely been regarded as one of
    merely ascetic character it represents quiet peaceful and
    cheerful faces full of innocence tall slender young figures
    the shoulders still scanty the breasts small with slender legs
    beneath their garments and round the upper part of the body
    clothing that is tight almost to the point of constriction the
    waist comes just under the bosom and from this point the broad
    skirts in folds give to the most feminine part of the feminine
    body full and absolutely unhampered power of movement and
    expansion the womanly belly even in saints and virgins is very
    pronounced in the carriage of the body and clearly protuberant
    beneath the clothing it is the maternal function in sacred and
    profane figures alike which marks the whole typeindeed the
    whole conceptionof woman for a brief period this fashion
    reappeared in the eighteenth century and women wore pads and
    other devices to increase the size of the abdomen
with the renaissance this ideal of beauty disappeared from art but in
real life we still seem to trace its survival in the fashion for that
class of garments which involved an immense amount of expansion below the
waist and secured such expansion by the use of whalebone hoops and similar
devices the elizabethan farthingale was such a garment this was
originally a spanish invention as indicated by the name from
verdugardo provided with hoops and reached england through france we
find the fashion at its most extreme point in the fashionable dress of
spain in the seventeenth century such as it has been immortalized by
velasquez in england hoops died out during the reign of george iii but
were revived for a time half a century later in the victorian
crinoline147
only second to the pelvis and its integuments as a secondary sexual
character in woman we must place the breasts148 among barbarous and
civilized peoples the beauty of the breast is usually highly esteemed
among europeans indeed the importance of this region is so highly
esteemed that the general rule against the exposure of the body is in its
favor abrogated and the breasts are the only portion of the body in the
narrow sense which a european lady in full dress is allowed more or less
to uncover moreover at various periods and notably in the eighteenth
century women naturally deficient in this respect have sometimes worn
artificial busts made of wax savages also sometimes show admiration for
this part of the body and in the papuan folktales for instance the
sole distinguishing mark of a beautiful woman is breasts that stand
up149 on the other hand various savage peoples even appear to regard
the development of the breasts as ugly and adopt devices for flattening
this part of the body150 the feeling that prompts this practice is not
unknown in modern europe for the bulgarians are said to regard developed
breasts as ugly in medival europe indeed the general ideal of feminine
slenderness was opposed to developed breasts and the garments tended to
compress them but in a very high degree of civilization this feeling is
unknown as indeed it is unknown to most barbarians and the beauty of a
womans breasts and of any natural or artificial object which suggests
the gracious curves of the bosom is a universal source of pleasure
    the casual vision of a girls breasts may in the chastest youth
    evoke a strange perturbation cf eg a passage in an early
    chapter of marcelle tinayres la maison du pch we need not
    regard this feeling as of purely sexual origin and in addition
    even to the sthetic element it is probably founded to some
    extent on a reminiscence of the earliest associations of life
    this element of early association was very well set forth long
    ago by erasmus darwin
    when the babe soon after it is born into this cold world is
    applied to its mothers bosom its sense of perceiving warmth is
    first agreeably affected next its sense of smell is delighted
    with the odor of her milk then its taste is gratified by the
    flavor of it afterward the appetites of hunger and of thirst
    afford pleasure by the possession of their object and by the
    subsequent digestion of the aliment and last the sense of
    touch is delighted by the softness and smoothness of the milky
    fountain the source of such variety of happiness
    all these various kinds of pleasure at length become associated
    with the form of the mothers breast which the infant embraces
    with its hands presses with its lips and watches with its eyes
    and thus acquires more accurate ideas of the form of its mothers
    bosom than of the odor flavor and warmth which it perceives by
    its other senses and hence at our maturer years when any object
    of vision is presented to us which by its wavy or spiral lines
    bears any similitude to the form of the female bosom whether it
    be found in a landscape with soft gradations of raising and
    descending surface or in the forms of some antique vases or in
    other works of the pencil or the chisel we feel a general glow
    of delight which seems to influence all our senses and if the
    object be not too large we experience an attraction to embrace it
    with our lips as we did in our early infancy the bosom of our
    mothers e darwin zonomia 1800 vol i p 174
the general admiration accorded to developed breasts and a developed
pelvis is evidenced by a practice which as embodied in the corset is all
but universal in many european countries as well as the extraeuropean
countries inhabited by the white race and in one form or another is by no
means unknown to peoples of other than the white race
the tightening of the waist girth was little known to the greeks of the
best period but it was practiced by the greeks of the decadence and by
them transmitted to the romans there are many references in latin
literature to this practice and the ancient physician wrote against it in
the same sense as modern doctors so far as christian europe is concerned
it would appear that the corset arose to gratify an ideal of asceticism
rather than of sexual allurement the bodice in early medival days bound
and compressed the breasts and thus tended to efface the specifically
feminine character of a womans body gradually however the bodice was
displaced downward and its effect ultimately was to render the breasts
more prominent instead of effacing them not only does the corset render
the breasts more prominent it has the further effect of displacing the
breathing activity of the lungs in an upward direction the advantage from
the point of sexual allurement thus gained being that additional attention
is drawn to the bosom from the respiratory movement thus imparted to it
so marked and so constant is this artificial respiratory effect under the
influence of the waist compression habitual among civilized women that
until recent years it was commonly supposed that there is a real and
fundamental difference in breathing between men and women that womens
breathing is thoracic and mens abdominal it is now known that under
natural and healthy conditions there is no such difference but that men
and women breathe in a precisely identical manner the corset may thus be
regarded as the chief instrument of sexual allurement which the armory of
costume supplies to a woman for it furnishes her with a method of
heightening at once her two chief sexual secondary characters the bosom
above the hips and buttocks below we cannot be surprised that all the
scientific evidence in the world of the evil of the corset is powerless
not merely to cause its abolition but even to secure the general adoption
of its comparatively harmless modifications
    several books have been written on the history of the corset
    loty le corset  travers les ages 1893 accepts bouviers
    division of the phases through which the corset has passed 1
    the bands or fasci of greek and roman ladies 2 period of
    transition during greater part of middle ages classic traditions
    still subsisting 3 end of middle ages and beginning of
    renaissance when tight bodices were worn 4 the period of
    whalebone bodices from middle of sixteenth to end of eighteenth
    centuries 5 the period of the modern corset we hear of
    embroidered girdles in homer even in rome however the fasci
    were not in general use and were chiefly employed either to
    support the breasts or to compress their excessive development
    and then called mamillare the zona was a girdle worn
    usually round the hips especially by young girls the modern
    corset is a combination of the fascia and the zona it was at
    the end of the fourteenth century that isabeau of bavaria
    introduced the custom of showing the breasts uncovered and the
    word corset was then used for the first time

    the compression caused by the corset it must be added is not
    usually realized or known by those who wear it thus rushton
    parker and hugh smith found in two independent series of
    measurements that the waist measurement was on the average two
    inches less over the corset than round the naked waist the
    great majority seemed quite unaware of the fact in one case the
    difference was as much as five inches british medical

the breasts and the developed hips are characteristics of women and are
indications of functional effectiveness as well as sexual allurement
another prominent sexual character which belongs to man and is not
obviously an index of function is furnished by the hair on the face the
beard may be regarded as purely a sexual adornment and thus comparable to
the somewhat similar growth on the heads of many male animals from this
point of view its history is interesting for it illustrates the tendency
with increase of civilization not merely to dispense with sexual
allurement in the primary sexual organs but even to disregard those
growths which would appear to have been developed solely to act as sexual
allurements the cultivation of the beard belongs peculiarly to barbarous
races among these races it is frequently regarded as the most sacred and
beautiful part of the person as an object to swear by an object to which
the slightest insult must be treated as deadly holding such a position
it must doubtless act as a sexual allurement allah has specially created
an angel in heaven it is said in the arabian nights who has no other
occupation than to sing the praises of the creator for giving a beard to
men and long hair to women the sexual character of the beard and the
other hirsute appendage is significantly indicated by the fact that the
ascetic spirit in christianity has always sought to minimize or to hide
the hair altogether apart however from this religious influence
civilization tends to be opposed to the growth of hair on the masculine
face and especially to the beard it is part of the wellmarked tendency
with civilization to the abolition of sexual differences we find this
general tendency among the greeks and romans and on the whole with
certain variations and fluctuations of fashion in modern europe also
schopenhauer frequently referred to this disappearance of the beard as a
mark of civilization a barometer of culture151 the absence of facial
hair heightens sthetic beauty of form and is not felt to remove any
substantial sexual attraction
    that even the egyptians regarded the beard as a mark of beauty
    and an object of veneration is shown by the fact that the priests
    wore it long and cut it off in grief herodotus euterpe
    chapter xxxvi the respect with which the beard was regarded
    among the ancient hebrews is indicated in the narrative ii
    samuel chapter x which tells how when david sent his servants
    to king hanun the latter shaved off half their beards they were
    too ashamed to return in this condition and remained at jericho
    until their beards had grown again a passage in ordericus
    vitalis ecclesiastical history book viii chapter x is
    interesting both as regards the fashions of the twelfth century
    in england and normandy and the feeling that prompted ordericus
    speaking of the men of his time he wrote the forepart of
    their head is bare after the manner of thieves while at the back
    they nourish long hair like harlots in former times penitents
    captives and pilgrims usually went unshaved and wore long beards
    as an outward mark of their penance or captivity or pilgrimage
    now almost all the world wear crisped hair and beards carrying
    on their faces the token of their filthy lust like stinking
    goats their locks are curled with hot irons and instead of
    wearing caps they bind their heads with fillets a knight seldom
    appears in public with his head uncovered and properly shaved
    according to the apostolic precept i corinthians chapter xi
    verses 7 and 14
we have seen that there is good reason for assuming a certain fundamental
tendency whereby the most various peoples of the world at all events in
the person of their most intelligent members recognize and accept a
common ideal of feminine beauty so that to a certain extent beauty may be
said to have an objectively sthetic basis we have further found that
this sthetic human ideal is modified and very variously modified in
different countries and even in the same country at different periods by
a tendency prompted by a sexual impulse which is not necessarily in
harmony with sthetic cannons to emphasize or even to repress one or
other of the prominent secondary sexual characters of the body we now
come to another tendency which is apt to an even greater extent to limit
the cultivation of the purely sthetic ideal of beauty the influences of
national or racial type
to the average man of every race the woman who most completely embodies
the type of his race is usually the most beautiful and even mutilations
and deformities often have their origin as humboldt long since pointed
out in the effort to accentuate the racial type152 eastern women
possess by nature large and conspicuous eyes and this characteristic
they seek still further to heighten by art the ainu are the hairiest of
races and there is nothing which they consider so beautiful as hair it
is difficult to be sexually attracted to persons who are fundamentally
unlike ourselves in racial constitution153
it frequently happens that this admiration for racial characteristics
leads to the idealization of features which are far removed from sthetic
beauty the firm and rounded breast is certainly a feature of beauty but
among many of the black peoples of africa the breasts fall at a very early
period and here we sometimes find that the hanging breast is admired as
beautiful
    the african baganda the rev j roscoe states journal of the
    anthropological institute januaryjune 1902 p 72 admire
    hanging breasts to such an extent that their young women tie them
    down in order to hasten the arrival of this condition
    the most remarkable trait of beauty in the east wrote sonnini
    is to have large black eyes and nature has made this a
    characteristic sign of the women of these countries but not
    content with this the women of egypt wish their eyes to be still
    larger and blacker to attain this mussulmans jewesses and
    christians rich and poor all tint their eyelids with galena
    they also blacken the lashes as juvenal tells us the roman
    ladies did and mark the angles of the eye so that the fissure
    appears larger sonnini voyage dans la haute et basse
    egypte 1799 vol i p 290 kohl is thus only used by the
    women who have what the arabs call natural kohl as flinders
    petrie has found the women of the socalled new race between
    the sixth and tenth dynasties of ancient egypt used galena and
    malachite for painting their faces jewish women in the days of
    the prophets painted their eyes with kohl as do some hindu women
    today
    the ainu have a great affection for their beards they regard
    them as a sign of manhood and strength and consider them as
    especially handsome they look upon them indeed as a great and
    highly prized treasure j batchelor the ainu and their
    folklore p 162
    a great many theories have been put forward to explain the
    chinese fashion of compressing and deforming the foot the
    chinese are great admirers of the feminine foot and show
    extreme sexual sensitiveness in regard to it chinese women
    naturally possess very small feet and the main reason for
    binding them is probably to be found in the desire to make them
    still smaller see eg stratz die frauenkleidung 1904 p

an interesting question which in part finds its explanation here and is
of considerable significance from the point of view of sexual selection
concerns the relative admiration bestowed on blondes and brunettes the
question is not indeed one which is entirely settled by racial
characteristics there is something to be said on the matter from the
objective standpoint of sthetic considerations stratz in a chapter on
beauty of coloring in woman points out that fair hair is more beautiful
because it harmonizes better with the soft outlines of woman and one may
add it is more brilliantly conspicuous a golden object looks larger than
a black object the hair of the armpit also stratz considers should be
light on the other hand the pubic hair should be dark in order to
emphasize the breadth of the pelvis and the obtusity of the angle between
the mons veneris and the thighs the eyebrows and eyelashes should also be
dark in order to increase the apparent size of the orbits stratz adds
that among many thousand women he has only seen one who together with an
otherwise perfect form has also possessed these excellencies in the
highest measure with an equable and matt complexion she had blonde very
long smooth hair with sparse blonde and curly axillary hair but
although her eyes were blue the eyebrows and eyelashes were black as
also was the not overdeveloped pubic hair154
we may accept it as fairly certain that so far as any objective standard
of sthetic beauty is recognizable that standard involves the supremacy
of the fair type of woman such supremacy in beauty has doubtless been
further supported by the fact that in most european countries the ruling
caste the aristocratic class whose superior energy has brought it to the
top is somewhat blonder than the average population
the main cause however in determining the relative amount of admiration
accorded in europe to blondes and to brunettes is the fact that the
population of europe must be regarded as predominantly fair and that our
conception of beauty in feminine coloring is influenced by an instinctive
desire to seek this type in its finest forms in the north of europe there
can of course be no question concerning the predominant fairness of the
population but in portions of the centre and especially in the south it
may be considered a question it must however be remembered that the
white population occupying all the shores of the mediterranean have the
black peoples of africa immediately to the south of them they have been
liable to come in contact with the black peoples and in contrast with them
they have tended not only to be more impressed with their own whiteness
but to appraise still more highly its blondest manifestations as
representing a type the farthest removed from the negro it must be added
that the northerner who comes into the south is apt to overestimate the
darkness of the southerner because of the extreme fairness of his own
people the differences are however less extreme than we are apt to
suppose there are more dark people in the north than we commonly assume
and more fair people in the south thus if we take italy we find in its
fairest part venetia according to raseri that there are 8 per cent
communes in which fair hair predominates 81 per cent in which brown
predominates and only 11 per cent in which black predominates as we go
farther south black hair becomes more prevalent but there are in most
provinces a few communes in which fair hair is not only frequent but even
predominant it is somewhat the same with light eyes which are also most
abundant in venetia and decrease to a slighter extent as we go south it
is possible that in former days the blondes prevailed to a greater degree
than today in the south of europe among the berbers of the atlas
mountains who are probably allied to the south europeans there appears
to be a fairly considerable proportion of blondes155 while on the other
hand there is some reason to believe that blondes die out under the
influence of civilization as well as of a hot climate
however this may be the european admiration for blondes dates back to
early classic times gods and men in homer would appear to be frequently
described as fair156 venus is nearly always blonde as was miltons
eve lucian refers to women who dye their hair the greek sculptors gilded
the hair of their statues and the figurines in many cases show very fair
hair157 the roman custom of dyeing the hair light as renier has shown
was not due to the desire to be like the fair germans and when rome fell
it would appear that the custom of dyeing the hair persisted and never
died out it is mentioned by anselm who died at the beginning of the
twelfth century158
in the poetry of the people in italy brunettes as we should expect
receive much commendation though even here the blondes are preferred
when we turn to the painters and poets of italy and the sthetic writers
on beauty from the renaissance onward the admiration for fair hair is
unqualified though there is no correspondingly unanimous admiration for
blue eyes angelico and most of the preraphaelite artists usually painted
their women with flaxen and lightgolden hair which often became brown
with the artists of the renaissance period firenzuola in his admirable
dialogue on feminine beauty says that a womans hair should be like gold
or honey or the rays of the sun luigini also in his libro della bella
donna says that hair must be golden so also thought petrarch and
ariosto there is however no corresponding predilection among these
writers for blue eyes firenzuola said that the eyes must be dark though
not black luigini said that they must be bright and black niphus had
previously said that the eyes should be black like those of venus and
the skin ivory even a little brown he mentions that avicenna had praised
the mixed or gray eye
in france and other northern countries the admiration for very fair hair
is just as marked as in italy and dates back to the earliest ages of
which we have a record even before the thirteenth century remarks
houdoy in his very interesting study of feminine beauty in northern
france during medival times and for men as well as for women fair hair
was an essential condition of beauty gold is the term of comparison
almost exclusively used159 he mentions that in the acta sanctorum it
is stated that saint godelive of bruges though otherwise beautiful had
black hair and eyebrows and was hence contemptuously called a crow in the
chanson de roland and all the french medival poems the eyes are
invariably vairs this epithet is somewhat vague it comes from
varius and signifies mixed which houdoy regards as showing various
irradiations the same quality which later gave rise to the term iris to
describe the pupillary membrane160 vair would thus describe not so
much the color of the eye as its brilliant and sparkling quality while
houdoy may have been correct it still seems probable that the eye
described as vair was usually assumed to be various in color also of
the kind we commonly call gray which is usually applied to blue eyes
encircled with a ring of faintly sprinkled brown pigment such eyes are
fairly typical of northern france and frequently beautiful that this was
the case seems to be clearly indicated by the fact that as houdoy himself
points out a few centuries later the vair eye was regarded as vert
and green eyes were celebrated as the most beautiful161 the etymology
was false but a false etymology will hardly suffice to change an ideal
at the renaissance jehan lemaire when describing venus as the type of
beauty speaks of her green eyes and ronsard a little later sang
    noir je veux loeil et brun le teint
    bien que loeil verd toute la france adore
early in the sixteenth century brantme quotes some lines current in
france spain and italy according to which a woman should have a white
skin but black eyes and eyebrows and adds that personally he agrees with
the spaniard that a brunette is sometimes equal to a blonde162 but
there is also a marked admiration for green eyes in spanish literature
not only in the typical description of a spanish beauty in the celestina
act i are the eyes green but cervantes for example when referring to
the beautiful eyes of a woman frequently speaks of them as green
it would thus appear that in continental europe generally from south to
north there is a fair uniformity of opinion as regards the pigmentary
type of feminine beauty such variation as exists seemingly involves a
somewhat greater degree of darkness for the southern beauty in harmony
with the greater racial darkness of the southerner but the variations
fluctuate within a narrow range the extremely dark type is always
excluded and so it would seem probable is the extremely fair type for
blue eyes have not on the whole been considered to form part of the
admired type
if we turn to england no serious modification of this conclusion is called
for beauty is still fair indeed the very word fair in england itself
means beautiful that in the seventeenth century it was generally held
essential that beauty should be blonde is indicated by a passage in the
anatomy of melancholy where burton argues that golden hair was ever
in great account and quotes many examples from classic and more modern
literature163 that this remains the case is sufficiently evidenced by
the fact that the ballet and chorus on the english stage wear yellow wigs
and the heroine of the stage is blonde while the female villain of
melodrama is a brunette
while however this admiration of fairness as a mark of beauty
unquestionably prevails in england i do not think it can be saidas it
probably can be said of the neighboring and closely allied country of
francethat the most beautiful women belong to the fairest group of the
community in most parts of europe the coarse and unbeautiful plebeian
type tends to be very dark in england it tends to be very fair england
is however somewhat fairer generally than most parts of europe so that
while it may be said that a very beautiful woman in france or in spain may
belong to the blondest section of the community a very beautiful woman in
england even though of the same degree of blondness as her continental
sister will not belong to the extremely blonde section of the english
community it thus comes about that when we are in northern france we find
that gray eyes a very fair but yet unfreckled complexion brown hair
finely molded features and highly sensitive facial expression combine to
constitute a type which is more beautiful than any other we meet in
france and it belongs to the fairest section of the french population
when we cross over to england however unless we go to a socalled
celtic district it is hopeless to seek among the blondest section of
the community for any such beautiful and refined type the english
beautiful woman though she may still be fair is by no means very fair
and from the english standpoint she may even sometimes appear somewhat
dark164 in determining what i call the index of pigmentationor degree
of darkness of the eyes and hairof different groups in the national
portrait gallery i found that the famous beauties my own personal
criterion of beauty not being taken into account was somewhat nearer to
the dark than to the light end of the scale165 if we consider at
random individual instances of famous english beauties they are not
extremely fair lady venetia stanley in the early seventeenth century
who became the wife of sir kenelm digby was somewhat dark with brown
hair and eyebrows mrs overall a little later in the same century a
lancashire woman the wife of the dean of st pauls was says aubrey
the greatest beauty in her time in england though very wanton with
the loveliest eyes that were ever seen if we may trust a ballad given
by aubrey she was dark with black hair the gunnings the famous beauties
of the eighteenth century were not extremely fair and lady hamilton the
most characteristic type of english beauty had blue brownflecked eyes
and dark chestnut hair coloration is only one of the elements of beauty
though an important one other things being equal the most blonde is most
beautiful but it so happens that among the races of great britain the
other things are very frequently not equal and that notwithstanding a
conviction ingrained in the language with us the fairest of women is not
always the fairest so magical however is the effect of brilliant
coloring that it serves to keep alive in popular opinion an unqualified
belief in the universal european creed of the beauty of blondness
we have seen that underlying the conception of beauty more especially as
it manifests itself in woman to man are to be found at least three
fundamental elements first there is the general beauty of the species as
it tends to culminate in the white peoples of european origin then there
is the beauty due to the full development or even exaggeration of the
sexual and more especially the secondary sexual characters and last there
is the beauty due to the complete embodiment of the particular racial or
national type to make the analysis fairly complete must be added at least
one other factor the influence of individual taste every individual at
all events in civilization within certain narrow limits builds up a
feminine ideal of his own in part on the basis of his own special
organization and its demands in part on the actual accidental attractions
he has experienced it is unnecessary to emphasize the existence of this
factor which has always to be taken into account in every consideration
of sexual selection in civilized man but its variations are numerous and
in impassioned lovers it may even lead to the idealization of features
which are in reality the reverse of beautiful it may be said of many a
man as dannunzio says of the hero of his trionfo della morte in
relation to the woman he loved that he felt himself bound to her by the
real qualities of her body and not only by those which were most
beautiful but specially by those which were least beautiful the
novelist italicizes these words so that his attention was fixed upon her
defects and emphasized them thus arousing within himself an impetuous
state of desire without invoking defects however there are endless
personal variations which may all be said to come within the limits of
possible beauty or charm there are no two women as stratz remarks
who in exactly the same way stroke back a rebellious lock from their
brows no two who hold the hand in greeting in exactly the same way no
two who gather up their skirts as they walk with exactly the same
movement166 among the multitude of minute differenceswhich yet can
be seen and feltthe beholder is variously attracted or repelled
according to his own individual idiosyncrasy and the operations of sexual
selection are effected accordingly
another factor in the constitution of the ideal of beauty but one perhaps
exclusively found under civilized conditions is the love of the unusual
the remote the exotic it is commonly stated that rarity is admired in
beauty this is not strictly true except as regards combinations and
characters which vary only in a very slight degree from the generally
admired type jucundum nihil est quod non reficit variatas according
to the saying of publilius syrus the greater nervous restlessness and
sensibility of civilization heightens this tendency which is not
infrequently found also among men of artistic genius one may refer for
instance to baudelaires profound admiration for the mulatto type of
beauty167 in every great centre of civilization the national ideal of
beauty tends to be somewhat modified in exotic directions and foreign
ideals as well as foreign fashions become preferred to those that are
native it is significant of this tendency that when a few years since
an enterprising parisian journal hung in its salle the portraits of one
hundred and thirtyone actresses etc and invited the votes of the
public by ballot as to the most beautiful of them not one of the three
women who came out at the head of the poll was french a dancer of belgian
origin clo de merode was by far at the head with over 3000 votes
followed by an american from san francisco sybil sanderson and then a
polish woman

beauty not the sole element in the sexual appeal of visionmovementthe
mirrornarcissismpygmalionismmixoscopythe indifference of women to
male beautythe significance of womans admiration of strengththe
spectacle of strength is a tactile quality made visible
our discussion of the sensory element of vision in human sexual selection
has been mainly an attempt to disentangle the chief elements of beauty in
so far as beauty is a stimulus to the sexual instinct beauty by no means
comprehends the whole of the influences which make for sexual allurement
through vision but it is the point at which all the most powerful and
subtle of these are focussed it represents a fairly definite complexus
appealing at once to the sexual and to the sthetic impulses to which no
other sense can furnish anything in any degree analogous it is because
this conception of beauty has arisen upon it that vision properly occupies
the supreme position in man from the point of view which we here occupy
beauty is thus the chief but it is not the sole element in the sexual
appeal of vision in all parts of the world this has always been well
understood and in courtship in the effort to arouse tumescence the
appeals to vision have been multiplied and at the same time aided by
appeals to the other senses movement especially in the form of dancing
is the most important of the secondary appeals to vision this is so well
recognized that it is scarcely necessary to insist upon it here it may
suffice to refer to a single typical example the most decent of
polynesian dances according to william ellis was the hura which was
danced by the daughters of chiefs in the presence of young men of rank
with the hope of gaining a future husband the daughters of the chiefs
who were the dancers on these occasions at times amounted to five or six
though occasionally only one exhibited her symmetry of figure and
gracefulness of action their dress was singular but elegant the head
was ornamented with a fine and beautiful braid of human hair wound round
the head in the form of a turban a triple wreath of scarlet white and
yellow flowers adorned the headdress a loose vest of spotted cloth
covered the lower part of the bosom the tihi of fine white stiffened
cloth frequently edged with a scarlet border gathered like a large frill
passed under the arms and reached below the waist while a handsome fine
cloth fastened round the waist with a band or sash covered the feet the
breasts were ornamented with rainbowcolored motherofpearl shells and a
covering of curiously wrought network and feathers the music of the hura
was the large and small drum and occasionally the flute the movements
were generally slow but always easy and natural and no exertion on the
part of the performers was wanting to render them graceful and
attractive168 we see here in this very typical example how the
extraneous visual aids of movement color and brilliancy are invoked in
conjunction with music to make the appeal of beauty more convincing in the
process of sexual selection
    it may be in place here to mention in passing the considerable
    place which vision occupies in normal and abnormal methods of
    heightening tumescence under circumstances which exclude definite
    selection by beauty the action of mirrors belongs to this group
    of phenomena mirrors are present in profusion in highclass
    brothelson the walls and also above the beds innocent youths
    and girls are also often impelled to contemplate themselves in
    mirrors and sometimes thus produce the first traces of sexual
    excitement i have referred to the developed forms of this kind
    of selfcontemplation in the study of autoerotism and in this
    connection have alluded to the fable of narcissus whence ncke
    has since devised the term narcissism for this group of
    phenomena it is only necessary to mention the enormous
    production of photographs representing normal and abnormal
    sexual actions specially prepared for the purpose of exciting or
    of gratifying sexual appetites and the frequency with which even
    normal photographs of the nude appeal to the same lust of the
    eyes
    pygmalionism or falling in love with statues is a rare form of
    erotomania founded on the sense of vision and closely related to
    the allurement of beauty i here use pygmalionism as a general
    term for the sexual love of statues it is sometimes restricted
    to cases in which a man requires of a prostitute that she shall
    assume the part of a statue which gradually comes to life and
    finds sexual gratification in this performance alone eulenburg
    quotes examples sexuale neuropathie p 107 an emotional
    interest in statues is by no means uncommon among young men
    during adolescence heine in florentine nights records the
    experiences of a boy who conceived a sentimental love for a
    statue and as this book appears to be largely autobiographical
    the incident may have been founded on fact youths have sometimes
    masturbated before statues and even before the image of the
    virgin such cases are known to priests and mentioned in manuals
    for confessors pygmalionism appears to have been not uncommon
    among the ancient greeks and this has been ascribed to their
    sthetic sense but the manifestation is due rather to the
    absence than to the presence of sthetic feeling and we may
    observe among ourselves that it is the ignorant and uncultured
    who feel the indecency of statues and thus betray their sense of
    the sexual appeal of such objects we have to remember that in
    greece statues played a very prominent part in life and also
    that they were tinted and thus more lifelike than with us
    lucian athenus lian and others refer to cases of men who
    fell in love with statues tarnowsky sexual instinct english
    edition p 85 mentions the case of a young man who was arrested
    in st petersburg for paying moonlight visits to the statue of a
    nymph on the terrace of a country house and krafftebing quotes
    from a french newspaper the case which occurred in paris during
    the spring of 1877 of a gardener who fell in love with a venus in
    one of the parks i bloch beitrge zur tiologie der
    psychopathia sexualis teil ii pp 297305 brings together
    various facts bearing on this group of manifestations
    necrophily or a sexual attraction for corpses is sometimes
    regarded as related to pygmalionism it is however a more
    profoundly morbid manifestation and may perhaps he regarded as a
    kind of perverted sadism
    founded on the sense of vision also we find a phenomenon
    bordering on the abnormal which is by moll termed mixoscopy
    this means the sexual pleasure derived from the spectacle of
    other persons engaged in natural or perverse sexual actions
    moll kontrre sexualempfindung third edition p 308 moll
    considers that in some cases mixoscopy is related to masochism
    there is however no necessary connection between the two
    phenomena brothels are prepared to accommodate visitors who
    merely desire to look on and for their convenience carefully
    contrived peepholes are provided such visitors are in paris
    termed voyeurs it is said by coffignon that persons hide at
    night in the bushes in the champs elyses in the hope of
    witnessing such scenes between servant girls and their lovers in
    england during a country walk i have come across an elderly man
    carefully ensconced behind a bush and intently watching through
    his fieldglass a couple of lovers reclining on a bank though
    the actions of the latter were not apparently marked by any
    excess of indecorum such impulses are only slightly abnormal
    whatever may be said of them from the point of view of good
    taste they are not very far removed from the legitimate
    curiosity of the young woman who believing herself unobserved
    turns her glass on to a group of young men bathing naked they
    only become truly perverse when the gratification thus derived is
    sought in preference to natural sexual gratification they are
    also not normal when they involve for instance a man desiring
    to witness his wife in the act of coitus with another man i have
    been told of the case of a scientific man who encouraged his wife
    to promote the advances of a young friend of his own in his own
    drawingroom he himself remaining present and apparently taking
    no notice the younger man was astonished but accepted the
    situation in such a case when the motives that led up to the
    episode are obscure we must not too hastily assume that
    masochism or even mixoscopy is involved for information on some
    of the points mentioned above see eg i bloch beitrge zur

wide however as is the appeal of beauty in sexual selection it cannot
be said to cover by any means the whole of the visual field in its sexual
relationship beauty in the human species is above all a feminine
attribute making its appeal to men even for women as has already been
noted beauty is still a feminine quality which they usually admire and
in cases of inversion worship with an ardor which equals if it does not
surpass that experienced by normal men but the normal woman experiences
no corresponding cult for the beauty of man the perfection of the body of
man is not behind that of woman in beauty but the study of it only
appeals to the artist or the sthetician it arouses sexual enthusiasm
almost exclusively in the male sexual invert whatever may be the case
among animals or even among savages in civilization the man is most
successful with women is not the most handsome man and may be the
reverse of handsome169 the maiden according to the old saying who has
to choose between adonis and hercules will turn to hercules
    a correspondent writes men are generally attracted in the first
    instance by a womans beauty either of face or figure
    frequently this is the highest form of love they are capable of
    personally my own love is always prompted by this in the case
    of my wife there was certainly a leaven of friendship and moral
    sympathies but these alone would never have been translated into
    love had she not been young and goodlooking moreover i have
    felt intense passion for other women in my relations with whom
    the elements of moral or mental sympathy have not entered and
    always as youth and beauty went i believe i should transfer my
    love to some one else
    now in woman i fancy this element of beauty and youth does not
    enter so much i have questioned a large number of womensome
    married some unmarried young and old ladies shopgirls
    servants prostitutes women whom i have known only as friends
    others with whom i have had sexual relationsand i cannot
    recollect one instance when a woman said she had fallen in love
    with a man for his looks the nearest approach to any sign of
    this was in the instance of one who noticed a handsome man
    sitting near us in a hotel and said to me i should like him to
    kiss me
    i have also noticed that women do not like looking at my body
    when naked as i like looking at theirs my wife has on a few
    occasions put her hand over my body and expressed pleasure at
    the feeling of my skin i have very fair soft skin but i have
    never seen women exhibit the excitement that is caused in me by
    the sight of their bodies which i love to look at to stroke to
    kiss all over
    it is interesting to point out in this connection that the
    admiration of strength is not confined to the human female it is
    by the spectacle of his force that the male among many of the
    lower animals sexually affects the female darwin duly allows for
    this fact while some evolutionists and notably wallace
    consider that it covers the whole field of sexual selection when
    choice exists wallace states all the facts appear to be
    consistent with the choice depending on a variety of male
    characteristics with some of which color is often correlated
    thus it is the opinion of some of the best observers that vigor
    and liveliness are most attractive and these are no doubt
    usually associated with some intensity of color  there is
    reason to believe that it is his the male birds persistency
    and energy rather than his beauty which wins the day ar
    wallace tropical nature 1898 p 199 in his later book
    darwinism p 295 wallace reaffirms his position that sexual
    selection means that in the rivalry of males for the female the
    most vigorous secures the advantage ornament he adds is the
    natural product and direct outcome of superabundant health and
    vigor as regards womans love of strength see westermarck
    history of marriage p 255
women admire a mans strength rather than his beauty this statement is
commonly made and with truth but so far as i am aware its meaning is
never analyzed when we look into it i think we shall find that it leads
us into a special division of the visual sphere of sexual allurement the
spectacle of force while it remains strictly within the field of vision
really brings to us although unconsciously impressions that are
correlated with another sensethat of touch we instinctively and
unconsciously translate visible energy into energy of pressure in
admiring strength we are really admiring a tactile quality which has been
made visible it may therefore be said that while through vision men are
sexually affected mainly by the more purely visual quality of beauty
women are more strongly affected by visual impressions which express
qualities belonging to the more fundamentally sexual sense of touch
the distinction between the mans view and the womans view here pointed
out is not it must be added absolute even for a man beauty with all
these components which we have already analyzed in it is not the sole
sexual allurement of vision a woman is not necessarily sexually
attractive in the ratio of her beauty and with even a high degree of
beauty may have a low degree of attraction the addition of vivacity or
the addition of languor may each furnish a sexual allurement and each of
these is a translated tactile quality which possesses an obscure potency
from vague sexual implications170 but while in the man the demand for
these translated pressure qualities in the visible attractiveness of a
woman are not usually quite clearly realized in a woman the corresponding
craving for the visual expression of pressure energy is much more
pronounced and predominant it is not difficult to see why this should be
so even without falling back on the usual explanation that natural
selection implies that the female shall choose the male who will be the
most likely father of strong children and the best protector of his
family the more energetic part in physical love belongs to the man the
more passive part to the woman so that while energy in a woman is no
index to effectiveness in love energy in a man furnishes a seeming index
to the existence of the primary quality of sexual energy which a woman
demands of a man in the sexual embrace it may be a fallacious index for
muscular strength is not necessarily correlated with sexual vigor and in
its extreme degrees appears to be more correlated with its absence but it
furnishes in stendhals phrase a probability of passion and in any case
it still remains a symbol which cannot be without its effect we must not
of course suppose that these considerations are always or often present
to the consciousness of the maiden who blushingly turns from adonis to
hercules but the emotional attitude is rooted in more or less unerring
instincts in this way it happens that even in the field of visual
attraction sexual selection influences women on the underlying basis of
the more primitive sense of touch the fundamentally sexual sense
    women are very sensitive to the quality of a mans touch and
    appear to seek and enjoy contact and pressure to a greater extent
    than do men although in early adolescence this impulse seems to
    be marked in both sexes there is something strangely winning to
    most women remarks george eliot in the mill on the floss
    in that offer of the firm arm the help is not wanted physically
    at that moment but the sense of helpthe presence of strength
    that is outside them and yet theirsmeets a continual want of
    the imagination
    women are often very critical concerning a mans touch and his
    method of shaking hands stanley hall adolescence vol ii p
    8 quotes a gifted lady as remarking i used to say that
    however much i liked a man i could never marry him if i did not
    like the touch of his hand and i feel so yet
    among the elements of sexual attractiveness which make a special
    appeal to women extreme personal cleanliness would appear to
    take higher rank than it takes in the eyes of a man some men
    indeed seeming to make surprisingly small demands of a woman in
    this respect if this is so we may connect it with the fact that
    beauty in a womans eye is to a much greater extent than in a
    mans a picture of energy in other words a translation of
    pressure contracts with which the question of physical purity is
    necessarily more intimately associated than it is with the
    picture of purely visual beauty it is noteworthy that ovid ars
    amandi lib i urges men who desire to please women to leave
    the arts of adornment and effeminacy to those whose loves are
    homosexual and to practice a scrupulous attention to extreme
    neatness and cleanliness of body and garments in every detail a
    sunbrowned skin and the absence of all odor some two thousand
    years later brummell in an age when extravagance and effeminacy
    often marked the fashions of men introduced a new ideal of
    unobtrusive simplicity extreme cleanliness with avoidance of
    perfumes and exquisite good taste he abhorred all
    eccentricity and may be said to have constituted a tradition
    which englishmen have ever since sought more or less
    successfully to follow he was idolized by women
    it may be added that the attentiveness of women to tactile
    contacts is indicated by the frequency with which in them it
    takes on morbid forms as the dlire du contact the horror of
    contamination the exaggerated fear of touching dirt see eg
    raymond and janet les obsessions et la psychasthnie

when we are dealing with the senses of touch smell and hearing it is
impossible at present and must always remain somewhat difficult to
investigate precisely the degree and direction of their influence in
sexual selection we can marshal in orderas has here been attemptedthe
main facts and considerations which clearly indicate that there is and
must be such an influence but we cannot even attempt to estimate its
definite direction and still less to measure it precisely with regard to
vision we are in a somewhat better position it is possible to estimate
the direction of the influence which certain visible characters exert on
sexual selection and it is even possible to attempt their actual
measurement although there must frequently be doubt as to the
interpretation of such measurements
two facts render it thus possible to deal more exactly with the influence
of vision on sexual selection than with the influence of the other senses
in the first place men and women consciously seek for certain visible
characters in the persons to whom they are attracted in other words
their ideals of a fitting mate are visual rather than tactile
olfactory or auditory in the second place whether such ideals are
potent in actual mating or whether they are modified or even inhibited by
more potent psychological or general biological influences it is in
either case possible to measure and compare the visible characters of
mated persons
the two visible characters which are at once most frequently sought in a
mate and most easily measurable are degree of stature and degree of
pigmentation every youth or maiden pictures the person he or she would
like for a lover as tall or short fair or dark and such characters are
measurable and have on a large scale been measured it is of interest in
illustration of the problem of sexual selection in man to consider briefly
what results are at present obtainable regarding the influence of these
two characters
it has long been a widespread belief that short people are sexually
attracted to tall people and tall people to short that in the matter of
stature men and women are affected by what bain called the charm of
disparity it has not always prevailed many centuries ago leonardo da
vinci whose insight at so many points anticipated our most modern
discoveries affirmed clearly and repeatedly the charm of parity after
remarking that painters tend to delineate the figures that resemble
themselves he adds that men also fall in love with and marry those who
resemble themselves chi sinnamora voluntieri sinnamorano de cose a
loro simiglianti he elsewhere puts it171 but from that day to this
it would seem leonardos statements have remained unknown or unnoticed
bernardin de saintpierre said that love is the result of contrasts and
schopenhauer affirmed the same point very decisively various scientific
and unscientific writers have repeated this statement172
so far as stature is concerned there appears to be very little reason to
suppose that this charm of disparity plays any notable part in
constituting the sexual ideals of either men or women indeed it may
probably be affirmed that both men and women seek tallness in the person
to whom they are sexually attracted darwin quotes the opinion of mayhew
that among dogs the females are strongly attracted to males of large
size173 i believe this is true and it is probably merely a particular
instance of a general psychological tendency
    it is noteworthy as an indication of the direction of the sexual
    ideal in this matter that the heroines of male novelists are
    rarely short and the heroes of female novelists almost invariably
    tall a reviewer of novels addressing to lady novelists in the
    speaker july 26 1890 a plea for shorter heroes publishes
    statistics on this point heroes he states are longer this
    year than ever of the 192 of whom i have had my word to say
    since october of last year 27 were merely tall and 11 were only
    slightly above the middle height no less than 85 stood exactly
    six feet in their stocking soles and the remainder were
    considerably over the two yards i take the average to be six
    feet three
    as a slight test alike of the supposed charm of disparity as
    well as of the general degree in which tall and short persons are
    sought as mates by those of the opposite sex i have examined a
    series of entries in the roundabout a publication issued by a
    club of which the president is mr wt stead having for its
    object the purpose of promoting correspondence friendship and
    marriage between its members there are two classes of entries
    one inserted with a view to intellectual friendship the other
    with a view to marriage i have not thought it necessary to
    recognize this distinction here if a man describes his own
    physical characteristics and those of the lady he would like as a
    friend i assume that from the point of view of the present
    inquiry he is much on the same footing as the man who seeks a
    wife in the series of entries which i have examined 35 men and
    women state approximately the height of the man or woman they
    seek to know 30 state in addition their own height the results
    are expressed in the table on the following page
    although the cases are few the results are in two main
    respects sufficiently clear without multiplication of data in
    the first place those who seek parity whether men or women are
    in a majority over those who seek disparity in the second place
    the existence of any disparity at all is due only to the
    universal desire to find a tall person not one man or woman sets
    down shortness as his or her ideal the very fact that no man in
    these initial announcements ventures to set himself down as short
    although a considerable proportion describe themselves as tall
    indicates a consciousness that shortness is undesirable as also
    does the fact that the women very frequently describe themselves
    as tall
the same charm of disparity which has been supposed to rule in selective
attraction as regards stature has also been assumed as regards
pigmentation the fair it is said are attracted to the dark the dark to
the fair again it must be said that this common assumption is not
confirmed either by introspection or by any attempt to put the matter on a
statistical basis174

most people who will carefully introspect their own feelings and ideals in
this matter will find that they are not attracted to persons of the
opposite sex who are strikingly unlike themselves in pigmentary
characters even when the abstract ideal of a sexually desirable person
is endowed with certain pigmentary characters such as blue eyes or
darknesseither of which is liable to make a vaguely romantic appeal to
the imaginationit is usually found on testing the feeling for
particular persons that the variation from the personal type of the
subject is usually only agreeable within narrow limits and that there is
a very common tendency for persons of totally opposed pigmentary types
even though they may sometimes be considered to possess a certain sthetic
beauty to be regarded as sexually unattractive or even repulsive with
this feeling may perhaps be associated the feeling certainly very widely
felt that one would not like to marry a person of foreign even though
closely allied race
    from the same number of the roundabout from which i have
    extracted the data on stature i have obtained corresponding data
    on pigmentation and have embodied them in the following table
    they are likewise very scanty but they probably furnish as good
    a general indication of the drift of ideals in this matter as we
    should obtain from more extensive data of the same character

    it will be seen that in the case of pigmentation there is not as
    in the case of stature a decided charm of parity in the formation
    of sexual ideals the phenomenon however remains essentially
    analogous just as in regard to stature there is without
    exception an abstract admiration for tall persons so here
    though to a less marked extent there is a general admiration for
    dark persons as many as 6 out of 8 women and 14 out of 21 men
    seek a dark partner this tendency ranges itself with the
    considerations already brought forward p 182 leading us to
    believe that in england at all events the admiration of
    fairness is not efficacious to promote any sexual selection and
    that if there is actually any such selection it must be put down
    to other causes no doubt even in england the abstract sthetic
    admiration of fairness is justifiable and may influence the
    artist probably also it influences the poet who is affected by
    a longestablished convention in favor of fairness and perhaps
    also by a general tendency on the part of our poets to be
    themselves fair and to yield to the charm of paritythe
    tendency to prefer the women of ones own stockwhich we have
    already found to be a real force175 but as a matter of fact
    our famous english beauties are not very fair probably our
    handsomest men are not very fair and the abstract sexual ideals
    of both our men and our women thus go out toward the dark
the formation of a sexual ideal while it furnishes a predisposition to be
attracted in a certain direction and undoubtedly has a certain weight in
sexual choice is not by any means the whole of sexual selection it is
not even the whole of the psychic element in sexual selection let us
take for instance the question of stature there would seem to be a
general tendency for both men and women apart from and before experience
to desire sexually large persons of the opposite sex it may even be that
this is part of a wider zological tendency in the human species it shows
itself also on the spiritual plane in the desire for the infinite in the
deep and unreasoning feeling that it is impossible to have too much of a
good thing but it not infrequently happens that a man in whose youthful
dreams of love the heroine has always been large has not been able to
calculate what are the special nervous and other characteristics most
likely to be met in large women nor how far these correlated
characteristics would suit his own instinctive demands he may and
sometimes does find that in these other demands which prove to be more
important and insistent than the desire for stature the tall women he
meets are less likely to suit him than the medium or short women176 it
may thus happen that a man whose ideal of woman has always been as tall
may yet throughout life never be in intimate relationship with a tall
woman because he finds that practically he has more marked affinities in
the case of shorter women his abstract ideals are modified or negatived
by more imperative sympathies or antipathies
in one field such sympathies have long been recognized especially by
alienists as leading to sexual unions of parity notwithstanding the
belief in the generally superior attraction of disparity it has often
been pointed out that the neuropathic the insane and criminal
degenerates of all kinds show a notable tendency to marry each other
this tendency has not however been investigated with any precision177
the first attempt on a statistical basis to ascertain what degree of
parity or disparity is actually attained by sexual selection was made by
alphonse de candolle178 obtaining his facts from switzerland north
germany and belgium he came to the conclusion that marriages are most
commonly contracted between persons with different eyecolors except in
the case of browneyed women who as schopenhauer stated and as is seen
in the english data of the sexual ideal i have brought forward are found
more attractive than others
the first series of serious observations tending to confirm the result
reached by the genius of leonardo da vinci and to show that sexual
selection results in the pairing of like rather than of unlike persons was
made by hermann fol the embryologist179 he set out with the popular
notion that married people end by resembling each other but when at nice
which is visited by many young married couples on their honeymoons he was
struck by the resemblances already existing immediately after marriage in
order to test the matter he obtained the photographs of 251 young and old
married couples not personally known to him the results were as follows
                    resemblances      nonresemblances
    couples        percentage      percentage   total
young 132 about 6666   66 about 3333   198
old  38 about 7170   15 about 2830    53
he concluded that in the immense majority of marriages of inclination the
contracting parties are attracted by similarities and not by
dissimilarities and that consequently the resemblances between aged
married couples are not acquired during conjugal life although fols
results were not obtained by good methods and do not cover definite
points like stature and eyecolor they represented the conclusions of a
highly skilled and acute observer and have since been amply confirmed
galton could not find that the average results from a fairly large number
of cases indicated that stature eyecolor or other personal
characteristics notably influenced sexual selection as evidenced by a
comparison of married couples180 karl pearson however in part making
use of a large body of data obtained by galton referring to stature and
eyecolor has reached the conclusion that sexual selection ultimately
results in a marked degree of parity so far as these characters are
concerned181 as regards stature he is unable to find evidence of what
he terms preferential mating that is to say it does not appear that
any preconceived ideals concerning the desirability of tallness in sexual
mates leads to any perceptibly greater tallness of the chosen mate
husbands are not taller than men in general nor wives than women in
general in regard to eyecolor however there appeared to be evidence of
preferential mating husbands are very decidedly fairer than men in
general and though there is no such marked difference in women wives are
also somewhat fairer than women in general as regards assortative
mating as it is termed by pearsonthe tendency to parity or to
disparity between husbands and wivesthe result were in both cases
decisive tall men marry women who are somewhat above the average in
height short men marry women who are somewhat below the average so that
husband and wife resemble each other in stature as closely as uncle and
niece as regards eyecolor there is also a tendency for like to marry
like the lighteyed men tend to marry lighteyed women more often than
darkeyed women the darkeyed men tend to marry darkeyed women more
often than lighteyed there remains however a very considerable
difference in the eyecolor of husband and wife in the 774 couples dealt
with by pearson there are 333 darkeyed women to only 251 darkeyed men
and 523 lighteyed men to only 441 lighteyed women the women in the
english population are darkereyed than the men182 but the difference
is scarcely so great as this so that even if wives are not so darkeyed
as women generally it would appear that the ideal admiration for the
darkeyed may still to some extent make itself felt in actual mating
while we have to recognize that the modification and even total inhibition
of sexual ideals in the process of actual mating is largely due to psychic
causes such causes do not appear to cover the whole of the phenomena
undoubtedly they count for much and the man or the woman who from
whatever causes has constituted a sexual ideal with certain characters
may in the actual contacts of life find that individuals with other and
even opposed characters most adequately respond to his or her psychic
demands there are however other causes in play here which at first
sight may seem to be not of a purely psychic character one unquestionable
cause of this kind comes into action in regard to pigmentary selection
fair people possibly as a matter of race more than from absence of
pigment are more energetic than dark people they possess a sanguine
vigor and impetuosity which in most though not in all fields and
especially in the competition of practical life tend to give them some
superiority over their darker brethren the greater fairness of husbands
in comparison with men in general as found by karl pearson is thus
accounted for fair men are most likely to obtain wives husbands are
fairer than men in general for the same reason that as i have shown
elsewhere183 created peers are fairer than either hereditary peers or
even most groups of intellectual persons they have possessed in higher
measure the qualities that insure success it may be added that with the
recognition of this fact we have not really left the field of sexual
psychology for as has already been pointed out that energy which thus
insures success in practical life is itself a sexual allurement to women
energy in a woman in courtship is less congenial to her sexual attitude
than to a mans and is not attractive to men thus it is not surprising
even apart from the probably greater beauty of dark women that the
preponderance of fairness among wives as compared to women generally
indicated by karl pearsons data is very slight it may possibly be
accounted for altogether by homogamythe tendency of like to marry
likein the fair husbands
the energy and vitality of fair people is not however it is probable
merely an indirect cause of the greater tendency of fair men to become
husbands that is to say it is not merely the result of the generally
somewhat greater ability of the fair to attain success in temporal
affairs in addition to this fair men if not fair women would appear to
show a tendency to a greater activity in their specifically sexual
proclivities this is a point which we shall encounter in a later study
and it is therefore unnecessary to discuss it here
in dealing with the question of sexual selection in man various writers
have been puzzled by the problem presented by that abhorrence of incest
which is usually though not always so clearly marked among the different
races of mankind184 it was once commonly stated as by morgan and by
maine that this abhorrence was the result of experience the marriages of
closely related persons were found to be injurious to offspring and were
therefore avoided this theory however is baseless because the marriages
of closely related persons are not injurious to the offspring
consanguineous marriages so closely as they can be investigated on a
large scalethat is to say marriages between cousinsas huth was the
first to show develop no tendency to the production of offspring of
impaired quality provided the parents are sound they are only injurious
in this respect in so far as they may lead to the union of couples who are
both defective in the same direction according to another theory that of
westermarck who has very fully and ably discussed the whole
question185 there is an innate aversion to sexual intercourse between
persons living very closely together from early youth and as such
persons are in most cases related this feeling displays itself chiefly
as a horror of intercourse between near kin westermarck points out very
truly that the prohibition of incest could not be founded on experience
even if as he is himself inclined to believe consanguineous marriages
are injurious to the offspring incest is prevented neither by laws nor
by customs nor by education but by an instinct which under normal
circumstances makes sexual love between the nearest kin a psychic
impossibility there is however a very radical objection to this
theory it assumes the existence of a kind of instinct which can with
difficulty be accepted an instinct is fundamentally a more or less
complicated series of reflexes set in action by a definite stimulus an
innate tendency at once so specific and so merely negative involving at
the same time deliberate intellectual processes can only with a certain
force be introduced into the accepted class of instincts it is as awkward
and artificial an instinct as would be let us say an instinct to avoid
eating the apples that grew in ones own yard186
the explanation of the abhorrence to incest is really however
exceedingly simple any reader who has followed the discussion of sexual
selection in the present volume and is also familiar with the analysis of
the sexual impulse set forth in the previous volume of these studies
will quickly perceive that the normal failure of the pairing instinct to
manifest itself in the case of brothers and sisters or of boys and girls
brought up together from infancy is a merely negative phenomenon due to
the inevitable absence under those circumstances of the conditions which
evoke the pairing impulse courtship is the process by which powerful
sensory stimuli proceeding from a person of the opposite sex gradually
produce the physiological state of tumescence with its psychic
concomitant of love and desire more or less necessary for mating to be
effected but between those who have been brought up together from
childhood all the sensory stimuli of vision hearing and touch have been
dulled by use trained to the calm level of affection and deprived of
their potency to arouse the erethistic excitement which produces sexual
tumescence187 brothers and sisters in relation to each other have at
puberty already reached that state to which old married couples by the
exhaustion of youthful passion and the slow usage of daily life gradually
approximate passion between brother and sister is indeed by no means so
rare as is sometimes supposed and it may be very strong but it is
usually aroused by the aid of those conditions which are normally required
for the appearance of passion more especially by the unfamiliarity caused
by a long separation in reality therefore the usual absence of sexual
attraction between brothers and sisters requires no special explanation
it is merely due to the normal absence under these circumstances of the
conditions that tend to produce sexual tumescence and the play of those
sensory allurements which lead to sexual selection188 it is a purely
negative phenomenon and it is quite unnecessary even if it were
legitimate to invoke any instinct for its explanation it is probable
that the same tendency also operates among animals to some extent tending
to produce a stronger sexual attraction toward those of their species to
whom they have not become habituated189 in animals and in man also
when living under primitive conditions sexual attraction is not a
constant phenomenon190 it is an occasional manifestation only called
out by the powerful stimulation it is not its absence which we need to
explain it is its presence which needs explanation and such an
explanation we find in the analysis of the phenomena of courtship
the abhorrence of incest is an interesting and significant phenomenon from
our present point of view because it instructively points out to us the
limits to that charm of parity which apparently makes itself felt to some
considerable extent in the constitution of the sexual ideal and still more
in the actual homogamy which seems to predominate over heterogamy this
homogamy is it will be observed a racial homogamy it relates to
anthropological characters which mark stocks even in this racial field
it is unnecessary to remark the homogamy attained is not and could not
be absolute nor would it appear that such absolute racial homogamy is
even desired a tall man who seeks a tall woman can seldom wish her to be
as tall as himself a dark man who seeks a dark woman certainly will not
be displeased at the inevitably greater or less degree of pigment which he
finds in her eyes as compared to his own
but when we go outside the racial field this tendency to homogamy
disappears at once a man marries a woman who with slight but agreeable
variations belongs to a like stock to himself the abhorrence of incest
indicates that even the sexual attraction to people of the same stock has
its limits for it is not strong enough to overcome the sexual
indifference between persons of near kin the desire for novelty shown in
this sexual indifference to near kin and to those who have been housemates
from childhood together with the notable sexual attractiveness often
possessed by a strange youth or maiden who arrives in a small town or
village indicates that slight differences in stock if not indeed a
positive advantage from this point of view are certainly not a
disadvantage when we leave the consideration of racial differences to
consider sexual differences not only do we no longer find any charm of
parity but we find that there is an actual charm of disparity at this
point it is necessary to remember all that has been brought forward in
earlier pages191 concerning the emphasis of the secondary sexual
characters in the ideal of beauty all those qualities which the woman
desires to see emphasized in the man are the precise opposite of the
qualities which the man desires to see emphasized in the woman the man
must be strong vigorous energetic hairy even rough to stir the
primitive instincts of the womans nature the woman who satisfies this
man must be smooth rounded and gentle it would be hopeless to seek for
any homogamy between the manly man and the virile woman between the
feminine woman and the effeminate man it is not impossible that this
tendency to seek disparity in sexual characters may exert some disturbing
influences on the tendency to seek parity in anthropological racial
characters for the sexual difference to some extent makes itself felt in
racial characters a somewhat greater darkness of women is a secondary
or more precisely tertiary sexual character and on this account
alone it is possible somewhat attractive to men192 a difference in
size and stature is a very marked secondary sexual character in the
considerable body of data concerning the stature of married couples
reproduced by pearson from galtons tables although the tall on the
average tend to marry the tall and the short the short it is yet
noteworthy that while the men of 5 ft 4 ins have more wives at 5 ft 2
ins than at any other height men of 6 ft show in an exactly similar
manner more wives at 5 ft 2 ins than at any other height although for
many intermediate heights the most numerous groups of wives are
taller193
in matters of carriage habit and especially clothing the love of sexual
disparity is instinctive everywhere well marked and often carried to
very great lengths to some extent such differences are due to the
opposing demands of more fundamental differences in custom and occupation
but this cause by no means adequately accounts for them since it may
sometimes happen that what in one land is the practice of the men is in
another the practice of the women and yet the practices of the two sexes
are still opposed194 men instinctively desire to avoid doing things in
womens ways and women instinctively avoid doing things in mens ways
yet both sexes admire in the other sex those things which in themselves
they avoid in the matter of clothing this charm of disparity reaches its
highest point and it has constantly happened that men have even called in
the aid of religion to enforce a distinction which seemed to them so
urgent195 one of the greatest of sex allurements would be lost and the
extreme importance of clothes would disappear at once if the two sexes
were to dress alike such identity of dress has however never come about
among any people

summary of the conclusions at present attainable in regard to the nature
of beauty and its relation to sexual selection
the consideration of vision has led us into a region in which more
definitely and precisely than is the case with any other sense we can
observe and even hope to measure the operation of sexual selection in man
in the conception of feminine beauty we possess an instrument of universal
extension by which it seems possible to measure the nature and extent of
such selection as exercised by men on women this conception with which
we set out is however by no means so precise so easily available for
the attainment of sound conclusions as at first it may seem to be
it is true that beauty is not as some have supposed a mere matter of
caprice it rests in part on 1 an objective basis of sthetic character
which holds all its variations together and leads to a remarkable
approximation among the ideals of feminine beauty cherished by the most
intelligent men of all races but beyond this general objective basis we
find that 2 the specific characters of the race or nation tend to cause
divergence in the ideals of beauty since beauty is often held to consist
in the extreme development of these racial or national anthropological
features and it would indeed appear that the full development of racial
characters indicates at the same time the full development of health and
vigor we have further to consider that 3 in most countries an important
and usually essential element of beauty lies in the emphasis of the
secondary and tertiary sexual characters the special characters of the
hair in woman her breasts her hips and innumerable other qualities of
minor saliency but all apt to be of significance from the point of view
of sexual selection in addition we have 4 the factor of individual
taste constituted by the special organization and the peculiar
experiences of the individual and inevitably affecting his ideal of
beauty often this individual factor is merged into collective shapes
and in this way are constituted passing fashions in the matter of beauty
certain influences which normally affect only the individual having become
potent enough to affect many individuals finally in states of high
civilization and in individuals of that restless and nervous temperament
which is common in civilization we have 5 a tendency to the appearance
of an exotic element in the ideal of beauty and in place of admiring that
kind of beauty which most closely approximates to the type of their own
race men begin to be agreeably affected by types which more or less
deviate from that with which they are most familiar
while we have these various and to some extent conflicting elements in a
mans ideal of feminine beauty the question is still further complicated
by the fact that sexual selection in the human species is not merely the
choice of the woman by the man but also the choice of the man by the
woman and when we come to consider this we find that the standard is
altogether different that many of the elements of beauty as it exists in
woman for man have here fallen away altogether while a new and
preponderant element has to be recognized in the shape of a regard for
strength and vigor this as i have pointed out is not a purely visual
character but a tactile pressure character translated into visual terms
when we have stated the sexual ideal we have not yet however by any
means stated the complete problem of human sexual selection the ideal
that is desired and sought is in a large measure not the outcome of
experience it is not even necessarily the expression of the individuals
temperament and idiosyncrasy it may be largely the result of fortuitous
circumstances of slight chance attractions in childhood of accepted
traditions consecrated by romance in the actual contacts of life the
individual may find that his sexual impulse is stirred by sensory stimuli
which are other than those of the ideal he had cherished and may even be
the reverse of them
beyond this also we have reason for believing that factors of a still
more fundamentally biological character to some extent deeper even than
all these psychic elements enter into the problem of sexual selection
certain individuals apart altogether from the question of whether they
are either ideally or practically the most fit mates display a greater
energy and achieve a greater success than others in securing partners
these individuals possess a greater constitutional vigor physical or
mental which conduces to their success in practical affairs generally
and probably also heightens their specifically philogamic activities
thus the problem of human sexual selection is in the highest degree
complicated when we gather together such scanty data of precise nature as
are at present available we realize that while generally according with
the results which the evidence not of a quantitative nature would lead us
to accept their precise significance is not at present altogether clear
it would appear on the whole that in choosing a mate we tend to seek
parity of racial and individual characters together with disparity of
secondary sexual characters but we need a much larger number of groups of
evidence of varying character and obtained under varying conditions such
evidence will doubtless accumulate now that its nature is becoming defined
and the need for it recognized in the meanwhile we are at all events in
a position to assert even with the evidence before us that now that the
real meaning of sexual selection is becoming clear its efficacy in human
evolution can no longer be questioned

the origins of the kiss
manifestations resembling the kiss whether with the object of expressing
affection or sexual emotion are found among various animals much lower
than man the caressing of the antenn practiced by snails and various
insects during sexual intercourse is of the nature of a kiss birds use
their bills for a kind of caress thus referring to guillemots and their
practice of nibbling each others feet and the interest the mate always
takes in this proceeding which probably relieves irritation caused by
insects edmund selous remarks when they nibble and preen each other
they may i think be rightly said to cosset and caress the expression
and pose of the bird receiving the benefit being often beatific196
among mammals such as the dog we have what closely resembles a kiss and
the dog who smells licks and gently bites his master or a bitch
combines most of the sensory activities involved in the various forms of
the human kiss
as practiced by man the kiss involves mainly either the sense of touch or
that of smell occasionally it involves to some extent both sensory
elements197
the tactile kiss is certainly very ancient and primitive it is common
among mammals generally the human infant exhibits in a very marked
degree the impulse to carry everything to the mouth and to lick or
attempt to taste it possibly as compayre suggests198 from a memory of
the action of the lips protruded to seize the maternal nipple the
affectionate child as mantegazza remarks199 not only applies inanimate
objects to its lips or tongue but of its own impulse licks the people it
likes stanley hall in the light of a large amount of information he
obtained on this point found that some children insist on licking the
cheeks necks and hands of those they wish to caress or like having
animals lick them200 this impulse in children may be associated with
the maternal impulse in animals to lick the young the method of licking
the young practiced by the mother remarks ss buckman would cause
licking to be associated with happy feelings and further there is the
allaying of parasitical irritation which is afforded by the rubbing and
hence results in pleasure it may even be suggested that the desire of the
mother to lick her young was prompted in the first place by a desire to
bestow on her offspring a pleasure she felt herself the licking impulse
in the child may thus it is possible be regarded as the evanescent
manifestation of a more fundamental animal impulse201 a manifestation
which is liable to appear in adult life under the stress of strong sexual
emotion such an association is of interest if as there is some reason to
believe the kiss of sexual love originated as a development of the more
primitive kiss bestowed by the mother on her child for it is sometimes
found that the maternal kiss is practiced where the sexual kiss is
unknown
the impulse to bite is also a part of the tactile element which lies at
the origin of kissing as stanley hall notes children are fond of biting
though by no means always as a method of affection there is however in
biting a distinctly sexual origin to invoke for among many animals the
teeth and among birds the bill are used by the male to grasp the female
more firmly during intercourse this point has been discussed in the
previous volume of these studies in reference to love and pain and
it is unnecessary to enter into further details here the heroine of
kleists penthesilea remarks kissing ksse rhymes with biting
bisse and one who loves with the whole heart may easily confound the
two
the kiss as known in europe has developed on a sensory basis that is
mainly tactile although an olfactory element may sometimes coexist the
kiss thus understood is not very widely spread and is not usually found
among rude and uncultured peoples we can trace it in aryan and semitic
antiquity but in no very pronounced form homer scarcely knew it and the
greek poets seldom mention it today it may be said to be known all over
europe except in lapland even in europe it is probably a comparatively
modern discovery and in all the celtic tongues rhys states there is no
word for kiss the word employed being always borrowed from the latin
pax202 at a fairly early historic period however the welsh cymri
at all events acquired a knowledge of the kiss but it was regarded as a
serious matter and very sparingly used being by law only permitted on
special occasions as at a game called ropeplaying or a carousal
otherwise a wife who kissed a man not her husband could be repudiated
throughout eastern asia it is unknown thus in japanese literature kisses
and embraces have no existence kisses and embraces are simply unknown
in japan as tokens of affection lafcadio hearn states if we except the
solitary fact that japanese mothers like mothers all over the world lip
and hug their little ones betimes after babyhood there is no more hugging
or kisses such actions except in the case of infants are held to be
immodest never do girls kiss one another never do parents kiss or
embrace their children who have become able to walk this holds true and
has always held true of all classes handclasping is also foreign to
them on meeting after a long absence hearn remarks they smile perhaps
cry a little they may even stroke each other but that is all japanese
affection is chiefly shown in acts of exquisite courtesy and
kindness203 among nearly all of the black races of africa lovers never
kiss nor do mothers usually kiss their babies204 among the american
indians the tactile kiss is for the most part unknown though here and
there as among the fuegians lovers rub their cheeks together205
kissing is unknown to the malays in north queensland however roth
states kissing takes place between mothers not fathers and infants
also between husbands and wives but whether it is an introduced custom
roth is unable to say he adds that the pittapitta language possesses a
word for kissing206
it must be remarked however that in many parts of the world where the
tactile kiss as we understand it is usually said to be unknown it still
exists as between a mother and her baby and this seems to support the
view advocated by lombroso that the lovers kiss is developed from the
maternal kiss thus the angoni zulus to the north of the zambesi wiese
states kiss their small children on both cheeks207 and among the
fuegians according to hyades mothers kiss their small children
even in europe the kiss in early medival days was it seems probable not
widely known as an expression of sexual love it would appear to have been
a refinement of love only practiced by the more cultivated classes in the
old ballad of glasgerion the lady suspected that her secret visitor was
only a churl and not the knight he pretended to be because when he came
in his masters place to spend the night with her he kissed her neither
coming nor going but simply got her with child it is only under a
comparatively high stage of civilization that the kiss has been emphasized
and developed in the art of love thus the arabic author of the perfumed
garden a work revealing the existence of a high degree of social
refinement insists on the great importance of the kiss especially if
applied to the inner part of the mouth and he quotes a proverb that a
moist kiss is better than a hasty coitus such kisses as well as on the
face generally and all over the body are frequently referred to by
hindu latin and more modern erotic writers as among the most efficacious
methods of arousing love208
a reason which may have stood in the way of the development of the kiss in
a sexual direction has probably been the fact that in the near east the
kiss was largely monopolized for sacred uses so that its erotic
potentialities were not easily perceived among the early arabians the
gods were worshiped by a kiss209 this was the usual way of greeting the
house gods on entering or leaving210 in rome the kiss was a sign of
reverence and respect far more than a method of sexual excitation211
among the early christians it had an all but sacramental significance it
retains its ancient and serious meaning in many usages of the western and
still more the eastern churches the relics of saints the foot of the
pope the hands of bishops are kissed just as the ancient greeks kissed
the images of the gods among ourselves we still have a legally recognized
example of the sacredness of the kiss in the form of taking an oath by
kissing the testament212
so far we have been concerned mainly with the tactile kiss which is
sometimes supposed to have arisen in remote times to the east of the
mediterraneanwhere the vassal kissed his suzerain and where the kiss of
love was known as we learn from the songs of songs to the hebrewsand
has now conquered nearly the whole of europe but over a much larger part
of the world and even in one corner of europe lapland as well as among
the russian yakuts a different kind of salutation rules the olfactory
kiss this varies in form in different regions and sometimes simulates a
tactile kiss but as it exists in a typical form in china where it has
been carefully studied by denjoy it may be said to be made up of three
phases 1 the nose is applied to the cheek of the beloved person 2
there is a long nasal inspiration accompanied by lowering of the eyelids
3 there is a slight smacking of the lips without the application of the
mouth to the embraced cheek the whole process denjoy considers is
founded on sexual desire and the desire for food smell being the sense
employed in both fields in the form described by denjoy we have the
mongolian variety of the olfactory kiss the chinese regard the european
kiss as odious suggesting voracious cannibals and yellow mothers in the
french colonies still frighten children by threatening to give them the
white mans kiss their own kiss the chinese regard as exclusively
voluptuous it is only befitting as between lovers and not only do
fathers refrain from kissing their children except when very young but
even the mothers only give their children a rare and furtive kiss among
some of the hilltribes of southeast india the olfactory kiss is found
the nose being applied to the cheek during salutation with a strong
inhalation instead of saying kiss me they here say smell me the
tamils i am told by a medical correspondent in ceylon do not kiss during
coitus but rub noses and also lick each others mouth and tongue the
olfactory kiss is known in africa thus on the gambia in inland africa
when a man salutes a woman he takes her hand and places it to his nose
twice smelling the back of it among the jekris of the niger coast mothers
rub their babies with their cheeks or mouths but they do not kiss them
nor do lovers kiss though they squeeze cuddle and embrace213 among
the swahilis a smell kiss exists and very young boys are taught to raise
their clothes before women visitors who thereupon playfully smell the
penis the child who does this is said to give tobacco214 kissing of
any kind appears to be unknown to the indians throughout a large part of
america im thurn states that it is unknown to the indians of guiana and
at the other end of south america hyades and deniker state that it is
unknown to the fuegians in forth america the olfactory kiss is known to
the eskimo and has been noted among some indian tribes as the blackfeet
it is also known in polynesia at samoa kissing was smelling215 in new
zealand also the hongi or nosepressing was the kiss of welcome of
mourning and of sympathy216 in the malay archipelago it is said the
same word is used for greeting and smelling among the dyaks of the
malay archipelago however vaughan stevens states that any form of
kissing is unknown217 in borneo breitenstein tells us kissing is a
kind of smelling the word for smelling being used but he never himself
saw a man kiss a woman it is always done in private218
the olfactory kiss is thus seen to have a much wider extension over the
world than the european or mediterranean tactile kiss in its most
complete development however it is mainly found among the people of
mongolian race or those yellow peoples more or less related to them
the literature of the kiss is extensive so far however as that
literature is known to me the following list includes everything that may
be profitably studied darwin the expression of the emotions ling

appendix b
histories of sexual development
the histories here recorded are similar in character to those given in
appendix b of the previous volume
    history icd clergyman age 34 height about 5 ft 8 in
    weight 8st 8lb complexion fair physical infirmities very
    myopic tendency to consumption
    my family is of old lineage on both sides my parents were
    normal and fairly healthy but i consider that heredity though
    not vitiated is somewhat overrefined and there is a neuropathic
    tendency which has appeared in myself and in one or two other
    members of the family as a child i suffered though not very
    frequently from nocturnal enuresis my sexual nature though
    normal has been keenly alive and sensitive as far back as i can
    remember and as i look back i discern within myself in early
    childhood what i now understand to be a decided masochistic or
    passively algolagnic tendency so far as i remember this
    manifested itself in me in two aspects one psychic or
    sentimental and free from carnality expressing itself in
    imaginative visions such as the following i used to imagine
    myself kneeling before a young and beautiful woman and being
    sentenced by her to some punishment and even threatened with
    death at other times i would picture myself as a wounded soldier
    watched over on his sickbed by queenly women these visions
    always included an imagination of something heroic in my own
    personality no doubt they were the same kind of dreamings as are
    present in multitudes of imaginative children they are only of
    interest in so far as a sexual element was present and that was
    algolagnic in character
    i had a small fund of natural common sense and my surroundings
    were not favorable to sentimental imaginings consequently i
    believe i began to throw them off at an early age though the
    temperament which produced them is still a part of my nature
    on the carnal side the sexual instinct was decidedly
    algolagnic masturbation is one of my earliest recollections
    indeed it was not at first so far as i remember associated
    with any sexual ideas at all but began as a reflex animal act i
    do not remember its first occurrence it soon however became
    associated in my mind with algolagnic excitement giving rise to
    reveries which took the ordinary form of imagining oneself
    stripped and whipped etc by persons of the opposite sex the
    dramatis person in my own algolagnic reveries were elderly
    women somewhat strangely i did not associate physical sexuality
    at this period with young and attractive women if scientific
    light on these matters were generally available in the practical
    bringing up of children persons in charge of young children
    might refrain from exciting an algolagnic tendency or doing
    anything calculated to awake sexual emotions prematurely in my
    own case i recollect acts performed by older persons in
    ignorance and thoughtlessness which undoubtedly tended to foster
    and strengthen my algolagnic instinct
    little or nothing was done to prevent discover or remedy the
    pernicious habit into which i was falling unknowingly
    circumcision was perhaps little thought of in those days as a
    preventive of juvenile masturbation at any rate it was not
    resorted to in my case i remember indeed that a nurse
    discovered that i was practicing masturbation and i think she
    made a few halfhearted attempts to stop it it was probably
    these attempts which gave me a growing feeling that there was
    something wrong about masturbation and that it must be practiced
    secretly but they were unsuccessful in their main object the
    practice continued
    i went to school at the age of 10 there i came in contact
    almost without warning with the ordinary lewdness and grossness
    of school conversation and took to it readily i soon became
    conversant with the theory of sexual relations but never got the
    opportunity of sexual intercourse and probably should have felt
    some moral restraint even had such opportunity presented itself
    for coitus however interesting it might be to talk about was a
    bigger thing to practice than masturbation i masturbated fairly
    frequently occasionally producing two orgasms in quick
    succession i seldom masturbated with the hand my method was to
    lie face downward there was probably little or no homosexuality
    at my first school i never heard of it till later and it was
    always repugnant to me though surrounded with a certain morbid
    interest masturbation was discountenanced openly at the school
    but was i believe extensively practiced both at that school
    and at the two others i afterward attended the boys often talked
    about the hygiene of it and the general theory was that it was
    somehow physically detrimental but i heard no arguments advanced
    sufficiently cogent to make me see the necessity for a real moral
    effort against the habit though as i neared puberty i was
    indulging more moderately and with greater misgivings
    the fact of becoming acquainted with the theory of sexual
    intercourse tended to diminish the algolagnia and to impel my
    sexual instinct into an ordinary channel on one occasion
    circumstances brought me into close contact with a woman for
    about three or four weeks i being a mere boy and she very much
    my senior i felt sexually attracted by this woman and allowed
    myself a degree of familiarity with her which i have since
    recognized as undue and have deeply regretted it did not
    however go to the length of seduction and i trust may have
    passed away without leaving any permanent harm it should
    indeed be remarked here that i never knew a woman sexually till
    my marriage and with the one exception mentioned i do not recall
    any instance of conduct on my part toward a woman which could be
    described as giving her an impulse downhill
    on the psychic side my sexual emotions awoke in early childhood
    and though my love affairs as a boy were not frequent and were
    kept to myself they attained a considerable degree of emotional
    power leaving out of account the precocious movements of the
    sexual instinct to which i have already referred as colored by
    psychic algolagnia i may say that somewhat later from the age
    of puberty and onward i had three or four love affairs devoid
    of any algolagnic tendency and considerably more developed on
    the psychic and emotional than on the physical side in fact
    my experience has been that when deeply in love when the mind is
    full of the love ecstasy the physical element of sexuality is
    keptdoubtless only temporarilyin abeyance
    to return now to the subject of masturbation here befell the
    chief moral struggle of my early life and no terms that i have
    at command will adequately describe the stress of it
    a casual remark heard one day as i was arriving at puberty
    convinced me that there must be truth in the vague schoolboy
    theory that masturbation was weakening it was to the effect
    that the evil results of masturbation practiced in boyhood would
    manifest themselves in later life i then realized that i must
    relinquish masturbation and i set myself to fight it but with
    grave misgivings that owing to the early age at which i had
    formed the habit i had already done myself serious harm
    before many weeks had passed i had formed a resolution to
    abstain which i kept thereafter withoutso far as i
    remembermore than one conscious lapse into my former habit
    here it must be said at once that so far as touches my own
    experience of a struggle of this kind the religious factor is of
    primary importance as strengthening and sustaining the moral
    effort which has to be made i am writing an account of my
    sexual not my spiritual experiences but i should not only be
    untrue to my convictions but unable to give an accurate and
    penetrating survey of the development of my sex life unless i
    were clearly to state that it was to a large extent on that life
    that my strongest and most valuable religious experiences
    arose219 it is to the endeavor to discipline the sexual
    instinct and to grapple with the difficulties and anxieties of
    the sex life that i owe what i possess of spiritual religion of
    the consciousness that my life has been brought into contact with
    divine love and power
    my early habits after they were broken off left me none the
    less a legacy of sexual neurasthenia and a slight varicocele my
    nocturnal pollutions were overfrequent and i brooded over them
    being too reticent and too much afraid of exposure at school and
    possible expulsion to confide in a doctor far better for me had
    i done so for a few years later i received the truest kindness
    and sympathy in regard to sexual matters at the hands of more
    than one medical man but while at school i was afraid to speak
    of the trouble which so unnerved and depressed me and as a
    consequence my morbid fears grew stronger being intensified by
    generalities which i met with from time to time in my reading on
    the subject of the punishment which nature metes out to impurity
    on leaving school my sex life continued for some years on the
    same lines a struggle for chastity morbid fears and regrets
    about the past efforts to cope with the neurasthenia and a
    haunting dread of coming insanity these troubles were increased
    by my sedentary life however i obtained medical aid and put as
    good a face on matters as possible
    but the most trying thing of all has yet to be mentionedthe
    discovery that i had not yet got fully clear of the habit of
    masturbation i had indeed repudiated it as far as my conscious
    waking moments were concerned even though strongly impelled by
    sexual desire but one night about a year after i had
    relinquished the practice i found myself again giving way to it
    in those moments between sleeping and waking when the will is
    only semiconscious it was as if a race took place for
    wakefulness between my physical instinct on the one side and my
    moral sense and inhibitory nerves on the other and very
    frequently the physical instinct won this perhaps is not an
    uncommon experience but it distressed me greatly and i never
    felt safe from it until marriage i resorted to various
    expedients to combat this tendency at length having to tie
    myself in a certain position every night with a cord round my
    legs so as to render it impossible to turn over upon my face
    in my early manhood the strain on my constitution was
    considerable from causes other than the sexual neurasthenia
    which indeed i am now well aware i exaggerated in importance
    medical advisers whom i consulted in that period assured me that
    this was so and though at the time i often thought that they
    were concealing the real facts from me out of kindness my own
    reading has since convinced me that they spoke nothing but
    scientific truth
    the years went on i went through a university course and in
    spite of my poor health took a good degree the agony of my
    struggle for chastity seemed to come to a climax about four years
    later when for a long period partly owing to overstudy and
    partly to the sexual strain i fell into a condition of severe
    nervous exhaustion one of the most distressing symptoms of which
    was insomnia the dreaded cloud of insanity seemed to come
    closer i had to use alcohol freely at nights and might by now
    have become a drunkard had i not been casuallyor i must say
    providentiallydirected to the common sense plan of measuring my
    whisky in a dram glass so that the alcohol could not steal a
    march upon me
    this period was one of acute mental suffering one cause of the
    nervous tension wasas i have now no doubtthe need of healthy
    sexual intercourse i proved this eventually my circumstances
    which had long been adverse to marriage at length were shaped in
    that direction i renewed acquaintance with a lady whom i had
    known well some years before and our friendship ripened until
    after much perplexity on my side owing to the uncertainty of my
    health and prospects i decided that it was right to speak we
    were married after a few months and i realized that i had gained
    an excellent wife we did not come together sexually for some
    nights after marriage but having once tasted the pleasure of
    the marriage bed i have to admit that partly owing to ignorance
    of the hygiene of marriage i was for some time rather
    unrestrained in conjugal relations requiring intercourse as
    often as eight or nine times a month this was not unnatural when
    one considers that i had now for the first time free access to a
    woman after a long and weary struggle to preserve chastity
    married life however tends naturallyor did so in my caseto
    regulate desire and when i began to understand the ethics and
    hygiene of sex as i did a year or two after marriage i was
    enabled to exercise increasing selfrestraint we are now sparing
    in our enjoyment of conjugal pleasure we have had no children
    and i attribute this chiefly to the remaining sexual weakness in
    myself220 but i may say that not only my sexual power but my
    nervepower and general health were greatly improved by
    marriage and though i have fallen back the last year or two
    into a poor state of health the cause of this is probably
    overwork rather than anything to do with sex not but what it
    must be said that had it not been for the juvenile masturbation
    superadded to a neuropathic temperament my constitution would no
    doubt have endured the general strain of life better than it has
    done the algolagnia being one of the congenital conditions of
    my sexual instinct must be considered fundamental and certainly
    has not been eliminated if i were to allow myself indulgence in
    algolagnic reveries they would even now excite me without
    difficulty but i have systematically discouraged them so that
    they give me little or no practical trouble my erotic dreams
    which years ago were to the best of my remembrance frequently
    algolagnic are now almost invariably normal
    my conjugal relations have always been on the lines of strictly
    normal sexuality i have a deep sense of the obligations of
    monogamous marriage besides a sincere affection for my wife
    consequently i repress as far as possible all sexual
    inclinations such as will come involuntarily sometimes toward
    other women
    from what i have disclosed it will be seen that i am but a
    frail man but for many years i have striven honestly and hard to
    discipline sexuality within myself and to regulate it according
    to right reason pure hygiene and the moral law and i can but
    hope and believe that the divine power in which i have endeavored
    to trust will in the future as it has done in the past working
    by natural methods and through the current events of my life
    amend and control my sex life and conduct it to safe and
    honorable issues
    history iiab married good general health dark hair fair
    complexion shortsighted and below medium height parents both
    belong to healthy families but the mother suffered from nerves
    during early years of married life and the father a very
    energetic and ambitious man was cold passionless and
    unscrupulous ab is the oldest child two of the brothers and
    sisters are slightly abnormal nervously but so far as is
    known none of the family has ever been sexually abnormal
    ab was a bright intelligent child though inclined to be
    melancholy and in later years prone to selfanalysis at
    preparatory school was fairly forward in studies at public
    school somewhat backward at university suddenly took a liking to
    intellectual pursuits throughout he was slack at games has
    never been able to learn to swim from nervousness can whistle
    well has always been fond of reading and would like to have
    been an author by profession he married at 24 and has had two
    children both of whom showed congenital physical abnormalities
    before the age of 7 or 8 ab can remember various trifling
    incidents one of the games i used to play with my sister he
    writes consisted in pretending we were father and mother and
    were relieving ourselves at the wc we would squat down in
    various parts of the room prolong the simulated act and talk i
    do not remember what our conversation was about nor whether i
    had an erection i used also to make water from a balcony into
    the garden and in other unusual places
    the first occasion on which i can recollect experiencing
    sensations or emotions similar in character to later and more
    developed feelings of desire was at the age of about 7 or 8 when
    i was a dayboy at a large school in a country town and absolutely
    innocent as to deed thought or knowledge i fell in love with a
    boy with whom i was brought in contact in my class about my own
    age i remember thinking him pretty he paid me no attention i
    had no distinct desire except a wish to be near him to touch
    him and to kiss him i blushed if i suddenly saw him and
    thought of him when absent and speculated on my chances of seeing
    him again i was put into a state of high ecstasy when he invited
    me to join him and some friends one summer evening in a game of
    rounders
    at the age of 8 i was told by my fathers groom where babies
    came from and how they were produced i already knew the
    difference in sexual organs as my sister and i were bathed in
    the same room he told me no details about erection semen etc
    nor did he take any liberties with me i used to notice him
    urinating he used to push back the foreskin and i thought his
    penis large
    when about 8 years old the nursemaid told me that the boy at her
    last place had intercourse with his sister i thought it
    disgusting about a year later i told the nurse i thought the
    story of adam and eve was not true and that when eve gave adam
    the apple he had intercourse with her and she was punished by
    having children i dont know if i had thought this out or if it
    had been suggested to me by others this nurse used often to talk
    about my tassel
    a family of several brothers went to the same school with me
    and we used to indulge in dirty stories chiefly however of the
    wc type rather than sexual
    when i was about 10 i learned much from my fathers coachman he
    used to talk about the girls he had had intercourse with and how
    he would have liked this with my nursemaid
    a year later i went to a large day school i think most of the
    boys if not nearly all were very ignorant and innocent in
    sexual matters the only incident in this connection i can
    recollect is asking a boy to let me see his penis he did so
    during the summer holidays at a watering place i attended a
    theatrical performance and fell in love with a girl of about 12
    who acted a part i bought a photograph of her which i kept and
    kissed for several years after about the same time i thought
    rather tenderly of a girl of my own age whose parents knew mine
    i remember feeling that i should like to kiss her once i
    furtively touched her hair
    when i was 12 i was sent to a small preparatory boarding
    school in the country during the holidays i used to talk about
    sexual things with my fathers footman he must have told me a
    good deal i used to have erections one evening when i was in
    bed and everyone else out my mother and the children in the
    country he came up to my room and tried to put his hand on my
    penis i had been thinking of sexual matters and had an erection
    i resisted but he persisted and when he succeeded in touching
    me i gave in he then proceeded to masturbate me i sank back
    overcome by the pleasant sensation he then stopped and i went on
    myself in the meantime he had taken out his penis and
    masturbated himself before me until the orgasm occurred i was
    disgusted at the sight of his large organ and the semen he then
    left me i could hardly sleep from excitement i felt i had been
    initiated into a great and delightful mystery
    i at once fell into the habit of masturbation it was some
    months before i could produce the orgasm at about 13 a slight
    froth came at about 14 a little semen i do not know how
    frequently i did itperhaps once or twice a week i used to feel
    ashamed of myself afterward i told the man i was doing it and he
    expressed surprise i had not known about it before he told me he
    warned me to stop doing it or it would injure my health i
    pretended later that i had stopped doing it
    i practiced solitary masturbation for some months at first the
    semen was small in amount and watery
    i had not at this time ever succeeded in drawing the foreskin
    below the corona after masturbation i would sometimes feel
    local pain in the penis sometimes pains in the testicles and
    generally a feeling of shame but not i think any lassitude
    the shame was a vague sense of discomfort at having done what i
    knew others would regard as dirty i also experienced fears that
    i was injuring my health
    it was not long before i found other boys at the preparatory
    school with whom i talked of sexual things and in some cases
    proceeded to acts the boys were between the ages of 9 and 14
    they left at 14 or 15 for the public schools we slept in
    bedroomsseveral in one room
    there was no general conversation on sexual matters few of the
    boys knew anything about thingsperhaps 7 or 8 out of 40 before
    describing my experiences at the school i may mention that i
    cannot remember having at this period any wish to experience
    heterosexual intercourse i knew as yet nothing of homosexual
    practices and i did not have except in one case any love or
    affection for any of the boys
    one night in my bedroomthere were about six of uswe were
    talking till rather late my recollection commences with being
    aware that all the boys were asleep except myself and one other
    p the son of a clergyman who was in a bed at exactly the
    opposite end of the room i suppose we must have been talking
    about this sort of thing for i vividly remember having an
    erection and suddenlyas if by premonitiongetting out of my
    bed and with heart beating going softly over to ps bed he
    exhibited no surprise at my presence a few whispered words took
    place i placed my hand on his penis and found he had an
    erection i started masturbating him but he said he had just
    finished i then suggested getting into bed with him i had
    never heard at that time of such a thing being done the idea
    arose spontaneously he said it was not safe and placed his
    hand on my penis i think with the object of satisfying and
    getting rid of me he masturbated me till the orgasm occurred
    i had no further relations with him except on one occasion
    shortly afterward when one day in the wc he asked me to
    masturbate him i did so he did not offer to do the same to me
    he was a delicate feeble boy not good at work womanish in his
    ways inclined to go in for petty bullying until a boy showed
    fight when he discovered himself to be an arrant coward four or
    five years later i met him at the university his greeting was
    cool my next affair was with a boy who was about my age 13
    strong fullblooded coarse always in hot water he was the
    son of the headmaster of one of the bestknown public schools it
    was reported that two brothers had been expelled from this public
    school for what we called beastliness he told me his older
    brother used to have intercrural intercourse with him this was
    the first i had heard of this we used to masturbate mutually i
    had however no affection or desire for him
    with e another boy i had no relations but i remember him as
    the first person of the same sex for whom i experienced love he
    was a small fair thin and little boy some two years younger
    than myself so my inferior in the social hierarchy of a school
    at the end of my last term i had two disappointments i was
    beaten by a younger and clever boy for the first place in the
    school and also beaten by one point in the competition for the
    athletic cup by a stronger boy who had only come to the school
    that very term however as a consolation prize and as i was
    leaving the headmaster gave me a second prize this soothed my
    hurt feelings and i remember just after the head had read out
    the prizes on the last day of term e coming up to me putting
    his arm on my shoulder looking at me rather pensively and in a
    voice that thrilled me and made me wish to kiss and hug him tell
    me he was so glad i had got a prize and that it was a shame that
    other chap had beaten me for the cup
    i was three years aged 12 to 15 at the preparatory school i
    started in the bottom form and ended second in the school my
    reports were generally good and i was keen to do well in work i
    was considerably influenced by the head he was a clergyman
    but a man of wide reading broad opinion great scholarship and
    great enthusiasm we became very friendly
    during the holidays i now first practiced intercrural
    intercourse with a younger brother i started touching his penis
    and causing erections when he was about 5 afterward i got him
    to masturbate me and i masturbated him i used to get him into
    bed with me on one occasion i spontaneously never having heard
    of such a thing made him take my penis in his mouth
    this went on for several years when i was about 16 and he about
    10 the old family nurse spoke to me about it she told me he had
    complained of my doing it i was in great fear that my parents
    might hear of it i went to him told him i was sorry but i had
    not understood he disliked it but that i would not do it again
    about a year later having persisted in this promise i made
    overtures to him but he refused i then commended his conduct
    and said i knew he was quite right and begged him to refuse
    again if i should ever suggest it i did not ever suggest it
    again for many years i bitterly reproached myself for having
    corrupted him however i do not think any harm has been done
    him but my selfreproaches have caused me to feel i owe some
    reparation to him i also have more affection for him than for my
    other brothers and sisters
    at the age of 15 i went to one of the large public schools i
    was fairly forward for my age and entered high but i made small
    progress i had bad reports i was slack in games and not
    popular among the boys in fact i stood still so that when i
    left i was backward in comparison with other boys of even less
    natural intelligence
    the teaching was certainly bad moreover i had not any friends
    and this made me very sensitive it was to a great extent my
    fault when i first went there i was taken up by a set above
    meboys who were senior to me in standing when they left i
    found myself alone
    my unpopularity was increased by my being considered to put on
    side also because i paid attention to my dress
    at the public school i had homosexual relations with various
    boys usually without any passion with one boy however i was
    deeply in love for over a year i thought of him dreamed of him
    would have been content only to kiss him but my courtship met
    with no success
    when carrying on with other boys the desire to reach the crisis
    was not always strong perhaps out of shyness or modesty
    occasionally i had intercrural connection which gave me the
    first intimation of what intercourse with a woman was like when
    i masturbated in solitude i used to continue till the orgasm
    my housemaster one day sent for me and said he had walked
    through my cubicle and noticed a stain on the sheet at this time
    i used to have nocturnal emissions i cannot remember whether on
    this occasion the stain was due to one or to masturbation but i
    imagined that one did not have wet dreams unless one
    masturbated so when he went on to say that this was a proof that
    i was immoral i acknowledged i masturbated he then told me i
    would injure my healthpossibly weaken my heart or send
    myself mad he said that he would ask me to promise never to do
    it again
    i promised i left humiliated and ashamed of myself also
    generally frightened he used to send for me every now and then
    and ask me if i had kept my promise for some months i did then
    i relapsed and told him when he asked me ultimately he ceased
    sending for meapparently convinced either that i was cured or
    that i was incorrigible
    a year or so afterward he discovered in my study for i was now
    in the upper school and had a study a french photograph that a
    boy had given me entitled qui est dans ma chambre it
    represented a man going by mistake into the wrong bedroom inside
    the room was a woman in nightdress in an attitude that
    suggested she had just been relieving herself my housemaster
    told me the picture was terribly indecent and that taken with
    what he knew of my habits it showed i was not a safe boy to be
    in the school he added that he did not wish to make trouble at
    home but that he advised me to get my parents to remove me at
    the end of that term instead of the following term when in the
    ordinary course of things i should have left
    i wrote to my people to say i was miserable at school and i was
    removed at the end of that term
    my first case of true heterosexual passion was with a girl
    called d whom i first knew when she was about 16 my family and
    hers were friendly my attraction to her soon became a matter of
    common knowledge and joking to members of my family she was a
    dark passionatelooking child with large eyes thatto
    meseemed full of an inner knowledge of sexual mysteries
    precocious vain jealous untruthfulthose were qualities in
    her that i myself soon recognized but the very fact that she was
    not conventionally goodygoody proved an attraction to me
    i never openly made love to her but i delighted to be near her
    our ages were sufficiently separated for this to be noticeable i
    dreamed of her and my highest ideal of blessedness was to kiss
    her and tell her i loved her i heard that she had been
    discovered talking indecently in a wc to some little boys sons
    of a friend of my familys the knowledge of this precocity on
    her part intensified my fascination for her
    when i left home to return to school i kissed herthe only
    time absence did nothing to diminish my affection i thought of
    her all day long at work or at play i wrote her a letternot
    openly passionate but my real feelings toward her must have been
    apparent i found out afterward that her mother opened the
    letter
    when i returned home for the holidays her mother asked me not
    to write her any letters and not to pay attentions to her as i
    might spoil her i promised i was of course greatly
    distressed
    d used to come to our house to see my younger sister she had
    clearly been warned by her mother not to allow me to speak to
    her i was too nervous to make any advances besides i had
    promised as i grew older my passion died out i have hardly
    ever seen her since she married some years ago i still retain
    sentimental feelings toward her
    i was now 18 i had stopped growing and was fairly broad and
    healthy intellectually i was rather precocious though not
    ambitious but i was no good at games had no tastes for physical
    exercises and no hobbies
    during the holidays in my last year at school i had gone to
    the royal aquarium with a school companion this was followed by
    one or two visits to the empire theatre it was then that i first
    discovered that sexual intercourse took place outside the limits
    of married life on one occasion my friend talked to one of the
    women who were walking about this same friend spoke to a
    prostitute at oxford at this time i went up to the university
    once or twice i met this girl she used to ask about my friend
    my feelings toward her were a combination of admiration for her
    physical beauty a sense of the mystery of her life and pity
    for her isolated position
    on the whole my first university term produced considerable
    improvement in me i began to be interested in my work and to
    read a fair amount of general literature i learned to bicycle
    and to row i also made one intimate friend
    in my first holiday i went to the empire and made the
    acquaintance of a girl there wh she attracted me by her quiet
    appearance i eventually made arrangements to pay her a visit my
    apprehensions consisted of 1 fear of catching venereal disease
    this i decided to safeguard by using a french letter 2 fear
    that she might have a bully
    the girl showed no sexual desire but at that time this did not
    attract my attention
    i got very much gone on her paid her several visits gave her
    some presents i could ill afford and felt very distressed when
    she informed me she was to be married and therefore could not see
    me any more
    my experiences with prostitutes cover a period of twelve years
    during three years of this period i was continually in their
    company i have had intercourse with some two dozen in some
    cases only once in others on numerous occasions they have
    usually been of the class that frequent piccadilly st james
    restaurant the continental hotel and the dancing clubs usual
    fee 2 for the night in one case 5
    1 not one of them as far as i knew was a drunkard
    2 as a rule they were not mercenary or dishonest
    3 in their language and general behavior they compared
    favorably with respectable women
    4 i never caught venereal disease
    5 i twice caught pediculi
    6 i did not find them as a rule very sensual or fond of
    indecent talk as a rule they objected to stripping naked they
    did not touch my organs they did not suggest masturbation
    sodomy or fellatio they seldom exhibited transports but the
    better among them seemed sentimental and affectionate
    7 their accounts of their first fall were nearly always the
    same they got to know a gentleman often by his addressing
    them in the street he took them about to dinners and theatres
    they were quite innocent and even ignorant on one occasion they
    drank too much and before they knew what was happening they were
    no longer virgins they do not however apparently round on the
    man or expose him or refuse to have anything more to do with him
    8 they statein common with the outwardly respectable women
    whom i have had a chance of catechisingthat before the first
    intercourse they did not feel any conscious desire for
    intercourse and hardly devoted any thought to it that it was
    very painful the first time and that some time elapsed before
    they commenced to derive pleasure from it or to experience the
    orgasm
    eb was the second woman i had intercourse with she was a
    prostitute but very young about 18 and had only been in london
    a few months i met her first in the st james restaurant i
    spoke a few words to her the next day i saw her in the
    burlington arcade i was not much attracted to her she was
    pretty in a coarse buxom style vulgar in manners voice and
    dress she asked me to go home with her i refused she pressed
    me i said i had no money she still urged me just to drive home
    with her and talk to her while she dressed for the evening i
    consented we drove to lodgings in albany street we went in she
    proceeded to kiss me i remained cold and told her again i had
    no money she then said that does not matter you remind me of
    a boy i love i want you to be my fancy boy i was flattered by
    this i saw a good deal of her she was sentimental i never gave
    her any money when i had some she refused to take it but
    allowed me to spend a little in buying her a present on the
    night before i left london she wept she wrote me illiterate but
    affectionate letters one day she wrote to me that she was to be
    kept by a man but that she had made it a condition with him that
    she should be allowed to have me i had never been in love with
    her because of her vulgarity i therefore took the earliest
    opportunity of letting matters cool by not writing often etc
    the next thing i remember was my fascination a few months later
    for sh
    she was not a regular prostitute she had taken a very minor
    part in light opera she was american by birth young slim and
    spoke like a lady her hair was dyed her breasts padded she
    acted sentiment but was less affectionate than eb i met her
    when she was out of a job i gave her 2 whenever i met her she
    was not mercenary she was sensual i became very much in love
    with her i discovered her however writing letters to a fellow
    whom i had met one day when i was walking with her he was only
    an acquaintance but the brother of my most intimate friend what
    i objected to was that in this letter to him she protested she
    did not care for me but could not afford to give me up she had
    to plead guilty but i was so fascinated by her i still kept in
    with her for a time until she was kept by a man and i had
    found other women to interest me
    owing to the strict regulations made by the university
    authorities prostitutes find it hard to make a living there and
    i never had anything to do with one my adventures were among the
    shopgirl class and were of a comparatively innocent nature one
    of them however ms a very undemonstrative shopgirl was the
    only girl not a prostitute with whom i had so far had
    intercourse
    about this time i made the acquaintance of three other
    prostitutes who however were nice gentle quiet girls
    neither vulgar nor mercenary a night passed with them always
    meant to me much more than mere intercourse they
    wereespecially two of themof a sentimental nature and would
    go to sleep in my arms there was on my part not any passion
    but a certain sympathy with them and pity and affection i
    remained faithful to the first jh until she was kept by a
    man and gave up her gentlemen friends then came dv she got in
    the family way and left london last mp she was not pretty
    but a good figure well dressed a bright conversationalist and
    an intelligent mind her regular price for the night was 5 but
    when she got to know one she would take one for less and take
    one on tick she was very sensual on one occasion between 11
    pm and about midday the following day i experienced the orgasm
    eleven or twelve times
    during term time i was often prevented from having women by want
    of money and absence from london i considered myself lucky if i
    could have a woman once or twice a month my allowance was not
    large enough to admit of such luxuries and i was only able to do
    what i did by being economical in my general expenditure and
    living and by running up bills for whatever i could get on
    credit i lived in the hopes of picking up amateurs who would
    give me what i wanted for the love of it and without payment my
    efforts were not very successful at present except in the case
    of ms i considered myself very lucky in having discovered her
    and i should have stuck to her for longer but for the rival
    attraction of another there was however no deep sentiment on
    either side
    but in order to preserve a continuity in my account of the
    women i have left out two cases of temporary reversion to
    homosexual practices during the periods when i could not get a
    woman i had recourse once more to masturbation at times i had
    wet dreams in which boys figured and my thoughts in waking
    hours sometimes reverted to memories of my school experiences i
    think however that i should have preferred a woman
    the homosexual reversions were as follows
    1 i had arranged to meet a shopgirl one evening outside the
    town she did not turn up the meeting place was a railway
    bridge waiting there too a few feet from me was a boy of about
    15 he was employed i afterward found by a gardener and was
    waiting to meet his brother who was engaged on the line i got
    into casual conversation with him and suddenly found myself
    wondering whether he ever masturbated with a feeling that i can
    only describe by calling it an intuition i moved nearer him and
    asked do you ever play with yourself he did not seem
    surprised at the abruptness of my question and answered yes i
    thereupon touched his penis and found he had an erection i
    suggested retiring to a bench that was near we sat down i
    masturbated him till he experienced the orgasm then
    intercrurally i gave him a shilling and said good night
    2 during my last summer at the university i took to gardening
    there was a small piece of garden behind the house in which i had
    lodgings my landlady suggested getting a cousin of hers
    employed by a nurseryman to supply me with plants etc he was a
    youth of about 16 or 17 tall dark not bad favored in looks i
    forget how many times i saw himnot many perhaps twice or
    thrice but one day when he came to see me in my room about
    something connected with the garden i gave him some old clothes
    of mine he was a great deal taller than myself and i suggested
    his trying on the trousers to see if they would fit i do not
    know whether i made this suggestion with any ulterior motive or
    whether i had ever before thought of him in connection with any
    sexual relations i only know that once more as if guided by
    instinct i felt he would not rebuff me although certainly no
    indecent talk had ever taken place between us i pretended to
    help him to pull up the trousers and let my hand touch his
    penis he did not resist and i felt his penis for a few seconds
    i then proposed he should come upstairs to my bedroom no one was
    in the house we went up he did not at first have an erection i
    asked why he said because you are strange to me he then felt
    my penis eventually we mutually masturbated one another i gave
    him half a crown
    some short time afterward he came again to the house on this
    occasion i attempted fellatio i dont think i had at that time
    ever heard of such a practice he said however he did not like
    it he masturbated intercrurally he said he had never done this
    before although he had had girls the other boy also told me he
    had had girls
    3 on another occasion i was out bicycling a boy of about 10
    years of age offered me a bunch of violets for a penny i told
    him i would give him a shilling to pick me a large bunch i am
    not sure if i had any ulterior motive he proceeded into a wood
    on the side of the road i dismounted from my machine and
    followed him he was a pretty dark boy he made water i went up
    to him and asked him to let me feel his penis he at once jumped
    away and ran off shrieking i was frightened mounted my
    bicycle and rode as fast as i could home
    there was no sentiment in the above cases it is also to be
    noted that in neither instance did i make any arrangements to see
    the person again as far as i can remember when once i was
    satisfied i felt disgust for my act in the case of women this
    was never so
    two of the women described in the foregoing pages stand out
    above the others perhaps i have not sufficiently shown that in
    the cases of wh and sh i felt a considerable degree of
    passion wh was the first woman with whom i had had
    intercourse this invested her in my heart with a peculiar
    sentiment in neither case can i be accused of fickleness
    indeed i may say that up to this time i had had no opportunity
    of being fickle i never saw enough or had enough of a woman to
    get a surfeit of her
    the case i now come to presents the features of the cases of
    wh and sh in a stronger form i was then 20 i have since
    then married i am a father my experiences have been many and
    varied but still i must confess that no other woman has ever
    stirred my emotions more thani doubt if as much asdc up to
    date if there has been any grand passion in my life it is my
    love for her dc when i got to know herby talking to her in
    the streetwas a girl of about 20 she was short and plump dark
    hair dark mischievous eyes a fair complexion small features
    quiet manners and a sensual ensemble i do not know what her
    father was he was dead her mother kept a university lodging
    house she spoke and behaved like a lady she dressed quietly
    was absolutely unmercenary her intelligenceie her
    intellectual calibrewas not great her masterpassion was one
    thing the first evening i walked out with her she put her hand
    down on my penis before i had even kissed her and proposed
    intercourse i was surprised almost embarrassed she herself led
    me to a wall and standing up made me do it
    next day we went away for the day together i may say she was
    always ready and never satisfied she was sensual rather than
    sentimental she was ready to shower her favors anywhere and to
    anyone my feelings toward her soon became affectionate and
    sentimental and then passionate i thought of nothing else all
    day long wrote her long letters daily simply lived to see her
    i found she was engaged to be married her fianc a
    schoolmaster himself used to have intercourse with her but he
    had taken a religious turn and thought it was wicked to do it
    until they married i had intercourse with her on every possible
    occasion in private rooms at hotels in railway carriages in a
    field against a wall andwhen the holidays cameshe stayed a
    night with me in london she had apparently no fear of getting in
    the family way and never used any precaution sensual as she
    was she did not show her feelings by outward demonstration
    on one occasion she proposed fellatio she said she had done
    it to her fianc and liked it this is the only case i have
    known of a woman wishing to do it for the love of it
    the emotional tension on my nervesthe continual jealousy i was
    in the knowledge that before long she would marry and we must
    parteventually caused me to get ill she never told me she
    loved me more than any other man yet owing to my importunity
    she saw much more of me than anyone else it came to the ears of
    her fianc that she was in my company a great deal there was a
    meeting of the three of usconvened at his wishat which she
    had formally before him to say goodbye to me yet we still
    continued to meet and to have intercourse
    then the date of her marriage drew near she wrote me saying that
    she could not see me any more i forced myself however on her
    and our relations still continued her elder sister interviewed
    me and said she would inform the authorities unless i gave her
    up a brother too came to see me and made a row
    i had what i seriously intended to be a last meeting with her
    but after that she came up to london to see me we went to a
    hotel together we arranged to see one another again but she did
    not write i had now left the university i heard she was
    married
    it was now four years since i had first had intercourse with a
    woman during this time i was almost continually under the
    influence either of a definite love affair or of a general
    lasciviousness and desire for intercourse with women my
    character and life were naturally affected by this my studies
    were interfered with i had become extravagant and had run into
    debt it is worthy of note that i had never up to this time
    considered the desirability of marriage this was perhaps chiefly
    because i had no means to marry but even in the midst of my
    affairs i always retained sufficient sense to criticise the moral
    and intellectual calibre of the women i loved and i held strong
    views on the advisability of mental and moral sympathies and
    congenital tastes existing between people who married in my
    amours i had hitherto found no intellectual equality or
    sympathies my passion for dc was prompted by 1 the bond that
    sexual intercourse with a woman has nearly always produced in my
    feelings 2 her physical beauty 3 that she was sensual 4
    that she was a lady 5 that she was young 6 that she was not
    mercenary it was kept alive by the obstacles in the way of my
    seeing her enough and by her engagement to another
    the dc affair left me worn out emotionally i reviewed my life
    of the last four years it seemed to show much more heartache
    anxiety and suffering than pleasure i concluded that this
    unsatisfactory result was inseparable from the pursuit of
    illegitimate amours i saw that my work had been interfered with
    and that i was in debt owing to the same cause yet i felt that
    i could never do without a woman in this quandary i found myself
    thinking that marriage was the only salvation for me then i
    should always have a woman by me i was sufficiently sensible to
    know that unless there were congenial tastes and sympathies a
    marriage could not turn out happily especially as my chief
    interests in life after woman were literature history and
    philosophy but i imagined that if i could find a girl who would
    satisfy the condition of being an intellectual companion to me
    all my troubles would be over my sexual desire would be
    satisfied and i could devote myself to work
    in this frame of mind i turned my thoughts more seriously in the
    direction of a girl whom i had known for some two years her age
    was nearly the same as mine my family and hers were acquainted
    with one another i had established a platonic friendship with
    her undoubtedly the prime attraction was that she was young and
    pretty but she was also a girl of considerable character
    without being as well educated as i was she was above the
    average girl in general intelligence she was fond of reading
    books formed our chief subject of conversation and common
    interest she was in fact a girl of more intelligence than i
    had yet encountered on her side as i afterward discovered the
    interest in me was less purely platonic our relations toward one
    another were absolutely correct yet we were intimate informal
    and talked on subjects that would be considered forbidden topics
    between two young persons by most people i felt she was a true
    friend she too confided to me her troubles
    we corresponded with one another frequently sometimes it
    occurred to me that it was rather strange she should be so keen
    to write to me to hear from me and to see me but i had never
    thought of her consciously except as a friend i never for a
    moment imagined she thought of me except as an interesting and
    intelligent friend nor did the idea of illicit love ever suggest
    itself to me she was one of those women whose face and
    expression put aside any such thought i was indeed inclined to
    regard her as a good influence on me but as passionless i
    confided to her the affair of dc which took place during our
    acquaintance she was distressed but sympathetic and not
    prudish i did not suspect the cause of her distress i thought
    it was owing to her disappointment in the ideals she had formed
    of me she invited me to join her and her family for a part of
    the summer i had now left the university having obtained my
    degree in low honors and i decided to join them at this stage
    there began to impress itself on my mind the possibility that she
    cared for me also the desirability if that were so of becoming
    engaged to her i found my feelings became warmer on several
    occasions we found ourselves alone then one day our talk
    became more personal more tender and i kissed her i do
    recollect distinctly the thought flashing through my mind as she
    allowed me to kiss her that she was not after all the
    passionless and straight girl i had thought but the idea must
    have been a very temporary one it did not return she declared
    her love for me and without any express proposal on my part we
    walked home that afternoon mutually taking it for granted that we
    were engaged i was happy and calmly happy proud and elated
    circumstances now made it necessary for me to make money for
    myself and i was forced to enter a profession for which i had
    never felt any attraction indeed i had never considered the
    possibility of it until i became engaged and saw i must support
    myself if i were ever to marry i worked hard and rapidly
    improved my position
    i think i am correct in stating that from the day i became
    engaged my sexual troubles seemed to have ceased my thoughts and
    passions were centred on one woman we wrote to one another
    twice every week and as far as i was concerned every thought and
    feeling i had i told her and the receipt of her letters was for
    me the event of my life for nearly three years my anxiety in
    connection with my work used up a great deal of my energy and
    although i looked forward to the time when i should have a woman
    at my side every night my sexual desires were in abeyance nor
    did i feel any desire or temptation for other women
    i masturbated but not frequently generally i did it to the
    accompaniment of images or scenes associated with my betrothed
    sometimes the act was purely autoerotic my leisure time was
    devoted to reading
    on only one occasion did i have intercourse with a woman during
    my engagement three years it was with a girl whose
    acquaintance i had made at the university and who asked me to
    come to see her
    i married at the age of 24 looking back on the early days of my
    married life it is now a matter of surprise to me that i was so
    far from exhibiting the transports of passion which since then
    have accompanied any intercourse with a new woman partly i was
    frightened of shocking her partly my three years of comparative
    abstinence had chastened me it was some weeks before i ever saw
    my wife entirely naked i never touched her parts with my hand
    for many months and after the first few weeks i did not have
    intercourse with her frequently
    perhaps this was to be expected the basis of my affection for
    her had always been a moral or mental one rather than physical
    although she was a handsome wellmade girl besides money and
    other worries kept my thoughts busy as well as struggles to make
    both ends meet
    indeed i may say my sexual nature seemed to be dying out when
    i had been married less than six months i discovered that sexual
    intercourse with my wife no longer meant what sexual intercourse
    used to meanno excitement or exaltation or ecstasy my wife
    perhaps contributed to this by her attitude she confessed
    afterward to me that for the first week or so she positively
    dreaded bedtime so physically painful was intercourse to her
    that it was many weeks if not months before she experienced the
    orgasm for the first year and more of marriage she could not
    endure touching my penis this at first disappointed me then
    annoyed and finally almost disgusted me
    later on she learned to experience the orgasm but she was very
    undemonstrative during the act and it was seldom that the orgasm
    occurred simultaneously she took a much longer time
    i ceased to think about sexual matters when i had been married
    about three years i was aware that in my case marriage meant
    the loss of all mad ecstasy in the act i knew that if i had no
    work to do and plenty of money and temptation came my way i
    should like to have another woman but there was no particular
    woman to enchain my fancy and i did not have time or money or
    inclination to hunt for one
    at times i masturbated sometimes i did this to the
    accompaniment of homosexual desires or memories of the past then
    i got my wife to masturbate me
    about four years after marriage i got a woman from piccadilly
    circus to do fellatio i had never had this done before she
    did not do it genuinely but used her fingers
    as stated above various anxieties the fact that i could always
    satisfy my physical desires all served to calm me i was also
    interested in my work and had become ambitious to improve my
    position and was very energetic
    on the whole notwithstanding money worries the first four or
    five years of my married life were the happiest in my life
    certainly i was very free from sexual desires and the general
    effect of marriage was to make me economical energetic
    ambitious and unselfish i was certainly overworked i seldom
    got to bed before 1 or 2 my meals were irregular and i became
    worried and nervous at the beginning of my fifth year of married
    life i got run down and had a severe illness and at one time my
    life was in danger but i had a fairly rapid convalescence
    my illness was critical in more senses than one my
    convalescence was accompanied by a remarkable recrudescence of my
    sexual feelings i will trace this in detail 1 as i got
    wellbut while still in bedi found myself experiencing almost
    continually violent erections these were at first of an
    autoerotic character and i masturbated myself thus gaining
    relief to my nerves 2 i also found my thoughts tending toward
    sexual images and i felt a desire toward my nurse i first
    became conscious of this when i noticed that i experienced an
    erection during the time that she was washing me i mentioned the
    matter to my doctor who told me not to worry and said the
    symptoms were usual in the circumstances 3 when i got up and
    about i found myself desiring very keenly to have intercourse
    with my wife i can almost say that i felt more sexually excited
    than i had done for four or five years as soon however as i
    had had intercourse with my wife a few times i felt my desire
    toward her cease 4 my thoughts now centered on having a woman
    to do fellatio and as soon as i was well enough to go out i
    got a prostitute to do this
    just before i was ill my wife had a child which was born with
    more than one abnormality no doubt the shock and worry caused by
    this got me into a low state and predisposed me to my illness
    but the consequences were farther reaching still the child
    underwent an operation and my wife had to take her away into the
    country for nearly six weeks so as to give her better air i was
    left alone in london for the first time since my marriage the
    worry in connection with the child and the heavy expense served
    to keep me nervously upset after i had apparently recovered
    physically from the illness once more i found myself thinking
    about women as an additional factor in the situation i became
    friendly with an old collegechum whom i had not seen much of for
    many years he lived the life of a fashionable young bachelor and
    was at the time keeping a woman the only common interest between
    us was women i found myself reverting to the old condition of
    rampant lust that had been such a curse to me in my university
    days some books he lent me had a decided effect they gave me
    erections and it was on top of the excitement thus engendered
    that one day i got a woman to do fellatio as already
    mentioned moreover since my illness i found all my previous
    energy and ambition had gone
    i have stated that i was in london alone with two servants the
    housemaid was a young girl nice looking with beautiful eyes and
    a sensual expression she had been with us for about a year i
    cannot remember when i first thought of her in a sexual way but
    one evening i suddenly felt a desire for her i talked to her i
    found my voice trembling i let my hand as if by accident touch
    hers she did not withdraw it and in a second i had kissed her
    she did not resist i took her on my knee and tried to take
    liberties which she resisted and i desisted
    next day i kissed her again and put my hand inside her breasts
    the same evening i took her to an exhibition on the way home in
    a hansom cab i made her masturbate me this was followed by a
    feeling of great relief elation and pride
    next morning when she came up to my bedroom to call me i
    kissed and embraced her she allowed me to take liberties and
    reassuring her by saying i would use a preventive i had
    intercourse with her she flinched somewhat she then told me she
    was at her period and that she had never had intercourse with a
    man before
    during the next few weeks i found her an adept pupil though
    always shy and undemonstrative i took her to a hotel and
    experienced the intensest pleasure i had ever had in undressing
    her i had lately heard about cunnilingus i now did it to her
    i soon found i experienced very great pleasure in this as did
    she i had attempted it with my wife but found it disgusted
    me i also had intercourse per anum this again was an act i
    had heard about but had never been able to regard as
    pleasurable but books i had been reading stated it was most
    pleasant both to man and woman she resisted at first finding
    it hurt her much it excited me greatly and when i had done it
    in this way several times she herself seemed to like it
    especially if i kept my hand on her clitoris at the same time
    my relations with the housemaid with whom i cannot pretend that
    i was in love were only put an end to by satiety and when i
    went away for my holidays i was utterly exhausted this was
    however only the first of a series of relationships at least
    one of which deeply stirred my emotional nature these
    experiences however it is unnecessary to detail there have
    also been occasional homosexual episodes
    i think i am now in a much healthier condition than i have been
    for some years i assume that it is not healthy for all ones
    thoughts to be always occupied on sexual subjects the
    conclusion i come to is that i can live a normal healthy life
    devoting my thoughts to my work and finding pleasure in
    friendship in my children in reading and in other sources of
    amusement as long as i can have occasional relations with a
    young girlie about once a week but if this outlet for my
    sexual emotions is stopped sexual thoughts obsess my brain i
    become both useless and miserable
    i have never regretted my marriage not only do i feel that life
    without a wife and home and children would be miserable but i
    entertain feelings of great affection toward my wife we are well
    suited to one another she is a woman of character and
    intelligence she looks after my home well is a sensible and
    devoted mother and understands me i have never met a woman i
    would have sooner married we have many tastes and likings in
    common andwhat is not possible with most womeni can as a
    rule speak to her about my feelings and find a listener who
    understands
    on the other hand all passion and sentiment have died out it
    seems to me that this is inevitable perhaps it is a good thing
    this should be so if men and women remained in the state of
    erotic excitement they are in when they marry the business and
    work of the world would go hang unfortunately in my case this
    very erotic excitement is the chief thing in life that appeals to
    me
    the factors that in my case have produced this death of passion
    and sentiment are as follows
    1 familiarity when one is continually in the company of a
    person all novelty dies out in the case of husband and wife the
    husband sees his wife every day at all times and seasons
    dressed undressed ill good tempered bad tempered he sees her
    wash and perform other functions he sees her naked whenever he
    likes he can have intercourse with her whenever he feels
    inclined how can love as i use the expressionie sexual
    passion continue
    2 satiety i am of a hot sensual disposition inclined to
    excess as far as my health and nerves are concerned the
    appetite gets jaded
    3 absence of strong sexual reciprocity on the part of my wife
    i have referred to this above she likes intercourse but she is
    never outwardly demonstrative she has naturally a chaste mind
    she never is guilty of those little indecencies which affect some
    men a great deal she does not like talking of these things and
    she tells me that if i died she would never want to have
    intercourse again with anyone at times especially recently she
    has even asked me to have intercourse with her or to masturbate
    her but it is seldom that the orgasm occurs contemporaneously
    in this respect she is different from other women i knew in whom
    the mere fact that the orgasm was occurring in me at once
    produced it in them at the same time i doubt whether even strong
    sexual reciprocity would have retained my passion for long
    4 during the early years of our married life money worries
    caused at times disagreements reproaches and quarrels passion
    and sentiment are fragile and cannot stand these things
    5 the fact that i had already had other women diminished the
    feeling of awe with which many regard the sexual act and the
    violation of sexual conventions
    6 loss of beauty loss of figure is i fear inseparable from
    childbearing especially if the woman works hard we have always
    had servants still my wife has always worked hard at sewing
    etc
    i have stated that i entertain feelings of respect and
    admiration for my wife but i almost loathe the idea of
    intercourse with her i would sooner masturbate and think of
    another woman than have intercourse with her it causes nausea in
    me to touch her private parts yet with other women it affords me
    mad pleasure to kiss them every part of their bodies but my
    wife still feels for me the love she had when we first married
    there lies the tragedy
the following narrative is a continuation of history xii in the previous
volume
    history iiii had become good looking for a time i knew what
    it was to have loving looks from every woman i met and being
    saner and healthier i would seem to be moving in a divine
    atmosphere of color and fragrance pearly teeth and bright eyes
    even the old women with daughters looked at me amiablymarried
    women with challenge and maidens with paradise in their eyes
    i was standing one morning at st peters corner with two young
    friends when a girl went by coming over from the roman catholic
    cathedral when she had passed she looked back with that
    imperious swing that is almost a command at me as my friends
    distinctly admitted they advised me to follow her i did so and
    she turned a pretty blushing face and pair of dark gray eyes
    with just the kind of eyebrows i liked brown very level rather
    thick but long her teeth and mouth were perfect and she spoke
    with a slight irish brogue she let me do all the talking while
    she took my measure god knows what she saw in me i spoke in an
    affected manner i remember imitating some swell character i had
    seen on the stage a night or two before but i was wise enough
    not to talk too much and to behave myself she promised to meet
    me again and made the appointment she was a schoolteacher and
    engaged to be married to some one else she meant to amuse
    herself her own way before she married the second night i met
    her she allowed me to kiss her as much as i liked and promised
    all her favors for the third night we took a long walk and in
    the dark she gave herself to me but i hurt her so much i had to
    stop two or three times she had had connection only once years
    before when at school herself she was inclined to be sensual
    but she was young fresh and pretty and her kisses turned my
    head i fell genuinely in love with her and told her so one
    night when she was particularly fascinating with the tears in my
    eyes and her face met mine with equal love the first night or
    two i had felt no pleasurewhether through years of selfabuse
    or not i do not knowbut this night my whole being was excited
    i met her once and sometimes twice a week and was always thinking
    of her my sister saw me looking lovesick one day and i heard
    her say hes in love which rather flattered me and i looked
    more lovesick and idiotic than ever it was all wrong and
    perverted she continued to meet her fianc and intended to
    marry him we both spoke of him as an adultress speaks of her
    husband that high level of tears and childlike joy in our youth
    and love was never reached again but i realized her sex her
    kisses her presenceafter all those years of horror if she had
    only knownmore even than the sexual act itself while she as
    time went on commenced to show a curiosity which i thought
    desecrating she liked to examineto let her hand stray were
    her words even her beauty seemed impaired some nights and i
    caught a gleam in her eye and a curve of her lip i thought
    vulgar but perhaps the next night i met her she would be as
    bright as ever
    i introduced her to my friends who knew our relations for i
    blabbed everything but she did not mind their knowing and if we
    met would give them all a kiss so that i felt i had been rather
    too profuse in my hospitality though i still would say have
    another one bert i dont mind but whatever ass i made of
    myself she forgave me anything and was fonder of me every time
    we met while i although i did not know it for a long time was
    less fond of her she knew how to revive my love however some
    nights she would not meet me and i would be like a madman other
    nights she would meet me but not let me raise her dress she
    would lie on me on a moonlit night and her young face in shadow
    like a sirens in its frame of hair merely to kiss me but what
    kisses slow cold kisses changing to clinging passionate ones
    she would leave my mouth to look around as if frightened and
    come back openmouthed with a sidecontact of lips that brought
    out unexpected felicities
    one night her fianc saw us together and followed me after i
    left her but on turning a corner i ran i ridiculed him to her
    and despised him i should have found it difficult to say why
    another night her brother attacked me and it would have gone
    hard with me but annie pulled me in and banged the door we were
    in a friends house but her father came around soon and laid a
    stick about her shoulders in my presence i tried to talk big
    and said something idiotic about being as good a man as her
    betrothed as though my intentions were honorable which for one
    brief moment made anne look at me paler faced and changed such
    a strange glance but he beat her home enjoying my rage and she
    went away crying in her hands i was allowed to go unmolested
    i soon received a letter from her asking me not to mind and
    making an appointment at which she turned up cheerful and
    unconcerned she went to confession and would meet me
    afterwards and her faith in that and the difference of our
    religions if i had any religion would make her seem strange and
    alien to me at times even banal at last our meetings became a
    mere habit of sensuality with all charm and suggestion of
    better things eliminated
    i went with my friend george who shared my room one afternoon
    and called at annies school she kept an infants school of her
    own she came to the door herself it was the first time i had
    seen her in daylight and i thought her cheekbones bigger she
    certainly was not so pretty as on the first evening i met her
    george had told me he would sleep away if i wanted the room and
    when next i met her she promised to come and sleep with me
    before i had always met her on the grass under trees she came
    and the sight of her young limbs and breasts revived something of
    my love for her my better love but she was insatiable and more
    sensual every day one day she came when i was not well and
    would not go away disappointed i had met a very pretty girl
    about this time and now resolved to give annie up which i did
    in the cruelest manner cutting her dead and refusing to answer
    her letters and touching messages i heard that she would cry for
    hours but i was harder than adamant
    i thought myself very much in love with the very pretty girl for
    whom i had thrown up annie she lived with her mother and two
    sisters one older than herself the other a mere child the
    eldest sister a handsome dark girl like a spaniard was not
    virtuous she was good natured too much so and took her
    pleasure with several of us dying not long after of
    consumption i thought her sister my girl was virtuous and i
    meant to marry hersome day at any rate i saw her mother who
    lived in a wellfurnished house and was a superior woman this
    did not prevent my trying to seduce her daughter i did not
    succeed for a long time though she did not cease meeting me the
    sisters came to see us i knew one night her sister was
    upstairs with d and i guessed what they were at so i suggested
    to her she should creep up on them for fun she did so came
    back excited and paleand gave herself to me but she was not a
    virgin and in time i had a glimpse of her unhappy fate and her
    mothers position her father was dead or divorced and her
    mother i believe was mistress to some wealthy bookmaker i am
    not sure there was always a mystery hanging over the mother nor
    am i certain that she connived at her daughters seduction but
    the girls account was that after some successful cup day there
    had been too much champagne drunk all around and that a man she
    looked on as a friend came into her bedroom that night when she
    was tte monte and seduced or violated herwhichever word you
    like to choose since then his visits had been frequent until she
    met me she said and if i would be true to her she would be a
    true wife to me and i believed her and still believe she meant
    what she said but i left melbourne shortly after this our
    letters got few and far between and ultimately i heard she was
    married to a young man who had always been in love with her
    among the inmates of the boarding house was a married couple
    who stayed for some time he was an insignificant ugly little
    crosseyed commercial traveler she was a pretty little creature
    who looked as innocent and was as merry as a child we all vied
    in paying her attentions and waiting on her like slaves the
    husband always smiling a cryptic smile after they had left it
    was hinted they were not married at all the oldest hands had
    been taken in one afternoon i met dolly the commercial
    travelers wife and she stopped and spoke to me i remembered
    what i had heard and ventured on some pleasantry at which she
    laughed and on my proposing that we should go for a walk she
    consented she had left the commercial traveler it came out in
    conversation and we went on talking and walking one idea only
    in my mind now could i detain her till dark dolly who was very
    pretty indeed amused herself with me for hours playing hot and
    cold snubbing me one minute encouraging me with her eyed
    another hour after hour went and she found this game so
    entertaining that she accompanied me to the park behind the
    botanical gardens and it was not until it was too late for me to
    catch a train home that she gave herself to me in fact we
    stayed out the whole of that warm summer night as the hours went
    by she told me of her home in london and how she first went
    wrong she had been a good girl till one day on an excursion she
    drank some rum or gin which seemingly revived some dormant taint
    of heritage when she went home that night she fell flat at her
    mothers feet her parents welltodo shopkeepers who had
    forgiven her several times before turned her out she became one
    mans mistress and then anothers she began early and was
    scarcely 19 now she would leave off the drink for a time and try
    to be respectable she loved her father and mother but she could
    not help drinking at times she spoke cheerfully and laughingly
    about it all she was young strong good natured and careless
    we went to sleep for a little while and then wandered in the
    early morning down toward the cemetery when she tried to tidy
    her hair asking me how i had enjoyed myself and not waiting for
    an answer she was thirsty she said and when the public houses
    opened we went and had a drink it was the first time i had seen
    her drink alcoholat the boarding house she had always been the
    picture of health and sweetnessand i saw a change come over
    her at once so that i understood all that she had told me the
    sleepless night may have made it worse but the look that came
    into her eyes and the looseness of the fibres not only of her
    telltale wet mouth but of every muscle of her face was
    startling and piteous to see she saw my look and laughed but
    her laugh was equally piteous to hear and when she spoke again
    her voice had changed too and was equally piteous she asked for
    another no dont i begged for the pretty girl i had
    flattered myself i had passed a summers night with that most
    young men would envy showed signs of changing like some siren
    into a flabby bleareyed boozer that hurt my vanity
    i met her another night and she took me to her lodgings and i
    slept with her all night i no longer tried to stop her drinking
    but drank with her i ceased to treat her with courtesy and
    gallantry she noticed it but only drank the more drank till
    she became dirty in her ways till her good looks vanished i
    left her too drunk to stand as some friend a woman called on
    her
    she came to see me once more like her old self so well dressed
    and well behaved and chatted so cheerfully to my landlady that
    the latter afterward congratulated me on having such a friend
    dolly carried a parcel of underclothing she had made with a few
    toys for the children of a poor man in the suburbs and i
    accompanied her to the house there was great excitement among
    the ragged children in fact the atmosphere became so
    dangerously full of love and charity that i commenced to feel
    uncomfortablethe shower of roses againand was glad to find
    myself in the open air we went for a walk and had several
    drinks which made the usual change in dolly i got tired of her
    determined i would leave her spoke cruelly and finallyafter
    having connection with her on the dry seaweedrose and left her
    brutally walked away faster and faster deaf to her
    remonstrances and careless whether or how she reached the
    station
    i had gone to lodge with a family whom i had been accustomed to
    visit as a friend there were two daughters the elder engaged
    to a young german who was away with a survey party had a rather
    plain face but a strong one and was herself a strong character
    and i came to like her in spite of myself the second girl had
    light golden hair a fresh complexion a short nose and rather
    large mouth which contained beautiful teeth they were both
    good obedient innocent churchgoing daughters as there was
    plenty of amusement there of an evening singing and dancing i
    did not go out got into better ways and gradually gave up
    drinking to excess i was so improved in appearance that an old
    acquaintance did not recognize me my anecdotes and fun amused
    mrs s the mother of the girls she could be very violent on
    occasions i found and i learned that there had been terrible
    scenes at times and that from time to time it had been necessary
    to place her in an asylum i went for drives with the girls and
    to theatres and ought to have been happy and glad to find myself
    in such good quarters the mother trusted me so entirely that she
    left me for hours with the girls the younger one of whom i would
    kiss sometimes she was engaged to a young fellow whom i spoke to
    patronizingly but whose shoes i was not worthy to fasten i was
    the cause of quarrels between them they made it up again but i
    think he noticed the change that was taking place in alice for
    from kissing her i had gone onall larking at first we formed
    the habit of sitting down on the sofa when alone and kissing
    steadily for ten minutes or more at a time she was excited
    without knowing what was the matter with herbut i knew and one
    day when our mouths were together i drew her to me and commenced
    to stroke her legs gently down she trembled like a string bow
    and allowed my hand to go farther and then she was frightened
    and ashamed and commenced to laugh and cry together she had
    these hysterical attacks several times and they always frightened
    me it ended in my seducing her she broke off her engagement
    and then was sorry but soon she thought only of me one day
    alice and i were nearly caught i had just left her on the sofa
    and had commenced drawing at a table with my back to her when
    suddenly her mother came in without her shoes while alice had
    one hand up her clothes arranging her underclothing the mother
    stopped dead and shot me one glance i shall never forget why
    alice you frighten me she said i feigned surprise and asked
    what is the matter alice although she was frightened out of
    her wits managed to stammer he couldnt see meyou couldnt
    see me could you appealing to me but i had managed to collect
    my senses a bit and although still under that maternal eye i
    askedat last turning slowly around to alice see what do you
    mean see what and i looked so mystified that the mother was
    deceived and contented herself with scolding alice and telling
    her to run no risks of that sort i breathed again
    but i was near the end of my tether alice and i talked about
    everything now she told me about her life at boarding school and
    the strange ideas some of the girls had about men and marriage
    after leaving school she had been sent to a large millinery or
    drapery establishment to learn sewing and dressmaking here she
    said the talk was awful at times and one girl had a book with
    pictures of mens organs of generation which was passed around
    and excited their curiosity to the highest pitch
    i had days of tenderness and contrition and even told her i
    would get on and marry her then the tears would come into her
    eyes and she would say i seem to feel as if you were my husband
    now 
    i had to see a man on business and went to his cottage the door
    was opened by his wife a handsome darkeyed young woman who
    looked as if butter would not melt in her mouth after leaving a
    message i went on talking to her on other subjects she piqued my
    vanity in some way and made me feel curious and restless i
    found myself thinking of her after i left and looking back i saw
    she was still looking at me
    to make a long story short she encouraged me it ended by my
    leaving the s family and going to board with them td the
    husband was glad of my company and my money they had a little
    boywhose father t was not i soon understood her inviting
    looks at me for she was a general lover and an old man in a
    good government billet visited her often when td was away i
    will call him silenus there was also a dark handsome man who
    built organs the latter came one day and sent for some beer i
    was working in my room and it so happened that before he knocked
    she had been going further than usual in her talk with me in
    fact as good as giving me the word when her friend was admitted
    he had to pass my open door and he gave me a look with his black
    eyes and i gave him a look which told each what the others game
    was it is wonderful what a lot can be learned from a single
    glance of the eyes when i saw the little boy bringing in the
    beer i felt that he had bested me but she brought me in a glass
    first and putting her down on the sofa i scored first it was
    done so suddenly so brutally that accustomed as she must have
    been to such scenes she turned red and bit her under lip but she
    sent the other man away in a few minutes after that she was
    insatiable it was every day and sometimes twice in one day i
    commenced to be gloomy and miserable again and there was not
    even a pretense of love there was no deception about her she
    even introduced me to silenus and we made excursions together
    for which he paid as he had plenty of money we were always
    drinking until at last i could eat nothing unless i had two or
    three whiskies i became very thin my horizon seemed black and
    all things at an end but td enjoyed his meals and was really
    fond of his wife and her boy and his work life was pleasant to
    him she would go up to town with me and to a certain hotel
    after drinking she would leave me waiting while she retired with
    the handsome young landlord for a short time she told me when
    she came back that he was a great favorite with married women
    she told me that silenus visited a woman who practiced
    fellatio on him mrs d thought such practices abominable and
    could not imagine how a woman could like doing such a thing
    when she was out walking with me one day tds name came up and
    she said in a slightly altered voice he told me he loved me
    it was a word seldom used by her except in jest i threw a
    startled look at her and caught an inquisitive and apologetic
    look in return such a strange and touching glance that i saw i
    had not yet understood herthere was an enigma somewhere when
    bit by bit she told me her life i understood or thought i
    understood that strange childlike glance in this young woman
    steeped to her eyes in sin no one had ever made love to her or
    spoken to her of love in her life
    it had commenced at school she must have been a particularly
    fine and handsome girl judging from her photographs she had
    seen boys playing with girls privates under the form and felt
    jealous that they did not play with hers she had no mother to
    look after her and she soon found plenty of boys to play with
    her and young men too as she grew older she took it as she
    took her meals she had been really fond of her childs father
    but as he had shown no tenderness for her nothing but a craving
    for sensual gratification she would rather have died than let
    him know she soon tired of her attachments she told me she did
    not like td he was not the complacent husband he was spirited
    enough but he believed everything she told him one day he came
    home unexpectedly when we were together on the bare palliass in
    her room it was a critical moment when his knocks were heard
    and in the hurry and excitement some moisture was left on the
    bed the knocks became louder but she was calmer than i and
    bade me run down to the closet i could hear her cheerful and
    chaffing voice greeting him when i walked in back to my own room
    she called out heres t home i learned afterward that he had
    been surly and suspicious and had seen the moisture on the bed
    and asked about it whereupon she had turned the tables upon him
    completely he ought to be ashamed of himself she knew what he
    meant by his insinuations if he must know how that moisture come
    on the bed why she put the soap there in a hurry to catch a
    flea he believed her and brought her a present next day in
    atonement for his suspicions
    during her monthly periods when i could not touch her she
    would come in and play with me until emissions occurred and my
    feelings had become so perverted that i even preferred this to
    coitus the orgasm would occur twice in her to once in me and
    though her eyes were rather hard and her mouth too she always
    looked well and cheerful while i was gloomy and depressed in
    her side however was a hard lump which pained her at times
    and which doubtless was waiting its time
    one day i felt so low in health that i proposed to td that we
    should take a boat and sail out in the bay for a day or two the
    sea the change the open air revived me and i even made
    sketches of the black sailor as he steered the boat one day when
    i was left alone in charge of the boat as i felt the time
    hanging on my hands for the sea the blue sky the lovely day
    gave me no real pleasure i remember abusing myself the old
    habit reasserting itself as soon as i was alone and idle when
    td came back he brought mrs d with him laughing and jolly as
    usual she was surprised when lying next to me under the deck on
    our return i did not respond to her advances it would have
    pleased her with her husband only a few feet away after that i
    spent a night with her but she was getting tired of me i did
    not care for her but it hurt my vanity and i made a few attempts
    to be impertinent she looked at me coldly and threatened to
    complain to t
    i want to relate an impression i received one night about this
    time when with several friends we called at a brothel i forget
    my companion but i remember two faces it was winter and great
    depression prevailed in adelaide we had been talking to the
    mistress as we drank some beer and were pretending to be jolly
    fellows although we were wet cold and had not enjoyed
    ourselves at least i had not and she was speaking harshly and
    jeeringly about two girls she had now who had not earned a penny
    for the past week just then we heard footsteps and she said in a
    lower tone here they are they came in unattended having
    ascertained which the brothelkeeper snorted and turned her back
    to them the faces of the girls who were quite young looked so
    miserable that even i pitied them the look on the face of one of
    those girls as she stood by the hearth drawing off her gloves
    lives in my memory too deep for tears was its sorrow shame and
    hopelessness
    i had given up drink and was living in the bush to anyone with
    normal nerves it would have been a happy time of quiet rustic
    peace beauty and relief from city life with me it was restless
    vanity amounting to madness in every relation action or
    possible event in which i figured or might figure in the future
    i always instantaneously called up an imaginary audience and
    then this imaginary audience admired everything i did or might
    do and put the most heroic gallant and romantic construction
    on my acts appearance lineage and breeding suppose i saw a
    pretty girl on a bush road instead of thinking there is a
    pretty girl i should like to know her or kiss her as i suppose
    a healthy normal young man would think i thought after this
    fashion there is a pretty girl now as i pass her she will
    think i am a handsome and aristocraticlooking stranger and as
    i carry a sketchbook an artista landscape painter how
    romantic she will say and then she will fall in love with me
    etc this preoccupation with what other people might think or
    would think so engrossed all my time that i had no means of
    enjoying the presence thought or favor of the divine creatures
    i met and i must have appeared cracked to them with my
    reticence pride and silly airs
    i met girls as foolish as myself sometimes once at a table
    dhte i met a young girl who went for a walk with me and let me
    know her carnally although she was little more than a schoolgirl
    she was going down to town soon she said and would meet me at a
    certain hotel belonging to relations of hers in adelaide on a
    certain date some time ahead if i took a room there she would
    come into it during the night in the meanwhile i had given way
    to drink again and abused myself at intervals i came down to
    town drunk in the coach and kept my appointment with the young
    girl at the hotel expecting a night of pleasure but she merely
    stared at me coldly as if she had never seen me before i abused
    myself twice in my solitary room
    i met a middleaged schoolteacher who had once been an officer
    in the army down for his holidays as he spoke well and was a
    gentleman i cultivated him one night he asked me to meet a
    girl he had an appointment with and tell her he was not well
    enough to meet her he foolishly told me the purpose of their
    intended meeting i went to the trystingplace at the back of
    the hotel and met the girl on delivering my message she smiled
    made some joke about her friend and looked at me as much as to
    say you will do as well i had been drinking and in the most
    brutal manner i took her into a closet by some strange chance or
    state of nerves she gave me exquisite pleasure but the orgasm
    came with me before it did with her and in spite of her
    disappointment and protests i stood up and pulled her out of the
    place for fear some one should find us there still protesting
    she followed me but her foot slipped on the paved court and she
    fell down on her face when she rose i saw that her front teeth
    were broken i looked at her without pity with impatience and
    abruptly leaving her i went into the hotel to the colonel i
    commenced to tell him lies when he asked me with a weak laugh
    what had been keeping me i smiled with low cunning and drunken
    vanity evading the question then he accused me directly i only
    laughed but drunk as i was i remember the look of the ageing
    bachelor as he saw he had been betrayed by a younger man he had
    known her for years
    i was now living in the home of a woman who was separated from
    her husband and kept lodgers she had a daughter with whom i
    walked out a pretty girl who drank like a fish as her mother
    also did there were other lodgers coming and going i would lie
    down all day and keep myself saturated with beer i commenced to
    get fat and bloated with the ways of a brothel bully a
    brokendown drunken old woman who visited the house and had been
    a beautiful lady in her youth told me i should end my days on the
    gallows trap the same woman when drunk would lift up her dress
    sardonically exposing herself other old women would congregate
    in the neglected and dirty bedrooms and tell fortunes with the
    cards one little woman an onanist was like a character out of
    dickens exaggerated affected unnatural with remains of
    gentility and society manners amidst all this drunkenness and
    abandonment may the landladys daughter preserved her
    virginity young lodgers would take liberties with her but at a
    certain stage would receive a stinger on the face the girl liked
    me and would kiss me but nothing else and thenout of this
    home of drunkenness and shamemay fell in love with some pretty
    boy she met by chance whom she never asked to her home she
    began to neglect me even to neglect drink and to dream
    preoccupied i felt a restless jealousy but she would look at
    me without resentment without recognition without seeing me
    look me straight in the eyes as i was talking to her and dream
    and dream this same pretty boy seduced her i believe when next
    i met her she was on the town her one dream of spring over
    about this time i had one of those salutary turns that have
    marked epochs in my life and as a result i left that house and
    resolutely abstained from drink i was now in a small
    upcountry town i commenced to play croquet and to ride out
    sometimes i was invited to dinner by a young man at the bank
    whose house was kept by his sister she had a small figure a
    pretty but rather narrow face and wellbred manners but there
    was a look in her asymmetrical eyes in the shape of her thin
    hands even in the stoop of her shoulders that seemed
    passionate one daywhen her brother a fine sweetblooded
    manly young athlete was absenti commenced to pull her about
    she gave me one passionate kiss but said no do you know what
    keeps me straight it is the thought of my brother i refrained
    from molesting her further i met other girls some pretty and
    arrogant others plain and hungryeyed it was a country town
    where there were four or five females to every male but i could
    not speak frankly and candidly to a young woman as the young
    banker did
    i remember that one night when i was living at the port i
    slept all night with a prostitute who had taken a fancy to me and
    who used to cry on my shoulder much to my impatience and
    annoyance in the same bed with us lying beside me was a girl
    aged about 12 on my expressing surprise i was told she was used
    to it and noticed nothing but in the morning i turned my head
    and looked at her and even in the dim light of that dirty
    bedroom i could see that her eyes had noticed and understood she
    pressed herself against me and smiled it was not the smile of an
    infant i could record many instances i have observed of the
    precocity of children
    at one time i made the acquaintance of three young men two in
    the customs the other in a surveyors office at the first
    glance you would have said they were ordinary nice young clerks
    but on becoming better acquainted you would notice certain
    peculiarities a looseness of mouth a restless nervous
    inquietude of manner an indescribable gleam of the eye they
    were very fond of performing and singing at amateur minstrel
    shows and developed a certain comic vein they thought original
    though it reminded me of professional cornermen however i
    enjoyed their singing and drinking habits and went to their
    lodgings several nights to play cards drink beer and tell funny
    stories one night they asked me to stay all night and on going
    to a room with two beds i was told to have one presently one of
    the young men came in and commenced to undress but before going
    to his bed he made a remark which though i had been drinking
    opened my eyes i told him to shut up and go to bed speaking
    firmly and rather coldly and he went reluctantly to his own bed
    but another night when they had shifted their lodgings and were
    all sleeping in the same room i was drunk and went to bed with
    the same fairhaired young man on waking up in the night i found
    my bedmate tampering with me the old force came over me and i
    abused him but refused to commit the crime he wanted me to his
    penis was small and pointed i rose early in the morning
    sobered suffering and covered with shame and went hastily
    away refusing to stay for breakfast i thought i caught an
    amazed and evil smile on the faces of the other two meeting the
    three the same evening in the street i passed them blushing and
    my bedmate of the previous night blushed also
    i now took cheap lodgings in north adelaide here i had slight
    recurrences of the strangeness and fear of going mad which i had
    experienced once before i led such a solitary life and fell into
    such a queer state that i turned to religion and attended church
    regularly it was approaching the time for those young men and
    women who wished to be confirmed to prepare themselves and a
    struggle now ensued between my pride and my wish to gain rest and
    peace of mind in jesus i was selfconscious to an incredible
    degree and dreaded exposure or making an exhibition of myself
    but still went to church hoping the grace of god would descend
    on me i had no other resources i had no pleasure in life and
    was so shattered and in such misery of dread that i welcomed the
    only refuge that seemed open to me at last one sunday i had
    what i thought was a call i shed a few tears and although
    tingling all down my spine i went up in the cathedral and joined
    those who were going to be confirmed i attended special meetings
    and shocked the good bishop very much by telling him i had never
    been baptized i had to be baptized first and went one day to the
    cathedral and he baptized me when the critical awful moment came
    the bishop whose faith even then surprised me somehow held my
    hand in his cold palm and gave it a pressure eyeing me
    expectantly inquisitively to see any change for the better
    but it so happened that morning i was in a horrible temper and
    black mood hard and dryeyed and no change came still i tried
    to believe there was a change
    i was confirmed with others had a prayerbook given me with
    prayers for nearly every hour in the day and was always kneeling
    and praying i procured a long white surplice and assisted at
    suburban services even conducting small ones myself reading the
    sermons out of books but my mood of rage increased and one
    sunday i had to walk a long way in a new pair of boots i shall
    never forget that hot sunday afternoon my feet commenced to ache
    and a murderous humor seized me i swore and blasphemed one
    moment and prayed to god to forgive me the next when i reached
    the chapel where i had to assist the chaplain i was exhausted
    with rage pain fear and religious mania i thought it probable
    i had offended the holy ghost when next sunday i went to try
    my hand at sundayschool teaching i wore a pair of boots so old
    that the little boys laughed i was always talking of my
    conversion and the spirit of our saviour i do not know what the
    clergymen i met thought of me i thought i should like to be a
    minister myself and questioned a church of england parson as to
    the amount of study necessary he received my question rather
    coldly i thought which discouraged me as my dread gradually
    diminished though i still felt strange i made excuses for not
    conducting services although i continued to read my bible and
    prayerbook and really believed i had been born again
    surely now i thought that i had christs aid i shall be able
    to break off my habit of selfabuse that had been the curse of my
    youth what was my horror and dismay to find that when the mood
    came on me next i went down the same as ever and after all my
    suffering and dread and fear of fits what could i do was i mad
    or what i was really frightened at my helplessness in the matter
    and decided on a course of conduct that ultimately brought me
    past this danger to better health and comparative happiness i
    said to myself that there is always a certain amount of
    preliminary thought and dalliance before i do this deed
    doubtless this it is that renders me incapable of resisting i
    decided therefore never to let my thoughts commence to dwell
    on lustful things but to think of something else on the first
    intimation of their appearance in my mind i rigorously followed
    this rule and it proved successful and i recommend it to others
    in the same predicament as myself after suffering weeks and
    months of dread and illness once more falling away in flesh and
    turning yellow i gradually mended a little i had a better color
    and tone and was something like other young men barring a
    strange alternate exaltation and depression even this gradually
    became less noticeable and my moods more even and reliable

219 my christian faith is of a somewhat nonemotional intellectual type
with a considerable element of agnostic reserve
220 on having connection with my wife i frequently exhibit sufficient
sexual power to produce orgasm in her but on occasion especially during
the first year or so of married life i have been unable to do this owing
to the too rapid action of the reflexes in myself and have even now and
again had emissions ante portam
