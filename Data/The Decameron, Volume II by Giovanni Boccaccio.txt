titus gisippus and sophronia tenth day eighth story

endeth here the fourth day of the decameron beginneth the fifth in
which under the rule of fiammetta discourse is had of good fortune
befalling lovers after divers direful or disastrous adventures

all the east was white nor any part of our hemisphere unillumined by the
rising beams when the carolling of the birds that in gay chorus saluted
the dawn among the boughs induced fiammetta to rise and rouse the other
ladies and the three gallants with whom adown the hill and about the
dewy meads of the broad champaign she sauntered talking gaily of divers
matters until the sun had attained some height then feeling his rays
grow somewhat scorching they retraced their steps and returned to the
villa where having repaired their slight fatigue with excellent wines
and comfits they took their pastime in the pleasant garden until the
breakfast hour when all things being made ready by the discreet
seneschal they after singing a stampita1 and a balladette or two
gaily at the queens behest sat them down to eat meetly ordered and
gladsome was the meal which done heedful of their rule of dancing they
trod a few short measures with accompaniment of music and song
thereupon being all dismissed by the queen until after the siesta some
hied them to rest while others tarried taking their pleasure in the fair
garden but shortly after none all at the queens behest reassembled
according to their wont by the fountain and the queen having seated
herself on her throne glanced towards pamfilo and bade him with a smile
lead off with the stories of good fortune whereto pamfilo gladly
addressed himself and thus began

novel i

cimon by loving waxes wise wins his wife iphigenia by capture on the
high seas and is imprisoned at rhodes he is delivered by lysimachus
and the twain capture cassandra and recapture iphigenia in the hour of
their marriage they flee with their ladies to crete and having there
married them are brought back to their homes

many stories sweet my ladies occur to me as meet for me to tell by way
of ushering in a day so joyous as this will be of which one does most
commend itself to my mind because not only has it one of those happy
endings of which today we are in quest but twill enable you to
understand how holy how mighty and how salutary are the forces of love
which not a few witting not what they say do most unjustly reprobate
and revile which if i err not should to you for that i take you to be
enamoured be indeed welcome
once upon a time then as we have read in the ancient histories of the
cypriotes there was in the island of cyprus a very great noble named
aristippus a man rich in all worldly goods beyond all other of his
countrymen and who might have deemed himself incomparably blessed but
for a single sore affliction that fortune had allotted him which was
that among his sons he had one the best grown and handsomest of them
all that was wellnigh a hopeless imbecile his true name was galesus
but as neither his tutors pains nor his fathers coaxing or
chastisement nor any other method had availed to imbue him with any
tincture of letters or manners but he still remained gruff and savage of
voice and in his bearing liker to a beast than to a man all as in
derision were wont to call him cimon which in their language signifies
the same as bestione brute1 in ours the father grieved beyond
measure to see his sons life thus blighted and having abandoned all
hope of his recovery nor caring to have the cause of his mortification
ever before his eyes bade him betake him to the farm and there keep
with his husbandmen to cimon the change was very welcome because the
manners and habits of the uncouth hinds were more to his taste than those
of the citizens so to the farm cimon hied him and addressed himself to
the work thereof and being thus employed he chanced one afternoon as he
passed staff on shoulder from one domain to another to enter a
plantation the like of which for beauty there was not in those parts
and which was thenfor twas the month of maya mass of greenery and
as he traversed it he came as fortune was pleased to guide him to a
meadow girt in with trees exceeding tall and having in one of its
corners a fountain most fair and cool beside which he espied a most
beautiful girl lying asleep on the green grass clad only in a vest of
such fine stuff that it scarce in any measure veiled the whiteness of her
flesh and below the waist nought but an apron most white and fine of
texture and likewise at her feet there slept two women and a man her
slaves no sooner did cimon catch sight of her than as if he had never
before seen form of woman he stopped short and leaning on his cudgel
regarded her intently saying never a word and lost in admiration and
in his rude soul which despite a thousand lessons had hitherto
remained impervious to every delight that belongs to urbane life he felt
the awakening of an idea that bade his gross and coarse mind
acknowledge that this girl was the fairest creature that had ever been
seen by mortal eye and thereupon he began to distinguish her several
parts praising her hair which shewed to him as gold her brow her nose
and mouth her throat and arms and above all her bosom which was as yet
but in bud and as he gazed he changed of a sudden from a husbandman
into a judge of beauty and desired of all things to see her eyes which
the weight of her deep slumber kept close shut and many a time he would
fain have awakened her that he might see them but so much fairer seemed
she to him than any other woman that he had seen that he doubted she
must be a goddess and as he was not so devoid of sense but that he
deemed things divine more worthy of reverence than things mundane he
forbore and waited until she should awake of her own accord and though
he found the delay overlong yet enthralled by so unwonted a delight he
knew not how to be going however after he had tarried a long while it
so befell that iphigeniasuch was the girls nameher slaves still
sleeping awoke and raised her head and opened her eyes and seeing
cimon standing before her leaning on his staff was not a little
surprised and saidcimon what seekest thou in this wood at this
hour for cimon she knew well as indeed did almost all the
countryside by reason alike of his uncouth appearance as of the rank
and wealth of his father to iphigenias question he answered never a
word but as soon as her eyes were open nought could he do but intently
regard them for it seemed to him that a soft influence emanated from
them which filled his soul with a delight that he had never before
known which the girl marking began to misdoubt that by so fixed a
scrutiny his boorish temper might be prompted to some act that should
cause her dishonour wherefore she roused her women and got up
sayingkeep thy distance cimon in gods name whereto cimon made
answeri will come with thee and albeit the girl refused his
escort being still in fear of him she could not get quit of him but he
attended her home after which he hied him straight to his fathers
house and announced that he was minded on no account to go back to the
farm which intelligence was far from welcome to his father and kinsmen
but nevertheless they suffered him to stay and waited to see what might
be the reason of his change of mind so cimon whose heart closed to all
teaching loves shaft sped by the beauty of iphigenia had penetrated
did now graduate in wisdom with such celerity as to astonish his father
and kinsmen and all that knew him he began by requesting his father to
let him go clad in the like apparel and with in all respects the like
personal equipment as his brothers which his father very gladly did
mixing thus with the gallants and becoming familiar with the manners
proper to gentlemen and especially to lovers he very soon to the
exceeding great wonder of all not only acquired the rudiments of
letters but waxed most eminent among the philosophic wits after which
for no other cause than the love he bore to iphigenia he not only
modulated his gruff and boorish voice to a degree of smoothness suitable
to urbane life but made himself accomplished in singing and music in
riding also and in all matters belonging to war as well by sea as by
land he waxed most expert and hardy and in sum that i go not about to
enumerate each of his virtues in detail he had not completed the fourth
year from the day of his first becoming enamoured before he was grown the
most gallant and courteous ay and the most perfect in particular
accomplishments of the young cavaliers that were in the island of
cyprus what then gracious ladies are we to say of cimon verily nought
else but that the high faculties with which heaven had endowed his noble
soul invidious fortune had bound with the strongest of cords and
circumscribed within a very narrow region of his heart all which cords
love more potent than fortune burst and brake in pieces and then with
the might wherewith he awakens dormant powers he brought them forth of
the cruel obfuscation in which they lay into clear light plainly
shewing thereby whence he may draw and whither he may guide by his
beams the souls that are subject to his sway
now albeit by his love for iphigenia cimon was betrayed as young lovers
very frequently are into some peccadillos yet aristippus reflecting
that it had turned him from a booby into a man not only bore patiently
with him but exhorted him with all his heart to continue steadfast in
his love and cimon who still refused to be called galesus because
twas as cimon that iphigenia had first addressed him being desirous to
accomplish his desire by honourable means did many a time urge his suit
upon her father cipseus that he would give her him to wife whereto
cipseus always made the same answer to wit that he had promised her to
pasimondas a young rhodian noble and was not minded to break faith with
him however the time appointed for iphigenias wedding being come and
the bridegroom having sent for her cimon said to himselftis now for
me to shew thee o iphigenia how great is my love for thee tis by thee
that i am grown a man nor doubt i if i shall have thee that i shall
wax more glorious than a god and verily thee will i have or die having
so said he privily enlisted in his cause certain young nobles that were
his friends and secretly fitted out a ship with all equipment meet for
combat and put to sea on the lookout for the ship that was to bear
iphigenia to rhodes and her husband and at length when her father had
done lavishing honours upon her husbands friends iphigenia embarked
and the mariners shaping their course for rhodes put to sea cimon was
on the alert and overhauled them the very next day and standing on his
ships prow shouted amain to those that were aboard iphigenias
shipbring to strike sails or look to be conquered and sunk in the
sea then seeing that the enemy had gotten their arms above deck and
were making ready to make a fight of it he followed up his words by
casting a grapnel upon the poop of the rhodians who were making great
way and having thus made their poop fast to his prow he sprang fierce
as a lion reckless whether he were followed or no on to the rhodians
ship making as it were no account of them and animated by love
hurled himself sword in hand with prodigious force among the enemy and
cutting and thrusting right and left slaughtered them like sheep
insomuch that the rhodians marking the fury of his onset threw down
their arms and as with one voice did all acknowledge themselves his
prisoners to whom cimongallants quoth he twas neither lust of
booty nor enmity to you that caused me to put out from cyprus to attack
you here with force of arms on the high seas moved was i thereto by that
which to gain is to me a matter great indeed which peaceably to yield me
is to you but a slight matter for tis even iphigenia whom more than
aught else i love whom as i might not have her of her father in
peaceable and friendly sort love has constrained me to take from you in
this highhanded fashion and by force of arms to whom i mean to be even
such as would have been your pasimondas wherefore give her to me and go
your way and gods grace go with you
yielding rather to force than prompted by generosity the rhodians
surrendered iphigenia all tears to cimon who marking her tears said
to hergrieve not noble lady thy cimon am i who by my long love
have established a far better right to thee than pasimondas by the faith
that was plighted to him so saying he sent her aboard his ship
whither he followed her touching nought that belonged to the rhodians
and suffering them to go their way to have gotten so dear a prize made
him the happiest man in the world but for a time twas all he could do
to assuage her grief then after taking counsel with his comrades he
deemed it best not to return to cyprus for the present and so by common
consent they shaped their course for crete where most of them and
especially cimon had alliances of old or recent date and friends not a
few whereby they deemed that there they might tarry with iphigenia in
security but fortune that had accorded cimon so gladsome a capture of
the lady suddenly proved fickle and converted the boundless joy of the
enamoured gallant into woeful and bitter lamentation twas not yet full
four hours since cimon had parted from the rhodians when with the
approach of night that night from which cimon hoped such joyance as he
had never known came weather most turbulent and tempestuous which
wrapped the heavens in cloud and swept the sea with scathing blasts
whereby twas not possible for any to see how the ship was to be worked
or steered or to steady himself so as to do any duty upon her deck
whereat what grief was cimons it boots not to ask indeed it seemed to
him that the gods had granted his hearts desire only that it might be
harder for him to die which had else been to him but a light matter not
less downcast were his comrades but most of all iphigenia who weeping
bitterly and shuddering at every wave that struck the ship did cruelly
curse cimons love and censure his rashness averring that this tempest
was come upon them for no other cause than that the gods had decreed
that as twas in despite of their will that he purposed to espouse her
he should be frustrate of his presumptuous intent and having lived to
see her expire should then himself meet a woeful death
while thus and yet more bitterly they bewailed them and the mariners
were at their wits end as the gale grew hourly more violent nor knew
they nor might conjecture whither they went they drew nigh the island
of rhodes albeit that rhodes it was they wist not and set themselves
as best and most skilfully they might to run the ship aground in which
enterprise fortune favoured them bringing them into a little bay where
shortly before them was arrived the rhodian ship that cimon had let go
nor were they sooner ware that twas rhodes they had made than day
broke and the sky thus brightening a little they saw that they were
about a bowshot from the ship that they had released on the preceding
day whereupon cimon vexed beyond measure being apprehensive of that
which in fact befell them bade make every effort to win out of the bay
and let fortune carry them whither she would for nowhere might they be
in worse plight than there so might and main they strove to bring the
ship out but all in vain the violence of the gale thwarted them to such
purpose as not only to preclude their passage out of the bay but to drive
them willing nilling ashore whither no sooner were they come than
they were recognized by the rhodian mariners who were already landed of
whom one ran with all speed to a farm hard by whither the rhodian
gallants were gone and told them that fortune had brought cimon and
iphigenia aboard their ship into the same bay to which she had guided
them whereat the gallants were overjoyed and taking with them not a few
of the farmservants hied them in hot haste to the shore where cimon
and his men being already landed with intent to take refuge in a
neighbouring wood they took them all with iphigenia and brought them
to the farm whence pursuant to an order of the senate of rhodes to
which so soon as he received the news pasimondas made his complaint
cimon and his men were all marched off to prison by lysimachus chief
magistrate of the rhodians for that year who came down from the city for
the purpose with an exceeding great company of men at arms on such wise
did our hapless and enamoured cimon lose his so lately won iphigenia
before he had had of her more than a kiss or two iphigenia was
entertained and comforted of the annoy occasioned as well by her recent
capture as by the fury of the sea by not a few noble ladies of rhodes
with whom she tarried until the day appointed for her marriage in
recompense of the release of the rhodian gallants on the preceding day
the lives of cimon and his men were spared notwithstanding that
pasimondas pressed might and main for their execution and instead they
were condemned to perpetual imprisonment wherein as may be supposed
they abode in dolorous plight and despaired of ever again knowing
happiness
however it so befell that pasimondas accelerating his nuptials to the
best of his power fortune as if repenting her that in her haste she had
done cimon so evil a turn did now by a fresh disposition of events
compass his deliverance pasimondas had a brother by name hormisdas his
equal in all respects save in years who had long been contract to marry
cassandra a fair and noble damsel of rhodes of whom lysimachus was in
the last degree enamoured but owing to divers accidents the marriage had
been from time to time put off now pasimondas being about to celebrate
his nuptials with exceeding great pomp bethought him that he could not
do better than to avoid a repetition of the pomp and expense arrange
if so he might that his brother should be wedded on the same day with
himself so having consulted anew with cassandras kinsfolk and come to
an understanding with them he and his brother and they conferred
together and agreed that on the same day that pasimondas married
iphigenia hormisdas should marry cassandra lysimachus getting wind of
this arrangement was mortified beyond measure seeing himself thereby
deprived of the hope which he cherished of marrying cassandra himself if
hormisdas should not forestall him but like a wise man he concealed his
chagrin and cast about how he might frustrate the arrangement to which
end he saw no other possible means but to carry cassandra off it did not
escape him that the office which he held would render this easily
feasible but he deemed it all the more dishonourable than if he had not
held the office but in short after much pondering honour yielded
place to love and he made up his mind that come what might he would
carry cassandra off then as he took thought what company he should take
with him and how he should go about the affair he remembered cimon
whom he had in prison with his men and it occurred to him that he could
not possibly have a better or more trusty associate in such an enterprise
than cimon wherefore the same night he caused cimon to be brought
privily to him in his own room and thus addressed himcimon as the
gods are most generous and liberal to bestow their gifts on men so are
they also most sagacious to try their virtue and those whom they find to
be firm and steadfast in all circumstances they honour as the most
worthy with the highest rewards they have been minded to be certified
of thy worth by better proofs than thou couldst afford them as long as
thy life was bounded by thy fathers house amid the superabundant wealth
which i know him to possess wherefore in the first place they so wrought
upon thee with the shrewd incitements of love that from an insensate
brute as i have heard thou grewest to be a man since when it has been
and is their intent to try whether evil fortune and harsh imprisonment
may avail to change thee from the temper that was thine when for a short
while thou hadst joyance of the prize thou hadst won and so thou prove
the same that thou wast then they have in store for thee a boon
incomparably greater than aught that they vouchsafed thee before what
that boon is to the end thou mayst recover heart and thy wonted
energies i will now explain to thee pasimondas exultant in thy
misfortune and eager to compass thy death hastens to the best of his
power his nuptials with thy iphigenia that so he may enjoy the prize
that fortune erstwhile smiling gave thee and forthwith frowning reft
from thee whereat how sore must be thy grief if rightly i gauge thy
love i know by my own case seeing that his brother hormisdas addresses
himself to do me on the same day a like wrong in regard of cassandra
whom i love more than aught else in the world nor see i that fortune has
left us any way of escape from this her unjust and cruel spite save what
we may make for ourselves by a resolved spirit and the might of our right
hands take we then the sword and therewith make we each prize of his
lady thou for the second i for the first time for so thou value the
recovery i say not of thy liberty for without thy lady i doubt thou
wouldst hold it cheap but of thy lady the gods have placed it in thine
own hands if thou art but minded to join me in my enterprise
these words restored to cimon all that he had lost of heart and hope nor
pondered he long before he repliedlysimachus comrade stouter or
more staunch than i thou mightst not have in such an enterprise if such
indeed it be as thou sayst wherefore lay upon me such behest as thou
shalt deem meet and thou shalt marvel to witness the vigour of my
performance whereupon lysimachuson the third day from now quoth
he their husbands houses will be newly entered by the brides and on
the same day at even we too will enter them in arms thou with thy men
and i with some of mine in whom i place great trust and forcing our way
among the guests and slaughtering all that dare to oppose us will bear
the ladies off to a ship which i have had privily got ready cimon
approved the plan and kept quiet in prison until the appointed time
which being come the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp and
magnificence that filled the houses of the two brothers with festal
cheer then lysimachus having made ready all things meet and fired cimon
and his men and his own friends for the enterprise by a long harangue
disposed them in due time all bearing arms under their cloaks in three
companies and having privily despatched one company to the port that
when the time should come to embark he might meet with no let he
marched with the other two companies to the house of pasimondas posted
the one company at the gate that being entered they might not be shut
in or debarred their egress and with the other company and cimon
ascended the stairs and gained the saloon where the brides and not a
few other ladies were set at several tables to sup in meet order
whereupon in they rushed and overthrew the tables and seized each his
own lady and placed them in charge of their men whom they bade bear
them off forthwith to the ship that lay ready to receive them whereupon
the brides and the other ladies and the servants with one accord fell a
sobbing and shrieking insomuch that a confused din and lamentation
filled the whole place cimon lysimachus and their band none
withstanding but all giving way before them gained the stairs which
they were already descending when they encountered pasimondas who
carrying a great staff in his hand was making in the direction of the
noise but one doughty stroke of cimons sword sufficed to cleave his
skull in twain and lay him dead at cimons feet and another stroke
disposed of hapless hormisdas as he came running to his brothers aid
some others who ventured to approach them were wounded and beaten off by
the retinue so forth of the house that reeked with blood and resounded
with tumult and lamentation and woe sped simon and lysimachus with all
their company and without any let in close order with their fair booty
in their midst made good their retreat to the ship whereon with the
ladies they one and all embarked for the shore was now full of armed men
come to rescue the ladies and the oarsmen giving way put to sea elate
arrived at crete they met with a hearty welcome on the part of their
many friends and kinsfolk and having married their ladies they made
greatly merry and had gladsome joyance of their fair booty their doings
occasioned both in cyprus and in rhodes no small stir and commotion
which lasted for a long while but in the end by the good offices of
their friends and kinsfolk in both islands twas so ordered as that
after a certain term of exile cimon returned with iphigenia to cyprus
and in like manner lysimachus returned with cassandra to rhodes and long
and blithely thereafter lived they each well contented with his own wife
in his own land

novel ii

gostanza loves martuccio gomito and hearing that he is dead gives way
to despair and hies her alone aboard a boat which is wafted by the wind
to susa she finds him alive in tunis and makes herself known to him
who having by his counsel gained high place in the kings favour
marries her and returns with her wealthy to lipari

pamfilos story being ended the queen after commending it not a little
called for one to follow from emilia who thus began
meet and right it is that one should rejoice when events so fall out that
passion meets with its due reward and as love merits in the long run
rather joy than suffering far gladlier obey i the queens than i did the
kings behest and address myself to our present theme you are to know
then dainty ladies that not far from sicily there is an islet called
lipari in which no great while ago there dwelt a damsel gostanza by
name fair as fair could be and of one of the most honourable families
in the island and one martuccio gomito who was also of the island a
young man most gallant and courteous and worthy for his condition
became enamoured of gostanza who in like manner grew so afire for him
that she was ever ill at ease except she saw him martuccio craving her
to wife asked her of her father who made answer that martuccio being
poor he was not minded to give her to him mortified to be thus rejected
by reason of poverty martuccio took an oath in presence of some of his
friends and kinsfolk that lipari should know him no more until he was
wealthy so away he sailed and took to scouring the seas as a rover on
the coast of barbary preying upon all whose force matched not his own
in which way of life he found fortune favourable enough had he but known
how to rest and be thankful but twas not enough that he and his
comrades in no long time waxed very wealthy their covetousness was
inordinate and while they sought to gratify it they chanced in an
encounter with certain saracen ships to be taken after a long defence
and despoiled and most part of them thrown into the sea by their
captors who after sinking his ship took martuccio with them to tunis
and clapped him in prison and there kept him a long time in a very sad
plight
meanwhile not by one or two but by divers and not a few persons
tidings reached lipari that all that were with martuccio aboard his bark
had perished in the sea the damsel whose grief on martuccios departure
had known no bounds now hearing that he was dead with the rest wept a
great while and made up her mind to have done with life but lacking
the resolution to lay violent hands upon herself she bethought her how
she might devote herself to death by some novel expedient so one night
she stole out of her fathers house and hied her to the port and there
by chance she found lying a little apart from the other craft a fishing
boat which as the owners had but just quitted her was still equipped
with mast and sails and oars aboard which boat she forthwith got and
being like most of the women of the island not altogether without
nautical skill she rowed some distance out to sea and then hoisted
sail and cast away oars and tiller and let the boat drift deeming that
a boat without lading or steersman would certainly be either capsized by
the wind or dashed against some rock and broken in pieces so that escape
she could not even if she would but must perforce drown and so her
head wrapped in a mantle she stretched herself weeping on the floor of
the boat but it fell out quite otherwise than she had conjectured for
the wind being from the north and very equable with next to no sea the
boat kept an even keel and next day about vespers bore her to land hard
by a city called susa full a hundred miles beyond tunis to the damsel
twas all one whether she were at sea or ashore for since she had been
aboard she had never once raised nor come what might meant she ever
to raise her head
now it so chanced that when the boat grounded there was on the shore a
poor woman that was in the employ of some fishermen whose nets she was
just taking out of the sunlight seeing the boat under full sail she
marvelled how it should be suffered to drive ashore and conjectured that
the fishermen on board were asleep so to the boat she hied her and
finding therein only the damsel fast asleep she called her many times
and at length awakened her and perceiving by her dress that she was a
christian she asked her in latin how it was that she was come thither
all alone in the boat hearing the latin speech the damsel wondered
whether the wind had not shifted and carried her back to lipari so up
she started gazed about her and finding herself ashore and the aspect
of the country strange asked the good woman where she was to which the
good woman made answermy daughter thou art hard by susa in barbary
whereupon the damsel sorrowful that god had not seen fit to accord her
the boon of death apprehensive of dishonour and at her wits end sat
herself down at the foot of her boat and burst into tears which the
good woman saw not without pity and persuaded her to come with her into
her hut and there by coaxing drew from her how she was come thither and
knowing that she could not but be fasting she set before her her own
coarse bread and some fish and water and prevailed upon her to eat a
little gostanza thereupon asked her who she was that thus spoke latin
whereto she answered that her name was carapresa and that she was from
trapani where she had served some christian fishermen to the damsel
sad indeed though she was this name carapresa wherefore she knew not
seemed to be of happy augury so that she began to take hope she knew
not why and to grow somewhat less fain of death wherefore without
disclosing who or whence she was she earnestly besought the good woman
for the love of god to have pity on her youth and advise her how best to
avoid insult whereupon carapresa good woman that she was left her in
her hut while with all speed she picked up her nets and on her return
she wrapped her in her own mantle and led her to susa arrived there
she said to hergostanza i shall bring thee to the house of an
excellent saracen lady for whom i frequently do bits of work as she has
occasion she is an old lady and compassionate i will commend thee to
her care as best i may and i doubt not she will right gladly receive
thee and entreat thee as her daughter and thou wilt serve her and
while thou art with her do all thou canst to gain her favour until such
time as god may send thee better fortune and as she said so she did
the old lady listened and then gazing steadfastly in the damsels face
shed tears and taking her hand kissed her forehead and led her into
the house where she and some other women dwelt quite by themselves
doing divers kinds of handiwork in silk and palm leaves and leather
wherein the damsel in a few days acquired some skill and thenceforth
wrought together with them and rose wondrous high in the favour and good
graces of all the ladies who soon taught her their language
now while the damsel mourned at home as lost and dead dwelt thus at
susa it so befell that mariabdela being then king of tunis a young
chieftain in granada of great power and backed by mighty allies gave
out that the realm of tunis belonged to him and having gathered a vast
army made a descent upon tunis with intent to expel the king from the
realm martuccio gomito who knew the language of barbary well heard the
tidings in prison and learning that the king of tunis was mustering a
mighty host for the defence of his kingdom said to one of the warders
that were in charge of him and his comradesif i might have speech of
the king i am confident that the advice that i should give him would
secure him the victory the warder repeated these words to his chief
who forthwith carried them to the king wherefore by the kings command
martuccio was brought before him and being asked by him what the advice
of which he had spoken might be answered on this wisesire if in
old days when i was wont to visit this country of yours i duly observed
the manner in which you order your battle methinks you place your main
reliance upon archers and therefore if you could contrive that your
enemys supply of arrows should give out and your own continue plentiful
i apprehend that you would win the battle ay indeed replied the
king i make no doubt that could i but accomplish that i should
conquer nay but sire returned martuccio you may do it if you
will listen and i will tell you how you must fit the bows of your
archers with strings much finer than those that are in common use and
match them with arrows the notches of which will not admit any but these
fine strings and this you must do so secretly that your enemy may not
know it else he will find means to be even with you which counsel i
give you for the following reasonwhen your and your enemys archers
have expended all their arrows you wot that the enemy will fall to
picking up the arrows that your men have shot during the battle and your
men will do the like by the enemys arrows but the enemy will not be
able to make use of your mens arrows by reason that their fine notches
will not suffice to admit the stout strings whereas your men will be in
the contrary case in regard of the enemys arrows for the fine string
will very well receive the largenotched arrow and so your men will have
an abundant supply of arrows while the enemy will be at a loss for
them
the king who lacked not sagacity appreciated martuccios advice and
gave full effect to it whereby he came out of the war a conqueror and
martuccio being raised to the chief place in his favour waxed rich and
powerful which matters being bruited throughout the country it came to
the ears of gostanza that martuccio gomito whom she had long supposed to
be dead was alive whereby her love for him some embers of which still
lurked in her heart burst forth again in sudden flame and gathered
strength and revived her dead hope wherefore she frankly told all her
case to the good lady with whom she dwelt saying that she would fain go
to tunis that her eyes might have assurance of that which the report
received by her ears had made them yearn to see the lady fell heartily
in with the girls desire and as if she had been her mother embarked
with her for tunis where on their arrival they were honourably received
in the house of one of her kinswomen carapresa who had attended her
being sent to discover what she might touching martuccio brought back
word that he was alive and high in honour and place the gentlewoman was
minded that none but herself should apprise martuccio of the arrival of
his gostanza wherefore she hied her one day to martuccio and
saidmartuccio there is come to my house a servant of thine from
lipari who would fain speak with thee here privily and for that he
would not have me trust another i am come hither myself to deliver his
message martuccio thanked her and forthwith hied him with her to her
house where no sooner did the girl see him than she all but died for
joy and carried away by her feelings fell upon his neck with open arms
and embraced him and what with sorrow of his past woes and her present
happiness said never a word but softly wept martuccio regarded her for
a while in silent wonder then heaving a sigh he saidthou livest
then my gostanza long since i heard that thou wast lost nor was aught
known of thee at home which said he tenderly and with tears embraced
her gostanza told him all her adventures and how honourably she had
been entreated by the gentlewoman with whom she had dwelt and so long
time they conversed and then martuccio parted from her and hied him
back to his lord the king and told him all to wit his own adventures
and those of the girl adding that with his leave he was minded to marry
her according to our law which matters the king found passing strange
and having called the girl to him and learned from her that twas even
as martuccio had saidwell indeed quoth he hast thou won thy
husband then caused he gifts most ample and excellent to be brought
forth part of which he gave to gostanza and part to martuccio leaving
them entirely to their own devices in regard of one another then
martuccio in terms most honourable bade farewell to the old lady with
whom gostanza had dwelt thanking her for the service she had rendered to
gostanza and giving her presents suited to her condition and commending
her to god while gostanza shed many a tear after which by leave of the
king they went aboard a light bark taking with them carapresa and
sped by a prosperous breeze arrived at lipari where they were received
with such cheer as twere vain to attempt to describe there were
martuccio and gostanza wedded with all pomp and splendour and there long
time in easeful peace they had joyance of their love

pietro boccamazza runs away with agnolella and encounters a gang of
robbers the girl takes refuge in a wood and is guided to a castle
pietro is taken but escapes out of the hands of the robbers and after
some adventures arrives at the castle where agnolella is marries her
and returns with her to rome

ended emilias story which none of the company spared to commend the
queen turning to elisa bade her follow suit and she with glad
obedience thus began
tis a story sweet ladies of a woeful night passed by two indiscreet
young lovers that i have in mind but as thereon ensued not a few days
of joy tis not inapposite to our argument and shall be narrated
tis no long time since at rome which albeit now the tail1 was of
yore the head of the world there dwelt a young man pietro boccamazza
by name a scion of one of the most illustrious of the roman houses who
became enamoured of a damsel exceeding fair and amorous withalher name
agnolellathe daughter of one gigliuozzo saullo a plebeian but in high
repute among the romans nor loving thus did pietro lack the address to
inspire in agnolella a love as ardent as his own wherefore overmastered
by his passion and minded no longer to endure the sore suffering that it
caused him he asked her in marriage whereof his kinsfolk were no sooner
apprised than with one accord they came to him and strongly urged him to
desist from his purpose they also gave gigliuozzo saullo to understand
that he were best to pay no sort of heed to pietros words for that if
he so did they would never acknowledge him as friend or relative thus
to see himself debarred of the one way by which he deemed he might attain
to his desire pietro was ready to die for grief and all his kinsfolk
notwithstanding he would have married gigliuozzos daughter had but the
father consented wherefore at length he made up his mind that if the
girl were willing nought should stand in the way and having through a
common friend sounded the damsel and found her apt he brought her to
consent to elope with him from rome the affair being arranged pietro
and she took horse betimes one morning and sallied forth for anagni
where pietro had certain friends in whom he placed much trust and as
they rode time not serving for full joyance of their love for they
feared pursuit they held converse thereof and from time to time
exchanged a kiss now it so befell that the way being none too well
known to pietro when perhaps eight miles from rome they should have
turned to the right they took instead a leftward road whereon when they
had ridden but little more than two miles they found themselves close to
a petty castle whence so soon as they were observed there issued some
dozen men at arms and as they drew near the damsel espying them gave
a cry and saidwe are attacked pietro let us flee and guiding her
nag as best she knew towards a great forest she planted the spurs in his
sides and so holding on by the saddlebow was borne by the goaded
creature into the forest at a gallop pietro who had been too engrossed
with her face to give due heed to the way and thus had not been ware as
soon as she of the approach of the men at arms was still looking about
to see whence they were coming when they came up with him and took him
prisoner and forced him to dismount then they asked who he was and
when he told them they conferred among themselves sayingthis is one
of the friends of our enemies what else can we do but relieve him of his
nag and of his clothes and hang him on one of these oaks in scorn of the
orsini to which proposal all agreeing they bade pietro strip himself
but while already divining his fate he was so doing an ambuscade of
full fiveandtwenty men at arms fell suddenly upon them
cryingdeath death thus surprised they let pietro go and stood on
the defensive but seeing that the enemy greatly outnumbered them they
took to their heels the others giving chase whereupon pietro hastily
resumed his clothes mounted his nag and fled with all speed in the
direction which he had seen the damsel take but finding no road or path
through the forest nor discerning any trace of a horses hooves he
wasfor that he found not the damselalbeit he deemed himself safe out
of the clutches of his captors and their assailants the most wretched
man alive and fell a weeping and wandering hither and thither about the
forest uttering agnolellas name none answered but turn back he dared
not so on he went not knowing whither he went besides which he was in
mortal dread of the wild beasts that infest the forest as well on
account of himself as of the damsel whom momently he seemed to see
throttled by some bear or wolf thus did our unfortunate pietro spend the
whole day wandering about the forest making it to resound with his
cries of agnolellas name and harking at times back when he thought to
go forward until at last what with his cries and his tears and his
fears and his long fasting he was so spent that he could go no further
twas then nightfall and as he knew not what else to do he dismounted
at the foot of an immense oak and having tethered his nag to the trunk
climbed up into the branches lest he should be devoured by the wild
beasts during the night shortly afterwards the moon rose with a very
clear sky and pietro who dared not sleep lest he should fall and
indeed had he been secure from that risk his misery and his anxiety on
account of the damsel would not have suffered him to sleep kept watch
sighing and weeping and cursing his evil luck
now the damsel who as we said before had fled she knew not whither
allowing her nag to carry her whithersoever he would strayed so far into
the forest that she lost sight of the place where she had entered it and
spent the whole day just as pietro had done wandering about the
wilderness pausing from time to time and weeping and uttering his
name and bewailing her evil fortune at last seeing that twas now the
vesper hour and pietro came not she struck into a path which the nag
followed until after riding some two miles she espied at some distance
a cottage for which she made with all speed and found there a good man
well stricken in years with his wife who was likewise aged seeing her
ride up alone they saiddaughter wherefore ridest thou thus alone at
this hour in these parts weeping the damsel made answer that she had
lost her companion in the forest and asked how far might anagni be from
there my daughter returned the good man this is not the road to
anagni tis more than twelve miles away and how far off inquired
the damsel are the nearest houses in which one might find lodging for
the night there are none so near replied the good man that thou
canst reach them today then so please you said the damsel since
go elsewhither i cannot for gods sake let me pass the night here with
you whereto the good man made answerdamsel welcome art thou to
tarry the night with us but still thou art to know that these parts are
infested both by day and by night by bands which be they friends or be
they foes are alike ill to meet with and not seldom do much despite and
mischief and if by misadventure one of these bands should visit us while
thou wert here and marking thy youth and beauty should do thee despite
and dishonour we should be unable to afford thee any succour this we
would have thee know that if it should so come to pass thou mayst not
have cause to reproach us the damsel heard not the old mans words
without dismay but seeing that the hour was now late she
answeredgod if he be so pleased will save both you and me from such
molestation and if not tis a much lesser evil to be maltreated by men
than to be torn in pieces by the wild beasts in the forest so saying
she dismounted and entered the cottage where having supped with the
poor man and his wife on such humble fare as they had she laid herself
in her clothes beside them in their bed she slept not however for her
own evil plight and that of pietro for whom she knew not how to augur
aught but evil kept her sighing and weeping all night long and towards
matins she heard a great noise as of men that marched so up she got and
hied her into a large courtyard that was in rear of the cottage and part
of which was covered with a great heap of hay which she espying hid
herself therein that if the men came there they might not so readily
find her scarce had she done so than the men who proved to be a strong
company of marauders were at the door of the cottage which they forced
open and having entered and found the damsels nag still saddled they
asked who was there the damsel being out of sight the good man
answeredthere is none here but my wife and i but this nag which has
given some one the slip found his way hither last night and we housed
him lest he should be devoured by the wolves so said the chief of
the band as he has no owner he will come in very handy for us
whereupon in several parties they ransacked the cottage from top to
bottom and one party went out into the courtyard where as they threw
aside their lances and targets it so befell that one of them not
knowing where else to bestow his lance tossed it into the hay and was
within an ace of killing the damsel that lay hid there as likewise she
of betraying her whereabouts for the lance all but grazing her left
breast insomuch that the head tore her apparel she doubted she was
wounded and had given a great shriek but that remembering where she
was she refrained for fear by and by the company cooked them a
breakfast of kids and other meat and having eaten and drunken
dispersed in divers directions as their affairs required taking the
girls nag with them and when they were gotten some little way off the
good man asked his wifewhat became of the damsel our guest of last
night that i have not seen her since we rose the good woman answered
that she knew not where the damsel was and went to look for her the
damsel discovering that the men were gone came forth of the hay and
the good man seeing her was overjoyed that she had not fallen into the
hands of the ruffians and as day was breaking said to hernow that
day is at hand we will so it like thee escort thee to a castle some
five miles hence where thou wilt be in safety but thou must needs go
afoot because these villains that are but just gone have taken thy nag
with them the damsel resigning herself to her loss besought them for
gods sake to take her to the castle whereupon they set forth and
arrived there about half tierce now the castle belonged to one of the
orsini liello di campo di fiore by name whose wife as it chanced was
there a most kindly and good woman she was and recognizing the damsel
as soon as she saw her gave her a hearty welcome and would fain have
from her a particular account of how she came there so the damsel told
her the whole story the lady to whom pietro was also known as being a
friend of her husband was distressed to hear of his misadventure and
being told where he was taken gave him up for dead so she said to the
damselsince so it is that thou knowest not how pietro has fared thou
shalt stay here with me until such time as i may have opportunity to send
thee safely back to rome
meanwhile pietro perched on his oak in as woeful a plight as might be
had espied when he should have been in his first sleep a full score of
wolves that as they prowled caught sight of the nag and straightway
were upon him on all sides the horse as soon as he was ware of their
approach strained on the reins till they snapped and tried to make good
his escape but being hemmed in was brought to bay and made a long
fight of it with his teeth and hooves but in the end they bore him down
and throttled him and forthwith eviscerated him and the whole pack
falling upon him devoured him to the bone before they had done with him
whereat pietro who felt that in the nag he had lost a companion and a
comfort in his travail was sorely dismayed and began to think that he
should never get out of the forest but towards dawn he perched there
in the oak almost dead with cold looking around him as he frequently
did espied about a mile off a huge fire wherefore as soon as twas
broad day he got down not without trepidation from the oak and bent
his steps towards the fire and being come to it he found gathered
about it a company of shepherds eating and making merry who took pity
on him and made him welcome and when he had broken his fast and warmed
himself he told them the mishap that had befallen him and how it was
that he was come there alone and asked them if there was a farm or
castle in those parts whither he might betake him the shepherds said
that about three miles away there was a castle belonging to liello di
campo di fiore where his lady was then tarrying pietro much comforted
requested to be guided thither by some of their company whereupon two of
them right gladly escorted him so pietro arrived at the castle where he
found some that knew him and while he was endeavouring to set on foot a
search for the damsel in the forest the lady summoned him to her
presence and he forthwith obeying and seeing agnolella with her was
the happiest man that ever was he yearned till he all but swooned to go
and embrace her but refrained for bashfulness in the ladys presence
and overjoyed as he was the joy of the damsel was no less the lady
received him with great cheer and though when she had heard the story
of his adventures from his own lips she chid him not a little for having
set at nought the wishes of his kinsfolk yet seeing that he was still
of the same mind and that the damsel was also constant she said to
herselfto what purpose give i myself all this trouble they love one
another they know one another they love with equal ardour their love
is honourable and i doubt not is well pleasing to god seeing that the
one has escaped the gallows and the other the lance and both the wild
beasts wherefore be it as they would have it then turning to them she
saidif tis your will to be joined in wedlock as man and wife mine

novel iv

ricciardo manardi is found by messer lizio da valbona with his daughter
whom he marries and remains at peace with her father

in silence elisa received the praise bestowed on her story by her fair
companions and then the queen called for a story from filostrato who
with a laugh began on this wisechidden have i been so often and by so
many of you for the sore burden which i laid upon you of discourse
harsh and meet for tears that as some compensation for such annoy i
deem myself bound to tell you somewhat that may cause you to laugh a
little wherefore my story which will be of the briefest shall be of a
love the course whereof save for sighs and a brief passage of fear
mingled with shame ran smooth to a happy consummation
know then noble ladies that tis no long time since there dwelt in
romagna a right worthy and courteous knight messer lizio da valbona by
name who was already verging upon old age when as it happened there
was born to him of his wife madonna giacomina a daughter who as she
grew up became the fairest and most debonair of all the girls of those
parts and for that she was the only daughter left to them was most
dearly loved and cherished by her father and mother who guarded her with
most jealous care thinking to arrange some great match for her now
there was frequently in messer lizios house and much in his company a
fine lusty young man one ricciardo de manardi da brettinoro whom
messer lizio and his wife would as little have thought of mistrusting as
if he had been their own son who now and again taking note of the
damsel that she was very fair and graceful and in bearing and behaviour
most commendable and of marriageable age fell vehemently in love with
her which love he was very careful to conceal the damsel detected it
however and in like manner plunged headlong into love with him to
ricciardos no small satisfaction again and again he was on the point of
speaking to her but refrained for fear at length however he summoned
up his courage and seizing his opportunity thus addressed
hercaterina i implore thee suffer me not to die for love of thee
whereto the damsel forthwith respondednay god grant that it be not
rather that i die for love of thee greatly exhilarated and encouraged
ricciardo made answertwill never be by default of mine that thou
lackest aught that may pleasure thee but it rests with thee to find the
means to save thy life and mine then said the damselthou seest
ricciardo how closely watched i am insomuch that i see not how twere
possible for thee to come to me but if thou seest aught that i may do
without dishonour speak the word and i will do it ricciardo was
silent a while pondering many matters then of a sudden he
saidsweet my caterina there is but one way that i can see to wit
that thou shouldst sleep either on or where thou mightst have access to
the terrace by thy fathers garden where so i but knew that thou
wouldst be there at night i would without fail contrive to meet thee
albeit tis very high as for my sleeping there replied caterina i
doubt not that it may be managed if thou art sure that thou canst join
me ricciardo answered in the affirmative whereupon they exchanged a
furtive kiss and parted
on the morrow it being now towards the close of may the damsel began
complaining to her mother that by reason of the excessive heat she had
not been able to get any sleep during the night daughter said the
lady what heat was there nay there was no heat at all had you
said to my thinking mother rejoined caterina you would perhaps
have said sooth but you should bethink you how much more heat girls have
in them than ladies that are advanced in years true my daughter
returned the lady but i cannot order that it shall be hot and cold as
thou perchance wouldst like we must take the weather as we find it and
as the seasons provide it perchance tonight it will be cooler and thou
wilt sleep better god grant it be so said caterina but tis not
wonted for the nights to grow cooler as the summer comes on what
then said the lady wouldst thou have me do with your leave and my
fathers answered caterina i should like to have a little bed made up
on the terrace by his room and over his garden where hearing the
nightingales sing and being in a much cooler place i should sleep much
better than in your room whereupondaughter be of good cheer said
the mother i will speak to thy father and we will do as he shall
decide so the lady told messer lizio what had passed between her and
the damsel but he being old and perhaps for that reason a little
morose saidwhat nightingale is this to whose chant she would fain
sleep i will see to it that the cicalas shall yet lull her to sleep
which speech coming to caterinas ears gave her such offence that for
anger rather than by reason of the heat she not only slept not herself
that night but suffered not her mother to sleep keeping up a perpetual
complaint of the great heat wherefore her mother hied her in the morning
to messer lizio and said to himsir you hold your daughter none too
dear what difference can it make to you that she lie on the terrace she
has tossed about all night long by reason of the heat and besides can
you wonder that she girl that she is loves to hear the nightingale
sing young folk naturally affect their likes whereto messer lizio made
answergo make her a bed there to your liking and set a curtain
round it and let her sleep there and hear the nightingale sing to her
hearts content which the damsel no sooner learned than she had a bed
made there with intent to sleep there that same night wherefore she
watched until she saw ricciardo whom by a concerted sign she gave to
understand what he was to do messer lizio as soon as he had heard the
damsel go to bed locked a door that led from his room to the terrace
and went to sleep himself when all was quiet ricciardo with the help of
a ladder got upon a wall and standing thereon laid hold of certain
toothings of another wall and not without great exertion and risk had
he fallen clambered up on to the terrace where the damsel received him
quietly with the heartiest of cheer many a kiss they exchanged and then
got them to bed where wellnigh all night long they had solace and
joyance of one another and made the nightingale sing not a few times
but brief being the night and great their pleasure towards dawn albeit
they wist it not they fell asleep caterinas right arm encircling
ricciardos neck while with her left hand she held him by that part of
his person which your modesty my ladies is most averse to name in the
company of men so peacefully they slept and were still asleep when day
broke and messer lizio rose and calling to mind that his daughter slept
on the terrace softly opened the door saying to himselflet me see
what sort of nights rest the nightingale has afforded our caterina and
having entered he gently raised the curtain that screened the bed and
saw ricciardo asleep with her and in her embrace as described both being
quite naked and uncovered and having taken note of ricciardo he went
away and hied him to his ladys room and called her sayingup up
wife come and see for thy daughter has fancied the nightingale to such
purpose that she has caught him and holds him in her hand how can
this be said the lady come quickly and thou shalt see replied
messer lizio so the lady huddled on her clothes and silently followed
messer lizio and when they were come to the bed and had raised the
curtain madonna giacomina saw plainly enough how her daughter had
caught and did hold the nightingale whose song she had so longed to
hear whereat the lady deeming that ricciardo had played her a cruel
trick would have cried out and upbraided him but messer lizio said to
herwife as thou valuest my love say not a word for in good sooth
seeing that she has caught him he shall be hers ricciardo is a
gentleman and wealthy an alliance with him cannot but be to our
advantage if he would part from me on good terms he must first marry
her so that the nightingale shall prove to have been put in his own cage
and not in that of another whereby the lady was reassured seeing that
her husband took the affair so quietly and that her daughter had had a
good night and was rested and had caught the nightingale so she kept
silence nor had they long to wait before ricciardo awoke and seeing
that twas broad day deemed that twas as much as his life was worth
and aroused caterina sayingalas my soul what shall we do now that
day has come and surprised me here which question messer lizio answered
by coming forward and sayingwe shall do well at sight of him
ricciardo felt as if his heart were torn out of his body and sate up in
the bed and saidmy lord i cry you mercy for gods sake i wot that
my disloyalty and delinquency have merited death wherefore deal with me
even as it may seem best to you however i pray you if so it may be to
spare my life that i die not ricciardo replied messer lizio the
love i bore thee and the faith i reposed in thee merited a better
return but still as so it is and youth has seduced thee into such a
transgression redeem thy life and preserve my honour by making
caterina thy lawful spouse that thine as she has been for this past
night she may remain for the rest of her life in this way thou mayst
secure my peace and thy safety otherwise commend thy soul to god
pending this colloquy caterina let go the nightingale and having
covered herself began with many a tear to implore her father to forgive
ricciardo and ricciardo to do as messer lizio required that thereby
they might securely count upon a long continuance of such nights of
delight but there needed not much supplication for what with remorse
for the wrong done and the wish to make amends and the fear of death
and the desire to escape it and above all ardent love and the craving
to possess the beloved one ricciardo lost no time in making frank avowal
of his readiness to do as messer lizio would have him wherefore messer
lizio having borrowed a ring from madonna giacomina ricciardo did there
and then in their presence wed caterina which done messer lizio and the
lady took their leave sayingnow rest ye a while for so perchance
twere better for you than if ye rose and so they left the young folks
who forthwith embraced and not having travelled more than six miles
during the night went two miles further before they rose and so
concluded their first day when they were risen ricciardo and messer
lizio discussed the matter with more formality and some days afterwards
ricciardo as was meet married the damsel anew in presence of their
friends and kinsfolk and brought her home with great pomp and
celebrated his nuptials with due dignity and splendour and so for many a
year thereafter he lived with her in peace and happiness and snared the
nightingales day and night to his hearts content
novel v

guidotto da cremona dies leaving a girl to giacomino da pavia she has
two lovers in faenza to wit giannole di severino and minghino di
mingole who fight about her she is discovered to be giannoles sister
and is given to minghino to wife

all the ladies laughed so heartily over the story of the nightingale
that even when filostrato had finished they could not control their
merriment however when the laughter was somewhat abated the queen
saidverily if thou didst yesterday afflict us today thou hast
tickled us to such purpose that none of us may justly complain of thee
then as the turn had now come round to neifile she bade her give them a
story and thus blithely neifile beganas filostrato went to romagna
for the matter of his discourse i too am fain to make a short journey
through the same country in what i am about to relate to you
i say then that there dwelt of yore in the city of fano two lombards
the one ycleped guidotto da cremona and the other giacomino da pavia men
advanced in life who being soldiers had spent the best part of their
youth in feats of arms now guidotto being at the point of death and
having no son or any friend or kinsman in whom he placed more trust than
in giacomino left him a girl of about ten years and all that he had in
the world and so having given him to know not a little of his affairs
he died about the same time the city of faenza which had long been at
war and in a most sorry plight began to recover some measure of
prosperity and thereupon liberty to return thither on honourable terms
was accorded to all that were so minded whither accordingly giacomino
who had dwelt there aforetime and liked the place returned with all his
goods and chattels taking with him the girl left him by guidotto whom
he loved and entreated as his daughter the girl grew up as beautiful a
maiden as was to be found in the city and no less debonair and modest
was she than fair wherefore she lacked not admirers but above all two
young men both very gallant and of equal merit the one giannole di
severino the other minghino di mingole affected her with so ardent a
passion that growing jealous they came to hate one another with an
inordinate hatred right gladly would each have espoused her she being
now fifteen years old but that his kinsmen forbade it wherefore seeing
that neither might have her in an honourable way each determined to
compass his end as best he might
now giacomino had in his house an ancient maid and a man by name
crivello a very pleasant and friendly sort of fellow with whom giannole
grew familiar and in due time confided to him all his love praying him
to further the attainment of his desire and promising to reward him
handsomely if he did so crivello made answerthou must know that
there is but one way in which i might be of service to thee in this
affair i might contrive that thou shouldst be where she is when
giacomino is gone off to supper but were i to presume to say aught to
her on thy behalf she would never listen to me this if it please thee
i promise to do for thee and will be as good as my word and then thou
canst do whatever thou mayst deem most expedient giannole said that he
asked no more and so twas arranged
meanwhile minghino on his part had made friends with the maid on whom he
had so wrought that she had carried several messages to the girl and had
gone far to kindle her to his love and furthermore had promised to
contrive that he should meet her when for any cause giacomino should be
from home in the evening and so it befell that no long time after these
parleys giacomino by crivellos management was to go sup at the house
of a friend and by preconcert between crivello and giannole upon signal
given giannole was to come to giacominos house and find the door open
the maid on her part witting nought of the understanding between
crivello and giannole let minghino know that giacomino would not sup at
home and bade him be near the house so that he might come and enter it
on sight of a signal from her the evening came neither of the lovers
knew aught of what the other was about but being suspicious of one
another they came to take possession each with his own company of armed
friends minghino while awaiting the signal rested with his company in
the house of one of his friends hard by the girls house giannole with
his company was posted a little farther off crivello and the maid when
giacomino was gone did each their endeavour to get the other out of the
way crivello said to the maidhow is it thou takest not thyself off
to bed but goest still hither and thither about the house and the maid
said to crivellonay but why goest thou not after thy master thou
hast supped what awaitest thou here and so neither being able to make
the other quit the post crivello the hour concerted with giannole being
come said to himselfwhat care i for her if she will not keep quiet
tis like to be the worse for her whereupon he gave the signal and hied
him to the door which he had no sooner opened than giannole entered
with two of his companions and finding the girl in the saloon laid
hands on her with intent to carry her off the girl struggled and
shrieked amain as did also the maid minghino fearing the noise hasted
to the spot with his companions and seeing that the girl was already
being borne across the threshold they drew their swords and cried out
in chorusah traitors that ye are ye are all dead men twill go
otherwise than ye think for what means this force which said they
fell upon them with their swords while the neighbours alarmed by the
noise came hurrying forth with lights and arms and protested that twas
an outrage and took minghinos part so after a prolonged struggle
minghino wrested the girl from giannole and set her again in giacominos
house nor were the combatants separated before the officers of the
governor of the city came up and arrested not a few of them among them
minghino and giannole and crivello whom they marched off to prison
however peace being restored and giacomino returned twas with no
little chagrin that he heard of the affair but finding upon
investigation that the girl was in no wise culpable he was somewhat
reassured and determined lest the like should again happen to bestow
the girl in marriage as soon as might be
on the morrow the kinsfolk of the two lovers having learned the truth of
the matter and knowing what evil might ensue to the captives if
giacomino should be minded to take the course which he reasonably might
came and gave him good words beseeching him to let the kindly feeling
the love which they believed he bore to them his suppliants count for
more with him than the wrong that the harebrained gallants had done him
and on their part and their own offering to make any amend that he might
require giacomino who had seen many things in his time and lacked not
sound sense made answer brieflygentlemen were i in my own country
as i am in yours i hold myself in such sort your friend that nought
would i do in this matter or in any other save what might be agreeable
to you besides which i have the more reason to consider your wishes
because tis against you yourselves that you have offended inasmuch as
this damsel whatever many folk may suppose is neither of cremona nor of
pavia but is of faenza albeit neither i nor she nor he from whom i had
her did ever wot whose daughter she was wherefore touching that you
ask of me i will even do just as you bid me the worthy men found it
passing strange that the girl should be of faenza and having thanked
giacomino for his handsome answer they besought him that he would be
pleased to tell them how she had come into his hands and how he knew
that she was of faenza to whom giacomino replied on this wisea
comrade and friend i had guidotto da cremona who being at the point of
death told me that when this city of faenza was taken by the emperor
frederic he and his comrades entering one of the houses during the
sack found there good store of booty and never a soul save this girl
who being two years old or thereabouts greeted him as father as he came
up the stairs wherefore he took pity on her and carried her with
whatever else was in the house away with him to fano where on his
deathbed he left her to me charging me in due time to bestow her in
marriage and give her all his goods and chattels by way of dowry but
albeit she is now of marriageable age i have not been able to provide
her with a husband to my mind though right glad should i be to do so
that nought like the event of yesterday may again befall me
now among the rest of those present was one guglielmo da medicina who
had been with guidotto on that occasion and knew well whose house it was
that guidotto had sacked and seeing the owner there among the rest he
went up to him and saiddost hear bernabuccio what giacomino says
ay answered bernabuccio and i gave the more heed thereto for that i
call to mind that during those disorders i lost a little daughter of just
the age that giacomino speaks of tis verily she then said
guglielmo for once when i was with guidotto i heard him describe what
house it was that he had sacked and i wist that twas thine wherefore
search thy memory if there be any sign by which thou thinkest to
recognize her and let her be examined that thou mayst be assured that
she is thy daughter so bernabuccio pondered a while and then
recollected that she ought to have a scar shewing like a tiny cross
above her left ear being where he had excised a tumour a little while
before that affair wherefore without delay he went up to giacomino who
was still there and besought him to let him go home with him and see the
damsel giacomino gladly did so and no sooner was the girl brought into
bernabuccios presence than as he beheld her twas as if he saw the
face of her mother who was still a beautiful woman however he would
not rest there but besought giacomino of his grace to permit him to lift
a lock or two of hair above her left ear whereto giacomino consented so
bernabuccio approached her where she stood somewhat shamefast and with
his right hand lifted her locks and seeing the cross wist that in very
truth she was his daughter and tenderly wept and embraced her albeit
she withstood him and then turning to giacomino he saidmy brother
the girl is my daughter twas my house that guidotto sacked and so
sudden was the assault that my wife her mother forgot her and we have
always hitherto supposed that my house being burned that same day she
perished in the flames catching his words and seeing that he was
advanced in years the girl inclined to believe him and impelled by some
occult instinct suffered his embraces and melting mingled her tears
with his bernabuccio forthwith sent for her mother and her sisters and
other kinswomen and her brothers and having shewn her to them all and
told the story after they had done her great cheer and embraced her a
thousand times to giacominos no small delight he brought her home with
him which coming to the ears of the governor of the city the worthy
man knowing that giannole whom he had in ward was bernabuccios son
and the girls brother made up his mind to deal leniently with giannole
wherefore he took upon himself the part of mediator in the affair and
having made peace between bernabuccio and giacomino and giannole and
minghino gave agnesasuch was the damsels nameto minghino to wife
to the great delight of all minghinos kinsfolk and set at liberty not
only giannole and minghino but crivello and the others their
confederates in the affair whereupon minghino with the blithest of
hearts wedded agnesa with all due pomp and circumstance and brought her
home where for many a year thereafter he lived with her in peace and
prosperity
novel vi

gianni di procida being found with a damsel that he loves and who had
been given to king frederic is bound with her to a stake so to be
burned he is recognized by ruggieri dell oria is delivered and
marries her

neifiles story with which the ladies were greatly delighted being
ended the queen called for one from pampinea who forthwith raised her
noble countenance and thus beganmighty indeed gracious ladies are
the forces of love and great are the labours and excessive and unthought
of the perils which they induce lovers to brave as is manifest enough by
what we have heard today and on other occasions howbeit i mean to shew
you the same once more by a story of an enamoured youth
hard by naples is the island of ischia in which there dwelt aforetime
with other young damsels one restituta by name daughter of one marin
bolgaro a gentleman of the island very fair was she and blithe of
heart and by a young gallant gianni by name of the neighbouring islet
of procida was beloved more dearly than life and in like measure
returned his love now not to mention his daily resort to ischia to see
her there were times not a few when gianni not being able to come by a
boat would swim across from procida by night that he might have sight
if of nought else at least of the walls of her house and while their
love burned thus fervently it so befell that one summers day as the
damsel was all alone on the seashore picking her way from rock to rock
detaching as she went shells from their beds with a knife she came to
a recess among the rocks where for the sake as well of the shade as of
the comfort afforded by a spring of most cool water that was there some
sicilian gallants that were come from naples had put in with their
felucca who having taken note of the damsel that she was very fair
and that she was not yet ware of them and was alone resolved to capture
her and carry her away nor did they fail to give effect to their
resolve but albeit she shrieked amain they laid hands on her and set
her aboard their boat and put to sea arrived at calabria they fell a
wrangling as to whose the damsel should be and in brief each claimed her
for his own wherefore finding no means of coming to an agreement and
fearing that worse might befall them and she bring misfortune upon them
they resolved with one accord to give her to frederic king of sicily
who was then a young man and took no small delight in commodities of
that quality and so being come to palermo they did
marking her beauty the king set great store by her but as she was
somewhat indisposed he commanded that till she was stronger she should
be lodged and tended in a very pretty villa that was in one of his
gardens which he called cuba and so twas done the purloining of the
damsel caused no small stir in ischia more especially because twas
impossible to discover by whom she had been carried off but gianni more
concerned than any other despairing of finding her in ischia and being
apprised of the course the felucca had taken equipped one himself and
put to sea and in hot haste scoured the whole coast from minerva to
scalea in calabria making everywhere diligent search for the damsel and
in scalea learned that she had been taken by sicilian mariners to
palermo whither accordingly he hied him with all speed and there
after long search discovering that she had been given to the king who
kept her at cuba he was sore troubled insomuch that he now scarce
ventured to hope that he should ever set eyes on her not to speak of
having her for his own again but still holden by love and seeing that
none there knew him he sent the felucca away and tarried there and
frequently passing by cuba he chanced one day to catch sight of her at a
window and was seen of her to their great mutual satisfaction and
gianni taking note that the place was lonely made up to her and had
such speech of her as he might and being taught by her after what
fashion he must proceed if he would have further speech of her he
departed but not till he had made himself thoroughly acquainted with the
configuration of the place and having waited until night was come and
indeed far spent he returned thither and though the ascent was such
that twould scarce have afforded lodgment to a woodpecker won his way
up and entered the garden where finding a pole he set it against the
window which the damsel had pointed out as hers and thereby swarmed up
easily enough
the damsel had aforetime shewn herself somewhat distant towards him
being careful of her honour but now deeming it already lost she had
bethought her that there was none to whom she might more worthily give
herself than to him and reckoning upon inducing him to carry her off
she had made up her mind to gratify his every desire and to that end had
left the window open that his ingress might be unimpeded so finding it
open gianni softly entered lay down beside the damsel who was awake
and before they went further opened to him all her mind beseeching him
most earnestly to take her thence and carry her off gianni replied that
there was nought that would give him so much pleasure and that without
fail upon leaving her he would make all needful arrangements for
bringing her away when he next came whereupon with exceeding great
delight they embraced one another and plucked that boon than which love
has no greater to bestow and having so done divers times they
unwittingly fell asleep in one anothers arms
now towards daybreak the king who had been greatly charmed with the
damsel at first sight happened to call her to mind and feeling himself
fit resolved notwithstanding the hour to go lie with her a while and
so attended by a few of his servants he hied him privily to cuba
having entered the house he passed the door being softly opened into
the room in which he knew the damsel slept a great blazing torch was
borne before him and so as he bent his glance on the bed he espied the
damsel and gianni lying asleep naked and in one anothers arms whereat
he was seized with a sudden and vehement passion of wrath insomuch that
albeit he said never a word he could scarce refrain from slaying both of
them there and then with a dagger that he had with him then bethinking
him that twere the depth of baseness in any mannot to say a kingto
slay two naked sleepers he mastered himself and determined to do them
to death in public and by fire wherefore turning to a single companion
that he had with him he saidwhat thinkest thou of this base woman
in whom i had placed my hope and then he asked whether he knew the
gallant that had presumed to enter his house to do him such outrage and
despite whereto the other replied that he minded not ever to have seen
him thereupon the king hied him out of the room in a rage and bade take
the two lovers naked as they were and bind them and as soon as twas
broad day bring them to palermo and bind them back to back to a stake
in the piazza there to remain until tierce that all might see them
after which they were to be burned as they had deserved and having so
ordered he went back to palermo and shut himself up in his room very
wroth
no sooner was he gone than there came unto the two lovers folk not a few
who having awakened them did forthwith ruthlessly take and bind them
whereat how they did grieve and tremble for their lives and weep and
bitterly bewail their fate may readily be understood
pursuant to the kings commandment they were brought to palermo and
bound to a stake in the piazza and before their eyes faggots and fire
were made ready to burn them at the hour appointed by the king great was
the concourse of the folk of palermo both men and women that came to
see the two lovers the men all agog to feast their eyes on the damsel
whom they lauded for shapeliness and loveliness and no less did the
women commend the gallant whom in like manner they crowded to see for
the same qualities meanwhile the two hapless lovers both exceeding
shamefast stood with bent heads bitterly bewailing their evil fortune
and momently expecting their death by the cruel fire so they awaited the
time appointed by the king but their offence being bruited abroad the
tidings reached the ears of ruggieri dell oria a man of peerless worth
and at that time the kings admiral who being likewise minded to see
them came to the place where they were bound and after gazing on the
damsel and finding her very fair turned to look at the gallant whom
with little trouble he recognized and drawing nearer to him he asked
him if he were gianni di procida gianni raised his head and recognizing
the admiral made answermy lord he of whom you speak i was but i
am now as good as no more the admiral then asked him what it was that
had brought him to such a pass whereuponlove and the kings wrath
quoth gianni the admiral induced him to be more explicit and having
learned from him exactly how it had come about was turning away when
gianni called him back sayingoh my lord if so it may be procure
me one favour of him by whose behest i thus stand here what favour
demanded ruggieri i see returned gianni that die i must and that
right soon i crave then as a favour that whereas this damsel and i
that have loved one another more dearly than life are here set back to
back we may be set face to face that i may have the consolation of
gazing on her face as i depart ruggieri laughed as he repliedwith
all my heart i will so order it that thou shalt see enough of her to
tire of her he then left him and charged the executioners to do nothing
more without further order of the king and being assured of their
obedience he hied him forthwith to the king to whom albeit he found
him in a wrathful mood he spared not to speak his mind sayingsire
wherein have they wronged thee those two young folk whom thou hast
ordered to be burned down there in the piazza the king told him
whereupon ruggieri continuedtheir offence does indeed merit such
punishment but not at thy hands and if misdeeds should not go
unpunished services should not go unrewarded nay may warrant
indulgence and mercy knowest thou who they are whom thou wouldst have
burned the king signified that he did not whereupon ruggieribut
i quoth he am minded that thou shouldst know them to the end that
thou mayst know with what discretion thou surrenderest thyself to a
transport of rage the young man is the son of landolfo di procida
brother of messer gianni di procida to whom thou owest it that thou art
lord and king of this island the damsel is a daughter of marin bolgaro
whose might alone today prevents ischia from throwing off thy yoke
moreover these young folk have long been lovers and tis for that the
might of love constrained them and not that they would do despite to thy
lordship that they have committed this offence if indeed tis meet to
call that an offence which young folk do for loves sake wherefore

novel vii

teodoro being enamoured of violante daughter of messer amerigo his
lord gets her with child and is sentenced to the gallows but while he
is being scourged thither he is recognized by his father and being set
at large takes violante to wife

while they doubted whether the two lovers would be burned the ladies
were all fear and suspense but when they heard of their deliverance
they all with one accord put on a cheerful countenance praising god the
story ended the queen ordained that the next should be told by lauretta
who blithely thus began
fairest ladies what time good king guglielmo ruled sicily there dwelt on
the island a gentleman messer amerigo abate da trapani by name who was
well provided as with other temporal goods so also with children for
which cause being in need of servants he took occasion of the appearance
in trapani waters of certain genoese corsairs from the levant who
scouring the coast of armenia had captured not a few boys to purchase
of them some of these youngsters supposing them to be turks among whom
albeit most shewed as mere shepherd boys there was one teodoro by
name whose less rustic mien seemed to betoken gentle blood who though
still treated as a slave was suffered to grow up in the house with
messer amerigos children and nature getting the better of
circumstance bore himself with such grace and dignity that messer
amerigo gladly gave him his freedom and still deeming him to be a turk
had him baptized and named pietro and made him his majordomo and placed
much trust in him now among the other children that grew up in messer
amerigos house was his fair and dainty daughter violante and as her
father was in no hurry to give her in marriage it so befell that she
became enamoured of pietro but for all her love and the great conceit
she had of his qualities and conduct she nevertheless was too shamefast
to discover her passion to him however love spared her the pains for
pietro had cast many a furtive glance in her direction and had grown so
enamoured of her that twas never well with him except he saw her but
great was his fear lest any should detect his passion for he deemed
twould be the worse for him the damsel who was fain indeed of the
sight of him understood his case and to encourage him dissembled not
her exceeding great satisfaction on which footing they remained a great
while neither venturing to say aught to the other much as both longed
to do so but while they both burned with a mutual flame fortune as if
their entanglement were of her preordaining found means to banish the
fear and hesitation that kept them tonguetied
messer amerigo possessed a mile or so from trapani a goodly estate to
which he was wont not seldom to resort with his daughter and other ladies
by way of recreation and on one of these days while there they tarried
with pietro whom they had brought with them suddenly as will sometimes
happen in summer the sky became overcast with black clouds insomuch
that the lady and her companions lest the storm should surprise them
there set out on their return to trapani making all the haste they
might but pietro and the girl being young and sped perchance by love no
less than by fear of the storm completely outstripped her mother and the
other ladies and when they were gotten so far ahead as to be wellnigh
out of sight of the lady and all the rest the thunder burst upon them
peal upon peal hard upon which came a fall of hail very thick and close
from which the lady sought shelter in the house of a husbandman pietro
and the damsel finding no more convenient refuge betook them to an old
and all but ruinous and now deserted cottage which however still had
a bit of roof left whereunder they both took their stand in such close
quarters owing to the exiguity of the shelter that they perforce
touched one another which contact was the occasion that they gathered
somewhat more courage to disclose their love and so it was that pietro
began on this wisenow would to god that this hail might never cease
that so i might stay here for ever and well content were i returned
the damsel and by and by their hands met not without a tender pressure
and then they fell to embracing and so to kissing one another while the
hail continued and not to dwell on every detail the sky was not clear
before they had known the last degree of loves felicity and had taken
thought how they might secretly enjoy one another in the future the
cottage being close to the city gate they hied them thither as soon as
the storm was overpast and having there awaited the lady returned home
with her nor using all discretion did they fail thereafter to meet
from time to time in secret to their no small solace and the affair
went so far that the damsel conceived whereby they were both not a
little disconcerted insomuch that the damsel employed many artifices to
arrest the course of nature but to no effect wherefore pietro being in
fear of his life saw nothing for it but flight and told her so
whereuponif thou leave me quoth she i shall certainly kill
myself much as he loved her pietro answerednay but my lady
wherefore wouldst thou have me tarry here thy pregnancy will discover
our offence thou wilt be readily forgiven but twill be my woeful lot
to bear the penalty of thy sin and mine pietro returned the damsel
too well will they wot of my offence but be sure that if thou confess
not none will ever wot of thine then quoth hesince thou givest me
this promise i will stay but mind thou keep it
the damsel who had done her best to keep her condition secret saw at
length by the increase of her bulk that twas impossible wherefore one
day most piteously bewailing herself she made her avowal to her mother
and besought her to shield her from the consequences distressed beyond
measure the lady chid her severely and then asked her how it had come
to pass the damsel to screen pietro invented a story by which she put
another complexion on the affair the lady believed her and that her
fall might not be discovered took her off to one of their estates
where the time of her delivery being come and she as women do in such
a case crying out for pain it so befell that messer amerigo whom the
lady expected not as indeed he was scarce ever wont to come there did
so having been out a hawking and passing by the chamber where the
damsel lay marvelled to hear her cries and forthwith entered and asked
what it meant on sight of whom the lady rose and sorrowfully gave him
her daughters version of what had befallen her but he less credulous
than his wife averred that it could not be true that she knew not by
whom she was pregnant and was minded to know the whole truth let the
damsel confess and she might regain his favour otherwise she must expect
no mercy and prepare for death
the lady did all she could to induce her husband to rest satisfied with
what she had told him but all to no purpose mad with rage he rushed
drawn sword in hand to his daughters bedside she pending the parley
having given birth to a boy and cried outdeclare whose this infant
is or forthwith thou diest overcome by fear of death the damsel broke
her promise to pietro and made a clean breast of all that had passed
between him and her whereat the knight grown fell with rage could
scarce refrain from slaying her however having given vent to his wrath
in such words as it dictated he remounted his horse and rode to trapani
and there before one messer currado the kings lieutenant laid
information of the wrong done him by pietro in consequence whereof
pietro who suspected nothing was forthwith taken and being put to the
torture confessed all some days later the lieutenant sentenced him to
be scourged through the city and then hanged by the neck and messer
amerigo being minded that one and the same hour should rid the earth of
the two lovers and their son for to have compassed pietros death was
not enough to appease his wrath mingled poison and wine in a goblet
and gave it to one of his servants with a drawn sword sayingget thee
with this gear to violante and tell her from me to make instant choice
of one of these two deaths either the poison or the steel else i will
have her burned as she deserves in view of all the citizens which
done thou wilt take the boy that she bore a few days ago and beat his
brains out against the wall and cast his body for a prey to the dogs
hearing the remorseless doom thus passed by the angry father upon both
his daughter and his grandson the servant prompt to do evil rather than
good hied him thence
now as pietro in execution of his sentence was being scourged to the
gallows by the serjeants twas so ordered by the leaders of the band
that he passed by an inn where were three noblemen of armenia sent by
the king of that country as ambassadors to rome to treat with the pope
of matters of the highest importance touching a crusade that was to be
who having there alighted to rest and recreate them for some days had
received not a few tokens of honour from the nobles of trapani and most
of all from messer amerigo hearing the tramp of pietros escort they
came to a window to see what was toward and one of them an aged man
and of great authority fineo by name looking hard at pietro who was
stripped from the waist up and had his hands bound behind his back
espied on his breast a great spot of scarlet not laid on by art but
wrought in the skin by operation of nature being such as the ladies here
call a rose which he no sooner saw than he was reminded of a son that
had been stolen from him by corsairs on the coast of lazistan some
fifteen years before nor had he since been able to hear tidings of him
and guessing the age of the poor wretch that was being scourged he set
it down as about what his sons would be were he living and what with
the mark and the age he began to suspect that twas even his son and
bethought him that if so he would scarce as yet have forgotten his name
or the speech of armenia wherefore as he was within earshot he called
to himteodoro at the word pietro raised his head whereupon fineo
speaking in armenian asked himwhence and whose son art thou the
serjeants that were leading him paused in deference to the great man
and so pietro answeredof armenia was i son of one fineo brought
hither by folk i wot not of when i was but a little child then fineo
witting that in very truth twas the boy that he had lost came down with
his companions weeping and all the serjeants making way he ran to
him and embraced him and doffing a mantle of richest texture that he
wore he prayed the captain of the band to be pleased to tarry there
until he should receive orders to go forward and was answered by the
captain that he would willingly so wait
fineo already knew for twas bruited everywhere the cause for which
pietro was being led to the gallows wherefore he straightway hied him
with his companions and their retinue to messer currado and said to
himsir this lad whom you are sending to the gallows like a slave
is freeborn and my son and is ready to take to wife her whom as tis
said he has deflowered so please you therefore delay the execution
until such time as it may be understood whether she be minded to have him
for husband lest should she be so minded you be found to have broken
the law messer currado marvelled to hear that pietro was fineos son
and not without shame albeit twas not his but fortunes fault
confessed that twas even as fineo said and having caused pietro to be
taken home with all speed and messer amerigo to be brought before him
told him the whole matter messer amerigo who supposed that by this time
his daughter and grandson must be dead was the saddest man in the world
to think that twas by his deed witting that were the damsel still
alive all might very easily be set right however he sent post haste to
his daughters abode revoking his orders if they were not yet carried
out the servant whom he had earlier despatched had laid the sword and
poison before the damsel and for that she was in no hurry to make her
choice was giving her foul words and endeavouring to constrain her
thereto when the messenger arrived but on hearing the injunction laid
upon him by his lord he desisted and went back and told him how things
stood whereupon messer amerigo much relieved hied him to fineo and
wellnigh weeping and excusing himself for what had befallen as best he
knew how craved his pardon and professed himself well content to give
teodoro so he were minded to have her his daughter to wife fineo
readily accepted his excuses and made answertis my will that my son
espouse your daughter and so he will not let thy sentence passed upon
him be carried out
so fineo and messer amerigo being agreed while teodoro still languished
in fear of death albeit he was glad at heart to have found his father
they questioned him of his will in regard of this matter
when he heard that if he would he might have violante to wife
teodoros delight was such that he seemed to leap from hell to paradise
and said that if twas agreeable to them all he should deem it the
greatest of favours so they sent to the damsel to learn her pleasure
who having heard how it had fared and was now like to fare with
teodoro albeit saddest of women she looked for nought but death began
at length to give some credence to their words and to recover heart a
little and answered that were she to follow the bent of her desire
nought that could happen would delight her more than to be teodoros
wife but nevertheless she would do as her father bade her
so all agreeing the damsel was espoused with all pomp and festal cheer
to the boundless delight of all the citizens and was comforted and
nurtured her little boy and in no long time waxed more beautiful than
ever before and her confinement being ended she presented herself
before fineo who was then about to quit rome on his homeward journey
and did him such reverence as is due to a father fineo mighty well
pleased to have so fair a daughterinlaw caused celebrate her nuptials
most bravely and gaily and received and did ever thereafter entreat
her as his daughter
and so he took her not many days after the festivities were ended with
his son and little grandson aboard a galley and brought them to
lazistan and there thenceforth the two lovers dwelt with him in easeful
and lifelong peace
novel viii

nastagio degli onesti loving a damsel of the traversari family by
lavish expenditure gains not her love at the instance of his kinsfolk he
hies him to chiassi where he sees a knight hunt a damsel and slay her
and cause her to be devoured by two dogs he bids his kinsfolk and the
lady that he loves to breakfast during the meal the said damsel is torn
in pieces before the eyes of the lady who fearing a like fate takes
nastagio to husband

lauretta was no sooner silent than thus at the queens behest began
filomenasweet ladies as in us pity has ever its meed of praise even
so divine justice suffers not our cruelty to escape severe chastisement
the which that i may shew you and thereby dispose you utterly to banish
that passion from your souls i am minded to tell you a story no less
touching than delightsome
in ravenna that most ancient city of romagna there dwelt of yore
noblemen and gentlemen not a few among whom was a young man nastagio
degli onesti by name who by the death of his father and one of his
uncles inherited immense wealth being without a wife nastagio as tis
the way with young men became enamoured of a daughter of messer paolo
traversaro a damsel of much higher birth than his whose love he hoped
to win by gifts and the like modes of courting which albeit they were
excellent and fair and commendable not only availed him not but seemed
rather to have the contrary effect so harsh and ruthless and unrelenting
did the beloved damsel shew herself towards him for whether it was her
uncommon beauty or her noble lineage that puffed her up so haughty and
disdainful was she grown that pleasure she had none either in him or in
aught that pleased him the burden of which disdain nastagio found so
hard to bear that many a time when he had made his moan he longed to
make away with himself however he refrained therefrom and many a time
resolved to give her up altogether or if so he might to hold her in
despite as she did him but twas all in vain for it seemed as if the
more his hope dwindled the greater grew his love and as thus he
continued loving and spending inordinately certain of his kinsfolk and
friends being apprehensive lest he should waste both himself and his
substance did many a time counsel and beseech him to depart ravenna and
go tarry for a time elsewhere that so he might at once cool his flame
and reduce his charges for a long while nastagio answered their
admonitions with banter but as they continued to ply him with them he
grew weary of saying no so often and promised obedience whereupon he
equipped himself as if for a journey to france or spain or other distant
parts got on horseback and sallied forth of ravenna accompanied by not
a few of his friends and being come to a place called chiassi about
three miles from ravenna he halted and having sent for tents and
pavilions told his companions that there he meant to stay and they
might go back to ravenna so nastagio pitched his camp and there
commenced to live after as fine and lordly a fashion as did ever any man
bidding divers of his friends from time to time to breakfast or sup with
him as he had been wont to do now it so befell that about the beginning
of may the season being very fine he fell a brooding on the cruelty of
his mistress and that his meditations might be the less disturbed he
bade all his servants leave him and sauntered slowly wrapt in thought
as far as the pinewood which he had threaded for a good halfmile when
the fifth hour of the day being wellnigh past yet he recking neither of
food nor of aught else twas as if he heard a woman wailing exceedingly
and uttering most piercing shrieks whereat the train of his sweet
melancholy being broken he raised his head to see what was toward and
wondered to find himself in the pinewood and saw moreover before him
running through a grove close set with underwood and brambles towards
the place where he was a damsel most comely stark naked her hair
dishevelled and her flesh all torn by the briers and brambles who wept
and cried piteously for mercy and at her flanks he saw two mastiffs
exceeding great and fierce that ran hard upon her track and not seldom
came up with her and bit her cruelly and in the rear he saw riding a
black horse a knight sadly accoutred and very wrathful of mien
carrying a rapier in his hand and with despiteful bloodcurdling words
threatening her with death whereat he was at once amazed and appalled
and then filled with compassion for the hapless lady whereof was bred a
desire to deliver her if so he might from such anguish and peril of
death wherefore as he was unarmed he ran and took in lieu of a cudgel
a branch of a tree with which he prepared to encounter the dogs and the
knight which the knight observing called to him before he was come to
close quarters sayinghold off nastagio leave the dogs and me alone
to deal with this vile woman as she has deserved and even as he spoke
the dogs gripped the damsel so hard on either flank that they arrested
her flight and the knight being come up dismounted whom nastagio
approached sayingi know not who thou art that knowest me so well
but thus much i tell thee tis a gross outrage for an armed knight to go
about to kill a naked woman and set his dogs upon her as if she were a
wild beast rest assured that i shall do all i can to protect her
whereuponnastagio replied the knight of the same city as thou was
i and thou wast yet a little lad when i messer guido degli anastagi by
name being far more enamoured of this damsel than thou art now of her of
the traversari was by her haughtiness and cruelty brought to so woeful a
pass that one day in a fit of despair i slew myself with this rapier
which thou seest in my hand for which cause i am condemned to the
eternal pains nor was it long after my death that she who exulted
therein over measure also died and for that she repented her not of her
cruelty and the joy she had of my sufferings for which she took not
blame to herself but merit was likewise condemned to the pains of hell
nor had she sooner made her descent than for her pain and mine twas
ordained that she should flee before me and that i who so loved her
should pursue her not as my beloved lady but as my mortal enemy and
so as often as i come up with her i slay her with this same rapier with
which i slew myself and having ripped her up by the back i take out
that hard and cold heart to which neither love nor pity had ever access
and therewith her other inward parts as thou shalt forthwith see and
cast them to these dogs to eat and in no long time as the just and
mighty god decrees she rises even as if she had not died and
recommences her dolorous flight i and the dogs pursuing her and it so
falls out that every friday about this hour i here come up with her and
slaughter her as thou shalt see but ween not that we rest on other days
for there are other places in which i overtake her places in which she
used or devised how she might use me cruelly on which wise changed as
thou seest from her lover into her foe i am to pursue her for years as
many as the months during which she shewed herself harsh to me wherefore
leave me to execute the decree of the divine justice and presume not to
oppose that which thou mayst not avail to withstand
affrighted by the knights words insomuch that there was scarce a hair
on his head but stood on end nastagio shrank back still gazing on the
hapless damsel and waited all a tremble to see what the knight would do
nor had he long to wait for the knight as soon as he had done speaking
sprang rapier in hand like a mad dog upon the damsel who kneeling
while the two mastiffs gripped her tightly cried him mercy but the
knight thrusting with all his force struck her between the breasts and
ran her clean through the body thus stricken the damsel fell forthwith
prone on the ground sobbing and shrieking whereupon the knight drew
forth a knife and having therewith opened her in the back took out the
heart and all the circumjacent parts and threw them to the two mastiffs
who being famished forthwith devoured them and in no long time the
damsel as if nought thereof had happened started to her feet and took
to flight towards the sea pursued and ever and anon bitten by the
dogs while the knight having gotten him to horse again followed them
as before rapier in hand and so fast sped they that they were quickly
lost to nastagios sight
long time he stood musing on what he had seen divided between pity and
terror and then it occurred to him that as this passed every friday it
might avail him not a little so having marked the place he rejoined
his servants and in due time thereafter sent for some of his kinsfolk
and friends and said to themtis now a long while that you urge me
to give up loving this lady that is no friend to me and therewith make
an end of my extravagant way of living and i am now ready so to do
provided you procure me one favour to wit that next friday messer paolo
traversaro and his wife and daughter and all the ladies their
kinswomen and as many other ladies as you may be pleased to bid come
hither to breakfast with me when you will see for yourselves the reason
why i so desire a small matter this seemed to them and so on their
return to ravenna they lost no time in conveying nastagios message to
his intended guests and albeit she was hardly persuaded yet in the end
the damsel that nastagio loved came with the rest
nastagio caused a lordly breakfast to be prepared and had the tables set
under the pines about the place where he had witnessed the slaughter of
the cruel lady and in ranging the ladies and gentlemen at table he so
ordered it that the damsel whom he loved was placed opposite the spot
where it should be enacted the last course was just served when the
despairing cries of the hunted damsel became audible to all to their no
small amazement and each asking and none knowing what it might import
up they all started intent to see what was toward and perceived the
suffering damsel and the knight and the dogs who in a trice were in
their midst they hollaed amain to dogs and knight and not a few
advanced to succour the damsel but the words of the knight which were
such as he had used to nastagio caused them to fall back
terrorstricken and lost in amazement and when the knight proceeded to
do as he had done before all the ladies that were there many of whom
were of kin to the suffering damsel and to the knight and called to mind
his love and death wept as bitterly as if twere their own case
when twas all over and the lady and the knight had disappeared the
strange scene set those that witnessed it pondering many and divers
matters but among them all none was so appalled as the cruel damsel that
nastagio loved who having clearly seen and heard all that had passed
and being ware that it touched her more nearly than any other by reason
of the harshness that she had ever shewn to nastagio seemed already to
be fleeing from her angered lover and to have the mastiffs on her
flanks and so great was her terror that lest a like fate should befall
her she converted her aversion into affection and as soon as occasion
served which was that very night sent a trusty chambermaid privily to
nastagio with a request that he would be pleased to come to her for that
she was ready in all respects to pleasure him to the full nastagio made
answer that he was greatly flattered but that he was minded with her
consent to have his pleasure of her in an honourable way to wit by
marrying her the damsel who knew that none but herself was to blame
that she was not already nastagios wife made answer that she consented
wherefore by her own mouth she acquainted her father and mother that she
agreed to marry nastagio and they heartily approving her choice
nastagio wedded her on the ensuing sunday and lived happily with her
many a year nor was it in her instance alone that this terror was
productive of good on the contrary it so wrought among the ladies of
ravenna that they all became and have ever since been much more
compliant with mens desires than they had been wont to be
novel ix

federigo degli alberighi loves and is not loved in return he wastes his
substance by lavishness until nought is left but a single falcon which
his lady being come to see him at his house he gives her to eat she
knowing his case changes her mind takes him to husband and makes him
rich

so ended filomena and the queen being ware that besides herself only
dioneo by virtue of his privilege was left to speak said with gladsome
mientis now for me to take up my parable which dearest ladies i
will do with a story like in some degree to the foregoing and that not
only that you may know how potent are your charms to sway the gentle
heart but that you may also learn how upon fitting occasions to make
bestowal of your guerdons of your own accord instead of always waiting
for the guidance of fortune which most times not wisely but without
rule or measure scatters her gifts
you are then to know that coppo di borghese domenichi a man that in our
day was and perchance still is had in respect and great reverence in
our city being not only by reason of his noble lineage but and yet
more for manners and merit most illustrious and worthy of eternal
renown was in his old age not seldom wont to amuse himself by
discoursing of things past with his neighbours and other folk wherein he
had not his match for accuracy and compass of memory and concinnity of
speech among other good stories he would tell how that there was of
yore in florence a gallant named federigo di messer filippo alberighi
who for feats of arms and courtesy had not his peer in tuscany who as
is the common lot of gentlemen became enamoured of a lady named monna
giovanna who in her day held rank among the fairest and most elegant
ladies of florence to gain whose love he jousted tilted gave
entertainments scattered largess and in short set no bounds to his
expenditure however the lady no less virtuous than fair cared not a
jot for what he did for her sake nor yet for him
spending thus greatly beyond his means and making nothing federigo
could hardly fail to come to lack and was at length reduced to such
poverty that he had nothing left but a little estate on the rents of
which he lived very straitly and a single falcon the best in the world
the estate was at campi and thither deeming it no longer possible for
him to live in the city as he desired he repaired more in love than
ever before and there in complete seclusion diverting himself with
hawking he bore his poverty as patiently as he might
now federigo being thus reduced to extreme poverty it so happened that
one day monna giovannas husband who was very rich fell ill and
seeing that he was nearing his end made his will whereby he left his
estate to his son who was now growing up and in the event of his death
without lawful heir named monna giovanna whom he dearly loved heir in
his stead and having made these dispositions he died
monna giovanna being thus left a widow did as our ladies are wont and
repaired in the summer to one of her estates in the country which lay
very near to that of federigo and so it befell that the urchin began to
make friends with federigo and to shew a fondness for hawks and dogs
and having seen federigos falcon fly not a few times took a singular
fancy to him and greatly longed to have him for his own but still did
not dare to ask him of federigo knowing that federigo prized him so
much so the matter stood when by chance the boy fell sick whereby the
mother was sore distressed for he was her only son and she loved him as
much as might be insomuch that all day long she was beside him and
ceased not to comfort him and again and again asked him if there were
aught that he wished for imploring him to say the word and if it might
by any means be had she would assuredly do her utmost to procure it for
him thus repeatedly exhorted the boy saidmother mine do but get me
federigos falcon and i doubt not i shall soon be well whereupon the
lady was silent a while bethinking her what she should do she knew that
federigo had long loved her and had never had so much as a single kind
look from her wherefore she said to herselfhow can i send or go to
beg of him this falcon which by what i hear is the best that ever flew
and moreover is his sole comfort and how could i be so unfeeling as to
seek to deprive a gentleman of the one solace that is now left him and
so albeit she very well knew that she might have the falcon for the
asking she was perplexed and knew not what to say and gave her son no
answer at length however the love she bore the boy carried the day
and she made up her mind for his contentment come what might not to
send but to go herself and fetch him the falcon sobe of good cheer
my son she said and doubt not thou wilt soon be well for i promise
thee that the very first thing that i shall do tomorrow morning will be
to go and fetch thee the falcon whereat the child was so pleased that
he began to mend that very day
on the morrow the lady as if for pleasure hied her with another lady to
federigos little house and asked to see him twas still as for some
days past no weather for hawking and federigo was in his garden busy
about some small matters which needed to be set right there when he
heard that monna giovanna was at the door asking to see him he was not
a little surprised and pleased and hied him to her with all speed as
soon as she saw him she came forward to meet him with womanly grace and
having received his respectful salutation said to himgood morrow
federigo and continuedi am come to requite thee for what thou hast
lost by loving me more than thou shouldst which compensation is this
that i and this lady that accompanies me will breakfast with thee without
ceremony this morning madam federigo replied with all humility i
mind not ever to have lost aught by loving you but rather to have been
so much profited that if i ever deserved well in aught twas to your
merit that i owed it and to the love that i bore you and of a surety
had i still as much to spend as i have spent in the past i should not
prize it so much as this visit you so frankly pay me come as you are to
one who can afford you but a sorry sort of hospitality which said with
some confusion he bade her welcome to his house and then led her into
his garden where having none else to present to her by way of
companion he saidmadam as there is none other here this good
woman wife of this husbandman will bear you company while i go to have
the table set now albeit his poverty was extreme yet he had not known
as yet how sore was the need to which his extravagance had reduced him
but this morning twas brought home to him for that he could find nought
wherewith to do honour to the lady for love of whom he had done the
honours of his house to men without number wherefore distressed beyond
measure and inwardly cursing his evil fortune he sped hither and
thither like one beside himself but never a coin found he nor yet aught
to pledge meanwhile it grew late and sorely he longed that the lady
might not leave his house altogether unhonoured and yet to crave help of
his own husbandman was more than his pride could brook in these
desperate straits his glance happened to fall on his brave falcon on his
perch in his little parlour and so as a last resource he took him and
finding him plump deemed that he would make a dish meet for such a lady
wherefore without thinking twice about it he wrung the birds neck and
caused his maid forthwith pluck him and set him on a spit and roast him
carefully and having still some spotless table linen he had the table
laid therewith and with a cheerful countenance hied him back to his lady
in the garden and told her that such breakfast as he could give her was
ready so the lady and her companion rose and came to table and there
with federigo who waited on them most faithfully ate the brave falcon
knowing not what they ate
when they were risen from table and had dallied a while in gay converse
with him the lady deemed it time to tell the reason of her visit
wherefore graciously addressing federigo thus began shefederigo by
what thou rememberest of thy past life and my virtue which perchance
thou hast deemed harshness and cruelty i doubt not thou must marvel at
my presumption when thou hearest the main purpose of my visit but if
thou hadst sons or hadst had them so that thou mightest know the full
force of the love that is borne them i should make no doubt that thou
wouldst hold me in part excused nor having a son may i for that thou
hast none claim exemption from the laws to which all other mothers are
subject and being thus bound to own their sway i must though fain
were i not and though tis neither meet nor right crave of thee that
which i know thou dost of all things and with justice prize most highly
seeing that this extremity of thy adverse fortune has left thee nought
else wherewith to delight divert and console thee which gift is no
other than thy falcon on which my boy has so set his heart that if i
bring him it not i fear lest he grow so much worse of the malady that he
has that thereby it may come to pass that i lose him and so not for
the love which thou dost bear me and which may nowise bind thee but for
that nobleness of temper whereof in courtesy more conspicuously than in
aught else thou hast given proof i implore thee that thou be pleased to
give me the bird that thereby i may say that i have kept my son alive
and thus made him for aye thy debtor
no sooner had federigo apprehended what the lady wanted than for grief
that twas not in his power to serve her because he had given her the
falcon to eat he fell a weeping in her presence before he could so much
as utter a word at first the lady supposed that twas only because he
was loath to part with the brave falcon that he wept and as good as made
up her mind that he would refuse her however she awaited with patience
federigos answer which was on this wisemadam since it pleased god
that i should set my affections upon you there have been matters not a
few in which to my sorrow i have deemed fortune adverse to me but they
have all been trifles in comparison of the trick that she now plays me
the which i shall never forgive her seeing that you are come here to my
poor house where while i was rich you deigned not to come and ask a
trifling favour of me which she has put it out of my power to grant how
tis so i will briefly tell you when i learned that you of your grace
were minded to breakfast with me having respect to your high dignity and
desert i deemed it due and seemly that in your honour i should regale
you to the best of my power with fare of a more excellent quality than
is commonly set before others and calling to mind the falcon which you
now ask of me and his excellence i judged him meet food for you and so
you have had him roasted on the trencher this morning and well indeed i
thought i had bestowed him but as now i see that you would fain have
had him in another guise so mortified am i that i am not able to serve
you that i doubt i shall never know peace of mind more in witness
whereof he had the feathers and feet and beak of the bird brought in and
laid before her
the first thing the lady did when she had heard federigos story and
seen the relics of the bird was to chide him that he had killed so fine
a falcon to furnish a woman with a breakfast after which the magnanimity
of her host which poverty had been and was powerless to impair elicited
no small share of inward commendation then frustrate of her hope of
possessing the falcon and doubting of her sons recovery she took her
leave with the heaviest of hearts and hied her back to the boy who
whether for fretting that he might not have the falcon or by the
unaided energy of his disorder departed this life not many days after
to the exceeding great grief of his mother for a while she would do
nought but weep and bitterly bewail herself but being still young and
left very wealthy she was often urged by her brothers to marry again
and though she would rather have not done so yet being importuned and
remembering federigos high desert and the magnificent generosity with
which he had finally killed his falcon to do her honour she said to her
brothersgladly with your consent would i remain a widow but if you
will not be satisfied except i take a husband rest assured that none
other will i ever take save federigo degli alberighi whereupon her
brothers derided her sayingfoolish woman what ist thou sayst how
shouldst thou want federigo who has not a thing in the world to whom
she answeredmy brothers well wot i that tis as you say but i had
rather have a man without wealth than wealth without a man the
brothers perceiving that her mind was made up and knowing federigo for
a good man and true poor though he was gave her to him with all her
wealth and so federigo being mated with such a wife and one that he
had so much loved and being very wealthy to boot lived happily keeping
more exact accounts to the end of his days
novel x

pietro di vinciolo goes from home to sup his wife brings a boy into the
house to bear her company pietro returns and she hides her gallant
under a hencoop pietro explains that in the house of ercolano with
whom he was to have supped there was discovered a young man bestowed
there by ercolanos wife the lady thereupon censures ercolanos wife
but unluckily an ass treads on the fingers of the boy that is hidden
under the hencoop so that he cries for pain pietro runs to the place
sees him and apprehends the trick played on him by his wife which
nevertheless he finally condones for that he is not himself free from
blame

when the queen had done speaking and all had praised god that he had
worthily rewarded federigo dioneo who never waited to be bidden thus
begani know not whether i am to term it a vice accidental and
superinduced by bad habits in us mortals or whether it be a fault seated
in nature that we are more prone to laugh at things dishonourable than
at good deeds and that more especially when they concern not ourselves
however as the sole scope of all my efforts has been and still shall be
to dispel your melancholy and in lieu thereof to minister to you
laughter and jollity therefore enamoured my damsels albeit the ensuing
story is not altogether free from matter that is scarce seemly yet as
it may afford you pleasure i shall not fail to relate it premonishing
you my hearers that you take it with the like discretion as when going
into your gardens you stretch forth your delicate hands and cull the
roses leaving the thorns alone which being interpreted means that you
will leave the caitiff husband to abide in sorry plight with his
dishonour and will gaily laugh at the amorous wiles or his wife and
commiserate her unfortunate gallant when occasion requires
tis no great while since there dwelt at perugia a rich man named pietro
di vinciolo who rather perchance to blind others and mitigate the evil
repute in which he was held by the citizens of perugia than for any
desire to wed took a wife and such being his motive fortune provided
him with just such a spouse as he merited for the wife of his choice was
a stout redhaired young woman and so hotblooded that two husbands
would have been more to her mind than one whereas one fell to her lot
that gave her only a subordinate place in his regard which she
perceiving while she knew herself to be fair and lusty and felt herself
to be gamesome and fit waxed very wroth and now and again had high
words with her husband and led but a sorry life with him at most times
then seeing that thereby she was more like to fret herself than to
dispose her husband to conduct less base she said to herselfthis poor
creature deserts me to go walk in pattens in the dry wherefore it shall
go hard but i will bring another aboard the ship for the wet weather i
married him and brought him a great and goodly dowry knowing that he
was a man and supposing him to have the desires which men have and ought
to have and had i not deemed him to be a man i should never have
married him he knew me to be a woman why then took he me to wife if
women were not to his mind tis not to be endured had i not been minded
to live in the world i had become a nun and being minded there to live
as i am if i am to wait until i have pleasure or solace of him i shall
wait perchance until i am old and then too late i shall bethink me to
my sorrow that i have wasted my youth and as to the way in which i
should seek its proper solace i need no better teacher and guide than
him who finds his delight where i should find mine and finds it to his
own condemnation whereas in me twere commendable tis but the laws
that i shall set at nought whereas he sets both them and nature herself
at nought
so the good lady reasoned and peradventure more than once and then
casting about how she might privily compass her end she made friends
with an old beldam that shewed as a veritable santa verdiana
fostermother of vipers who was ever to be seen going to pardonings with
a parcel of paternosters in her hand and talked of nothing but the lives
of the holy fathers and the wounds of st francis and was generally
reputed a saint to whom in due time she opened her whole mind my
daughter replied the beldam god who knows all things knows that
thou wilt do very rightly indeed were it for no other reason twould be
meet for thee and every other young woman so to do that the heyday of
youth be not wasted for there is no grief like that of knowing that it
has been wasted and what the devil are we women fit for when we are old
except to pore over the cinders on the hearth the which if any know and
may attest it tis i who now that i am old call to mind the time that
i let slip from me not without most sore and bitter and fruitless
regret and albeit twas not all wasted for i would not have thee think
that i was entirely without sense yet i did not make the best use of it
whereof when i bethink me and that i am now even as thou seest me such
a hag that never a spark of fire may i hope to get from any god knows
how i rue it now with men tis otherwise they are born meet for a
thousand uses not for this alone and the more part of them are of much
greater consequence in old age than in youth but women are fit for
nought but this and tis but for that they bear children that they are
cherished whereof if not otherwise thou mayst assure thyself if thou
do but consider that we are ever ready for it which is not the case with
men besides which one woman will tire out many men without being
herself tired out seeing then that tis for this we are born i tell
thee again that thou wilt do very rightly to give thy husband thy loaf
for his cake that in thy old age thy soul may have no cause of complaint
against thy flesh every one has just as much of this life as he
appropriates and this is especially true of women whom therefore it
behoves much more than men to seize the moment as it flies indeed as
thou mayst see for thyself when we grow old neither husband nor any
other man will spare us a glance but on the contrary they banish us to
the kitchen there to tell stories to the cat and to count the pots and
pans or worse they make rhymes about usto the damsel dainty bits
to the beldam aguefits and suchlike catches but to make no more
words about it i tell thee at once that there is no person in the world
to whom thou couldst open thy mind with more advantage than to me for
there is no gentleman so fine but i dare speak my mind to him nor any so
harsh and forbidding but i know well how to soften him and fashion him to
my will tell me only what thou wouldst have and leave the rest to me
but one word more i pray thee to have me in kindly remembrance for that
i am poor and thou shalt henceforth go shares with me in all my
indulgences and every paternoster that i say that god may make thereof
light and tapers for thy dead wherewith she ended
so the lady came to an understanding with the beldam that as soon as
she set eyes on a boy that often came along that street and of whom the
lady gave her a particular description she would know what she was to
do and thereupon the lady gave her a chunk of salt meat and bade her
godspeed the beldam before long smuggled into the ladys chamber the
boy of whom she had spoken and not long after another such being the
humour of the lady who standing in perpetual dread of her husband was
disposed in this particular to make the most of her opportunities and
one of these days her husband being to sup in the evening with a friend
named ercolano the lady bade the beldam bring her a boy as pretty and
dainty as was to be found in perugia and so the beldam forthwith did
but the lady and the boy being set at table to sup lo pietros voice
was heard at the door bidding open to him whereupon the lady gave
herself up for dead but being fain if she might to screen the boy and
knowing not where else to convey or conceal him bestowed him under a
hencoop that stood in a veranda hard by the chamber in which they were
supping and threw over it a sorry mattress that she had that day emptied
of its straw which done she hastened to open the door to her husband
saying to him as he enteredyou have gulped your supper mighty quickly
tonight whereto pietro repliedwe have not so much as tasted it
how so enquired the lady i will tell thee said pietro no sooner
were we set at table ercolano his wife and i than we heard a sneeze
close to us to which though twas repeated we paid no heed but as the
sneezer continued to sneeze a third a fourth a fifth and many another
time to boot we all began to wonder and ercolano who was somewhat out
of humour with his wife because she had kept us a long time at the door
before she opened it burst out in a sort of rage withwhat means
this who ist that thus sneezes and made off to a stair hard by
beneath which and close to its foot was a wooden closet of the sort
which when folk are furnishing their houses they commonly cause to be
placed there to stow things in upon occasion and as it seemed to him
that the sneezing proceeded thence he undid the wicket and no sooner
had he opened it than out flew never so strong a stench of brimstone
albeit we had already been saluted by a whiff of it and complained
thereof but had been put off by the lady withtis but that a while
ago i bleached my veils with brimstone having sprinkled it on a dish
that they might catch its fumes which dish i then placed under the
stair so that it still smells a little
however the door being now as i have said open and the smoke somewhat
less dense ercolano peering in espied the fellow that had sneezed and
who still kept sneezing being thereto constrained by the pungency of the
brimstone and for all he sneezed yet was he by this time so wellnigh
choked with the brimstone that he was like neither to sneeze nor to do
aught else again as soon as he caught sight of him ercolano bawled
outnow see i madam why it was that a while ago when we came here
we were kept waiting so long at the gate before twas opened but woe
betide me for the rest of my days if i pay you not out whereupon the
lady perceiving that her offence was discovered ventured no excuse but
fled from the table whither i know not ercolano ignoring his wifes
flight bade the sneezer again and again to come forth but he being by
this time fairly spent budged not an inch for aught that ercolano said
wherefore ercolano caught him by one of his feet and dragged him forth
and ran off for a knife with intent to kill him but i standing in fear
of the signory on my own account got up and would not suffer him to kill
the fellow or do him any hurt and for his better protection raised the
alarm whereby some of the neighbours came up and took the lad more dead
than alive and bore him off i know not whither however our supper
being thus rudely interrupted not only have not gulped it but i have
not so much as tasted it as i said before
her husbands story shewed his wife that there were other ladies as
knowing as she albeit misfortune might sometimes overtake them and
gladly would she have spoken out in defence of ercolanos wife but
thinking that by censuring anothers sin she would secure more scope
for her own she launched out on this wisefine doings indeed a right
virtuous and saintly lady she must be here is the loyalty of an honest
woman and one to whom i had lief have confessed so spiritual i deemed
her and the worst of it is that being no longer young she sets a rare
example to those that are so curses on the hour that she came into the
world curses upon her that she make not away with herself basest most
faithless of women that she must needs be the reproach of her sex the
opprobrium of all the ladies of this city to cast aside all regard for
her honour her marriage vow her reputation before the world and lost
to all sense of shame to scruple not to bring disgrace upon a man so
worthy a citizen so honourable a husband by whom she was so well
treated ay and upon herself to boot by my hope of salvation no mercy
should be shewn to such women they should pay the penalty with their
lives to the fire with them while they yet live and let them be burned
to ashes then calling to mind the lover that she had close at hand in
the hencoop she fell to coaxing pietro to get him to bed for the hour
grew late pietro who was more set on eating than sleeping only asked
whether there was aught he might have by way of supper supper
forsooth replied the lady ay of course tis our way to make much of
supper when thou art not at home as if i were ercolanos wife now
wherefore tarry longer go get thy nights rest twere far better for
thee
now so it was that some of pietros husbandmen had come to the house that
evening with divers things from the farm and had put up their asses in a
stable that adjoined the veranda but had neglected to water them and
one of the asses being exceeding thirsty got his head out of the halter
and broke loose from the stable and went about nosing everything if
haply he might come by water whereby he came upon the hencoop beneath
which was the boy who being constrained to stand on all fours had the
fingers of one hand somewhat protruding from under the hencoop and so
as luck or rather illluck would have it the ass trod on them whereat
being sorely hurt he set up a great howling much to the surprise of
pietro who perceived that twas within his house so forth he came and
hearing the boy still moaning and groaning for the ass still kept his
hoof hard down on the fingers called outwho is there and ran to
the hencoop and raised it and espied the fellow who besides the pain
that the crushing of his fingers by the asss hoof occasioned him
trembled in every limb for fear that pietro should do him a mischief he
was one that pietro had long been after for his foul purposes so pietro
recognizing him asked himwhat dost thou here the boy making no
answer save to beseech him for the love of god to do him no hurt pietro
continuedget up have no fear that i shall hurt thee but tell
mehow and for what cause comest thou to be here the boy then
confessed everything whereupon pietro as elated by the discovery as his
wife was distressed took him by the hand and led him into the room
where the lady in the extremity of terror awaited him and having seated
himself directly in front of her saidtwas but a moment ago that
thou didst curse ercolanos wife and averred that she ought to be
burned and that she was the reproach of your sex why saidst thou not
of thyself or if thou wast not minded to accuse thyself how hadst thou
the effrontery to censure her knowing that thou hadst done even as she
verily twas for no other reason than that ye are all fashioned thus and
study to cover your own misdeeds with the delinquencies of others would
that fire might fall from heaven and burn you all brood of iniquity that
ye are
the lady marking that in the first flush of his wrath he had given her
nothing worse than hard words and discerning as she thought that he
was secretly overjoyed to hold so beautiful a boy by the hand took heart
of grace and saidi doubt not indeed that thou wouldst be well pleased
that fire should fall from heaven and devour us all seeing that thou art
as fond of us as a dog is of the stick though by the holy rood thou wilt
be disappointed but i would fain have a little argument with thee to
know whereof thou complainest well indeed were it with me didst thou
but place me on an equality with ercolanos wife who is an old
sanctimonious hypocrite and has of him all that she wants and is
cherished by him as a wife should be but that is not my case for
granted that thou givest me garments and shoes to my mind thou knowest
how otherwise ill bested i am and how long it is since last thou didst
lie with me and far liefer had i go barefoot and in rags and have thy
benevolence abed than have all that i have and be treated as thou dost
treat me understand me pietro be reasonable consider that i am a
woman like other women with the like craving whereof if thou deny me
the gratification tis no blame to me that i seek it elsewhere and at
least i do thee so much honour as not forgather with stableboys or
scurvy knaves
pietro perceived that she was like to continue in this vein the whole
night wherefore indifferent as he was to her he saidnow madam no
more of this in the matter of which thou speakest i will content thee
but of thy great courtesy let us have something to eat by way of supper
for methinks the boy as well as i has not yet supped ay true
enough said the lady he has not supped for we were but just sitting
down to table to sup when beshrew thee thou madest thy appearance
go then said pietro get us some supper and by and by i will arrange
this affair in such a way that thou shalt have no more cause of
complaint the lady perceiving that her husband was now tranquil rose
and soon had the table laid again and spread with the supper which she
had ready and so they made a jolly meal of it the caitiff husband the
lady and the boy what after supper pietro devised for their mutual
satisfaction has slipped from my memory but so much as this i know that
on the morrow as he wended his way to the piazza the boy would have been
puzzled to say whether of the twain the wife or the husband had had
the most of his company during the night but this i would say to you
dear my ladies that whoso gives you tit why just give him tat and if
you cannot do it at once why bear it in mind until you can that even
as the ass gives so he may receive
dioneos story whereat the ladies laughed the less for shamefastness
rather than for disrelish being ended the queen taking note that the
term of her sovereignty was come rose to her feet and took off the
laurel wreath and set it graciously upon elisas head sayingmadam
tis now your turn to bear sway the dignity accepted elisa followed in
all respects the example of her predecessors she first conferred with
the seneschal and directed him how meetly to order all things during the
time of her sovereignty which done to the satisfaction of the
companyofttimes quoth she have we heard how with bright sallies
and ready retorts and sudden devices not a few have known how to repugn
with apt checks the bites of others or to avert imminent perils and
because tis an excellent argument and may be profitable i ordain that
tomorrow god helping us the following be the rule of our discourse to
wit that it be of such as by some sprightly sally have repulsed an
attack or by some ready retort or device have avoided loss peril or
scorn the rule being heartily approved by all the queen rose and
dismissed them till suppertime so the honourable company seeing the
queen risen rose all likewise and as their wont was betook them to
their diversions as to each seemed best but when the cicalas had hushed
their chirping all were mustered again for supper and having blithely
feasted they all addressed them to song and dance and the queen while
emilia led a dance called for a song from dioneo who at once came out
withmonna aldruda come perk up thy mood a piece of glad tidings i
bring thee whereat all the ladies fell a laughing and most of all the
queen who bade him give them no more of that but sing another quoth
dioneomadam had i a tabret i would singup with your smock
monna lapa oroh the greensward under the olive or perchance you
had liefer i should give youwoe is me the wave of the sea but no
tabret have i wherefore choose which of these others you will have
perchance you would likenow hie thee to us forth that so it may be
cut as may the fields about no returned the queen give us
another then said dioneo i will singmonna simona embarrel
embarrel why tis not the month of october1 now a plague upon
thee said the queen with a laugh give us a proper song wilt thou
for we will have none of these never fear madam replied dioneo
only say which you prefer i have more than a thousand songs by heart
perhaps you would likethis my little covert make i neer it overt
orgently gently husband mine ora hundred pounds were none too
high a price for me a cock to buy the queen now shewed some offence
though the other ladies laughed anda truce to thy jesting dioneo
said she and give us a proper song else thou mayst prove the quality
of my ire whereupon dioneo forthwith ceased his fooling and sang on
this wise
so ravishing a light
  doth from the fair eyes of my mistress move
  as keeps me slave to her and thee o love
a beam from those bright orbs did radiate
  that flame that through mine own eyes to my breast
  did whilom entrance gain
  thy majesty o love thy might how great
  they be twas her fair face did manifest
  whereon to brood still fain
  i felt thee take and chain
  each sense my soul enthralling on such wise
  that she alone henceforth evokes my sighs
wherefore o dear my lord myself i own
  thy slave and all obedience wait and yearn
  till thy might me console
  yet wot i not if it be throughly known
  how noble is the flame wherewith i burn
  my loyalty how whole
  to her that doth control
  evn in such sort my mind that shall i none
  nor would i peace receive save hers alone
and so i pray thee sweet my lord that thou
  give her to feel thy fire and shew her plain
  how grievous my disease
  this service deign to render for that now
  thou seest me waste for love and in the pain
  dissolve me by degrees
  and then the apt moment seize
  my cause to plead with her as is but due
  from thee to me who fain with thee would sue
when dioneos silence shewed that his song was ended the queen accorded
it no stinted meed of praise after which she caused not a few other
songs to be sung thus passed some part of the night and then the queen
taking note that its freshness had vanquished the heat of the day bade
all go rest them if they would till the morning
1 the song is evidently amoebean

endeth here the fifth day of the decameron beginneth the sixth wherein
under the rule of elisa discourse is had of such as by some sprightly
sally have repulsed an attack or by some ready retort or device have
avoided loss peril or scorn

still in mid heaven the moon had lost her radiance nor was any part of
our world unillumined by the fresh splendour of the dawn when the queen
being risen and having mustered her company they hied them gently
sauntering across the dewy mead some distance from the beautiful hill
conversing now of this now of the other matter canvassing the stories
their greater or less degree of beauty and laughing afresh at divers of
their incidents until the sun being now in his higher ascendant they
began to feel his heat and turning back by common consent retraced
their steps to the palace where the tables being already set and
fragrant herbs and fair flowers strewn all about they by the queens
command before it should grow hotter addressed themselves to their
meal so having blithely breakfasted they first of all sang some dainty
and jocund ditties and then as they were severally minded composed
them to sleep or sat them down to chess or dice while dioneo and
lauretta fell a singing of troilus and cressida
the hour of session being come they took their places at the queens
summons in their wonted order by the fountain but when the queen was
about to call for the first story that happened which had not happened
before to wit there being a great uproar in the kitchen among the maids
and men the sound thereof reached the ears of the queen and all the
company whereupon the queen called the seneschal and asked him who
bawled so loud and what was the occasion of the uproar the seneschal
made answer that twas some contention between licisca and tindaro but
the occasion he knew not having but just come to quiet them when he
received her summons the queen then bade him cause licisca and tindaro
to come thither forthwith so they came and the queen enquired of them
the cause of the uproar tindaro was about to make answer when licisca
who was somewhat advanced in years and disposed to give herself airs
and heated to the strife of words turned to tindaro and scowling upon
him saidunmannerly varlet that makest bold to speak before me leave
me to tell the story then turning to the queen she saidmadam
this fellow would fain instruct me as to sicofantes wife andneither
more or lessas if i had not known her wellwould have me believe that
the first night that sicofante lay with her twas by force and not
without effusion of blood that master yard made his way into dusky hill
which i deny averring that he met with no resistance but on the
contrary with a hearty welcome on the part of the garrison and such a
numskull is he as fondly to believe that the girls are so simple as to
let slip their opportunities while they wait on the caprice of father or
brothers who six times out of seven delay to marry them for three or
four years after they should ay ay indeed doubtless they were well
advised to tarry so long christs faith i should know the truth of what
i swear there is never a woman in my neighbourhood whose husband had her
virginity and well i know how many and what manner of tricks our married
dames play their husbands and yet this booby would fain teach me to know
women as if i were but born yesterday
while licisca thus spoke the ladies laughed till all their teeth were
ready to start from their heads six times at least the queen bade her be
silent but all in vain she halted not till she had said all that she
had a mind to when she had done the queen turned with a smile to dioneo
sayingthis is a question for thee to deal with dioneo so hold
thyself in readiness to give final judgment upon it when our stories are
ended madam replied dioneo forthwith i give judgment without more
ado i say that licisca is in the right i believe that tis even as she
says and that tindaro is a fool whereupon licisca burst out laughing
and turning to tindaronow did i not tell thee so quoth she begone
in gods name dost think to know more than i thou that art but a
sucking babe thank god i have not lived for nothing not i and had
not the queen sternly bade her be silent and make no more disturbance
unless she had a mind to be whipped and sent both her and tindaro back
to the kitchen the whole day would have been spent in nought but
listening to her so licisca and tindaro having withdrawn the queen
charged filomena to tell the first story and gaily thus filomena began
novel i

a knight offers to carry madonna oretta a horseback with a story but
tells it so ill that she prays him to dismount her

as stars are set for an ornament in the serene expanse of heaven and
likewise in springtime flowers and leafy shrubs in the green meadows so
damsels in the hour of rare and excellent discourse is wit with its
bright sallies which being brief are much more proper for ladies than
for men seeing that prolixity of speech where brevity is possible is
much less allowable to them but for whatever cause be it the sorry
quality of our understanding or some especial enmity that heaven bears
to our generation few ladies or none are left today that when occasion
prompts are able to meet it with apt speech ay or if aught of the kind
they hear can understand it aright to our common shame be it spoken
but as touching this matter enough has already been said by
pampinea1 i purpose not to enlarge thereon but that you may know
what excellence resides in speech apt for the occasion i am minded to
tell you after how courteous a fashion a lady imposed silence upon a
gentleman
tis no long time since there dwelt in our city a lady noble debonair
and of excellent discourse whom not a few of you may have seen or heard
of whose namefor such high qualities merit not oblivionwas madonna
oretta her husband being messer geri spina now this lady happening to
be as we are in the country moving from place to place for pleasure
with a company of ladies and gentlemen whom she had entertained the day
before at breakfast at her house and the place of their next sojourn
whither they were to go afoot being some considerable distance off one
of the gentlemen of the company said to hermadonna oretta so please
you i will carry you great part of the way a horseback with one of the
finest stories in the world indeed sir replied the lady i pray
you do so and i shall deem it the greatest of favours whereupon the
gentleman who perhaps was no better master of his weapon than of his
story began a tale which in itself was indeed excellent but which by
repeating the same word three four or six times and now and again
harking back and sayingi said not well and erring not seldom in
the names setting one in place of another he utterly spoiled besides
which his mode of delivery accorded very ill with the character of the
persons and incidents insomuch that madonna oretta as she listened did
oft sweat and was like to faint as if she were ill and at the point of
death and being at length able to bear no more of it witting that the
gentleman had got into a mess and was not like to get out of it she said
pleasantly to himsir this horse of yours trots too hard i pray you
be pleased to set me down the gentleman being perchance more quick of
apprehension than he was skilful in narration missed not the meaning of
her sally and took it in all good and gay humour so leaving unfinished
the tale which he had begun and so mishandled he addressed himself to
tell her other stories

cisti a baker by an apt speech gives messer geri spina to know that he
has by inadvertence asked that of him which he should not

all the ladies and the men alike having greatly commended madonna
orettas apt saying the queen bade pampinea follow suit and thus she
began
fair ladies i cannot myself determine whether nature or fortune be the
more at fault the one in furnishing a noble soul with a vile body or
the other in allotting a base occupation to a body endowed with a noble
soul whereof we may have seen an example among others in our
fellowcitizen cisti whom furnished though he was with a most lofty
soul fortune made a baker and verily i should curse nature and fortune
alike did i not know that nature is most discreet and that fortune
albeit the foolish imagine her blind has a thousand eyes for tis i
suppose that being wise above a little they do as mortals ofttimes do
who being uncertain as to their future provide against contingencies by
burying their most precious treasures in the basest places in their
houses as being the least likely to be suspected whence in the hour of
their greatest need they bring them forth the base place having kept
them more safe than the dainty chamber would have done and so these two
arbitresses of the world not seldom hide their most precious commodities
in the obscurity of the crafts that are reputed most base that thence
being brought to light they may shine with a brighter splendour whereof
how in a trifling matter cisti the baker gave proof restoring the eyes
of the mind to messer geri spina whom the story of his wife madonna
oretta has brought to my recollection i am minded to shew you in a
narrative which shall be of the briefest
i say then that pope boniface with whom messer geri spina stood very
high in favour and honour having sent divers of his courtiers to
florence as ambassadors to treat of certain matters of great moment and
they being lodged in messer geris house where he treated with them of
the said affairs of the pope twas for some reason or another the wont
of messer geri and the ambassadors of the pope to pass almost every
morning by santa maria ughi where cisti the baker had his bakehouse
and plied his craft in person now albeit fortune had allotted him a
very humble occupation she had nevertheless prospered him therein to
such a degree that he was grown most wealthy and without ever aspiring
to change it for another lived in most magnificent style having among
his other good things a cellar of the best wines white and red that
were to be found in florence or the country parts and marking messer
geri and the ambassadors of the pope pass every morning by his door he
bethought him that as twas very hot twould be a very courteous thing
to give them to drink of his good wine but comparing his rank with that
of messer geri he deemed it unseemly to presume to invite him and cast
about how he might lead messer geri to invite himself so wearing always
the whitest of doublets and a spotless apron that denoted rather the
miller than the baker he let bring every morning about the hour that
he expected messer geri and the ambassadors to pass by his door a
spickandspan bucket of fresh and cool spring water and a small
bolognese flagon of his good white wine and two beakers that shone like
silver so bright were they and there down he sat him as they came by
and after hawking once or twice fell a drinking his wine with such gusto
that twould have raised a thirst in a corpse which messer geri having
observed on two successive mornings said on the thirdwhat ist
cisti ist good whereupon cisti jumped up and answereday sir
good it is but in what degree i might by no means make you understand
unless you tasted it messer geri in whom either the heat of the
weather or unwonted fatigue or perchance the gusto with which he had
seen cisti drink had bred a thirst turned to the ambassadors and said
with a smilegentlemen twere well to test the quality of this worthy
mans wine it may be such that we shall not repent us and so in a body
they came up to where cisti stood who having caused a goodly bench to
be brought out of the bakehouse bade them be seated and to their
servants who were now coming forward to wash the beakers saidstand
back comrades and leave this office to me for i know as well how to
serve wine as to bake bread and expect not to taste a drop yourselves
which said he washed four fine new beakers with his own hands and
having sent for a small flagon of his good wine he heedfully filled the
beakers and presented them to messer geri and his companions who deemed
the wine the best that they had drunk for a great while so messer geri
having praised the wine not a little came there to drink every morning
with the ambassadors as long as they tarried with him
now when the ambassadors had received their conge and were about to
depart messer geri gave a grand banquet to which he bade some of the
most honourable of the citizens and also cisti who could by no means be
induced to come however messer geri bade one of his servants go fetch a
flask of cistis wine and serve half a beaker thereof to each guest at
the first course the servant somewhat offended perhaps that he had
not been suffered to taste any of the wine took with him a large flask
which cisti no sooner saw thanson quoth he messer geri does not
send thee to me and often as the servant affirmed that he did he could
get no other answer wherewith he was fain at last to return to messer
geri go get thee back said messer geri and tell him that i do send
thee to him and if he answers thee so again ask him to whom then i
send thee so the servant came back and saidcisti messer geri
does for sure send me to thee son answered cisti messer geri
does for sure not send thee to me to whom then said the servant
does he send me to arno returned cisti which being reported by the
servant to messer geri the eyes of his mind were straightway opened
andlet me see quoth he to the servant what flask it is thou
takest there and when he had seen itcisti says sooth he added
and having sharply chidden him he caused him take with him a suitable
flask which when cisti sawnow know i quoth he that tis indeed
messer geri that sends thee to me and blithely filled it and having
replenished the rundlet that same day with wine of the same quality he
had it carried with due care to messer geris house and followed after
himself where finding messer geri he saidi would not have you think
sir that i was appalled by the great flask your servant brought me this
morning twas but that i thought you had forgotten that which by my
little beakers i gave you to understand when you were with me of late
to wit that this is no table wine and so wished this morning to refresh
your memory now however being minded to keep the wine no longer i
have sent you all i have of it to be henceforth entirely at your
disposal messer geri set great store by cistis gift and thanked him
accordingly and ever made much of him and entreated him as his friend

monna nonna de pulci by a ready retort silences the scarce seemly
jesting of the bishop of florence

pampineas story ended and praise not a little bestowed on cisti alike
for his apt speech and for his handsome present the queen was pleased to
call forthwith for a story from lauretta who blithely thus began
debonair my ladies the excellency of wit and our lack thereof have
been noted with no small truth first by pampinea and after her by
filomena to which topic twere bootless to return wherefore to that
which has been said touching the nature of wit i purpose but to add one
word to remind you that its bite should be as a sheeps bite and not as
a dogs for if it bite like a dog tis no longer wit but discourtesy
with which maxim the words of madonna oretta and the apt reply of cisti
accorded excellently true indeed it is that if tis by way of retort
and one that has received a dogs bite gives the biter a like bite in
return it does not seem to be reprehensible as otherwise it would have
been wherefore one must consider how and when and on whom and likewise
where one exercises ones wit by ill observing which matters one of our
prelates did once upon a time receive no less shrewd a bite than he gave
as i will shew you in a short story
while messer antonio dorso a prelate both worthy and wise was bishop
of florence there came thither a catalan gentleman messer dego della
ratta by name being king rubertos marshal now dego being very goodly
of person and inordinately fond of women it so befell that of the
ladies of florence she that he regarded with especial favour was the very
beautiful niece of a brother of the said bishop and having learned that
her husband though of good family was but a caitiff and avaricious in
the last degree he struck a bargain with him that he should lie one
night with the lady for five hundred florins of gold whereupon he had
the same number of popolins1 of silver which were then current
gilded and having lain with the lady albeit against her will gave them
to her husband which coming to be generally known the caitiff husband
was left with the loss and the laugh against him and the bishop like a
wise man feigned to know nought of the affair and so the bishop and the
marshal being much together it befell that on st johns day as they
rode side by side down the street whence they start to run the palio2
and took note of the ladies the bishop espied a young gentlewoman whom
this present pestilence has reft from us monna nonna de pulci by name
a cousin of messer alesso rinucci whom you all must know whom for that
she was lusty and fair and of excellent discourse and a good courage
and but just settled with her husband in porta san piero the bishop
presented to the marshal and then being close beside her he laid his
hand on the marshals shoulder and said to hernonna what thinkest
thou of this gentleman that thou mightst make a conquest of him which
words the lady resented as a jibe at her honour and like to tarnish it
in the eyes of those who were not a few in whose hearing they were
spoken wherefore without bestowing a thought upon the vindication of her
honour but being minded to return blow for blow she retorted
hastilyperchance sir he might not make a conquest of me but if he
did so i should want good money the answer stung both the marshal and
the bishop to the quick the one as contriver of the scurvy trick played
upon the bishops brother in regard of his niece the other as thereby
outraged in the person of his brothers niece insomuch that they dared
not look one another in the face but took themselves off in shame and
silence and said never a word more to her that day
in such a case then the lady having received a bite twas allowable in
her wittily to return it

chichibio cook to currado gianfigliazzi owes his safety to a ready
answer whereby he converts currados wrath into laughter and evades the
evil fate with which currado had threatened him

lauretta being now silent all lauded nonna to the skies after which
neifile received the queens command to follow suit and thus began
albeit loving ladies ready wit not seldom ministers words apt and
excellent and congruous with the circumstances of the speakers tis also
true that fortune at times comes to the aid of the timid and
unexpectedly sets words upon the tongue which in a quiet hour the
speaker could never have found for himself the which tis my purpose to
shew you by my story
currado gianfigliazzi as the eyes and ears of each of you may bear
witness has ever been a noble citizen of our city openhanded and
magnificent and one that lived as a gentleman should with hounds and
hawks in which to say nothing at present of more important matters he
found unfailing delight now having one day hard by peretola despatched
a crane with one of his falcons finding it young and plump he sent it
to his excellent cook a venetian chichibio by name bidding him roast
it for supper and make a dainty dish of it chichibio who looked as he
was a very greenhead had dressed the crane and set it to the fire and
was cooking it carefully when the bird being all but roasted and the
fumes of the cooking very strong it so chanced that a girl brunetta by
name that lived in the same street and of whom chichibio was greatly
enamoured came into the kitchen and perceiving the smell and seeing the
bird began coaxing chichibio to give her a thigh by way of answer
chichibio fell a singingyou get it not from me madam brunetta you
get it not from me whereat madam brunetta was offended and said to
himby god if thou givest it me not thou shalt never have aught from
me to pleasure thee in short there was not a little altercation and in
the end chichibio fain not to vex his mistress cut off one of the
cranes thighs and gave it to her so the bird was set before currado
and some strangers that he had at table with him and currado observing
that it had but one thigh was surprised and sent for chichibio and
demanded of him what was become of the missing thigh whereto the
mendacious venetian answered readilythe crane sir has but one thigh
and one leg what the devil rejoined currado in a rage so the crane
has but one thigh and one leg thinkst thou i never saw crane before
this but chichibio continuedtis even so as i say sir and so
please you i will shew you that so it is in the living bird currado
had too much respect for his guests to pursue the topic he only
saidsince thou promisest to shew me in the living bird what i have
never seen or heard tell of i bid thee do so tomorrow and i shall be
satisfied but if thou fail i swear to thee by the body of christ that i
will serve thee so that thou shalt ruefully remember my name for the rest
of thy days
no more was said of the matter that evening but on the morrow at
daybreak currado who had by no means slept off his wrath got up still
swelling therewith and ordered his horses mounted chichibio on a
hackney and saying to himwe shall soon see which of us lied
yesternight thou or i set off with him for a place where there was
much water beside which there were always cranes to be seen about dawn
chichibio observing that currados ire was unabated and knowing not how
to bolster up his lie rode by currados side in a state of the utmost
trepidation and would gladly had he been able have taken to flight
but as he might not he glanced now ahead now aback now aside and
saw everywhere nought but cranes standing on two feet however as they
approached the river the very first thing they saw upon the bank was a
round dozen of cranes standing each and all on one foot as is their
wont when asleep which chichibio presently pointed out to currado
sayingnow may you see well enough sir that tis true as i said
yesternight that the crane has but one thigh and one leg mark but how
they stand over there whereupon curradowait quoth he and i will
shew thee that they have each thighs and legs twain so having drawn a
little nigher to them he ejaculated oho which caused the cranes to
bring each the other foot to the ground and after hopping a step or
two to take to flight currado then turned to chichibio sayinghow
now rogue art satisfied that the bird has thighs and legs twain
whereto chichibio all but beside himself with fear made answeray
sir but you cried not oho to our crane of yestereve had you done so
it would have popped its other thigh and foot forth as these have done
which answer currado so much relished that all his wrath changed to
jollity and laughterchichibio quoth he thou art right indeed i
ought to have so done
thus did chichibio by his ready and jocund retort arrest impending evil
and make his peace with his master

messer forese da rabatta and master giotto the painter journeying
together from mugello deride one anothers scurvy appearance

neifile being silent and the ladies having made very merry over
chichibios retort pamfilo at the queens command thus spokedearest
ladies if fortune as pampinea has shewn us does sometimes bide
treasures most rich of native worth in the obscurity of base occupations
so in like manner tis not seldom found that nature has enshrined
prodigies of wit in the most ignoble of human forms whereof a notable
example is afforded by two of our citizens of whom i purpose for a brief
while to discourse the one messer forese da rabatta by name was short
and deformed of person and withal flatcheeked and flatnosed insomuch
that never a baroncio1 had a visage so misshapen but his would have
shewed as hideous beside it yet so conversant was this man with the
laws that by not a few of those well able to form an opinion he was
reputed a veritable storehouse of civil jurisprudence the other whose
name was giotto was of so excellent a wit that let nature mother of
all operant ever by continual revolution of the heavens fashion what
she would he with his style and pen and pencil would depict its like on
such wise that it shewed not as its like but rather as the thing itself
insomuch that the visual sense of men did often err in regard thereof
mistaking for real that which was but painted wherefore having brought
back to light that art which had for many ages lain buried beneath the
blunders of those who painted rather to delight the eyes of the ignorant
than to satisfy the intelligence of the wise he may deservedly be called
one of the lights that compose the glory of florence and the more so
the more lowly was the spirit in which he won that glory who albeit he
was while he yet lived the master of others yet did ever refuse to be
called their master and this title that he rejected adorned him with a
lustre the more splendid in proportion to the avidity with which it was
usurped by those who were less knowing than he or were his pupils but
for all the exceeding greatness of his art yet in no particular had he
the advantage of messer forese either in form or in feature but to come
to the storytwas in mugello that messer forese as likewise giotto
had his countryseat whence returning from a sojourn that he had made
there during the summer vacation of the courts and being as it chanced
mounted on a poor jade of a draught horse he fell in with the said
giotto who was also on his way back to florence after a like sojourn on
his own estate and was neither better mounted nor in any other wise
better equipped than messer forese and so being both old men they
jogged on together at a slow pace and being surprised by a sudden
shower such as we frequently see fall in summer they presently sought
shelter in the house of a husbandman that was known to each of them and
was their friend but after a while as the rain gave no sign of ceasing
and they had a mind to be at florence that same day they borrowed of the
husbandman two old cloaks of romagnole cloth and two hats much the worse
for age there being no better to be had and resumed their journey
whereon they had not proceeded far when taking note that they were
soaked through and through and liberally splashed with the mud cast up
by their nags hooves circumstances which are not of a kind to add to
ones dignity they after long silence the sky beginning to brighten a
little began to converse and messer forese as he rode and hearkened to
giotto who was an excellent talker surveyed him sideways and from head
to foot and all over and seeing him in all points in so sorry and
scurvy a trim and recking nought of his own appearance broke into a
laugh and saidgiotto would eer a stranger that met us and had not
seen thee before believe thinkst thou that thou wert as thou art
the greatest painter in the world whereto giotto answered
promptlymethinks sir he might if scanning you he gave you credit
for knowing the a b c which hearing messer forese recognized his
error and perceived that he had gotten as good as he brought

michele scalza proves to certain young men that the baronci are the best
gentlemen in the world and the maremma and wins a supper

the ladies were still laughing over giottos ready retort when the queen
charged fiammetta to follow suit wherefore thus fiammetta
beganpamfilos mention of the baronci who to you damsels are
perchance not so well known as to him has brought to my mind a story in
which tis shewn how great is their nobility and for that it involves
no deviation from our rule of discourse i am minded to tell it you
tis no long time since there dwelt in our city a young man michele
scalza by name the pleasantest and merriest fellow in the world and the
best furnished with quaint stories for which reason the florentine youth
set great store on having him with them when they forgathered in company
now it so befell that one day he being with a party of them at mont
ughi they fell a disputing together on this wise to wit who were the
best gentlemen and of the longest descent in florence one said the
uberti another the lamberti or some other family according to the
predilection of the speaker whereat scalza began to smile and
saidnow out upon you out upon you blockheads that ye are ye know
not what ye say the best gentlemen and of longest descent in all the
world and the maremma let alone florence are the baronci by the common
consent of all phisopholers1 and all that know them as i do and lest
you should otherwise conceive me i say that tis of your neighbours the
baronci2 of santa maria maggiore that i speak whereupon the young
men who had looked for somewhat else from him said derisivelythou
dost but jest with us as if we did not know the baronci as well as
thou quoth scalzaby the gospels i jest not but speak sooth and if
there is any of you will wager a supper to be given to the winner and six
good fellows whom he shall choose i will gladly do the like andwhat
is morei will abide by the decision of such one of you as you may
choose then said one of them whose name was neri manninii am ready
to adventure this supper and so they agreed together that piero di
fiorentino in whose house they were should be judge and hied them to
him followed by all the rest eager to see scalza lose and triumph in
his discomfiture and told piero all that had been said piero who was a
young man of sound sense heard what neri had to say and then turning to
scalzaand how quoth he mayst thou make good what thou averrest
i will demonstrate it returned scalza by reasoning so cogent that
not only you but he that denies it shall acknowledge that i say sooth
you know and so they were saying but now that the longer mens descent
the better is their gentility and i say that the baronci are of longer
descent and thus better gentlemen than any other men if then i prove
to you that they are of longer descent than any other men without a
doubt the victory in this dispute will rest with me now you must know
that when god made the baronci he was but a novice in his art of which
when he made the rest of mankind he was already master and to assure
yourself that herein i say sooth you have but to consider the baronci
how they differ from the rest of mankind who all have faces well
composed and duly proportioned whereas of the baronci you will see one
with a face very long and narrow another with a face inordinately broad
one with a very long nose another with a short one one with a
protruding and upturned chin and great jaws like an asss and again
there will be one that has one eye larger than its fellow or set on a
lower plane so that their faces resemble those that children make when
they begin to learn to draw whereby as i said tis plainly manifest
that when god made them he was but novice in his art and so they are
of longer descent than the rest of mankind and by consequence better
gentlemen by which entertaining argument piero the judge and neri who
had wagered the supper and all the rest calling to mind the baroncis
ugliness were so tickled that they fell a laughing and averred that
scalza was in the right and that he had won the wager and that without
a doubt the baronci were the best gentlemen and of the longest descent
not merely in florence but in the world and the maremma to boot
wherefore twas not without reason that pamfilo being minded to declare
messer foreses illfavouredness said that he would have been hideous
beside a baroncio

madonna filippa being found by her husband with her lover is cited
before the court and by a ready and jocund answer acquits herself and
brings about an alteration of the statute

fiammetta had been silent some time but scalzas novel argument to prove
the preeminent nobility of the baronci kept all still laughing when the
queen called for a story from filostrato who thus begannoble ladies
an excellent thing is apt speech on all occasions but to be proficient
therein i deem then most excellent when the occasion does most
imperatively demand it as was the case with a gentlewoman of whom i
purpose to speak to you who not only ministered gaiety and merriment to
her hearers but extricated herself as you shall hear from the toils of
an ignominious death
there was aforetime in the city of prato a statute no less censurable
than harsh which making no distinction between the wife whom her
husband took in adultery with her lover and the woman found pleasuring a
stranger for money condemned both alike to be burned while this statute
was in force it befell that a gentlewoman fair and beyond measure
enamoured madonna filippa by name was by her husband rinaldo de
pugliesi found in her own chamber one night in the arms of lazzarino de
guazzagliotri a handsome young noble of the same city whom she loved
even as herself whereat rinaldo very wroth scarce refrained from
falling upon them and killing them on the spot and indeed but that he
doubted how he should afterwards fare himself he had given way to the
vehemence of his anger and so done nor though he so far mastered
himself could he forbear recourse to the statute thereby to compass
that which he might not otherwise lawfully compass to wit the death of
his lady wherefore having all the evidence needful to prove her guilt
he took no further counsel but as soon as twas day he charged the
lady and had her summoned like most ladies that are veritably enamoured
the lady was of a high courage and though not a few of her friends and
kinsfolk sought to dissuade her she resolved to appear to the summons
having liefer die bravely confessing the truth than basely flee and for
defiance of the law live in exile and shew herself unworthy of such a
lover as had had her in his arms that night and so attended by many
ladies and gentlemen who all exhorted her to deny the charge she came
before the podesta and with a composed air and unfaltering voice asked
whereof he would interrogate her the podesta surveying her and taking
note of her extraordinary beauty and exquisite manners and the high
courage that her words evinced was touched with compassion for her
fearing she might make some admission by reason whereof to save his
honour he must needs do her to death but still as he could not refrain
from examining her of that which was laid to her charge he
saidmadam here as you see is your husband rinaldo who prefers a
charge against you alleging that he has taken you in adultery and so he
demands that pursuant to a statute which is in force here i punish you
with death but this i may not do except you confess wherefore be very
careful what you answer and tell me if what your husband alleges against
you be true the lady no wise dismayed and in a tone not a little
jocund thus made answertrue it is sir that rinaldo is my husband
and that last night he found me in the arms of lazzarino in whose arms
for the wholehearted love that i bear him i have ofttimes lain nor
shall i ever deny it but as well i wot you know the laws ought to be
common and enacted with the common consent of all that they affect which
conditions are wanting to this law inasmuch as it binds only us poor
women in whom to be liberal is much less reprehensible than it were in
men and furthermore the consent of no woman wasi say not had butso
much as asked before twas made for which reasons it justly deserves to
be called a bad law however if in scathe of my body and your own soul
you are minded to put it in force tis your affair but i pray you go
not on to try this matter in any wise until you have granted me this
trifling grace to wit to ask my husband if i ever gainsaid him but did
not rather accord him when and so often as he craved it complete
enjoyment of myself whereto rinaldo without awaiting the podestas
question forthwith answered that assuredly the lady had ever granted
him all that he had asked of her for his gratification then promptly
continued the lady if he has ever had of me as much as sufficed for his
solace what was i or am i to do with the surplus am i to cast it to the
dogs is it not much better to bestow it on a gentleman that loves me
more dearly than himself than to suffer it to come to nought or worse
which jocund question being heard by wellnigh all the folk of prato who
had flocked thither all agog to see a dame so fair and of such quality on
her trial for such an offence they laughed loud and long and then all
with one accord and as with one voice exclaimed that the lady was in
the right and said well nor left they the court until in concert with
the podesta they had so altered the harsh statute as that thenceforth
only such women as should wrong their husbands for money should be within
its purview
wherefore rinaldo left the court discomfited of his foolish enterprise
and the lady blithe and free as if rendered back to life from the
burning went home triumphant

the queen perceiving that emilia had finished her story and that none
but she and he who had the privilege of speaking last now remained to
tell began on this wisealbeit debonair my ladies you have
forestalled me today of more than two of the stories of which i had
thought to tell one yet one is still left me to recount which carries
at the close of it a quip of such a sort that perhaps we have as yet
heard nought so pregnant
you are to know then that in former times there obtained in our city
customs excellent and commendable not a few whereof today not one is
left to us thanks to the greed which growing with the wealth of our
folk has banished them all from among us one of which customs was that
in divers quarters of florence the gentlemen that there resided would
assemble together in companies of a limited number taking care to
include therein only such as might conveniently bear the expenses and
today one another tomorrow each in his turn for a day would
entertain the rest of the company and so they would not seldom do honour
to gentlemen from distant parts when they visited the city and also to
their fellowcitizens and in like manner they would meet together at
least once a year all in the same trim and on the most notable days
would ride together through the city and now and again they would tilt
together more especially on the greater feasts or when the city was
rejoiced by tidings of victory or some other glad event among which
companies was one of which messer betto brunelleschi was the leading
spirit into which messer betto and his comrades had striven hard to
bring guido son of cavalcante de cavalcanti and not without reason
inasmuch as besides being one of the best logicians in the world and an
excellent natural philosopher qualities of which the company made no
great account he was without a peer for gallantry and courtesy and
excellence of discourse and aptitude for all matters which he might set
his mind to and that belonged to a gentleman and therewithal he was
very rich and when he deemed any worthy of honour knew how to bestow
it to the uttermost but as messer betto had never been able to gain him
over he and his comrades supposed that twas because guido being
addicted to speculation was thereby estranged from men and for that he
was somewhat inclined to the opinion of the epicureans the vulgar
averred that these speculations of his had no other scope than to prove
that god did not exist now one day it so befell that guido being come
as was not seldom his wont from or san michele by the corso degli
adimari as far as san giovanni around which were then the great tombs of
marble that are today in santa reparata besides other tombs not a few
and guido being between the columns of porphyry that are there and the
tombs and the door of san giovanni which was locked messer betto and
his company came riding on to the piazza of santa reparata and seeing
him among the tombs saidgo we and flout him so they set spurs to
their horses and making a mock onset were upon him almost before he saw
them whereuponguido they began thou wilt be none of our company
but lo now when thou hast proved that god does not exist what wilt
thou have achieved guido seeing that he was surrounded presently
answeredgentlemen you may say to me what you please in your own
house thereupon he laid his hand on one of the great tombs and being
very nimble vaulted over it and so evaded them and went his way while
they remained gazing in one anothers faces and some said that he had
taken leave of his wits and that his answer was but nought seeing that
the ground on which they stood was common to them with the rest of the
citizens and among them guido himself but messer betto turning to
themnay but quoth he tis ye that have taken leave of your wits
if ye have not understood him for meetly and in few words he has given
us never so shrewd a reprimand seeing that if you consider it well
these tombs are the houses of the dead that are laid and tarry therein
which he calls our house to shew us that we and all other simple
unlettered men are in comparison of him and the rest of the learned in
sorrier case than dead men and so being here we are in our own house
then none was there but understood guidos meaning and was abashed
insomuch that they flouted him no more and thenceforth reputed messer
betto a gentleman of a subtle and discerning wit
novel x

fra cipolla promises to shew certain countryfolk a feather of the angel
gabriel in lieu of which he finds coals which he avers to be of those
with which st lawrence was roasted

all the company save dioneo being delivered of their several stories he
wist that twas his turn to speak wherefore without awaiting any very
express command he enjoined silence on those that were commending
guidos pithy quip and thus begansweet my ladies albeit tis my
privilege to speak of what likes me most i purpose not today to deviate
from that theme whereon you have all discoursed most appositely but
following in your footsteps i am minded to shew you with what adroitness
and readiness of resource one of the friars of st antony avoided a
pickle that two young men had in readiness for him nor if in order to
do the story full justice i be somewhat prolix of speech should it be
burdensome to you if you will but glance at the sun which is yet in
midheaven
certaldo as perchance you may have heard is a town of val delsa within
our countryside which small though it is had in it aforetime people
of rank and wealth thither for that there he found good pasture twas
long the wont of one of the friars of st antony to resort once every
year to collect the alms that fools gave them fra cipolla1so hight
the friarmet with a hearty welcome no less perchance by reason of
his name than for other cause the onions produced in that district being
famous throughout tuscany he was little of person redhaired
jollyvisaged and the very best of good fellows and therewithal though
learning he had none he was so excellent and ready a speaker that whoso
knew him not would not only have esteemed him a great rhetorician but
would have pronounced him tully himself or perchance quintilian and in
all the countryside there was scarce a soul to whom he was not either
gossip or friend or lover being thus wont from time to time to visit
certaldo the friar came there once upon a time in the month of august
and on a sunday morning all the good folk of the neighbouring farms
being come to mass in the parish church he took occasion to come forward
and sayladies and gentlemen you wot tis your custom to send year by
year to the poor of baron master st antony somewhat of your wheat and
oats more or less according to the ability and the devoutness of each
that blessed st antony may save your oxen and asses and pigs and sheep
from harm and you are also accustomed and especially those whose names
are on the books of our confraternity to pay your trifling annual dues
to collect which offerings i am hither sent by my superior to wit
master abbot wherefore with the blessing of god after none when you
hear the bells ring you will come out of the church to the place where
in the usual way i shall deliver you my sermon and you will kiss the
cross and therewithal knowing as i do that you are one and all most
devoted to baron master st antony i will by way of especial grace shew
you a most holy and goodly relic which i brought myself from the holy
land overseas which is none other than one of the feathers of the angel
gabriel which he left behind him in the room of the virgin mary when he
came to make her the annunciation in nazareth and having said thus
much he ceased and went on with the mass now among the many that were
in the church while fra cipolla made this speech were two very wily
young wags the one giovanni del bragoniera by name the other biagio
pizzini who albeit they were on the best of terms with fra cipolla and
much in his company had a sly laugh together over the relic and
resolved to make game of him and his feather so having learned that fra
cipolla was to breakfast that morning in the town with one of his
friends as soon as they knew that he was at table down they hied them
into the street and to the inn where the friar lodged having complotted
that biagio should keep the friars servant in play while giovanni made
search among the friars goods and chattels for this feather whatever it
might be to carry it off that they might see how the friar would
afterwards explain the matter to the people now fra cipolla had for
servant one guccio2 whom some called by way of addition balena3
others imbratta4 others again porco5 and who was such a rascallion
that sure it is that lippo topo6 himself never painted his like
concerning whom fra cipolla would ofttimes make merry with his familiars
sayingmy servant has nine qualities any one of which in solomon
aristotle or seneca would have been enough to spoil all their virtue
wisdom and holiness consider then what sort of a man he must be that
has these nine qualities and yet never a spark of either virtue or
wisdom or holiness and being asked upon divers occasions what these
nine qualities might be he strung them together in rhyme and
answeredi will tell you lazy and uncleanly and a liar he is
negligent disobedient and foulmouthed iwis and reckless and witless
and mannerless and therewithal he has some other petty vices which
twere best to pass over and the most amusing thing about him is that
wherever he goes he is for taking a wife and renting a house and on the
strength of a big black greasy beard he deems himself so very handsome
a fellow and seductive that he takes all the women that see him to be in
love with him and if he were left alone he would slip his girdle and
run after them all true it is that he is of great use to me for that
be any minded to speak with me never so secretly he must still have his
share of the audience and if perchance aught is demanded of me such is
his fear lest i should be at a loss what answer to make that he
presently replies ay or no as he deems meet
now when he left this knave at the inn fra cipolla had strictly
enjoined him on no account to suffer any one to touch aught of his and
least of all his wallet because it contained the holy things but guccio
imbratta who was fonder of the kitchen than any nightingale of the green
boughs and most particularly if he espied there a maid and in the
hosts kitchen had caught sight of a coarse fat woman short and
misshapen with a pair of breasts that shewed as two buckets of muck and
a face that might have belonged to one of the baronci all reeking with
sweat and grease and smoke left fra cipollas room and all his things to
take care of themselves and like a vulture swooping down upon the
carrion was in the kitchen in a trice where though twas august he
sat him down by the fire and fell a gossiping with nutasuch was the
maids nameand told her that he was a gentleman by procuration7 and
had more florins than could be reckoned besides those that he had to
give away which were rather more than less and that he could do and say
such things as never were or might be seen or heard forever good lord
and a day and all heedless of his cowl which had as much grease upon it
as would have furnished forth the caldron of altopascio8 and of his
rent and patched doublet inlaid with filth about the neck and under the
armpits and so stained that it shewed hues more various than ever did
silk from tartary or the indies and of his shoes that were all to
pieces and of his hose that were all in tatters he told her in a tone
that would have become the sieur de chatillon that he was minded to
rehabit her and put her in trim and raise her from her abject condition
and place her where though she would not have much to call her own at
any rate she would have hope of better things with much more to the like
effect which professions though made with every appearance of good
will proved like most of his schemes insubstantial as air and came to
nothing
finding guccio porco thus occupied with nuta the two young men gleefully
accounted their work half done and none gainsaying them entered fra
cipollas room which was open and lit at once upon the wallet in which
was the feather the wallet opened they found wrapt up in many folds of
taffeta a little casket on opening which they discovered one of the
tailfeathers of a parrot which they deemed must be that which the friar
had promised to shew the good folk of certaldo and in sooth he might
well have so imposed upon them for in those days the luxuries of egypt
had scarce been introduced into tuscany though they have since been
brought over in prodigious abundance to the grave hurt of all italy and
though some conversance with them there was yet in those parts folk knew
next to nothing of them but adhering to the honest simple ways of
their forefathers had not seen nay for the most part had not so much as
heard tell of a parrot
so the young men having found the feather took it out with great glee
and looking around for something to replace it they espied in a corner
of the room some pieces of coal wherewith they filled the casket which
they then closed and having set the room in order exactly as they had
found it they quitted it unperceived and hied them merrily off with the
feather and posted themselves where they might hear what fra cipolla
would say when he found the coals in its stead mass said the simple
folk that were in the church went home with the tidings that the feather
of the angel gabriel was to be seen after none and this goodman telling
his neighbour and that goodwife her gossip by the time every one had
breakfasted the town could scarce hold the multitude of men and women
that flocked thither all agog to see this feather
fra cipolla having made a hearty breakfast and had a little nap got up
shortly after none and marking the great concourse of countryfolk that
were come to see the feather sent word to guccio imbratta to go up there
with the bells and bring with him the wallet guccio though twas with
difficulty that he tore himself away from the kitchen and nuta hied him
up with the things required and though when he got up he was winded
for he was corpulent with drinking nought but water he did fra cipollas
bidding by going to the church door and ringing the bells amain when all
the people were gathered about the door fra cipolla all unwitting that
aught of his was missing began his sermon and after much said in
glorification of himself caused the confiteor to be recited with great
solemnity and two torches to be lit by way of preliminary to the shewing
of the feather of the angel gabriel he then bared his head carefully
unfolded the taffeta and took out the casket which after a few
prefatory words in praise and laudation of the angel gabriel and his
relic he opened when he saw that it contained nought but coals he did
not suspect guccio balena of playing the trick for he knew that he was
not clever enough nor did he curse him that his carelessness had
allowed another to play it but he inly imprecated himself that he had
committed his things to the keeping of one whom he knew to be negligent
and disobedient reckless and witless nevertheless he changed not
colour but with face and hands upturned to heaven he said in a voice
that all might hearo god blessed be thy might for ever and ever
then closing the casket and turning to the peopleladies and
gentlemen he said you are to know that when i was yet a very young
man i was sent by my superior into those parts where the sun rises and
i was expressly bidden to search until i should find the privileges of
porcellana which though they cost nothing to seal are of much more use
to others than to us on which errand i set forth taking my departure
from venice and traversing the borgo de greci9 and thence on
horseback the realm of algarve10 and so by baldacca11 i came to
parione12 whence somewhat athirst i after a while got on to
sardinia13 but wherefore go i about to enumerate all the lands in
which i pursued my quest having passed the straits of san giorgio i
arrived at truffia14 and buffia15 countries thickly populated and
with great nations whence i pursued my journey to menzogna16 where i
met with many of our own brethren and of other religious not a few
intent one and all on eschewing hardship for the love of god making
little account of others toil so they might ensue their own advantage
and paying in nought but unminted coin17 throughout the length and
breadth of the country and so i came to the land of abruzzi where the
men and women go in pattens on the mountains and clothe the hogs with
their own entrails18 and a little further on i found folk that carried
bread in staves and wine in sacks19 and leaving them i arrived at the
mountains of the bachi20 where all the waters run downwards in short
i penetrated so far that i came at last to india pastinaca21 where i
swear to you by the habit that i wear that i saw pruninghooks22 fly
a thing that none would believe that had not seen it whereof be my
witness that i lie not maso del saggio that great merchant whom i found
there cracking nuts and selling the shells by retail however not being
able to find that whereof i was in quest because from thence one must
travel by water i turned back and so came at length to the holy land
where in summer cold bread costs four deniers and hot bread is to be had
for nothing and there i found the venerable father
nonmiblasmetesevoipiace23 the most worshipful patriarch of jerusalem
who out of respect for the habit that i have ever worn to wit that of
baron master st antony was pleased to let me see all the holy relics
that he had by him which were so many that were i to enumerate them
all i should not come to the end of them in some miles however not to
disappoint you i will tell you a few of them in the first place then
he shewed me the finger of the holy spirit as whole and entire as it
ever was and the tuft of the seraph that appeared to st francis and
one of the nails of the cherubim and one of the ribs of the verbum caro
hie thee to the casement24 and some of the vestments of the holy
catholic faith and some of the rays of the star that appeared to the
magi in the east and a phial of the sweat of st michael a battling with
the devil and the jaws of death of st lazarus and other relics and for
that i gave him a liberal supply of the acclivities25 of monte morello
in the vulgar and some chapters of caprezio of which he had long been in
quest he was pleased to let me participate in his holy relics and gave
me one of the teeth of the holy cross and in a small phial a bit of the
sound of the bells of solomons temple and this feather of the angel
gabriel whereof i have told you and one of the pattens of san gherardo
da villa magna which not long ago i gave at florence to gherardo di
bonsi who holds him in prodigious veneration he also gave me some of
the coals with which the most blessed martyr st lawrence was roasted
all which things i devoutly brought thence and have them all safe true
it is that my superior has not hitherto permitted me to shew them until
he should be certified that they are genuine however now that this is
avouched by certain miracles wrought by them of which we have tidings by
letter from the patriarch he has given me leave to shew them but
fearing to trust them to another i always carry them with me and to
tell you the truth i carry the feather of the angel gabriel lest it
should get spoiled in a casket and the coals with which st lawrence
was roasted in another casket which caskets are so like the one to the
other that not seldom i mistake one for the other which has befallen me
on this occasion for whereas i thought to have brought with me the
casket wherein is the feather i have brought instead that which contains
the coals nor deem i this a mischance nay methinks tis by
interposition of god and that he himself put the casket of coals in my
hand for i mind me that the feast of st lawrence falls but two days
hence wherefore god being minded that by shewing you the coals with
which he was roasted i should rekindle in your souls the devotion that
you ought to feel towards him guided my hand not to the feather which i
meant to take but to the blessed coals that were extinguished by the
humours that exuded from that most holy body and so blessed children
bare your heads and devoutly draw nigh to see them but first of all i
would have you know that whoso has the sign of the cross made upon him
with these coals may live secure for the whole of the ensuing year that
fire shall not touch him that he feel it not
having so said the friar chanting a hymn in praise of st lawrence
opened the casket and shewed the coals whereon the foolish crowd gazed
a while in awe and reverent wonder and then came pressing forward in a
mighty throng about fra cipolla with offerings beyond their wont each
and all praying him to touch them with the coals wherefore fra cipolla
took the coals in his hand and set about making on their white blouses
and on their doublets and on the veils of the women crosses as big as
might be averring the while that whatever the coals might thus lose
would be made good to them again in the casket as he had often proved
on this wise to his exceeding great profit he marked all the folk of
certaldo with the cross and thanks to his ready wit and resource had
his laugh at those who by robbing him of the feather thought to make a
laughingstock of him they indeed being among his hearers and marking
his novel expedient and how voluble he was and what a long story he
made of it laughed till they thought their jaws would break and when
the congregation was dispersed they went up to him and never so merrily
told him what they had done and returned him his feather which next
year proved no less lucrative to him than that day the coals had been

immense was the delight and diversion which this story afforded to all
the company alike and great and general was the laughter over fra
cipolla and more especially at his pilgrimage and the relics as well
those that he had but seen as those that he had brought back with him
which being ended the queen taking note that therewith the close of her
sovereignty was come stood up took off the crown and set it on
dioneos head saying with a laughtis time dioneo that thou prove
the weight of the burden of having ladies to govern and guide be thou
king then and let thy rule be such that when tis ended we may have
cause to commend it dioneo took the crown and laughingly
answeredkings worthier far than i you may well have seen many a time
ere nowi speak of the kings in chess but let me have of you that
obedience which is due to a true king and of a surety i will give you to
taste of that solace without which perfection of joy there may not be in
any festivity but enough of this i will govern as best i may then as
was the wont he sent for the seneschal and gave him particular
instruction how to order matters during the term of his sovereignty
which done he saidnoble ladies such and so diverse has been our
discourse of the ways of men and their various fortunes that but for the
visit that we had a while ago from madam licisca who by what she said
has furnished me with matter of discourse for tomorrow i doubt i had
been not a little put to it to find a theme you heard how she said that
there was not a woman in her neighbourhood whose husband had her
virginity adding that well she knew how many and what manner of tricks
they after marriage played their husbands the first count we may well
leave to the girls whom it concerns the second methinks should prove a
diverting topic wherefore i ordain that taking our cue from madam
licisca we discourse tomorrow of the tricks that either for love or
for their deliverance from peril ladies have heretofore played their
husbands and whether they were by the said husbands detected or no to
discourse of such a topic some of the ladies deemed unmeet for them and
besought the king to find another theme but the king made
answerladies what manner of theme i have prescribed i know as well
as you nor was i to be diverted from prescribing it by that which you
now think to declare unto me for i wot the times are such that so only
men and women have a care to do nought that is unseemly tis allowable
to them to discourse of what they please for in sooth as you must know
so out of joint are the times that the judges have deserted the
judgmentseat the laws are silent and ample licence to preserve his
life as best he may is accorded to each and all wherefore if you are
somewhat less strict of speech than is your wont not that aught unseemly
in act may follow but that you may afford solace to yourselves and
others i see not how you can be open to reasonable censure on the part
of any furthermore nought that has been said from the first day to the
present moment has methinks in any degree sullied the immaculate honour
of your company nor god helping us shall aught ever sully it besides
who is there that knows not the quality of your honour which were proof
i make no doubt against not only the seductive influence of diverting
discourse but even the terror of death and to tell you the truth
whoso wist that you refused to discourse of these light matters for a
while would be apt to suspect that twas but for that you had yourselves
erred in like sort and truly a goodly honour would you confer upon me
obedient as i have ever been to you if after making me your king and
your lawgiver you were to refuse to discourse of the theme which i
prescribe away then with this scruple fitter for low minds than yours
and let each study how she may give us a goodly story and fortune
prosper her therein
so spake the king and the ladies hearkening said that even as he
would so it should be whereupon he gave all leave to do as they might
be severally minded until the supperhour the sun was still quite high
in the heaven for they had not enlarged in their discourse wherefore
dioneo with the other gallants being set to play at dice elisa called
the other ladies apart and saidthere is a nook hard by this place
where i think none of you has ever been tis called the ladies vale
whither ever since we have been here i have desired to take you but
time meet i have not found until today when the sun is still so high
if then you are minded to visit it i have no manner of doubt that
when you are there you will be very glad you came the ladies answered
that they were ready and so saying nought to the young men they
summoned one of their maids and set forth nor had they gone much more
than a mile when they arrived at the vale of ladies they entered it by
a very strait gorge through which there issued a rivulet clear as
crystal and a sight than which nought more fair and pleasant
especially at that time when the heat was great could be imagined met
their eyes within the valley as one of them afterwards told me was a
plain about halfamile in circumference and so exactly circular that it
might have been fashioned according to the compass though it seemed a
work of natures art not mans twas girdled about by six hills of no
great height each crowned with a palace that shewed as a goodly little
castle the slopes of the hills were graduated from summit to base after
the manner of the successive tiers ever abridging their circle that we
see in our theatres and as many as fronted the southern rays were all
planted so close with vines olives almondtrees cherrytrees
figtrees and other fruitbearing trees not a few that there was not a
handsbreadth of vacant space those that fronted the north were in like
manner covered with copses of oak saplings ashes and other trees as
green and straight as might be besides which the plain which was shut
in on all sides save that on which the ladies had entered was full of
firs cypresses and baytrees with here and there a pine in order and
symmetry so meet and excellent as had they been planted by an artist the
best that might be found in that kind wherethrough even when the sun
was in the zenith scarce a ray of light might reach the ground which
was all one lawn of the finest turf pranked with the hyacinth and divers
other flowers add to whichnor was there aught there more
delightsomea rivulet that issuing from one of the gorges between two
of the hills descended over ledges of living rock making as it fell a
murmur most gratifying to the ear and seen from a distance shewed as a
spray of finest powdered quicksilver and no sooner reached the little
plain than twas gathered into a tiny channel by which it sped with
great velocity to the middle of the plain where it formed a diminutive
lake like the fishponds that townsfolk sometimes make in their gardens
when they have occasion for them the lake was not so deep but that a man
might stand therein with his breast above the water and so clear so
pellucid was the water that the bottom which was of the finest gravel
shewed so distinct that one had he wished who had nought better to do
might have counted the stones nor was it only the bottom that was to be
seen but such a multitude of fishes glancing to and fro as was at once
a delight and a marvel to behold bank it had none but its margin was
the lawn to which it imparted a goodlier freshness so much of the water
as it might not contain was received by another tiny channel through
which issuing from the vale it glided swiftly to the plain below
to which pleasaunce the damsels being come surveyed it with roving
glance and finding it commendable and marking the lake in front of
them did as twas very hot and they deemed themselves secure from
observation resolve to take a bath so having bidden their maid wait
and keep watch over the access to the vale and give them warning if
haply any should approach it they all seven undressed and got into the
water which to the whiteness of their flesh was even such a veil as fine
glass is to the vermeil of the rose they being thus in the water the
clearness of which was thereby in no wise affected did presently begin
to go hither and thither after the fish which had much ado where to
bestow themselves so as to escape out of their hands in which diversion
they spent some time and caught a few and then they hied them out of
the water and dressed them again and bethinking them that twas time to
return to the palace they began slowly sauntering thither dilating much
as they went upon the beauty of the place albeit they could not extol it
more than they had already done twas still quite early when they
reached the palace so that they found the gallants yet at play where
they had left them to whom quoth pampinea with a smilewe have stolen
a march upon you today so replied dioneo tis with you do first
and say after ay my lord returned pampinea and told him at large
whence they came and what the place was like and how far twas off and
what they had done what she said of the beauty of the spot begat in the
king a desire to see it wherefore he straightway ordered supper whereof
when all had gaily partaken the three gallants parted from the ladies
and hied them with their servants to the vale where none of them had
ever been before and having marked all its beauties extolled it as
scarce to be matched in all the world then as the hour was very late
they did but bathe and as soon as they had resumed their clothes
returned to the ladies whom they found dancing a carol to an air that
fiammetta sang which done they conversed of the ladies vale waxing
eloquent in praise thereof insomuch that the king called the seneschal
and bade him have some beds made ready and carried thither on the morrow
that any that were so minded might there take their siesta he then had
lights and wine and comfits brought and when they had taken a slight
refection he bade all address them to the dance so at his behest
pamfilo led a dance and then the king turning with gracious mien to
elisafair damsel quoth he twas thou today didst me this honour
of the crown and tis my will that thine tonight be the honour of the
song wherefore sing us whatsoever thou hast most lief that gladly
will i replied elisa smiling and thus with dulcet voice began
if of thy talons love be quit i may
  i deem it scarce can be
  but other fangs i may elude for aye
service i took with thee a tender maid
  in thy war thinking perfect peace to find
  and all my arms upon the ground i laid
  yielding myself to thee with trustful mind
  thou harpytyrant whom no faith may bind
  eftsoons didst swoop on me
  and with thy cruel claws madst me thy prey
then thy poor captive bound with many a chain
  thou tookst and gavst to him whom fate did call
  hither my death to be for that in pain
  and bitter tears i waste away his thrall
  nor heave i eer a sigh or tear let fall
  so harsh a lord is he
  that him inclines a jot my grief to allay
my prayers upon the idle air are spent
  he hears not will not hear wherefore in vain
  the more each hour my soul doth her torment
  nor may i die albeit to die were gain
  ah lord have pity of my bitter pain
  help have i none but thee
  then take and bind and at my feet him lay
but if thou wilt not do my soul but loose
  from hope that her still binds with triple chain
  sure o my lord this prayer thoult not refuse
  the which so thou to grant me do but deign
  i look my wonted beauty to regain
  and banish misery
  with roses white and red bedecked and gay
so with a most piteous sigh ended elisa her song whereat all wondered
exceedingly nor might any conjecture wherefore she so sang but the
king who was in a jolly humour sent for tindaro and bade him out with
his cornemuse and caused them tread many a measure thereto until no
small part of the night being thus spent he gave leave to all to betake
them to rest

endeth here the sixth day of the decameron beginneth the seventh in

either for love or for their deliverance from peril ladies have
heretofore played their husbands and whether they were by the said
husbands detected or no

fled was now each star from the eastern sky save only that which we call
lucifer which still glowed in the whitening dawn when uprose the
seneschal and with a goodly baggagetrain hied him to the ladies vale
there to make all things ready according to the ordinance and commandment
of the king nor was it long after his departure that the king rose
being awaked by the stir and bustle that the servants made in lading the
horses and being risen he likewise roused all the ladies and the other
gallants and so when as yet twas scarce clear daybreak they all took
the road nor seemed it to them that the nightingales and the other birds
had ever chanted so blithely as that morning by which choir they were
attended to the ladies vale where they were greeted by other warblers
not a few that seemed rejoiced at their arrival roving about the vale
and surveying its beauties afresh they rated them higher than on the
previous day as indeed the hour was more apt to shew them forth then
with good wine and comfits they broke their fast and that they might
not lag behind the songsters they fell a singing whereto the vale
responded ever echoing their strains nor did the birds as minded not
to be beaten fail to swell the chorus with notes of unwonted sweetness
however breakfasttime came and then the tables being laid under a
living canopy of trees and beside other goodly trees that fringed the
little lake they sat them down in order as to the king seemed meet so
they took their meal glancing from time to time at the lake where the
fish darted to and fro in multitudinous shoals which afforded not only
delight to their eyes but matter for converse breakfast ended and the
tables removed they fell a singing again more blithely than before
after which there being set in divers places about the little vale
beds which the discreet seneschal had duly furnished and equipped within
and without with store of french coverlets and other bedgear all that
were so minded had leave of the king to go to sleep and those that
cared not to sleep might betake them as each might choose to any of
their wonted diversions but all at length being risen and the time for
addressing them to the storytelling being come the king had carpets
spread on the sward no great way from the place where they had
breakfasted and all having sat them down beside the lake he bade
emilia begin which blithe and smiling emilia did on this wise

gianni lotteringhi hears a knocking at his door at night he awakens his
wife who persuades him that tis the bogey which they fall to
exorcising with a prayer whereupon the knocking ceases

my lord glad indeed had i been that saving your good pleasure some
other than i had had precedence of discourse upon so goodly a theme as
this of which we are to speaki doubt i am but chosen to teach others
confidence but such being your will i will gladly obey it and my
endeavour shall be dearest ladies to tell you somewhat that may be
serviceable to you in the future for if you are as i am timorous and
that most especially of the bogey which god wot i know not what manner
of thing it may be nor yet have found any that knew albeit we are all
alike afraid of it you may learn from this my story how to put it to
flight should it intrude upon you with a holy salutary and most
efficacious orison
there dwelt of yore at florence in the quarter of san pancrazio a
masterspinner gianni lotteringhi by name one that had prospered in his
business but had little understanding of aught else insomuch that being
somewhat of a simpleton he had many a time been chosen leader of the
band of laudsingers of santa maria novella and had charge of their
school and not a few like offices had he often served upon which he
greatly plumed himself howbeit twas all for no other reason than that
being a man of substance he gave liberal doles to the friars who for
that they got thereof this one hose another a cloak and a third a
hood would teach him good orisons or give him the paternoster in the
vernacular or the chant of st alexis or the lament of st bernard or
the laud of lady matilda or the like sorry stuff which he greatly
prized and guarded with jealous care deeming them all most conducive to
the salvation of his soul
now our simple masterspinner had a most beautiful wife and amorous
withal her name monna tessa daughter she was of mannuccio dalla
cuculla and not a little knowing and keenwitted and being enamoured of
federigo di neri pegolotti a handsome and lusty gallant as he also of
her she knowing her husbands simplicity took counsel with her maid
and arranged that federigo should come to chat with her at a right goodly
pleasurehouse that the said gianni had at camerata where she was wont
to pass the summer gianni coming now and again to sup and sleep and
going back in the morning to his shop or maybe to his laudsingers
federigo who desired nothing better went up there punctually on the
appointed day about vespers and as the evening passed without gianni
making his appearance did most comfortably and to his no small
satisfaction sup and sleep with the lady who lying in his arms taught
him that night some six of her husbands lauds but as neither she nor
federigo was minded that this beginning should also be the end of their
intercourse and that it might not be needful for the maid to go each
time to make the assignation with him they came to the following
understanding to wit that as often as he came and went between the
house and an estate that he had a little higher up he should keep an eye
on a vineyard that was beside the house where he would see an asss head
stuck on one of the poles of the vineyard and as often as he observed
the muzzle turned towards florence he might visit her without any sort
of misgiving and if he found not the door open he was to tap it thrice
and she would open it and when he saw the muzzle of the asss head
turned towards fiesole he was to keep away for then gianni would be
there following which plan they forgathered not seldom but on one of
these evenings when federigo was to sup with monna tessa on two fat
capons that she bad boiled it so chanced that gianni arrived there
unexpectedly and very late much to the ladys chagrin so she had a
little salt meat boiled apart on which she supped with her husband and
the maid by her orders carried the two boiled capons laid in a spotless
napkin with plenty of fresh eggs and a bottle of good wine into the
garden to which there was access otherwise than from the house and
where she was wont at times to sup with federigo and there the maid set
them down at the foot of a peachtree that grew beside a lawn but in
her vexation she forgot to tell the maid to wait till federigo should
come and let him know that gianni was there and he must take his supper
in the garden and she and gianni and the maid were scarce gone to bed
when federigo came and tapped once at the door which being hard by the
bedroom gianni heard the tap as did also the lady albeit that gianni
might have no reason to suspect her she feigned to be asleep federigo
waited a little and then gave a second tap whereupon wondering what it
might mean gianni nudged his wife sayingtessa dost hear what i
hear methinks some one has tapped at our door the lady who had heard
the noise much better than he feigned to wake up andhow what sayst
thou quoth she i say replied gianni that meseems some one has
tapped at our door tapped at it quoth the lady alas my gianni
wottest thou not what that is tis the bogey which for some nights past
has so terrified me as never was insomuch that i never hear it but i pop
my head under the clothes and venture not to put it out again until tis
broad day come come wife quoth gianni if such it is be not
alarmed for before we got into bed i repeated the te lucis the
intemerata and divers other good orisons besides which i made the sign
of the cross in the name of the father son and holy spirit at each
corner of the bed wherefore we need have no fear that it may avail to
hurt us whatever be its power the lady lest federigo perchance
suspecting a rival should take offence resolved to get up and let him
understand that gianni was there so she said to her husbandwell
well so sayst thou but i for my part shall never deem myself safe and
secure unless we exorcise it seeing that thou art here oh said
gianni and how does one exorcise it that quoth the lady i know
right well for tother day when i went to fiesole for the pardoning
one of those anchoresses the saintliest creature my gianni god be my
witness knowing how much afraid i am of the bogey taught me a holy and
salutary orison which she said she had tried many a time before she was
turned anchoress and always with success god wot i should never have
had courage to try it alone but as thou art here i propose that we go
exorcise it together gianni made answer that he was quite of the same
mind so up they got and stole to the door on the outside of which
federigo now suspicious was still waiting and as soon as they were
therenow quoth the lady to gianni thou wilt spit when i tell
thee good said gianni whereupon the lady began her orison
saying
  bogey bogey that goest by night
  tail erect thou camst tail erect take thy flight
  hie thee to the garden and the great peach before
  grease upon grease and droppings five score
  of my hen shalt thou find
  set the flask thy lips to
  then away like the wind
  and no scathe unto me or my gianni do
and when she had donenow gianni quoth she spit and gianni
spat
there was no more room for jealousy in federigos mind as he heard all
this from without nay for all his disappointment he was like to burst
with suppressed laughter and when gianni spat he muttered under his
breathnow out with thy teeth the lady having after this fashion
thrice exorcised the bogey went back to bed with her husband federigo
disappointed of the supper that he was to have had with her and
apprehending the words of the orison aright hied him to the garden and
having found the two capons and the wine and the eggs at the foot of the
peachtree took them home with him and supped very comfortably and
many a hearty laugh had he and the lady over the exorcism during their
subsequent intercourse
now true it is that some say that the lady had in fact turned the asss
head towards fiesole but that a husbandman passing through the
vineyard had given it a blow with his stick whereby it had swung round
and remained fronting florence and so it was that federigo thought that
he was invited and came to the house and that the ladys orison was on
this wise
  bogey a gods name away thee hie
  for whoeer turned the asss head twas not i
  another it was foul fall his eyne
  and here am i with gianni mine
wherefore federigo was fain to take himself off having neither slept nor
supped
but a neighbour of mine a lady well advanced in years tells me that by
what she heard when she was a girl both stories are true but that the
latter concerned not gianni lotteringhi but one gianni di nello that
lived at porta san piero and was no less a numskull than gianni
lotteringhi wherefore dear my ladies you are at liberty to choose
which exorcism you prefer or take both if you like they are both of
extraordinary and approved virtue in such cases as you have heard get
them by heart therefore and they may yet stand you in good stead
novel ii

her husband returning home peronella bestows her lover in a tun which
being sold by her husband she avers to have been already sold by herself
to one that is inside examining it to see if it be sound whereupon the
lover jumps out and causes the husband to scour the tun for him and
afterwards to carry it to his house

great indeed was the laughter with which emilias story was received
which being ended and her orison commended by all as good and salutary
the king bade filostrato follow suit and thus filostrato begandearest
my ladies so many are the tricks that men play you and most of all your
husbands that when from time to time it so befalls that some lady plays
her husband a trick the circumstance whether it come within your own
cognizance or be told you by another should not only give you joy but
should incite you to publish it on all hands that men may be ware that
knowing as they are their ladies also on their part know somewhat
which cannot but be serviceable to you for that one does not rashly
essay to take another with guile whom one wots not to lack that quality
can we doubt then that should but the converse that we shall hold
today touching this matter come to be bruited among men twould serve
to put a most notable check upon the tricks they play you by doing them
to wit of the tricks which you in like manner when you are so minded
may play them wherefore tis my intention to tell you in what manner a
young girl albeit she was but of low rank did on the spur of the
moment beguile her husband to her own deliverance
tis no long time since at naples a poor man a mason by craft took to
wife a fair and amorous maidenperonella was her namewho eked out by
spinning what her husband made by his craft and so the pair managed as
best they might on very slender means and as chance would have it one
of the gallants of the city taking note of this peronella one day and
being mightily pleased with her fell in love with her and by this means
and that so prevailed that he won her to accord him her intimacy their
times of forgathering they concerted as followsto wit that her
husband being wont to rise betimes of a morning to go to work or seek for
work the gallant was to be where he might see him go forth and the
street where she dwelt which is called avorio being scarce inhabited
was to come into the house as soon as her husband was well out of it and
so times not a few they did but on one of these occasions it befell
that the good man being gone forth and giannello sirignariosuch was
the gallants namebeing come into the house and being with peronella
after a while back came the good man though twas not his wont to
return until the day was done and finding the door locked he knocked
and after knocking he fell a saying to himselfo god praised be thy
name forever for that albeit thou hast ordained that i be poor at
least thou hast accorded me the consolation of a good and honest girl for
wife mark what haste she made to shut the door when i was gone forth
that none else might enter to give her trouble
now peronella knew by his knock that twas her husband
whereforealas giannello mine quoth she i am a dead woman for
lo here is my husband foul fall him come back what it may import i
know not for he is never wont to come back at this hour perchance he
caught sight of thee as thou camest in however for the love of god be
it as it may get thee into this tun that thou seest here and i will go
open to him and we shall see what is the occasion of this sudden return
this morning so giannello forthwith got into the tun and peronella
went to the door and let in her husband and gave him black looks
sayingthis is indeed a surprise that thou art back so soon this
morning by what i see thou hast a mind to make this a holiday that thou
returnest tools in hand if so what are we to live on whence shall we
get bread to eat thinkest thou i will let thee pawn my gown and other
bits of clothes day and night i do nought else but spin insomuch that
the flesh is fallen away from my nails that at least i may have oil
enough to keep our lamp alight husband husband there is never a woman
in the neighbourhood but marvels and mocks at me that i am at such
labour and pains and thou comest home to me with thy hands hanging idle
when thou shouldst be at work which said she fell a weeping and
repeatingalas alas woe s me in what evil hour was i born in what
luckless moment came i hither i that might have had so goodly a young
man and i would not to take up with one that bestows never a thought on
her whom he has made his wife other women have a good time with their
lovers and never a one have we here but has two or three they take
their pleasure and make their husbands believe that the moon is the sun
and i alas for that i am an honest woman and have no such casual
amours i suffer and am hard bested i know not why i provide not myself
with one of these lovers as others do give good heed husband to what
i say were i disposed to dishonour thee i were at no loss to find the
man for here are gallants enough that love me and court me and have
sent me many an offer of moneyno stintor dresses or jewels should i
prefer them but my pride would never suffer it because i was not born
of a woman of that sort and now thou comest home to me when thou
oughtest to be at work
whereto the husbandwife wife for gods sake distress not thyself
thou shouldst give me credit for knowing what manner of woman thou art
as indeed i have partly seen this morning true it is that i went out to
work but tis plain that thou knowest not as indeed i knew not that
today tis the feast of san galeone and a holiday and that is why i am
come home at this hour but nevertheless i have found means to provide us
with bread for more than a month for i have sold to this gentleman whom
thou seest with me the tun thou wottest of seeing that it has
encumbered the house so long and he will give me five gigliats for it
quoth then peronellaand all this but adds to my trouble thou that
art a man and goest abroad and shouldst know affairs hast sold for
five gigliats a tun which i that am but a woman and was scarce ever
out of doors have for that it took up so much room in the house sold
for seven gigliats to a good man that but now as thou camst back got
therein to see if twere sound so hearing the husband was overjoyed
and said to the man that was come to take it awaygood man i wish
thee godspeed for as thou hearest my wife has sold the tun for seven
gigliats whereas thou gavest me only five whereuponso be it said
the good man and took himself off then said peronella to her
husbandnow as thou art here come up and arrange the matter with
the good man
now giannello who meanwhile had been all on the alert to discover if
there were aught he had to fear or be on his guard against no sooner
heard peronellas last words than he sprang out of the tun and feigning
to know nought of her husbands return began thuswhere art thou
good dame whereto the husband coming up answeredhere am i what
wouldst thou of me quoth giannelloand who art thou i would speak
with the lady with whom i struck the bargain for this tun then said the
good manhave no fear you can deal with me for i am her husband
quoth then giannellothe tun seems to me sound enough but i think you
must have let the lees remain in it for tis all encrusted with i know
not what that is so dry that i cannot raise it with the nail wherefore
i am not minded to take it unless i first see it scoured whereupon
peronellato be sure that shall not hinder the bargain my husband
will scour it clean andwell and good said the husband
so he laid down his tools stripped himself to his vest sent for a light
and a rasp and was in the tun and scraping away in a trice whereupon
peronella as if she were curious to see what he did thrust her head
into the vent of the tun which was of no great size and therewithal one
of her arms up to the shoulder and fell a sayingscrape here and
here and there too and look there is a bit left here so she being
in this posture directing and admonishing her husband giannello who
had not that morning fully satisfied his desire when the husband
arrived now seeing that as he would he might not brought his mind to
his circumstances and resolved to take his pleasure as he might
wherefore he made up to the lady who completely blocked the vent of the
tun and even on such wise as on the open champaign the wild and lusty
horses do amorously assail the mares of parthia he sated his youthful
appetite and so it was that almost at the same moment that he did so
and was off the tun was scoured the husband came forth of it and
peronella withdrew her head from the vent and turning to giannello
saidtake this light good man and see if tis scoured to thy mind
whereupon giannello looking into the tun said that twas in good trim
and that he was well content and paid the husband the seven gigliats
and caused him carry the tun to his house
novel iii

fra rinaldo lies with his gossip her husband finds him in the room with
her and they make him believe that he was curing his godson of worms by
a charm

filostrato knew not how so to veil what he said touching the mares of
parthia but that the keenwitted ladies laughed thereat making as if
twas at somewhat else however his story being ended the king called
for one from elisa who all obedience thus begandebonair my ladies
we heard from emilia how the bogey is exorcised and it brought to my
mind a story of another incantation tis not indeed so good a story as
hers but as no other germane to our theme occurs to me at present i
will relate it
you are to know then that there dwelt aforetime at siena a young man
right gallant and of honourable family his name rinaldo who being in
the last degree enamoured of one of his neighbours a most beautiful
gentlewoman and the wife of a rich man was not without hopes that if he
could but find means to speak with her privately he might have of her
all that he desired but seeing no way and the lady being pregnant he
cast about how he might become her childs godfather wherefore having
ingratiated himself with her husband he broached the matter to him in as
graceful a manner as he might and twas arranged so rinaldo being now
godfather to madonna agnesas child and having a more colourable pretext
for speaking to her took courage and told her in words that message of
his heart which she had long before read in his eyes but though twas
not displeasing to the lady to hear it availed him but little
now not long afterwards it so befell that whatever may have been his
reason rinaldo betook him to friarage and whether it was that he found
good pasture therein or what not he persevered in that way of life and
though for a while after he was turned friar he laid aside the love he
bore his gossip and certain other vanities yet in course of time
without putting off the habit he resumed them and began to take a pride
in his appearance and to go dressed in fine clothes and to be quite the
trim gallant and to compose songs and sonnets and ballades and to sing
them and to make a brave shew in all else that pertained to his new
character but why enlarge upon our fra rinaldo of whom we speak what
friars are there that do not the like ah opprobrium of a corrupt world
sleekfaced and sanguine daintily clad dainty in all their accessories
they ruffle it shamelessly before the eyes of all shewing not as doves
but as insolent cocks with raised crest and swelling bosom and what is
worse to say nought of the vases full of electuaries and unguents the
boxes packed with divers comfits the pitchers and phials of artificial
waters and oils the flagons brimming with malmsey and greek and other
wines of finest quality with which their cells are so packed that they
shew not as the cells of friars but rather as apothecaries or
perfumers shops they blush not to be known to be gouty flattering
themselves that other folk wot not that long fasts and many of them and
coarse fare and little of it and sober living make men lean and thin
and for the most part healthy or if any malady come thereof at any rate
tis not the gout the wonted remedy for which is chastity and all beside
that belongs to the regimen of a humble friar they flatter themselves
too that others wot not that over and above the meagre diet long vigils
and orisons and strict discipline ought to mortify men and make them
pale and that neither st dominic nor st francis went clad in stuff
dyed in grain or any other goodly garb but in coarse woollen habits
innocent of the dyers art made to keep out the cold and not for shew
to which matters twere well god had a care no less than to the souls of
the simple folk by whom our friars are nourished
fra rinaldo then being come back to his first affections took to
visiting his gossip very frequently and gaining confidence began with
more insistence than before to solicit her to that which he craved of
her so being much urged the good lady to whom fra rinaldo perhaps
seemed now more handsome than of yore had recourse one day when she
felt herself unusually hard pressed by him to the common expedient of
all that would fain concede what is asked of them and saidoh but
fra rinaldo do friars then do this sort of thing madam replied fra
rinaldo when i divest myself of this habit which i shall do easily
enough you will see that i am a man furnished as other men and no
friar whereto with a truly comical air the lady made answeralas
woes me you are my childs godfather how might it be nay but twere
a very great mischief and many a time i have heard that tis a most
heinous sin and without a doubt were it not so i would do as you
wish if said fra rinaldo you forego it for such a scruple as this
you are a fool for your pains i say not that tis no sin but there is
no sin so great but god pardons it if one repent now tell me whether
is more truly father to your son i that held him at the font or your
husband that begot him my husband replied the lady sooth say you
returned the friar and does not your husband lie with you why yes
said the lady then rejoined the friar i that am less truly your
sons father than your husband ought also to lie with you as does your
husband the lady was no logician and needed little to sway her she
therefore believed or feigned to believe that what the friar said was
true so who might avail to answer your words of wisdom quoth she
and presently forgot the godfather in the lover and complied with his
desires nor had they begun their course to end it forthwith but under
cover of the friars sponsorship which set them more at ease as it
rendered them less open to suspicion they forgathered again and again
but on one of these occasions it so befell that fra rinaldo being come
to the ladys house where he espied none else save a very pretty and
dainty little maid that waited on the lady sent his companion away with
her into the pigeonhouse there to teach her the paternoster while he
and the lady holding her little boy by the hand went into the bedroom
locked themselves in got them on to a divan that was there and began to
disport them and while thus they sped the time it chanced that the
father returned and before any was ware of him was at the bedroom
door and knocked and called the lady by her name whereupontis as
much as my life is worth quoth madonna agnesa lo here is my husband
and the occasion of our intimacy cannot but be now apparent to him
sooth say you returned fra rinaldo who was undressed that is to say
had thrown off his habit and hood and was in his tunic if i had but my
habit and hood on me in any sort twould be another matter but if you
let him in and he find me thus twill not be possible to put any face
on it but with an inspiration as happy as suddennow get them on
you quoth the lady and when you have them on take your godson in
your arms and give good heed to what i shall say to him that your words
may accord with mine and leave the rest to me
the good man was still knocking when his wife made answer coming
coming and so up she got and put on a cheerful countenance and hied
her to the door and opened it and saidhusband mine well indeed was
it for us that in came fra rinaldo our sponsor twas god that sent him
to us for in sooth but for that we had today lost our boy which the
poor simpleton almost swooned to hear andhow so quoth he o
husband mine replied the lady he was taken but now all of a sudden
with a fainting fit so that i thought he was dead and what to do or say
i knew not had not fra rinaldo our sponsor come just in the nick of
time and set him on his shoulder and saidgossip tis that he has
worms in his body and getting as they do about the heart they might
only too readily be the death of him but fear not i will say a charm
that will kill them all and before i take my leave you will see your
boy as whole as you ever saw him and because to say certain of the
prayers thou shouldst have been with us and the maid knew not where to
find thee he caused his companion to say them at the top of the house
and he and i came in here and for that tis not meet for any but the
boys mother to assist at such a service that we might not be troubled
with any one else we locked the door and he yet has him in his arms
and i doubt not that he only waits till his companion have said his
prayers and then the charm will be complete for the boy is already
quite himself again
the good simple soul taking all this for sooth and overwrought by the
love he bore his son was entirely without suspicion of the trick his
wife was playing him and heaving a great sigh saidi will go look
for him nay replied the wife go not thou wouldst spoil the
efficacy of the charm wait here i will go see if thou mayst safely go
and will call thee
whereupon fra rinaldo who had heard all that passed and was in his
canonicals and quite at his ease and had the boy in his arms having
made sure that all was as it should be cried outgossip do i not
hear the fathers voice out there ay indeed sir replied the
simpleton come in then said fra rinaldo so in came the simpleton
whereupon quoth fra rinaldoi restore to you your boy made whole by
the grace of god whom but now i scarce thought you would see alive at
vespers you will do well to have his image fashioned in wax not less
than lifesize and set it for a thanksgiving to god before the statue
of master st ambrose by whose merits you have this favour of god
the boy catching sight of his father ran to him with joyous greetings
as little children are wont and the father taking him in his arms and
weeping as if he were restored to him from the grave fell by turns a
kissing him and thanking his godfather that he had cured him fra
rinaldos companion who had taught the maid not one paternoster only
but peradventure four or more and by giving her a little purse of white
thread that a nun had given him had made her his devotee no sooner
heard fra rinaldo call the simpleton into his wifes room than he
stealthily got him to a place whence he might see and hear what was going
on observing that the affair was now excellently arranged he came down
and entered the chamber sayingfra rinaldo those four prayers that
you bade me say i have said them all then well done my brother
quoth fra rinaldo wellbreathed must thou be for my part i had but
said two when my gossip came in but what with thy travail and mine god
of his grace has vouchsafedus the healing or the boy the simpleton
then had good wine and comfits brought in and did the honours to the
godfather and his companion in such sort as their occasions did most
demand he then ushered them forth of the house commending them to god
and without delay had the waxen image made and directed it to be set up
with the others in front of the statue of st ambrose not be it
understood st ambrose of milan1
1 the statue would doubtless be that of st ambrose of siena of the
dominican order

lauretta he signified his will that she should tell somewhat wherefore
without delay she begano love how great and signal is thy potency
how notable thy stratagems thy devices was there ever shall there ever
be philosopher or adept competent to inspire counsel and teach in such
sort as thou by thine unpremeditated art dost tutor those that follow thy
lead verily laggard teachers are they all in comparison of thee as by
the matters heretofore set forth may very well be understood to which
store i will add loving ladies a stratagem used by a woman of quite
ordinary understanding and of such a sort that i know not by whom she
could have been taught it save by love
know then that there dwelt aforetime at arezzo a rich man tofano by
name who took to wife monna ghita a lady exceeding fair of whom for
what cause he knew not he presently grew jealous whereof the lady being
ware waxed resentful and having on divers occasions demanded of him the
reason of his jealousy and gotten from him nought precise but only
generalities and trivialities resolved at last to give him cause enough
to die of that evil which without cause he so much dreaded and being
ware that a gallant whom she deemed well worthy of her was enamoured of
her she using due discretion came to an understanding with him which
being brought to the point that it only remained to give effect to their
words in act the lady cast about to devise how this might be and
witting that among other bad habits that her husband had he was too
fond of his cups she would not only commend indulgence but cunningly
and not seldom incite him thereto insomuch that wellnigh as often as
she was so minded she led him to drink to excess and when she saw that
he was well drunken she would put him to bed and so not once only but
divers times without any manner of risk she forgathered with her lover
nay presuming upon her husbands intoxication she grew so bold that
not content with bringing her lover into her house she would at times go
spend a great part of the night with him at his house which was not far
off
now such being the enamoured ladys constant practice it so befell that
the dishonoured husband took note that while she egged him on to drink
she herself drank never a drop whereby he came to suspect the truth to
wit that the lady was making him drunk that afterwards she might take
her pleasure while he slept and being minded to put his surmise to the
proof one evening having drunken nought all day he mimicked never so
drunken a sot both in speech and in carriage the lady deeming him to be
really as he appeared and that twas needless to ply him with liquor
presently put him to bed which done she as she at times was wont hied
her forth to her lovers house where she tarried until midnight tofano
no sooner perceived that his wife was gone than up he got hied him to
the door locked it and then posted himself at the window to observe her
return and let her know that he was ware of her misconduct so there he
stood until the lady returned and finding herself locked out was
annoyed beyond measure and sought to force the door open tofano let her
try her strength upon it a while and thenmadam quoth he tis all
to no purpose thou canst not get in go get thee back thither where thou
hast tarried all this while and rest assured that thou shalt never
recross this threshold until i have done thee such honour as is meet for
thee in the presence of thy kinsfolk and neighbours thereupon the lady
fell entreating him to be pleased to open to her for the love of god for
that she was not come whence he supposed but had only been passing the
time with one of her gossips because the nights were long and she could
not spend the whole time either in sleep or in solitary watching but her
supplications availed her nothing for the fool was determined that all
arezzo should know their shame whereof as yet none wist aught so as
twas idle to entreat the lady assumed a menacing tone sayingso
thou open not to me i will make thee the saddest man alive whereto
tofano made answerand what then canst thou do the lady her wits
sharpened by love rejoinedrather than endure the indignity to which
thou wouldst unjustly subject me i will cast myself into the well hard
by here and when i am found dead there all the world will believe that
twas thou that didst it in thy cups and so thou wilt either have to
flee and lose all that thou hast and be outlawed or forfeit thy head as
guilty of my death as indeed thou wilt be but for all she said
tofano wavered not a jot in his foolish purpose so at lastlo now
quoth the lady i can no more abide thy surly humour god forgive thee
i leave thee my distaff here which be careful to bestow in a safe
place so saying away she hied her to the well and the night being so
dark that wayfarers could scarce see one another as they passed she took
up a huge stone that was by the well and ejaculating god forgive me
dropped it therein tofano hearing the mighty splash that the stone made
as it struck the water never doubted that she had cast herself in so
bucket and rope in hand he flung himself out of the house and came
running to the well to her rescue the lady had meanwhile hidden herself
hard by the door and seeing him make for the well was in the house in a
trice and having locked the door hied her to the window and greeted
him withtis while thou art drinking not now when the night is far
spent that thou shouldst temper thy wine with water thus derided
tofano came back to the door and finding his ingress barred began
adjuring her to let him in whereupon changing the low tone she had
hitherto used for one so shrill that twas wellnigh a shriek she broke
out withby the holy rood tedious drunken sot that thou art thou
gettest no admittance here tonight thy ways are more than i can endure
tis time i let all the world know what manner of man thou art and at
what hour of the night thou comest home tofano on his part now grew
angry and began loudly to upbraid her insomuch that the neighbours
aroused by the noise got up men and women alike and looked out of the
windows and asked what was the matter whereupon the lady fell a weeping
and sayingtis this wicked man who comes home drunk at even or
falls asleep in some tavern and then returns at this hour long and to
no purpose have i borne with him but tis now past endurance and i have
done him this indignity of locking him out of the house in the hope that
perchance it may cause him to mend his ways
tofano on his part told dolt that he was just what had happened and
was mighty menacing whereuponnow mark quoth the lady to the
neighbours the sort of man he is what would you say if i were as he
is in the street and he were in the house as i am gods faith i
doubt you would believe what he said hereby you may gauge his sense he
tells you that i have done just what i doubt not he has done himself
he thought to terrify me by throwing i know not what into the well
wherein would to god he had thrown himself indeed and drowned himself
whereby the wine of which he has taken more than enough had been watered
to some purpose the neighbours men and women alike now with one
accord gave tongue censuring tofano throwing all the blame upon him
and answering what he alleged against the lady with loud recrimination
and in short the bruit passing from neighbour to neighbour reached at
last the ears of the ladys kinsfolk who hied them to the spot and
being apprised of the affair from this that and the other of the
neighbours laid hands on tofano and beat him till he was black and blue
from head to foot which done they entered his house stripped it of all
that belonged to the lady and took her home with them bidding tofano
look for worse to come thus hard bested and ruing the plight in which
his jealousy had landed him tofano who loved his wife with all his
heart set some friends to work to patch matters up whereby he did in
fact induce his lady to forgive him and live with him again albeit he
was fain to promise her never again to be jealous and to give her leave
to amuse herself to her hearts content provided she used such
discretion that he should not be ware of it on such wise like the churl
and booby that he was being despoiled he made terms now long live
love and perish war and all that wage it
novel v

a jealous husband disguises himself as a priest and hears his own wifes
confession she tells him that she loves a priest who comes to her every
night the husband posts himself at the door to watch for the priest and
meanwhile the lady brings her lover in by the roof and tarries with him

when lauretta had done speaking and all had commended the lady for that
she had done well and treated her caitiff husband as he had deserved
the king not to lose time turned to fiammetta and graciously bade her
take up her parable which she did on this wisemost noble ladies the
foregoing story prompts me likewise to discourse of one of these jealous
husbands deeming that they are justly requited by their wives more
especially when they grow jealous without due cause and had our
legislators taken account of everything i am of opinion that they would
have visited ladies in such a case with no other penalty than such as
they provide for those that offend in selfdefence seeing that a jealous
husband does cunningly practise against the life of his lady and most
assiduously machinate her death all the week the wife stays at home
occupied with her domestic duties after which on the day that is sacred
to joy she like every one else craves some solace some peace some
recreation not unreasonably for she craves but what the husbandmen take
in the fields the craftsmen in the city the magistrates in the courts
nay what god himself took when he rested from all his labours on the
seventh day and which laws human and divine mindful alike of the honour
of god and the common wellbeing have ordained appropriating certain
days to work and others to repose to which ordinance these jealous
husbands will in no wise conform on the contrary by then most sedulously
secluding their wives they make those days which to all other women are
gladsome to them most grievous and dolorous and what an affliction it
is to the poor creatures they alone know who have proved it for which
reason to sum up i say that a wife is rather to be commended than
censured if she take her revenge upon a husband that is jealous without
cause
know then that at rimini there dwelt a merchant a man of great substance
in lands and goods and money who having a most beautiful woman to wife
waxed inordinately jealous of her and that for no better reason than
that loving her greatly and esteeming her exceeding fair and knowing
that she did her utmost endeavour to pleasure him he must needs suppose
that every man loved her and esteemed her fair and that she moreover
was as zealous to stand well with every other man as with himself
whereby you may see that he was a poor creature and of little sense
being thus so deeply infected with jealousy he kept so strict and close
watch over her that some maybe have lain under sentence of death and
been less rigorously confined by their warders twas not merely that the
lady might not go to a wedding or a festal gathering or even to church
or indeed set foot out of doors in any sort but she dared not so much as
shew herself at a window or cast a glance outside the house no matter
for what purpose wherefore she led a most woeful life of it and found
it all the harder to bear because she knew herself to be innocent
accordingly seeing herself evilly entreated by her husband without good
cause she cast about how for her own consolation she might devise means
to justify his usage of her and for that as she might not shew herself
at the window there could be no interchange of amorous glances between
her and any man that passed along the street but she wist that in the
next house there was a goodly and debonair gallant she bethought her
that if there were but a hole in the wall that divided the two houses
she might watch thereat until she should have sight of the gallant on
such wise that she might speak to him and give him her love if he cared
to have it and if so it might be contrived forgather with him now and
again and after this fashion relieve the burden of her woeful life
until such time as the evil spirit should depart from her husband so
peering about now here now there when her husband was away she found
in a very remote part of the house a place where by chance the wall
had a little chink in it peering through which she made out though not
without great difficulty that on the other side was a room and said to
herselfif this were filippos roomfilippo was the name of the
gallant her neighbouri should be already halfway to my goal so
cautiously through her maid who was grieved to see her thus languish
she made quest and discovered that it was indeed the gallants room
where he slept quite alone wherefore she now betook her frequently to
the aperture and whenever she was ware that the gallant was in the room
she would let fall a pebble or the like trifle whereby at length she
brought the gallant to the other side of the aperture to see what the
matter was whereupon she softly called him and he knowing her voice
answered and so having now the opportunity she had sought she in few
words opened to him all her mind the gallant being overjoyed wrought
at the aperture on such wise that albeit none might be ware thereof he
enlarged it and there many a time they held converse together and
touched hands though further they might not go by reason of the
assiduous watch that the jealous husband kept
now towards christmas the lady told her husband that if he approved she
would fain go on christmas morning to church and confess and
communicate like other christians and what sins quoth he hast thou
committed that wouldst be shriven how returned the lady dost thou
take me for a saint for all thou keepest me so close thou must know
very well that i am like all other mortals however i am not minded to
confess to thee for that thou art no priest her husband whose
suspicions were excited by what she had said cast about how he might
discover these sins of hers and having bethought him of what seemed an
apt expedient made answer that she had his consent but he would not
have her go to any church but their own chapel where she might hie her
betimes in the morning and confess either to their own chaplain or some
other priest that the chaplain might assign her but to none other and
presently return to the house the lady thought she half understood him
but she answered only that she would do as he required christmas morning
came and with the dawn the lady rose dressed herself and hied her to
the church appointed by her husband who also rose and hied him to the
same church where he arrived before her and having already concerted
matters with the priest that was in charge he forthwith put on one of
the priests robes with a great hood overshadowing the face such as we
see priests wear and which he pulled somewhat forward and so disguised
he seated himself in the choir
on entering the church the lady asked for the priest who came and
learning that she was minded to confess said that he could not hear her
himself but would send her one of his brethren so away he hied him and
sent her in an evil hour for him her husband for though he wore an air
of great solemnity and twas not yet broad day and he had pulled the
hood well over his eyes yet all did not avail but that his lady
forthwith recognized him and said to herselfgod be praised why the
jealous rogue is turned priest but leave it me to give him that whereof
he is in quest so she feigned not to know him and seated herself at his
feet i should tell you that he had put some pebbles in his mouth that
his speech being impeded might not betray him to his wife and in all
other respects he deemed himself so thoroughly disguised that there was
nought whereby she might recognize him now to come to the confession
the lady after informing him that she was married told him among other
matters that she was enamoured of a priest who came every night to lie
with her which to hear was to her husband as if he were stricken through
the heart with a knife and had it not been that he was bent on knowing
more he would have forthwith given over the confession and taken
himself off however he kept his place andhow said he to the lady
does not your husband lie with you the lady replied in the
affirmative how then quoth the husband can the priest also lie
with you sir replied she what art the priest employs i know not
but door there is none however well locked in the house that comes not
open at his touch and he tells me that being come to the door of my
room before he opens it he says certain words whereby my husband
forthwith falls asleep whereupon he opens the door and enters the room
and lies with me and so tis always without fail then tis very
wrong madam and you must give it up altogether said the husband
that sir returned the lady i doubt i can never do for i love him
too much in that case quoth the husband i cannot give you
absolution the pity of it ejaculated the lady i came not hither to
tell you falsehoods if i could give it up i would madam replied
the husband indeed i am sorry for you for i see that you are in a fair
way to lose your soul however this i will do for you i will make
special supplication to god on your behalf and perchance you may be
profited thereby and from time to time i will send you one of my young
clerks and you will tell him whether my prayers have been of any help to
you or no and if they have been so i shall know what to do next
nay sir quoth the lady do not so send no man to me at home for
should my husband come to know it he is so jealous that nothing in the
world would ever disabuse him of the idea that he came but for an evil
purpose and so i should have no peace with him all the year long
madam returned the husband have no fear rest assured that i will so
order matters that you shall never hear a word about it from him if
you can make sure of that quoth the lady i have no more to say and
so her confession ended and her penance enjoined she rose and went to
mass while the luckless husband fuming and fretting hasted to divest
himself of his priests trappings and then went home bent upon devising
some means to bring the priest and his wife together and take his
revenge upon them both
when the lady came home from church she read in her husbands face that
she had spoiled his christmas for him albeit he dissembled to the
uttermost lest she should discover what he had done and supposed
himself to have learned his mind was made up to keep watch for the
priest that very night by his own front door so to the lady he saidi
have to go out tonight to sup and sleep so thou wilt take care that the
front door and the midstair door and the bedroom door are well locked
and for the rest thou mayst go to bed at thine own time well and
good replied the lady and as soon as she was able off she hied her to
the aperture and gave the wonted signal which filippo no sooner heard
than he was at the spot the lady then told him what she had done in the
morning and what her husband had said to her after breakfast
addingsure i am that he will not stir out of the house but will keep
watch beside the door wherefore contrive to come in tonight by the
roof that we may be together madam replied the gallant nothing
loath trust me for that
night came the husband armed and noiselessly hid himself in a room on
the ground floor the lady locked all the doors being especially careful
to secure the midstair door to bar her husbands ascent and in due
time the gallant having found his way cautiously enough over the roof
they got them to bed and there had solace of one another and a good
time and at daybreak the gallant hied him back to his house meanwhile
the husband rueful and supperless half dead with cold kept his armed
watch beside his door momently expecting the priest for the best part
of the night but towards daybreak his powers failing him he lay down
and slept in the groundfloor room twas hard upon tierce when he awoke
and the front door was then open so making as if he had just come in
he went upstairs and breakfasted not long afterwards he sent to his wife
a young fellow disguised as the priests underling who asked her if he
of whom she wist had been with her again the lady who quite understood
what that meant made answer that he had not come that night and that
if he continued to neglect her so twas possible he might be forgotten
though she had no mind to forget him
now to make a long story short the husband passed many a night in the
same way hoping to catch the priest as he came in the lady and her
gallant meanwhile having a good time but at last the husband being able
to stand it no longer sternly demanded of his wife what she had said to
the priest the morning when she was confessed the lady answered that she
was not minded to tell him for that twas not seemly or proper so to do
whereuponsinful woman quoth the husband in thy despite i know
what thou saidst to him and know i must and will who this priest is of
whom thou art enamoured and who by dint of his incantations lies with
thee a nights or i will sluice thy veins for thee tis not true
replied the lady that i am enamoured of a priest how quoth the
husband saidst thou not as much to the priest that confessed thee
thou canst not have had it from him rejoined the lady wast thou then
present thyself for sure i never told him so then tell me quoth the
husband who this priest is and lose no time about it whereat the
lady began to smile andi find it not a little diverting quoth she
that a wise man should suffer himself to be led by a simple woman as a
ram is led by the horns to the shambles albeit no wise man art thou not
since that fatal hour when thou gavest harbourage in thy breast thou
wist not why to the evil spirit of jealousy and the more foolish and
insensate thou art the less glory have i deemest thou my husband that
i am as blind of the bodily eye as thou art of the minds eye nay but
for sure i am not so i knew at a glance the priest that confessed me
and that twas even thyself but i was minded to give thee that of which
thou wast in quest and i gave it thee howbeit if thou hadst been the
wise man thou takest thyself to be thou wouldst not have chosen such a
way as that to worm out thy good ladys secrets nor wouldst thou have
fallen a prey to a baseless suspicion but wouldst have understood that
what she confessed was true and she all the while guiltless i told thee
that i loved a priest and wast not thou whom i love though ill enough
dost thou deserve it turned priest i told thee that there was no door
in my house but would open when he was minded to lie with me and when
thou wouldst fain have access to me what door was ever closed against
thee i told thee that the priest lay nightly with me and what night was
there that thou didst not lie with me thou sentest thy young clerk to
me and thou knowest that as often as thou hadst not been with me i
sent word that the priest had not been with me who but thou that hast
suffered jealousy to blind thee would have been so witless as not to
read such a riddle but thou must needs mount guard at night beside the
door and think to make me believe that thou hadst gone out to sup and
sleep consider thy ways and court not the mockery of those that know
them as i do but turn a man again as thou wast wont to be and let there
be no more of this strict restraint in which thou keepest me for i swear
to thee by god that if i were minded to set horns on thy brow i should
not fail so to take my pastime that thou wouldst never find it out
though thou hadst a hundred eyes as thou hast but two
thus admonished the jealous caitiff who had flattered himself that he
had very cunningly discovered his wifes secret was ashamed and made no
answer save to commend his wifes wit and honour and thus having cause
for jealousy he discarded it as he had erstwhile been jealous without
cause and so the adroit lady had as it were a charter of indulgence
and needed no more to contrive for her lover to come to her over the roof
like a cat but admitted him by the door and using due discretion had
many a good time with him and sped her life gaily
novel vi

madonna isabella has with her leonetto her accepted lover when she is
surprised by one messer lambertuccio by whom she is beloved her husband
coming home about the same time she sends messer lambertuccio forth of
the house drawn sword in hand and the husband afterwards escorts
leonetto home

wondrous was the delight that all the company had of fiammettas story
nor was there any but affirmed that the lady had done excellent well and
dealt with her insensate husband as he deserved however it being ended
the king bade pampinea follow suit which she did on this wisenot a
few there are that in their simplicity aver that love deranges the mind
insomuch that whoso loves becomes as it were witless the folly of which
opinion albeit i doubt it not and deem it abundantly proven by what has
been already said i purpose once again to demonstrate
in our city rich in all manner of good things there dwelt a young
gentlewoman fair exceedingly and wedded to a most worthy and excellent
gentleman and as it not seldom happens that one cannot keep ever to the
same diet but would fain at times vary it so this lady finding her
husband not altogether to her mind became enamoured of a gallant
leonetto by name who though of no high rank was not a little debonair
and courteous and he in like manner fell in love with her and as you
know that tis seldom that what is mutually desired fails to come about
twas not long before they had fruition of their love now the lady
being as i said fair and winsome it so befell that a gentleman messer
lambertuccio by name grew mightily enamoured of her but so tiresome and
odious did she find him that for the world she could not bring herself
to love him so growing tired of fruitlessly soliciting her favour by
ambassage messer lambertuccio who was a powerful signior sent her at
last another sort of message in which he threatened to defame her if she
complied not with his wishes wherefore the lady knowing her man was
terrified and disposed herself to pleasure him
now it so chanced that madonna isabella for such was the ladys name
being gone as is our florentine custom in the summer to spend some time
on a very goodly estate that she had in the contado one morning finding
herself alone for her husband had ridden off to tarry some days
elsewhere she sent for leonetto to come and keep her company and
leonetto came forthwith in high glee but while they were together
messer lambertuccio who having got wind that the husband was away had
mounted his horse and ridden thither quite alone knocked at the door
whereupon the ladys maid hied her forthwith to her mistress who was
alone with leonetto and called her sayingmadam messer lambertuccio
is here below quite alone whereat the lady was vexed beyond measure
and being also not a little dismayed she said to leonettoprithee
let it not irk thee to withdraw behind the curtain and there keep close
until messer lambertuccio be gone leonetto who stood in no less fear
of messer lambertuccio than did the lady got into his hidingplace and
the lady bade the maid go open to messer lambertuccio she did so and
having dismounted and fastened his palfrey to a pin he ascended the
stairs at the head of which the lady received him with a smile and as
gladsome a greeting as she could find words for and asked him on what
errand he was come the gentleman embraced and kissed her sayingmy
soul i am informed that your husband is not here and therefore i am
come to stay a while with you which said they went into the room and
locked them in and messer lambertuccio fell a toying with her
now while thus he sped the time with her it befell that the ladys
husband albeit she nowise expected him came home and as he drew nigh
the palace was observed by the maid who forthwith ran to the ladys
chamber and saidmadam the master will be here anon i doubt he is
already in the courtyard whereupon for that she had two men in the
house and the knights palfrey that was in the courtyard made it
impossible to hide him the lady gave herself up for dead nevertheless
she made up her mind on the spur of the moment and springing out of bed
sir quoth she to messer lambertuccio if you have any regard for me
and would save my life you will do as i bid you that is to say you
will draw your blade and put on a fell and wrathful countenance and hie
you downstairs sayingby god he shall not escape me elsewhere and
if my husband would stop you or ask you aught say nought but what i
have told you and get you on horseback and tarry with him on no
account to hear is to obey quoth messer lambertuccio who with the
flush of his recent exertion and the rage that he felt at the husbands
return still on his face and drawn sword in hand did as she bade him
the ladys husband being now dismounted in the courtyard and not a
little surprised to see the palfrey there was about to go up the stairs
when he saw messer lambertuccio coming down them and marvelling both at
his words and at his mienwhat means this sir quoth he but messer
lambertuccio clapped foot in stirrup and mounted saying nought
butzounds but i will meet him elsewhere and so he rode off
the gentleman then ascended the stairs at the head of which he found his
lady distraught with terror to whom he saidwhat manner of thing is
this after whom goes messer lambertuccio so wrathful and menacing
whereto the lady drawing nigher the room that leonetto might hear her
made answernever sir had i such a fright as this there came
running in here a young man who to me is quite a stranger and at his
heels messer lambertuccio with a drawn sword in his hand and as it
happened the young man found the door of this room open and trembling in
every limb cried outmadam your succour for gods sake that i die
not in your arms so up i got and would have asked him who he was and
how bested when up came messer lambertuccio exclaimingwhere art
thou traitor i planted myself in the doorway and kept him from
entering and seeing that i was not minded to give him admittance he was
courteous enough after not a little parley to take himself off as you
saw whereuponwife quoth the husband thou didst very right
great indeed had been the scandal had some one been slain here and
twas a gross affront on messer lambertuccios part to pursue a fugitive
within the house he then asked where the young man was whereto the
lady answerednay where he may be hiding sir i wot not
sowhere art thou quoth the knight fear not to shew thyself then
forth of his hidingplace all of a tremble for in truth he had been
thoroughly terrified crept leonetto who had heard all that had passed
to whomwhat hast thou to do with messer lambertuccio quoth the
knight nothing in the world replied the young man wherefore i
doubt he must either be out of his mind or have mistaken me for another
for no sooner had he sight of me in the street hard by the palace than
he laid his hand on his sword and exclaimedtraitor thou art a dead
man whereupon i sought not to know why but fled with all speed and
got me here and so thanks to god and this gentlewoman i escaped his
hands now away with thy fears quoth the knight i will see thee
home safe and sound and then twill be for thee to determine how thou
shalt deal with him and so when they had supped he set him on
horseback and escorted him to florence and left him not until he was
safe in his own house and the very same evening following the ladys
instructions leonetto spoke privily with messer lambertuccio and so
composed the affair with him that though it occasioned not a little
talk the knight never wist how he had been tricked by his wife
novel vii

lodovico discovers to madonna beatrice the love that he bears her she
sends egano her husband into a garden disguised as herself and lies
with lodovico who thereafter being risen hies him to the garden and
cudgels egano

this device of madonna isabella thus recounted by pampinea was held
nothing short of marvellous by all the company but being bidden by the
king to tell the next story thus spake filomenaloving ladies if i
mistake not the device of which you shall presently hear from me will
prove to be no less excellent than the last
you are to know then that there dwelt aforetime at paris a florentine
gentleman who being by reason of poverty turned merchant had prospered
so well in his affairs that he was become very wealthy and having by his
lady an only son lodovico by name whose nobility disrelished trade he
would not put him in any shop but that he might be with other gentlemen
he caused him to enter the service of the king of france whereby he
acquired very fine manners and other accomplishments being in this
service lodovico was one day with some other young gallants that talked
of the fair ladies of france and england and other parts of the world
when they were joined by certain knights that were returned from the holy
sepulchre and hearing their discourse one of the knights fell a saying
that of a surety in the whole world so far as he had explored it there
was not any lady of all that he had ever seen that might compare for
beauty with madonna beatrice the wife of egano de galluzzi of bologna
wherein all his companions who in common with him had seen the lady at
bologna concurred which report lodovico who was as yet fancyfree no
sooner heard than he burned with such a yearning to see the lady that he
was able to think of nought else insomuch that he made up his mind to
betake him to bologna to see her and if she pleased him to remain
there to which end he gave his father to understand that he would fain
visit the holy sepulchre whereto his father after no little demur
consented
so to bologna anichinofor so he now called himselfcame and as
fortune would have it the very next day he saw the lady at a festal
gathering and deemed her vastly more beautiful than he had expected
wherefore he waxed most ardently enamoured of her and resolved never to
quit bologna until he had gained her love so casting about how he
should proceed he could devise no other way but to enter her husbands
service which was the more easy that he kept not a few retainers on
this wise lodovico surmised that peradventure he might compass his end
he therefore sold his horses and meetly bestowed his servants bidding
them make as if they knew him not and being pretty familiar with his
host he told him that he was minded to take service with some worthy
lord it any such he might find thou wouldst make quoth the host
the very sort of retainer to suit a gentleman of this city egano by
name who keeps not a few of them and will have all of them presentable
like thee i will mention the matter to him and so he accordingly did
and before he took leave of egano had placed anichino with him to
eganos complete satisfaction
being thus resident with egano and having abundant opportunities of
seeing the fair lady anichino set himself to serve egano with no little
zeal wherein he succeeded so well that egano was more than satisfied
insomuch that by and by there was nought he could do without his advice
and he entrusted to him the guidance not only of himself but of all his
affairs now it so befell that one day when egano was gone a hawking
having left anichino at home madonna beatrice who as yet wist not of
his love albeit she had from time to time taken note of him and his
manners and had not a little approved and commended them sat herself
down with him to a game of chess which to please her anichino most
dexterously contrived to lose to the ladys prodigious delight after a
while the ladys women one and all gave over watching their play and
left them to it whereupon anichino heaved a mighty sigh the lady
looking hard at him saidwhat ails thee anichino is it then such
a mortification to thee to be conquered by me nay madam replied
anichino my sigh was prompted by a much graver matter then if thou
hast any regard for me quoth the lady tell me what it is hearing
himself thus adjured by any regard he had for her whom he loved more
than aught else anichino heaved a yet mightier sigh which caused the
lady to renew her request that he would be pleased to tell her the
occasion of his sighs whereuponmadam said anichino i greatly
fear me that were i to tell it you twould but vex you and moreover
i doubt you might repeat it to some one else rest assured returned
the lady that i shall neither be annoyed nor without thy leave ever
repeat to any other soul aught that thou mayst say then said
anichino having this pledge from you i will tell it you and while
the tears all but stood in his eyes he told her who he was the report
he had heard of her and where and how he had become enamoured of her
and with what intent he had taken service with her husband after which
he humbly besought her that if it might be she would have pity on him
and gratify this his secret and ardent desire and that if she were not
minded so to do she would suffer him to retain his place there and love
her ah bologna how sweetly mixed are the elements in thy women how
commendable in such a case are they all no delight have they in sighs
and tears but are ever inclinable to prayers and ready to yield to the
solicitations of love had i but words apt to praise them as they
deserve my eloquence were inexhaustible
the gentlewomans gaze was fixed on anichino as he spoke she made no
doubt that all he said was true and yielding to his appeal she
entertained his love within her heart in such measure that she too began
to sigh and after a sigh or two made answersweet my anichino be of
good cheer neither presents nor promises nor any courting by gentleman
or lord or whoso else for i have been and am still courted by not a
few was ever able to sway my soul to love any of them but thou by the
few words that thou hast said hast so wrought with me that brief though
the time has been i am already in far greater measure thine than mine
my love i deem thee to have won right worthily and so i give it thee
and vow to give thee joyance thereof before the coming night be past to
which end thou wilt come to my room about midnight i will leave the door
open thou knowest the side of the bed on which i sleep thou wilt come
there should i be asleep thou hast but to touch me and i shall awake
and give thee solace of thy longpent desire in earnest whereof i will
even give thee a kiss so saying she threw her arms about his neck and
lovingly kissed him as anichino her
their colloquy thus ended anichino betook him elsewhere about some
matters which he had to attend to looking forward to midnight with
boundless exultation egano came in from his hawking and after supper
being weary went straight to bed whither the lady soon followed him
leaving as she had promised the door of the chamber open thither
accordingly at the appointed hour came anichino and having softly
entered the chamber and closed the door behind him stole up to where
the lady lay and laying his hand upon her breast found that she was
awake now as soon as she wist that anichino was come she took his hand
in both her own and keeping fast hold of him she turned about in the
bed until she awoke egano whereuponhusband quoth she i would
not say aught of this to thee yestereve because i judged thou wast
weary but tell me upon thy hope of salvation egano whom deemest thou
thy best and most loyal retainer and the most attached to thee of all
that thou hast in the house what a question is this wife returned
egano dost not know him retainer i have none nor ever had so
trusted or loved as anichino but wherefore put such a question
now when anichino wist that egano was awake and heard them talk of
himself he more than once tried to withdraw his hand being mightily
afraid lest the lady meant to play him false but she held it so tightly
that he might not get free while thus she made answer to eganoi will
tell thee what he is i thought that he was all thou sayst and that none
was so loyal to thee as he but he has undeceived me for that yesterday
when thou wast out a hawking he being here chose his time and had the
shamelessness to crave of me compliance with his wanton desires and i
that i might not need other evidence than that of thine own senses to
prove his guilt to thee i made answer that i was well content and that
tonight after midnight i would get me into the garden and await him
there at the foot of the pine now go thither i shall certainly not but
if thou wouldst prove the loyalty of thy retainer thou canst readily do
so if thou but slip on one of my loose robes and cover thy face with a
veil and go down and attend his coming for come i doubt not he will
whereto eganomeet indeed it is quoth he that i should go see
and straightway up he got and as best he might in the dark he put on
one of the ladys loose robes and veiled his face and then hied him to
the garden and sate down at the foot of the pine to await anichino the
lady no sooner wist that he was out of the room than she rose and
locked the door anichino who had never been so terrified in all his
life and had struggled with all his might to disengage his hand from the
ladys clasp and had inwardly cursed her and his love and himself for
trusting her a hundred thousand times was overjoyed beyond measure at
this last turn that she had given the affair and so the lady having got
her to bed again and he at her bidding having stripped and laid him
down beside her they had solace and joyance of one another for a good
while then the lady deeming it unmeet for anichino to tarry longer
with her caused him to get up and resume his clothes saying to
himsweet my mouth thou wilt take a stout cudgel and get thee to the
garden and making as if i were there and thy suit to me had been but to
try me thou wilt give egano a sound rating with thy tongue and a sound
belabouring with thy cudgel the sequel whereof will be wondrously
gladsome and delightful whereupon anichino hied him off to the garden
armed with a staff of wild willow and as he drew nigh the pine egano
saw him and rose and came forward to meet him as if he would receive him
with the heartiest of cheer butah wicked woman quoth anichino
so thou art come thou didst verily believe then that i was that i
am minded thus to wrong my lord foul fall thee a thousand times and
therewith he raised his cudgel and began to lay about him egano
however had heard and seen enough and without a word took to flight
while anichino pursued him crying outaway with thee god send thee a
bad year lewd woman that thou art nor doubt that egano shall hear of
this tomorrow egano having received sundry round knocks got him back
to his chamber with what speed he might and being asked by the lady
whether anichino had come into the gardenwould to god he had not
quoth he for that taking me for thee he has beaten me black and blue
with his cudgel and rated me like the vilest woman that ever was
passing strange indeed it had seemed to me that he should have said
those words to thee with intent to dishonour me and now tis plain that
twas but that seeing thee so blithe and frolicsome he was minded to
prove thee wheretogod be praised returned the lady that he
proved me by words as thee by acts and i doubt not he may say that i
bear his words with more patience than thou his acts but since he is so
loyal to thee we must make much of him and do him honour ay indeed
quoth egano thou sayst sooth
thus was egano fortified in the belief that never had any gentleman wife
so true or retainer so loyal as he and many a hearty laugh had he with
anichino and his lady over this affair which to them was the occasion
that with far less let than might else have been they were able to have
solace and joyance of one another so long as it pleased anichino to
tarry at bologna
novel viii

a husband grows jealous of his wife and discovers that she has warning
of her lovers approach by a piece of packthread which she ties to her
great toe a nights while he is pursuing her lover she puts another
woman in bed in her place the husband finding her there beats her and
cuts off her hair he then goes and calls his wifes brothers who
holding his accusation to be false give him a rating

rare indeed was deemed by common consent the subtlety shewn by madonna
beatrice in the beguilement of her husband and all affirmed that the
terror of anichino must have been prodigious when the lady still
keeping fast hold of him he had heard her say that he had made suit of
love to her however filomena being silent the king turned to neifile
sayingtis now for you to tell whereupon neifile while a slight
smile died away upon her lips thus beganfair ladies to entertain you
with a goodly story such as those which my predecessors have delighted
you withal is indeed a heavy burden but god helping me i trust fairly
well to acquit myself thereof
you are to know then that there dwelt aforetime in our city a most
wealthy merchant arriguccio berlinghieri by name who foolishly as we
wot by daily experience is the way of merchants thinking to compass
gentility by matrimony took to wife a young gentlewoman by no means
suited to him whose name was monna sismonda now monna sismonda seeing
that her husband was much abroad and gave her little of his company
became enamoured of a young gallant ruberto by name who had long
courted her and she being grown pretty familiar with him and using
perchance too little discretion for she affected him extremely it so
befell that arriguccio whether it was that he detected somewhat or
howsoever waxed of all men the most jealous and gave up going abroad
and changed his way of life altogether and made it his sole care to
watch over his wife insomuch that he never allowed himself a wink of
sleep until he had seen her to bed which occasioned the lady the most
grievous dumps because twas on no wise possible for her to be with her
ruberto so casting about in many ways how she might contrive to meet
him and being thereto not a little plied by ruberto himself she
bethought her at last of the following expedient to wit her room
fronting the street and arriguccio as she had often observed being
very hard put to it to get him to sleep but thereafter sleeping very
soundly she resolved to arrange with ruberto that he should come to the
front door about midnight whereupon she would get her down and open the
door and stay some time with him while her husband was in his deep
sleep and that she might have tidings of his arrival yet so as that
none else might wot aught thereof she adopted the device of lowering a
packthread from the bedroom window on such wise that while with one end
it should all but touch the ground it should traverse the floor of the
room until it reached the bed and then be brought under the clothes so
that when she was abed she might attach it to her great toe having so
done she sent word to ruberto that when he came he must be sure to
jerk the packthread and if her husband were asleep she would loose
it and go open to him but if he were awake she would hold it taut and
draw it to herself to let him know that he must not expect her ruberto
fell in with the idea came there many times and now forgathered with
her and again did not but at last they still using this cunning
practice it so befell that one night while the lady slept arriguccio
letting his foot stray more than he was wont about the bed came upon the
packthread and laying his hand upon it found that it was attached to
his ladys great toe and said to himselfthis must be some trick and
afterwards discovering that the thread passed out of the window was
confirmed in his surmise wherefore he softly severed it from the ladys
toe and affixed it to his own and waited all attention to learn the
result of his experiment nor had he long to wait before ruberto came
and arriguccio felt him jerk the thread according to his wont and as
arriguccio had not known how to attach the thread securely and ruberto
jerked it with some force it gave way whereby he understood that he was
to wait and did so arriguccio straightway arose caught up his arms
and hasted to the door to see who might be there intent to do him a
mischief now arriguccio for all he was a merchant was a man of spirit
and of thews and sinews and being come to the door he opened it by no
means gingerly as the lady was wont whereby ruberto who was in
waiting surmised the truth to wit that twas arriguccio by whom the
door was opened wherefore he forthwith took to flight followed by
arriguccio but at length when he had run a long way as arriguccio gave
not up the pursuit he being also armed drew his sword and faced about
and so they fell to arriguccio attacking and ruberto defending himself
now when arriguccio undid the bedroom door the lady awoke and finding
the packthread cut loose from her toe saw at a glance that her trick
was discovered and hearing arriguccio running after ruberto she
forthwith got up foreboding what the result was like to be and called
her maid who was entirely in her confidence whom she so plied with her
obsecrations that at last she got her into bed in her room beseeching
her not to say who she was but to bear patiently all the blows that
arriguccio might give her and she would so reward her that she should
have no reason to complain then extinguishing the light that was in the
room forth she hied her and having found a convenient hidingplace in
the house awaited the turn of events now arriguccio and ruberto being
hotly engaged in the street the neighbours roused by the din of the
combat got up and launched their curses upon them wherefore arriguccio
fearing lest he should be recognized drew off before he had so much as
discovered who the young gallant was or done him any scathe and in a
fell and wrathful mood betook him home stumbling into the bedroom he
cried out angrilywhere art thou lewd woman thou hast put out the
light that i may not be able to find thee but thou hast miscalculated
and going to the bedside he laid hold of the maid taking her to be his
wife and fell a pummelling and kicking her with all the strength he had
in his hands and feet insomuch that he pounded her face wellnigh to
pulp rating her the while like the vilest woman that ever was and last
of all he cut off her hair the maid wept bitterly as indeed she well
might and though from time to time she ejaculated an alas mercy for
gods sake or spare me spare me yet her voice was so broken by her
sobs and arriguccios hearing so dulled by his wrath that he was not
able to discern that twas not his wifes voice but that of another
woman so having soundly thrashed her and cut off her hair as we
saidwicked woman quoth he i touch thee no more but i go to find
thy brothers and shall do them to wit of thy good works and then they
may come here and deal with thee as they may deem their honour demands
and take thee hence for be sure thou shalt no more abide in this house
with this he was gone locking the door of the room behind him and
quitted the house alone
now no sooner did monna sismonda who had heard all that passed perceive
that her husband was gone than she opened the door of the bedroom
rekindled the light and finding her maid all bruises and tears did what
she could to comfort her and carried her back to her own room where
causing her to be privily waited on and tended she helped her so
liberally from arriguccios own store that she confessed herself
content the maid thus bestowed in her room the lady presently hied her
back to her own which she set all in neat and trim order remaking the
bed so that it might appear as if it had not been slept in relighting
the lamp and dressing and tiring herself until she looked as if she had
not been abed that night then taking with her a lighted lamp and some
work she sat her down at the head of the stairs and began sewing while
she waited to see how the affair would end
arriguccio meanwhile had hied him with all speed straight from the house
to that of his wifes brothers where by dint of much knocking he made
himself heard and was admitted the ladys three brothers and her
mother being informed that twas arriguccio got up and having set
lights a burning came to him and asked him on what errand he was come
there at that hour and alone whereupon arriguccio beginning with the
discovery of the packthread attached to his ladys great toe gave them
the whole narrative of his discoveries and doings down to the very end
and to clinch the whole matter he put in their hands the locks which he
had cut as he believed from his wifes head adding that twas now for
them to come for her and deal with her on such wise as they might deem
their honour required seeing that he would nevermore have her in his
house firmly believing what he told them the ladys brothers were very
wroth with her and having provided themselves with lighted torches set
out with arriguccio and hied them to his house with intent to scorn her
while their mother followed weeping and beseeching now one now another
not to credit these matters so hastily until they had seen or heard
somewhat more thereof for that the husband might have some other reason
to be wroth with her and having illtreated her might have trumped up
this charge by way of exculpation adding that if true twas passing
strange for well she knew her daughter whom she had brought up from her
tenderest years and much more to the like effect
however being come to arriguccios house they entered and were
mounting the stairs when monna sismonda hearing them called outwho
is there whereto one of the brothers respondedlewd woman thou
shalt soon have cause enough to know who it is now lord love us
quoth monna sismonda what would he be at then rising she greeted
them withwelcome my brothers but what seek ye abroad at this hour
all three of you they had seen her sitting and sewing with never a sign
of a blow on her face whereas arriguccio had averred that he had
pummelled her all over wherefore their first impression was one of
wonder and refraining the vehemence of their wrath they asked her what
might be the truth of the matter which arriguccio laid to her charge and
threatened her with direful consequences if she should conceal aught
whereto the ladywhat you would have me tell you quoth she or what
arriguccio may have laid to my charge that know not i arriguccio could
but gaze upon her as one that had taken leave of his wits calling to
mind how he had pummelled her about the face times without number and
scratched it for her and mishandled her in all manner of ways and there
he now saw her with no trace of aught of it all upon her however to
make a long story short the ladys brothers told her what arriguccio had
told them touching the packthread and the beating and all the rest of
it whereupon the lady turned to him withalas my husband what is
this that i hear why givest thou me to thy own great shame the
reputation of a lewd woman when such i am not and thyself the
reputation of a wicked and cruel man which thou art not wast thou ever
tonight i say not in my company but so much as in the house until now
or when didst thou beat me for my part i mind me not of it arriguccio
beganhow sayst thou lewd woman did we not go to bed together did i
not come back after chasing thy lover did i not give thee bruises not a
few and cut thy hair for thee but the lady interrupted him
sayingnay thou didst not lie here tonight but leave we this of
which my true words are my sole witness and pass we to this of the
beating thou sayst thou gavest me and how thou didst cut my hair never
a beating had i from thee and i bid all that are here and thee among
them look at me and say if i have any trace of a beating on my person
nor should i advise thee to dare lay hand upon me for by the holy rood
i would spoil thy beauty for thee nor didst thou cut my hair for aught
that i saw or felt however thou didst it perchance on such wise that
i was not ware thereof so let me see whether tis cut or no then
unveiling herself she shewed that her hair was uncut and entire
wherefore her brothers and mother now turned to arriguccio withwhat
means this arriguccio this accords not with what thou gavest us to
understand thou hadst done nor know we how thou wilt prove the residue
arriguccio was lost as it were in a dream and yet he would fain have
spoken but seeing that what he had thought to prove was otherwise he
essayed no reply so the lady turning to her brothersi see quoth
she what he would have he will not be satisfied unless i do what i
never would otherwise have done to wit give you to know what a pitiful
caitiff he is as now i shall not fail to do i make no manner of doubt
that as he has said even so it befell and so he did how you shall
hear this worthy man to whom worse luck you gave me to wife a
merchant as he calls himself and as such would fain have credit and
who ought to be more temperate than a religious and more continent than
a girl lets scarce an evening pass but he goes a boozing in the taverns
and consorting with this or the other woman of the town and tis for me
to await his return until midnight or sometimes until matins even as you
now find me i doubt not that being thoroughly well drunk he got him to
bed with one of these wantons and awaking found the packthread on her
foot and afterwards did actually perform all these brave exploits of
which he speaks and in the end came back to her and beat her and cut
her hair off and being not yet quite recovered from his debauch
believed and i doubt not still believes that twas i that he thus
treated and if you will but scan his face closely you will see that he
is still half drunk but whatever he may have said about me i would
have you account it as nothing more than the disordered speech of a tipsy
man and forgive him as i do whereupon the ladys mother raised no
small outcry sayingby the holy rood my daughter this may not be a
daughter such as thou to be mated with one so unworthy of thee the
pestilent insensate cur should be slain on the spot a pretty state of
things indeed why he might have picked thee up from the gutter now
foul fall him but thou shalt no more be vexed with the tedious drivel of
a petty dealer in asss dung some blackguard belike that came hither
from the country because he was dismissed the service of some petty
squire clad in romagnole with belfrybreeches and a pen in his arse
and for that he has a few pence must needs have a gentlemans daughter
and a fine lady to wife and set up a coat of arms and sayi am of
the such and such and my ancestors did thus and thus ah had my sons
but followed my advice thy honour were safe in the house of the counts
guidi where they might have bestowed thee though thou hadst but a
morsel of bread to thy dowry but they must needs give thee to this rare
treasure who though better daughter and more chaste there is none than
thou in florence has not blushed this very midnight and in our presence
to call thee a strumpet as if we knew thee not gods faith so i were
hearkened to he should shrewdly smart for it then turning to her
sons she saidmy sons i told you plainly enough that this ought not
to be now have you heard how your worthy brotherinlaw treats your
sister petty twopenny trader that he is were it for me to act as it is
for you after what he has said of her and done to her nought would
satisfy or appease me till i had rid the earth of him and were i a man
who am but a woman none other but myself should meddle with the affair
gods curse upon him the woeful shameless sot whereupon the young
men incensed by what they had seen and heard turned to arriguccio and
after giving him the soundest rating that ever was bestowed upon caitiff
concluded as followsthis once we pardon thee witting thee to be a
drunken knavebut as thou holdest thy life dear have a care that
henceforth we hear no such tales of thee for rest assured that if aught
of the kind do reach our ears we will requite thee for both turns
which said they departed arriguccio standing there like one dazed not
witting whether his late doings were actual fact or but a dream made no
more words about the matter but left his wife in peace thus did she by
her address not only escape imminent peril but open a way whereby in
time to come she was able to gratify her passion to the full without any
farther fear of her husband
novel ix

lydia wife of nicostratus loves pyrrhus who to assure himself thereof
asks three things of her all of which she does and therewithal enjoys
him in presence of nicostratus and makes nicostratus believe that what
he saw was not real

so diverting did the ladies find neifiles story that it kept them still
laughing and talking though the king having bidden pamfilo tell his
story had several times enjoined silence upon them however as soon as
they had done pamfilo thus beganmethinks worshipful ladies there is
no venture though fraught with gravest peril that whoso loves ardently
will not make of which truth exemplified though it has been in stories
not a few i purpose to afford you yet more signal proof in one which i
shall tell you wherein you will hear of a lady who in her enterprises
owed far more to the favour of fortune than to the guidance of reason
wherefore i should not advise any of you rashly to follow in her
footsteps seeing that fortune is not always in a kindly mood nor are
the eyes of all men equally holden
in argos that most ancient city of achaia the fame of whose kings of
old time is out of all proportion to its size there dwelt of yore
nicostratus a nobleman to whom when he was already verging on old age
fortune gave to wife a great lady lydia by name whose courage matched
her charms nicostratus as suited with his rank and wealth kept not a
few retainers and hounds and hawks and was mightily addicted to the
chase among his dependants was a young man named pyrrhus a gallant of
no mean accomplishment and goodly of person and beloved and trusted by
nicostratus above all other of whom lydia grew mighty enamoured
insomuch that neither by day nor by night might her thoughts stray from
him but whether it was that pyrrhus wist not her love or would have
none of it he gave no sign of recognition whereby the ladys suffering
waxing more than she could bear she made up her mind to declare her love
to him and having a chambermaid lusca by name in whom she placed great
trust she called her and saidlusca tokens thou hast had from me of
my regard that should ensure thy obedience and loyalty wherefore have a
care that what i shall now tell thee reach the ears of none but him to
whom i shall bid thee impart it thou seest lusca that i am in the
prime of my youth and lustihead and have neither lack nor stint of all
such things as folk desire save only to be brief that i have one cause
to repine to wit that my husbands years so far outnumber my own
wherefore with that wherein young ladies take most pleasure i am but ill
provided and as my desire is no less than theirs tis now some while
since i determined that if fortune has shewn herself so little friendly
to me by giving me a husband so advanced in years at least i will not be
mine own enemy by sparing to devise the means whereby my happiness and
health may be assured and that herein as in all other matters my joy
may be complete i have chosen thereto to minister by his embraces our
pyrrhus deeming him more worthy than any other man and have so set my
heart upon him that i am ever ill at ease save when he is present either
to my sight or to my mind insomuch that unless i forgather with him
without delay i doubt not that twill be the death of me and so if
thou holdest my life dear thou wilt shew him my love on such wise as
thou mayst deem best and make my suit to him that he be pleased to come
to me when thou shalt go to fetch him that gladly will i replied
the chambermaid and as soon as she found convenient time and place she
drew pyrrhus apart and as best she knew how conveyed her ladys
message to him which pyrrhus found passing strange to hear for twas in
truth a complete surprise to him and he doubted the lady did but mean to
try him wherefore he presently and with some asperity answered
thuslusca believe i cannot that this message comes from my lady
have a care therefore what thou sayst and if perchance it does come
from her i doubt she does not mean it and if perchance she does mean
it why then i am honoured by my lord above what i deserve and i would
not for my life do him such a wrong so have a care never to speak of
such matters to me again lusca nowise disconcerted by his uncompliant
tone rejoinedi shall speak to thee pyrrhus of these and all other
matters wherewith i may be commissioned by my lady as often as she
shall bid me whether it pleases or irks thee but thou art a blockhead
so somewhat chafed lusca bore pyrrhus answer back to her lady who
would fain have died when she heard it and some days afterwards resumed
the topic sayingthou knowest lusca that tis not the first stroke
that fells the oak wherefore methinks thou wert best go back to this
strange man who is minded to evince his loyalty at my expense and
choosing a convenient time declare to him all my passion and do thy
best endeavour that the affair be carried through for if it should thus
lapse twould be the death of me besides which he would think we had
but trifled with him and whereas tis his love we would have we should
earn his hatred so after comforting the lady the maid hied her in
quest of pyrrhus whom she found in a gladsome and propitious mood and
thus addressedtis not many days pyrrhus since i declared to thee
how ardent is the flame with which thy lady and mine is consumed for love
of thee and now again i do thee to wit thereof and that if thou shalt
not relent of the harshness that thou didst manifest the other day thou
mayst rest assured that her life will be short wherefore i pray thee to
be pleased to give her solace of her desire and shouldst thou persist in
thy obduracy i that gave thee credit for not a little sense shall deem
thee a great fool how flattered thou shouldst be to know thyself beloved
above all else by a lady so beauteous and highborn and how indebted
shouldst thou feel thyself to fortune seeing that she has in store for
thee a boon so great and so suited to the cravings of thy youth ay and
so like to be of service to thee upon occasion of need bethink thee if
there be any of thine equals whose life is ordered more agreeably than
thine will be if thou but be wise which of them wilt thou find so well
furnished with arms and horses clothes and money as thou shalt be if
thou but give my lady thy love receive then my words with open mind
be thyself again bethink thee that tis fortunes way to confront a man
but once with smiling mien and open lap and if he then accept not her
bounty he has but himself to blame if afterward he find himself in
want in beggary besides which no such loyalty is demanded between
servants and their masters as between friends and kinsfolk rather tis
for servants so far as they may to behave towards their masters as
their masters behave towards them thinkest thou that if thou hadst a
fair wife or mother or daughter or sister that found favour in
nicostratus eyes he would be so scrupulous on the point of loyalty as
thou art disposed to be in regard of his lady thou art a fool if so
thou dost believe hold it for certain that if blandishments and
supplications did not suffice he would whatever thou mightest think of
it have recourse to force observe we then towards them and theirs the
same rule which they observe towards us and ours take the boon that
fortune offers thee repulse her not rather go thou to meet her and
hail her advance for be sure that if thou do not so to say nought of
thy ladys death which will certainly ensue thou thyself wilt repent
thee thereof so often that thou wilt be fain of death
since he had last seen lusca pyrrhus had repeatedly pondered what she
had said to him and had made his mind up that should she come again he
would answer her in another sort and comply in all respects with the
ladys desires provided he might be assured that she was not merely
putting him to the proof wherefore he now made answerlo now lusca
i acknowledge the truth of all that thou sayst but on the other hand i
know that my lord is not a little wise and wary and as he has committed
all his affairs to my charge i sorely misdoubt me that tis with his
approbation and by his advice and but to prove me that lydia does
this wherefore let her do three things which i shall demand of her for
my assurance and then there is nought that she shall crave of me but i
will certainly render her prompt obedience which three things are
thesefirst let her in nicostratus presence kill his fine
sparrowhawk then she must send me a lock of nicostratus beard and
lastly one of his best teeth hard seemed these terms to lusca and hard
beyond measure to the lady but love that great fautor of enterprise
and master of stratagem gave her resolution to address herself to their
performance wherefore through the chambermaid she sent him word that
what he required of her she would do and that without either reservation
or delay and therewithal she told him that as he deemed nicostratus so
wise she would contrive that they should enjoy one another in
nicostratus presence and that nicostratus should believe that twas a
mere show pyrrhus therefore anxiously expected what the lady would do
some days thus passed and then nicostratus gave a great breakfast as
was his frequent wont to certain gentlemen and when the tables were
removed the lady robed in green samite and richly adorned came forth
of her chamber into the hall wherein they sate and before the eyes of
pyrrhus and all the rest of the company hied her to the perch on which
stood the sparrowhawk that nicostratus so much prized and loosed him
and as if she were minded to carry him on her hand took him by the
jesses and dashed him against the wall so that he died
whereuponalas my lady what hast thou done exclaimed nicostratus
but she vouchsafed no answer save that turning to the gentlemen that
had sate at meat with him she saidmy lords ill fitted were i to
take vengeance on a king that had done me despite if i lacked the
courage to be avenged on a sparrowhawk you are to know that by this
bird i have long been cheated of all the time that ought to be devoted by
gentlemen to pleasuring their ladies for with the first streaks of dawn
nicostratus has been up and got him to horse and hawk on hand hied him
to the champaign to see him fly leaving me such as you see me alone
and ill content abed for which cause i have oftentimes been minded to do
that which i have now done and have only refrained therefrom that
biding my time i might do it in the presence of men that should judge my
cause justly as i trust you will do which hearing the gentlemen who
deemed her affections no less fixed on nicostratus than her words
imported broke with one accord into a laugh and turning to nicostratus
who was sore displeased fell a sayingnow well done of the lady to
avenge her wrongs by the death of the sparrowhawk and so the lady
being withdrawn to her chamber they passed the affair off with divers
pleasantries turning the wrath of nicostratus to laughter
pyrrhus who had witnessed what had passed said to himselfnobly
indeed has my lady begun and on such wise as promises well for the
felicity of my love god grant that she so continue and even so lydia
did for not many days after she had killed the sparrowhawk she being
with nicostratus in her chamber from caressing passed to toying and
trifling with him and he sportively pulling her by the hair gave her
occasion to fulfil the second of pyrrhus demands which she did by
nimbly laying hold of one of the lesser tufts of his beard and laughing
the while plucking it so hard that she tore it out of his chin which
nicostratus somewhat resentingnow what cause hast thou quoth she
to make such a wry face tis but that i have plucked some halfdozen
hairs from thy beard thou didst not feel it as much as did i but now thy
tugging of my hair and so they continued jesting and sporting with one
another the lady jealously guarding the tuft that she had torn from the
beard which the very same day she sent to her cherished lover the third
demand caused the lady more thought but being amply endowed with wit
and powerfully seconded by love she failed not to hit upon an apt
expedient
nicostratus had in his service two lads who being of gentle birth had
been placed with him by their kinsfolk that they might learn manners
one of whom when nicostratus sate at meat carved before him while the
other gave him to drink both lads lydia called to her and gave them to
understand that their breath smelt and admonished them that when they
waited on nicostratus they should hold their heads as far back as
possible saying never a word of the matter to any the lads believing
her did as she bade them whereupon she took occasion to say to
nicostratushast thou marked what these lads do when they wait upon
thee troth that have i replied nicostratus indeed i have often
had it in mind to ask them why they do so nay rejoined the lady
spare thyself the pains for i can tell thee the reason which i have
for some time kept close lest it should vex thee but as i now see that
others begin to be ware of it it need no longer be withheld from thee
tis for that thy breath stinks shrewdly that they thus avert their heads
from thee twas not wont to be so nor know i why it should be so and
tis most offensive when thou art in converse with gentlemen and
therefore twould be well to find some way of curing it i wonder what
it could be returned nicostratus is it perchance that i have a
decayed tooth in my jaw that may well be quoth lydia and taking him
to a window she caused him open his mouth and after regarding it on
this side and thatoh nicostratus quoth she how couldst thou have
endured it so long thou hast a tooth here which by what i see is not
only decayed but actually rotten throughout and beyond all manner of
doubt if thou let it remain long in thy head twill infect its
neighbours so tis my advice that thou out with it before the matter
grows worse my judgment jumps with thine quoth nicostratus
wherefore send without delay for a chirurgeon to draw it god forbid
returned the lady that chirurgeon come hither for such a purpose
methinks the case is such that i can very well dispense with him and
draw the tooth myself besides which these chirurgeons do these things
in such a cruel way that i could never endure to see thee or know thee
under the hands of any of them wherefore my mind is quite made up to do
it myself that at least if thou shalt suffer too much i may give it
over at once as a chirurgeon would not do and so she caused the
instruments that are used on such occasions to be brought her and having
dismissed all other attendants save lusca from the chamber and locked
the door made nicostratus lie down on a table set the pincers in his
mouth and clapped them on one of his teeth which while lusca held him
so that albeit he roared for pain he might not move she wrenched by
main force from his jaw and keeping it close took from luscas hand
another and horribly decayed tooth which she shewed him suffering and
half dead as he was sayingsee what thou hadst in thy jaw mark how
far gone it is believing what she said and deeming that now the tooth
was out his breath would no more be offensive and being somewhat eased
of the pain which had been extreme and still remained so that he
murmured not little by divers comforting applications he quitted the
chamber whereupon the lady forthwith sent the tooth to her lover who
having now full assurance of her love placed himself entirely at her
service but the lady being minded to make his assurance yet more sure
and deeming each hour a thousand till she might be with him now saw fit
for the more ready performance of the promise she had given him to feign
sickness and nicostratus coming to see her one day after breakfast
attended only by pyrrhus she besought him for her better solacement to
help her down to the garden wherefore nicostratus on one side and
pyrrhus on the other took her and bore her down to the garden and set
her on a lawn at the foot of a beautiful peartree and after they had
sate there a while the lady who had already given pyrrhus to understand
what he must do said to himpyrrhus i should greatly like to have
some of those pears get thee up the tree and shake some of them down
pyrrhus climbed the tree in a trice and began to shake down the pears
and while he did sofie sir quoth he what is this you do and
you madam have you no shame that you suffer him to do so in my
presence think you that i am blind twas but now that you were gravely
indisposed your cure has been speedy indeed to permit of your so
behaving and as for such a purpose you have so many goodly chambers why
betake you not yourselves to one of them if you must needs so disport
yourselves twould be much more decent than to do so in my presence
whereupon the lady turning to her husbandnow what can pyrrhus mean
said she is he mad nay madam quoth pyrrhus mad am not i think
you i see you not whereat nicostratus marvelled not a little
andpyrrhus quoth he i verily believe thou dreamest nay my
lord replied pyrrhus not a whit do i dream neither do you rather
you wag it with such vigour that if this peartree did the like there
would be never a pear left on it then the ladywhat can this mean
quoth she can it be that it really seems to him to be as he says upon
my hope of salvation were i but in my former health i would get me up
there to judge for myself what these wonders are which he professes to
see whereupon as pyrrhus in the peartree continued talking in the
same strange straincome down quoth nicostratus and when he was
downnow what said nicostratus is it thou sayst thou seest up
there i suppose replied pyrrhus that you take me to be deluded or
dreaming but as i must needs tell you the truth i saw you lying upon
your wife and then when i came down i saw you get up and sit you down
here where you now are therein said nicostratus thou wast
certainly deluded for since thou clombest the peartree we have not
budged a jot save as thou seest then said pyrrhuswhy make more
words about the matter see you i certainly did and seeing you i saw
you lying upon your own nicostratus wonder now waxed momently
insomuch that he saidi am minded to see if this peartree be
enchanted so that whoso is in it sees marvels and so he got him up
into it whereupon the lady and pyrrhus fell to disporting them and
nicostratus seeing what they were about exclaimedah lewd woman
what is this thou doest and thou pyrrhus in whom i so much trusted
and so saying he began to climb down meanwhile the lady and pyrrhus had
made answerwe are sitting here and seeing him descending they
placed themselves as they had been when he had left them whom
nicostratus being come down no sooner saw than he fell a rating them
then quoth pyrrhusverily nicostratus i now acknowledge that as
you said a while ago what i saw when i was in the peartree was but a
false show albeit i had never understood that so it was but that i now
see and know that thou hast also seen a false show and that i speak
truth you may sufficiently assure yourself if you but reflect whether
tis likely that your wife who for virtue and discretion has not her
peer among women would if she were minded so to dishonour you see fit
to do so before your very eyes of myself i say nought albeit i had
liefer be hewn in pieces than that i should so much as think of such a
thing much less do it in your presence wherefore tis evident that tis
some illusion of sight that is propagated from the peartree for nought
in the world would have made me believe that i saw not you lying there in
carnal intercourse with your wife had i not heard you say that you saw
me doing that which most assuredly so far from doing i never so much as
thought of the lady then started up with a most resentful mien and
burst out withfoul fall thee if thou knowest so little of me as to
suppose that if i were minded to do thee such foul dishonour as thou
sayst thou didst see me do i would come hither to do it before thine
eyes rest assured that for such a purpose were it ever mine i should
deem one of our chambers more meet and it should go hard but i would so
order the matter that thou shouldst never know aught of it nicostratus
having heard both and deeming that what they both averred must be true
to wit that they would never have ventured upon such an act in his
presence passed from chiding to talk of the singularity of the thing
and how marvellous it was that the vision should reshape itself for every
one that clomb the tree the lady however made a show of being
distressed that nicostratus should so have thought of her
andverily quoth she no woman neither i nor another shall again
suffer loss of honour by this peartree run pyrrhus and bring hither
an axe and at one and the same time vindicate thy honour and mine by
felling it albeit twere better far nicostratus skull should feel the
weight of the axe seeing that in utter heedlessness he so readily
suffered the eyes of his mind to be blinded for albeit this vision was
seen by the bodily eye yet ought the understanding by no means to have
entertained and affirmed it as real
so pyrrhus presently hied him to fetch the axe and returning therewith
felled the pear whereupon the lady turning towards nicostratusnow
that this foe of my honour is fallen quoth she my wrath is gone from
me nicostratus then craving her pardon she graciously granted it him
bidding him never again to suffer himself to be betrayed into thinking
such a thing of her who loved him more dearly than herself so the poor
duped husband went back with her and her lover to the palace where not
seldom in time to come pyrrhus and lydia took their pastime together more
at ease god grant us the like
novel x

two sienese love a lady one of them being her gossip the gossip dies
having promised his comrade to return to him from the other world which
he does and tells him what sort of life is led there

none now was left to tell save the king who as soon as the ladies had
ceased mourning over the fall of the peartree that had done no wrong
and were silent began thusmost manifest it is that tis the prime
duty of a just king to observe the laws that he has made and if he do
not so he is to be esteemed no king but a slave that has merited
punishment into which fault and under which condemnation i your king
must as of necessity fall for indeed when yesterday i made the law
which governs our discourse of today i thought not today to avail
myself of my privilege but to submit to the law no less than you and
to discourse of the same topic whereof you all have discoursed but not
only has the very story been told which i had intended to tell but
therewithal so many things else and so very much goodlier have been
said that search my memory as i may i cannot mind me of aught nor wot
i that touching such a matter there is indeed aught for me to say that
would be comparable with what has been said wherefore as infringe i
must the law that i myself have made i confess myself worthy of
punishment and instantly declaring my readiness to pay any forfeit that
may be demanded of me am minded to have recourse to my wonted privilege
and such dearest ladies is the potency of elisas story of the
godfather and his gossip and therewith of the simplicity of the sienese
that i am prompted thereby to pass from this topic of the beguilement of
foolish husbands by their cunning wives to a little story touching these
same sienese which albeit there is not a little therein which you were
best not to believe may yet be in some degree entertaining to hear
know then that at siena there dwelt in porta salaia two young men of
the people named the one tingoccio mini the other meuccio di tura
who by what appeared loved one another not a little for they were
scarce ever out of one anothers company and being wont like other
folk to go to church and listen to sermons they heard from time to time
of the glory and the woe which in the other world are allotted
according to merit to the souls of the dead of which matters craving
but being unable to come by more certain assurance they agreed together
that whichever of them should die first should if he might return to
the survivor and certify him of that which he would fain know and this
agreement they confirmed with an oath now after they had made this
engagement and while they were still constantly together tingoccio
chanced to become sponsor to one ambruogio anselmini that dwelt in campo
reggi who had had a son by his wife monna mita the lady was exceeding
fair and amorous withal and tingoccio being wont sometimes to visit her
as his gossip and to take meuccio with him he notwithstanding his
sponsorship grew enamoured of her as did also meuccio for she pleased
him not a little and he heard her much commended by tingoccio which
love each concealed from the other but not for the same reason
tingoccio was averse to discover it to meuccio for that he deemed it an
ignominious thing to love his gossip and was ashamed to let any one know
it meuccio was on his guard for a very different reason to wit that he
was already ware that the lady was in tingoccios good graces wherefore
he said to himselfif i avow my love to him he will be jealous of me
and as being her gossip he can speak with her as often as he pleases
he will do all he can to make her hate me and so i shall never have any
favour of her
now the two young men being thus as i have said on terms of most
familiar friendship it befell that tingoccio being the better able to
open his heart to the lady did so order his demeanour and discourse that
he had from her all that he desired nor was his friends success hidden
from meuccio though much as it vexed him yet still cherishing the hope
of eventually attaining his end and fearing to give tingoccio occasion
to baulk or hamper him in some way he feigned to know nought of the
matter so tingoccio more fortunate than his comrade and rival in love
did with such assiduity till his gossips good land that he got thereby a
malady which in the course of some days waxed so grievous that he
succumbed thereto and departed this life and on the night of the third
day after his decease perchance because earlier he might not he made
his appearance according to his promise in meuccios chamber and
called meuccio who was fast asleep by his name whereuponwho art
thou quoth meuccio as he awoke tis i tingoccio replied he come
back in fulfilment of the pledge i gave thee to give thee tidings of
the other world for a while meuccio saw him not without terror then
his courage revivingwelcome my brother quoth he and proceeded to
ask him if he were lost nought is lost but what is irrecoverable
replied tingoccio how then should i be here if i were lost nay
quoth then meuccio i mean it not so i would know of thee whether thou
art of the number of the souls that are condemned to the penal fire of
hell why no returned tingoccio not just that but still for the
sins that i did i am in most sore and grievous torment meuccio then
questioned tingoccio in detail of the pains there meted out for each of
the sins done here and tingoccio enumerated them all whereupon meuccio
asked if there were aught he might do for him here on earth tingoccio
answered in the affirmative to wit that he might have masses and
prayers said and almsdeeds done for him for that such things were of
great service to the souls there that gladly will i replied meuccio
and then as tingoccio was about to take his leave he bethought him of
the gossip and raising his head a little he saidi mind me
tingoccio of the gossip with whom thou wast wont to lie when thou wast
here now what is thy punishment for that my brother returned
tingoccio as soon as i got down there i met one that seemed to know
all my sins by heart who bade me betake me to a place where while in
direst torment i bewept my sins i found comrades not a few condemned to
the same pains and so standing there among them and calling to mind
what i had done with the gossip and foreboding in requital thereof a
much greater torment than had yet been allotted me albeit i was in a
great and most vehement flame i quaked for fear in every part of me
which one that was beside me observingwhat quoth he hast thou
done more than the rest of us that are here that thou quakest thus as
thou standest in the fire my friend quoth i i am in mortal fear of
the doom that i expect for a great sin that i once committed he then
asked what sin it might be twas on this wise replied i i lay with
my gossip and that so much that i died thereof whereat he did but
laugh sayinggo to fool make thy mind easy for here there is no
account taken of gossips which completely revived my drooping spirits
twas now near daybreak whereforeadieu meuccio quoth his friend
for longer tarry with thee i may not and so he vanished as for
meuccio having learned that no account was taken of gossips in the other
world he began to laugh at his own folly in that he had already spared
divers such and so being quit of his ignorance he in that respect in
course of time waxed wise which matters had fra rinaldo but known he
would not have needed to go about syllogizing in order to bring his fair
gossip to pleasure him
the sun was westering and a light breeze blew when the king his story
ended and none else being left to speak arose and taking off the
crown set it on laurettas head sayingmadam i crown you with
yourself1 queen of our company tis now for you as our sovereign
lady to make such ordinances as you shall deem meet for our common
solace and delectation and having so said he sat him down again queen
lauretta sent for the seneschal and bade him have a care that the tables
should be set in the pleasant vale somewhat earlier than had been their
wont that their return to the palace might be more leisurely after
which she gave him to know what else he had to do during her sovereignty
then turning to the companyyesterday quoth she dioneo would have
it that today we should discourse of the tricks that wives play their
husbands and but that i am minded not to shew as of the breed of yelping
curs that are ever prompt to retaliate i would ordain that tomorrow we
discourse of the tricks that husbands play their wives however in lieu
thereof i will have every one take thought to tell of those tricks that
daily woman plays man or man woman or one man another wherein i
doubt not there will be matter of discourse no less agreeable than has
been that of today so saying she rose and dismissed the company until
suppertime so the ladies and the men being risen some bared their feet
and betook them to the clear water there to disport them while others
took their pleasure upon the green lawn amid the trees that there grew
goodly and straight for no brief while dioneo and fiammetta sang in
concert of arcite and palamon and so each and all taking their several
pastimes they sped the hours with exceeding great delight until
suppertime which being come they sat them down at table beside the
little lake and there while a thousand songsters charmed their ears
and a gentle breeze that blew from the environing hills fanned them
and never a fly annoyed them reposefully and joyously they supped the
tables removed they roved a while about the pleasant vale and then the
sun being still high for twas but half vespers the queen gave the
word and they wended their way back to their wonted abode and going
slowly and beguiling the way with quips and quirks without number upon
divers matters nor those alone of which they had that day discoursed
they arrived hard upon nightfall at the goodly palace there the short
walks fatigue dispelled by wines most cool and comfits they presently
gathered for the dance about the fair fountain and now they footed it to
the strains of tindaros cornemuse and now to other music which done
the queen bade filomena give them a song and thus filomena sang
ah woe is me my soul
  ah shall i ever thither fare again
  whence i was parted to my grievous dole
full sure i know not but within my breast
  throbs ever the same fire
  of yearning there where erst i was to be
  o thou in whom is all my weal my rest
  lord of my hearts desire
  ah tell me thou for none to ask save thee
  neither dare i nor see
  ah dear my lord this wasted heart disdain
  thou wilt not but with hope at length console
kindled the flame i know not what delight
  which me doth so devour
  that day and night alike i find no ease
  for whether it was by hearing touch or sight
  unwonted was the power
  and fresh the fire that me each way did seize
  wherein without release
  i languish still and of thee lord am fain
  for thou alone canst comfort and make whole
ah tell me if it shall be and how soon
  that i again thee meet
  where those deathdealing eyes i kissed thou chief
  weal of my soul my very soul this boon
  deny not say that fleet
  thou hiest hither comfort thus my grief
  ah let the time be brief
  till thou art here and then long time remain
  for i lovestricken crave but loves control
let me but once again mine own thee call
  no more so indiscreet
  as erst ill be to let thee from me part
  nay ill still hold thee let what may befall
  and of thy mouth so sweet
  such solace take as may content my heart
  so this be all my art
  thee to entice me with thine arms to enchain
  whereon but musing inly chants my soul
this song set all the company conjecturing what new and delightsome love
might now hold filomena in its sway and as its words imported that she
had had more joyance thereof than sight alone might yield some that were
there grew envious of her excess of happiness however the song being
ended the queen bethinking her that the morrow was friday thus
graciously addressed them allye wot noble ladies and ye also my
gallants that tomorrow is the day that is sacred to the passion of our
lord which if ye remember we kept devoutly when neifile was queen
intermitting delectable discourse as we did also on the ensuing
saturday wherefore being minded to follow neifiles excellent example
i deem that now as then twere a seemly thing to surcease from this our
pastime of storytelling for those two days and compose our minds to
meditation on what was at that season accomplished for the weal of our
souls all the company having approved their queens devout speech she
as the night was now far spent dismissed them and so they all betook
them to slumber
1 a play upon laurea laurel wreath and lauretta

endeth here the seventh day of the decameron beginneth the eighth in
which under the rule of lauretta discourse is had of those tricks that
daily woman plays man or man woman or one man another

the summits of the loftiest mountains were already illumined by the rays
of the rising sun the shades of night were fled and all things plainly
visible when the queen and her company arose and hied them first to the
dewy mead where for a while they walked then about half tierce they
wended their way to a little church that was hard by where they heard
divine service after which they returned to the palace and having
breakfasted with gay and gladsome cheer and sung and danced a while
were dismissed by the queen to rest them as to each might seem good but
when the sun was past the meridian the queen mustered them again for
their wonted pastime and all being seated by the fair fountain thus
at her command neifile began
novel i

gulfardo borrows moneys of guasparruolo which he has agreed to give
guasparruolos wife that he may lie with her he gives them to her and
in her presence tells guasparruolo that he has done so and she
acknowledges that tis true

sith god has ordained that tis for me to take the lead today with my
story well pleased am i and for that loving ladies much has been said
touching the tricks that women play men i am minded to tell you of one
that a man played a woman not because i would censure what the man did
or say that twas not merited by the woman but rather to commend the man
and censure the woman and to shew that men may beguile those that think
to beguile them as well as be beguiled by those they think to beguile
for peradventure what i am about to relate should in strictness of speech
not be termed beguilement but rather retaliation for as it behoves
woman to be most strictly virtuous and to guard her chastity as her very
life nor on any account to allow herself to sully it which
notwithstanding tis not possible by reason of our frailty that there
should be as perfect an observance of this law as were meet i affirm
that she that allows herself to infringe it for money merits the fire
whereas she that so offends under the prepotent stress of love will
receive pardon from any judge that knows how to temper justice with
mercy witness what but the other day we heard from filostrato touching
madonna filippa at prato1
know then that there was once at milan a german mercenary gulfardo by
name a doughty man and very loyal to those with whom he took service a
quality most uncommon in germans and as he was wont to be most faithful
in repaying whatever moneys he borrowed he would have had no difficulty
in finding a merchant to advance him any amount of money at a low rate of
interest now tarrying thus at milan gulfardo fixed his affection on a
very fine woman named madonna ambruogia the wife of a wealthy merchant
one guasparruolo cagastraccio with whom he was well acquainted and on
friendly terms which amour he managed with such discretion that neither
the husband nor any one else wist aught of it so one day he sent her a
message beseeching her of her courtesy to gratify his passion and
assuring her that he on his part was ready to obey her every behest
the lady made a great many words about the affair the upshot of which
was that she would do as gulfardo desired upon the following terms to
wit that in the first place he should never discover the matter to a
soul and secondly that as for some purpose or another she required
two hundred florins of gold he out of his abundance should supply her
necessity these conditions being satisfied she would be ever at his
service offended by such base sordidness in one whom he had supposed to
be an honourable woman gulfardo passed from ardent love to something
very like hatred and cast about how he might flout her so he sent her
word that he would right gladly pleasure her in this and in any other
matter that might be in his power let her but say when he was to come to
see her and he would bring the moneys with him and none should know of
the matter except a comrade of his in whom he placed much trust and who
was privy to all that he did the lady if she should not rather be
called the punk gleefully made answer that in the course of a few days
her husband guasparruolo was to go to genoa on business and that when
he was gone she would let gulfardo know and appoint a time for him to
visit her gulfardo thereupon chose a convenient time and hied him to
guasparruolo to whomi am come quoth he about a little matter of
business which i have on hand for which i require two hundred florins of
gold and i should be glad if thou wouldst lend them me at the rate of
interest which thou art wont to charge me that gladly will i replied
guasparruolo and told out the money at once a few days later
guasparruolo being gone to genoa as the lady had said she sent word to
gulfardo that he should bring her the two hundred florins of gold so
gulfardo hied him with his comrade to the ladys house where he found
her expecting him and lost no time in handing her the two hundred
florins of gold in his comrades presence sayingyou will keep the
money madam and give it to your husband when he returns witting not
why gulfardo so said but thinking that twas but to conceal from his
comrade that it was given by way of price the lady made answerthat
will i gladly but i must first see whether the amount is right
whereupon she told the florins out upon a table and when she found that
the two hundred were there she put them away in high glee and turning
to gulfardo took him into her chamber where not on that night only but
on many another night while her husband was away he had of her all that
he craved on guasparruolos return gulfardo presently paid him a visit
having first made sure that the lady would be with him and so in her
presenceguasparruolo quoth he i had after all no occasion for the
money to wit the two hundred florins of gold that thou didst lend me
the other day being unable to carry through the transaction for which i
borrowed them and so i took an early opportunity of bringing them to thy
wife and gave them to her thou wilt therefore cancel the account
whereupon guasparruolo turned to the lady and asked her if she had had
them she not daring to deny the fact in presence of the witness
answeredwhy yes i had them and quite forgot to tell thee good
quoth then guasparruolo we are quits gulfardo make thy mind easy i
will see that thy account is set right gulfardo then withdrew leaving
the flouted lady to hand over her illgotten gains to her husband and so
the astute lover had his pleasure of his greedy mistress for nothing

the good lady returns him with a gibe

ladies and men alike commended gulfardo for the check that he gave to the
greed of the milanese lady but before they had done the queen turned to
pamfilo and with a smile bade him follow suit wherefore thus pamfilo
beganfair my ladies it occurs to me to tell you a short story which
reflects no credit on those by whom we are continually wronged without
being able to retaliate to wit the priests who have instituted a
crusade against our wives and deem that when they have made conquest of
one of them they have done a work every whit as worthy of recompense by
remission of sin and punishment as if they had brought the soldan in
chains to avignon in which respect tis not possible for the hapless
laity to be even with them howbeit they are as hot to make reprisals on
the priests mothers sisters mistresses and daughters as the priests
to attack their wives wherefore i am minded to give you as i may do in
few words the history of a rustic amour the conclusion whereof was not
a little laughable nor barren of moral for you may also gather
therefrom that tis not always well to believe everything that a priest
says
i say then that at varlungo a village hard by here as all of you my
ladies should wot either of your own knowledge or by report there dwelt
a worthy priest and doughty of body in the service of the ladies who
albeit he was none too quick at his book had no lack of precious and
blessed solecisms to edify his flock withal of a sunday under the elm
and when the men were out of doors he would visit their wives as never a
priest had done before him bringing them feastday gowns and holy water
and now and again a bit of candle and giving them his blessing now it
so befell that among those of his fair parishioners whom he most affected
the first place was at length taken by one monna belcolore the wife of a
husbandman that called himself bentivegna del mazzo and in good sooth
she was a winsome and lusty country lass brown as a berry and buxom
enough and fitter than eer another for his mill moreover she had not
her match in playing the tabret and singingthe borage is full
sappy1 and in leading a brawl or a breakdown no matter who might be
next her with a fair and dainty kerchief in her hand which spells so
wrought upon master priest that for love of her he grew distracted and
did nought all day long but loiter about the village on the chance of
catching sight of her and if of a sunday morning he espied her in
church he strove might and main to acquit himself of his kyrie and
sanctus in the style of a great singer albeit his performance was liker
to the braying of an ass whereas if he saw her not he scarce exerted
himself at all however he managed with such discretion that neither
bentivegna del mazzo nor any of the neighbours wist aught of his love
and hoping thereby to ingratiate himself with monna belcolore he from
time to time would send her presents now a clove of fresh garlic the
best in all the countryside from his own garden which he tilled with
his own hands and anon a basket of beans or a bunch of chives or
shallots and when he thought it might serve his turn he would give her
a sly glance and follow it up with a little amorous mocking and mowing
which she with rustic awkwardness feigned not to understand and ever
maintained her reserve so that master priest made no headway
now it so befell that one day when the priest at high noon was aimlessly
gadding about the village he encountered bentivegna del mazzo at the
tail of a well laden ass and greeted him asking him whither he was
going ifaith sir quoth bentivegna for sure tis to town i go
having an affair or two to attend to there and i am taking these things
to ser buonaccorri da ginestreto to get him to stand by me in i wot not
what matter whereof the justice o th coram has by his provoker served
me with a pertrumpery summons to appear before him whereupontis
well my son quoth the priest overjoyed my blessing go with thee
good luck to thee and a speedy return and harkye shouldst thou see
lapuccio or naldino do not forget to tell them to send me those thongs
for my flails it shall be done quoth bentivegna and jogged on
towards florence while the priest thinking that now was his time to hie
him to belcolore and try his fortune put his best leg forward and
stayed not till he was at the house which entering he saidgod be
gracious to us who is within belcolore who was up in the loft made
answerwelcome sir but what dost thou gadding about in the heat
why as i hope for gods blessing quoth he i am just come to stay
with thee a while having met thy husband on his way to town whereupon
down came belcolore took a seat and began sifting cabbageseed that her
husband had lately threshed by and by the priest beganso belcolore
wilt thou keep me ever a dying thus whereat belcolore tittered and
saidwhy what ist i do to you truly nothing at all replied the
priest but thou sufferest me not to do to thee that which i had lief
and which god commands now away with you returned belcolore do
priests do that sort of thing indeed we do quoth the priest and to
better purpose than others why not i tell you our grinding is far
better and wouldst thou know why tis because tis intermittent and in
truth twill be well worth thy while to keep thine own counsel and let
me do it worth my while ejaculated belcolore how may that be
there is never a one of you but would overreach the very devil tis
not for me to say returned the priest say but what thou wouldst have
shall it be a pair of dainty shoes or wouldst thou prefer a fillet or
perchance a gay riband whats thy will marry no lack have i quoth
belcolore of such things as these but if you wish me so well why do
me not a service and i would then be at your command name but the
service returned the priest and gladly will i do it quoth then
belcoloreon saturday i have to go to florence to deliver some wool
that i have spun and to get my spinningwheel put in order lend me but
five poundsi know you have themand i will redeem my perse petticoat
from the pawnshop and also the girdle that i wear on saints days and
that i had when i was marriedyou see that without them i cannot go to
church or anywhere else and then i will do just as you wish thenceforth
and forever whereuponso god give me a good year quoth he as i
have not the money with me but never fear that i will see that thou hast
it before saturday with all the pleasure in life ay ay rejoined
belcolore you all make great promises but then you never keep them
think you to serve me as you served biliuzza whom you left in the lurch
at last gods faith you do not so to think that she turned woman of
the world just for that if you have not the money with you why go and
get it prithee returned the priest send me not home just now for
seest thou tis the very nick of time with me and the coast is clear
and perchance it might not be so on my return and in short i know not
when it would be likely to go so well as now whereto she did but
rejoingood if you are minded to go get you gone if not stay where
you are the priest therefore seeing that she was not disposed to give
him what he wanted as he was fain to wit on his own terms but was
bent upon having a quid pro quo changed his tone andlo now quoth
he thou doubtest i will not bring thee the money so to set thy mind at
rest i will leave thee this cloakthou seest tis good skyblue
silkin pledge so raising her head and glancing at the cloakand
what may the cloak be worth quoth belcolore worth ejaculated the
priest i would have thee know that tis all douai not to say trouai
make nay there are some of our folk here that say tis quadrouai and
tis not a fortnight since i bought it of lotto the secondhand dealer
for seven good pounds and then had it five good soldi under value by
what i hear from buglietto who thou knowest is an excellent judge of
these articles oh say you so exclaimed belcolore so help me god
i should not have thought it however let me look at it so master
priest being ready for action doffed the cloak and handed it to her
and she having put it in a safe place said to himnow sir we will
away to the hut there is never a soul goes there and so they did and
there master priest giving her many a mighty buss and straining her to
his sacred person solaced himself with her no little while
which done he hied him away in his cassock as if he were come from
officiating at a wedding but when he was back in his holy quarters he
bethought him that not all the candles that he received by way of
offering in the course of an entire year would amount to the half of five
pounds and saw that he had made a bad bargain and repented him that he
had left the cloak in pledge and cast about how he might recover it
without paying anything and as he did not lack cunning he hit upon an
excellent expedient by which he compassed his end so on the morrow
being a saints day he sent a neighbours lad to monna belcolore with a
request that she would be so good as to lend him her stone mortar for
that binguccio dal poggio and nuto buglietti were to breakfast with him
that morning and he therefore wished to make a sauce belcolore having
sent the mortar the priest about breakfast time reckoning that
bentivegna del mazzo and belcolore would be at their meal called his
clerk and said to himtake the mortar back to belcolore and
saymy master thanks you very kindly and bids you return the cloak
that the lad left with you in pledge the clerk took the mortar to
belcolores house where finding her at table with bentivegna he set
the mortar down and delivered the priests message whereto belcolore
would fain have demurred but bentivegna gave her a threatening glance
sayingso then thou takest a pledge from master priest by christ i
vow i have half a mind to give thee a great clout o the chin go give
it back at once a murrain on thee and look to it that whatever he may
have a mind to were it our very ass he be never denied so with a
very bad grace belcolore got up and went to the wardrobe and took out
the cloak and gave it to the clerk sayingtell thy master from
mewould to god he may never ply pestle in my mortar again such honour
has he done me for this turn so the clerk returned with the cloak and
delivered the message to master priest who laughing made
answertell her when thou next seest her that so she lend us not
the mortar i will not lend her the pestle be it tit for tat
bentivegna made no account of his wifes words deeming that twas but
his chiding that had provoked them but belcolore was not a little
displeased with master priest and had never a word to say to him till
the vintage after which what with the salutary fear in which she stood
of the mouth of lucifer the great to which he threatened to consign her
and the must and roast chestnuts that he sent her she made it up with
him and many a jolly time they had together and though she got not the
five pounds from him he put a new skin on her tabret and fitted it with
a little bell wherewith she was satisfied

novel iii

calandrino bruno and buffalmacco go in quest of the heliotrope beside
the mugnone thinking to have found it calandrino gets him home laden
with stones his wife chides him whereat he waxes wroth beats her and
tells his comrades what they know better than he

ended pamfilos story which moved the ladies to inextinguishable
laughter the queen bade elisa follow suit whereupon laughing she thus
begani know not debonair my ladies whether with my little story
which is no less true than entertaining i shall give you occasion to
laugh as much as pamfilo has done with his but i will do my best
in our city where there has never been lack of odd humours and queer
folk there dwelt no long time ago a painter named calandrino a simple
soul of uncouth manners that spent most of his time with two other
painters the one bruno the other buffalmacco by name pleasant fellows
enough but not without their full share of sound and shrewd sense and
who kept with calandrino for that they not seldom found his singular ways
and his simplicity very diverting there was also at the same time at
florence one maso del saggio a fellow marvellously entertaining by his
cleverness dexterity and unfailing resource who having heard somewhat
touching calandrinos simplicity resolved to make fun of him by playing
him a trick and inducing him to believe some prodigy and happening one
day to come upon calandrino in the church of san giovanni where he sate
intently regarding the paintings and intaglios of the tabernacle above
the altar which had then but lately been set there he deemed time and
place convenient for the execution of his design which he accordingly
imparted to one of his comrades whereupon the two men drew nigh the
place where calandrino sate alone and feigning not to see him fell a
talking of the virtues of divers stones of which maso spoke as aptly and
pertinently as if he had been a great and learned lapidary calandrino
heard what passed between them and witting that twas no secret after a
while got up and joined them to masos no small delight he therefore
continued his discourse and being asked by calandrino where these
stones of such rare virtues were to be found made answerchiefly in
berlinzone in the land of the basques the district is called bengodi
and there they bind the vines with sausages and a denier will buy a
goose and a gosling into the bargain and on a mountain all of grated
parmesan cheese dwell folk that do nought else but make macaroni and
raviuoli1 and boil them in capons broth and then throw them down to
be scrambled for and hard by flows a rivulet of vernaccia the best that
ever was drunk and never a drop of water therein ah tis a sweet
country quoth calandrino but tell me what becomes of the capons that
they boil they are all eaten by the basques replied maso
thenwast thou ever there quoth calandrino whereuponwas i ever
there sayst thou replied maso why if i have been there once i have
been there a thousand times and how many miles ist from here quoth
calandrino oh returned maso more than thou couldst number in a
night without slumber farther off then than the abruzzi said
calandrino why yes tis a bit farther replied maso
now calandrino like the simple soul that he was marking the composed
and grave countenance with which maso spoke could not have believed him
more thoroughly if he had uttered the most patent truth and thus taking
his words for gospeltis a trifle too far for my purse quoth he
were it nigher i warrant thee i would go with thee thither one while
just to see the macaroni come tumbling down and take my fill thereof
but tell me so good luck befall thee are none of these stones that
have these rare virtues to be found in these regions ay replied
maso two sorts of stone are found there both of virtues extraordinary
the one sort are the sandstones of settignano and montisci which being
made into millstones by virtue thereof flour is made wherefore tis a
common saying in those countries that blessings come from god and
millstones from montisci but for that these sandstones are in great
plenty they are held cheap by us just as by them are emeralds whereof
they have mountains bigger than monte morello that shine at midnight a
gods name and know this that whoso should make a goodly pair of
millstones and connect them with a ring before ever a hole was drilled
in them and take them to the soldan should get all he would have
thereby the other sort of stone is the heliotrope as we lapidaries call
it a stone of very great virtue inasmuch as whoso carries it on his
person is seen so long as he keep it by never another soul where he is
not these be virtues great indeed quoth calandrino but where is
this second stone to be found whereto maso made answer that there were
usually some to be found in the mugnone and what are its size and
colour quoth calandrino the size varies replied maso for some are
bigger and some smaller than others but all are of the same colour
being nearly black all these matters duly marked and fixed in his
memory calandrino made as if he had other things to attend to and took
his leave of maso with the intention of going in quest of the stone but
not until he had let his especial friends bruno and buffalmacco know of
his project so that no time might be lost but postponing everything
else they might begin the quest at once he set about looking for them
and spent the whole morning in the search at length when twas already
past none he called to mind that they would be at work in the faentine
womens convent and though twas excessively hot he let nothing stand
in his way but at a pace that was more like a run than a walk hied him
thither and so soon as he had made them ware of his presence thus he
spokecomrades so you are but minded to hearken to me tis in our
power to become the richest men in florence for i am informed by one
that may be trusted that there is a kind of stone in the mugnone which
renders whoso carries it invisible to every other soul in the world
wherefore methinks we were wise to let none have the start of us but
go search for this stone without any delay we shall find it without a
doubt for i know what tis like and when we have found it we have but
to put it in the purse and get us to the moneychangers whose counters
as you know are always laden with groats and florins and help ourselves
to as many as we have a mind to no one will see us and so hey presto
we shall be rich folk in the twinkling of an eye and have no more need
to go besmearing the walls all day long like so many snails whereat
bruno and buffalmacco began only to laugh and exchanging glances made
as if they marvelled exceedingly and expressed approval of calandrinos
project then buffalmacco asked what might be the name of the stone
calandrino like the numskull that he was had already forgotten the
name so he made answerwhy need we concern ourselves with the name
since we know the stones virtue methinks we were best to go look for
it and waste no more time well well said bruno but what are the
size and shape of the stone they are of all sizes and shapes said
calandrino but they are all pretty nearly black wherefore methinks
we were best to collect all the black stones that we see until we hit
upon it and so let us be off and lose no more time nay but said
bruno wait a bit and turning to buffalmaccomethinks quoth he
that calandrino says well but i doubt this is not the time for such
work seeing that the sun is high and his rays so flood the mugnone as
to dry all the stones insomuch that stones will now shew as white that
in the morning before the sun had dried them would shew as black
besides which today being a workingday there will be for one cause or
another folk not a few about the mugnone who seeing us might guess
what we were come for and peradventure do the like themselves whereby
it might well be that they found the stone and we might miss the trot by
trying after the amble wherefore so you agree methinks we were best to
go about it in the morning when we shall be better able to distinguish
the black stones from the white and on a holiday when there will be
none to see us
buffalmaccos advice being approved by bruno calandrino chimed in and
so twas arranged that they should all three go in quest of the stone on
the following sunday so calandrino having besought his companions above
all things to let never a soul in the world hear aught of the matter for
that it had been imparted to him in strict confidence and having told
them what he had heard touching the land of bengodi the truth of which
he affirmed with oaths took leave of them and they concerted their
plan while calandrino impatiently expected the sunday morning whereon
about dawn he arose and called them and forth they issued by the porta
a san gallo and hied them to the mugnone and following its course
began their quest of the stone calandrino as was natural leading the
way and jumping lightly from rock to rock and wherever he espied a
black stone stooping down picking it up and putting it in the fold of
his tunic while his comrades followed picking up a stone here and a
stone there thus it was that calandrino had not gone far before
finding that there was no more room in his tunic he lifted the skirts of
his gown which was not cut after the fashion of hainault and gathering
them under his leathern girdle and making them fast on every side thus
furnished himself with a fresh and capacious lap which however taking
no long time to fill he made another lap out of his cloak which in like
manner he soon filled with stones wherefore bruno and buffalmacco
seeing that calandrino was well laden and that twas nigh upon
breakfasttime and the moment for action comewhere is calandrino
quoth bruno to buffalmacco whereto buffalmacco who had calandrino full
in view having first turned about and looked here there and everywhere
made answerthat wot not i but not so long ago he was just in front
of us not so long ago forsooth returned bruno tis my firm belief
that at this very moment he is at breakfast at home having left to us
this wildgoose chase of black stones in the mugnone marry quoth
buffalmacco he did but serve us right so to trick us and leave seeing
that we were so silly as to believe him why who could have thought that
any but we would have been so foolish as to believe that a stone of such
rare virtue was to be found in the mugnone calandrino hearing their
colloquy forthwith imagined that he had the stone in his hand and by
its virtue though present was invisible to them and overjoyed by such
good fortune would not say a word to undeceive them but determined to
hie him home and accordingly faced about and put himself in motion
whereuponay quoth buffalmacco to bruno what are we about that we
go not back too go we then said bruno but by god i swear that
calandrino shall never play me another such trick and as to this were i
nigh him as i have been all the morning i would teach him to remember
it for a month or so such a reminder would i give him in the heel with
this stone and even as he spoke he threw back his arm and launched the
stone against calandrinos heel galled by the blow calandrino gave a
great hop and a slight gasp but said nothing and halted not then
picking out one of the stones that he had collectedbruno quoth
buffalmacco see what a goodly stone i have here would it might but
catch calandrino in the back and forthwith he discharged it with main
force upon the said back and in short suiting action to word now in
this way now in that they stoned him all the way up the mugnone as far
as the porta a san gallo there they threw away the stones they had
picked up and tarried a while with the customs officers who being
primed by them had let calandrino pass unchallenged while their
laughter knew no bounds
so calandrino halting nowhere betook him to his house which was hard
by the corner of the macina and so well did fortune prosper the trick
that all the way by the stream and across the city there was never a soul
that said a word to calandrino and indeed he encountered but few for
most folk were at breakfast but no sooner was calandrino thus gotten
home with his stones than it so happened that his good lady monna
tessa shewed her fair face at the stairs head and catching sight of
him and being somewhat annoyed by his long delay chid him
sayingwhat the devil brings thee here so late must breakfast wait
thee until all other folk have had it calandrino caught the words and
angered and mortified to find that he was not invisible broke out
withalas curst woman so twas thou thou hast undone me but gods
faith i will pay thee out whereupon he was upstairs in a trice and
having discharged his great load of stones in a parlour rushed with fell
intent upon his wife and laid hold of her by the hair and threw her
down at his feet and beat and kicked her in every part of her person
with all the force he had in his arms and legs insomuch that he left
never a hair of her head or bone of her body unscathed and twas all in
vain that she laid her palms together and crossed her fingers and cried
for mercy
now buffalmacco and bruno after making merry a while with the warders of
the gate had set off again at a leisurely pace keeping some distance
behind calandrino arrived at his door they heard the noise of the sound
thrashing that he was giving his wife and making as if they were but
that very instant come upon the scene they called him calandrino
flushed all of a sweat and out of breath shewed himself at the window
and bade them come up they putting on a somewhat angry air did so and
espied calandrino sitting in the parlour amid the stones which lay all
about untrussed and puffing with the air of a man spent with exertion
while his lady lay in one of the corners weeping bitterly her hair all
dishevelled her clothes torn to shreds and her face livid bruised and
battered so after surveying the room a whilewhat means this
calandrino quoth they art thou minded to build thee a wall that we
see so many stones about and then as they received no answer they
continuedand hows this how comes monna tessa in this plight
twould seem thou hast given her a beating what unheardof doings are
these what with the weight of the stones that he had carried and the
fury with which he had beaten his wife and the mortification that he
felt at the miscarriage of his enterprise calandrino was too spent to
utter a word by way of reply wherefore in a menacing tone buffalmacco
began againhowever out of sorts thou mayst have been calandrino
thou shouldst not have played us so scurvy a trick as thou hast to take
us with thee to the mugnone in quest of this stone of rare virtue and
then without so much as saying either godspeed or devilspeed to be
off and leave us there like a couple of gowks we take it not a little
unkindly and rest assured that thou shalt never so fool us again
whereto with an effort calandrino repliedcomrades be not wroth with
me tis not as you think i luckless wight found the stone listen
and you will no longer doubt that i say sooth when you began saying one
to the otherwhere is calandrino i was within ten paces of you and
marking that you came by without seeing me i went before and so
keeping ever a little ahead of you i came hither and then he told them
the whole story of what they had said and done from beginning to end and
shewed them his back and heel how they had been mauled by the stones
after whichand i tell you he went on that laden though i was
with all these stones that you see here never a word was said to me by
the warders of the gate as i passed in though you know how vexatious and
grievous these warders are wont to make themselves in their determination
to see everything and moreover i met by the way several of my gossips
and friends that are ever wont to greet me and ask me to drink and
never a word said any of them to me no nor half a word either but they
passed me by as men that saw me not but at last being come home i was
met and seen by this devil of a woman curses upon her forasmuch as all
things as you know lose their virtue in the presence of a woman
whereby i from being the most lucky am become the most luckless man in
florence and therefore i thrashed her as long as i could stir a hand
nor know i wherefore i forbear to sluice her veins for her cursed be the
hour that first i saw her cursed be the hour that i brought her into the
house and so kindling with fresh wrath he was about to start up and
give her another thrashing when buffalmacco and bruno who had listened
to his story with an air of great surprise and affirmed its truth again
and again while they all but burst with suppressed laughter seeing him
now frantic to renew his assault upon his wife got up and withstood and
held him back averring that the lady was in no wise to blame for what
had happened but only he who witting that things lost their virtue in
the presence of women had not bidden her keep aloof from him that day
which precaution god had not suffered him to take either because the
luck was not to be his or because he was minded to cheat his comrades
to whom he should have shewn the stone as soon as he found it and so
with many words they hardly prevailed upon him to forgive his injured
wife and leaving him to rue the illluck that had filled his house with
stones went their way
1 a sort of rissole
novel iv

the rector of fiesole loves a widow lady by whom he is not loved and
thinking to lie with her lies with her maid with whom the ladys
brothers cause him to be found by his bishop

elisa being come to the end of her story which in the telling had
yielded no small delight to all the company the queen turning to
emilia signified her will that her story should ensue at once upon that
of elisa and thus with alacrity emilia begannoble ladies how we are
teased and tormented by these priests and friars and indeed by clergy of
all sorts i mind me to have been set forth in more than one of the
stories that have been told but as twere not possible to say so much
thereof but that more would yet remain to say i purpose to supplement
them with the story of a rector who in defiance of all the world was
bent upon having the favour of a gentlewoman whether she would or no
which gentlewoman being discreet above a little treated him as he
deserved
fiesole whose hill is here within sight is as each of you knows a
city of immense antiquity and was aforetime great though now tis
fallen into complete decay which notwithstanding it always was and
still is the see of a bishop now there was once a gentlewoman monna
piccarda by name a widow that had an estate at fiesole hard by the
cathedral on which for that she was not in the easiest circumstances
she lived most part of the year and with her her two brothers very
worthy and courteous young men both of them and the lady being wont
frequently to resort to the cathedral and being still quite young and
fair and debonair withal it so befell that the rector grew in the last
degree enamoured of her and waxed at length so bold that he himself
avowed his passion to the lady praying her to entertain his love and
requite it in like measure the rector was advanced in years but
otherwise the veriest springald being bold and of a high spirit of a
boundless conceit of himself and of mien and manners most affected and
in the worst taste and withal so tiresome and insufferable that he was
on bad terms with everybody and if with one person more than another
with this lady who not only cared not a jot for him but had liefer have
had a headache than his company wherefore the lady discreetly made
answeri may well prize your love sir and love you i should and will
right gladly but such love as yours and mine may never admit of aught
that is not honourable you are my spiritual father and a priest and now
verging towards old age circumstances which should ensure your honour
and chastity and i on my part am no longer a girl such as these love
affairs might beseem but a widow and well you wot how it behoves widows
to be chaste wherefore i pray you to have me excused for after the
sort you crave you shall never have my love nor would i in such sort be
loved by you with this answer the rector was for the nonce fain to be
content but he was not the man to be dismayed and routed by a first
repulse and with his wonted temerity and effrontery he plied her again
and again with letters and ambassages and also by word of mouth when he
espied her entering the church wherefore the lady finding this
persecution more grievous and harassing than she could well bear cast
about how she might be quit thereof in such fashion as he deserved
seeing that he left her no choice howbeit she would do nought in the
matter until she had conferred with her brothers she therefore told them
how the rector pursued her and how she meant to foil him and with
their full concurrence some few days afterwards she went as she was
wont to church the rector no sooner saw her than he approached and
accosted her as he was wont in a tone of easy familiarity the lady
greeted him as he came up with a glance of gladsome recognition and
when he had treated her to not a little of his wonted eloquence she drew
him aside and heaving a great sigh saidi have oftentimes heard it
said sir that there is no castle so strong but that if the siege be
continued day by day it will sooner or later be taken which i now
plainly perceive is my own case for so fairly have you hemmed me in with
this that and the other pretty speech or the like blandishments that
you have constrained me to make nought of my former resolve and seeing
that i find such favour with you to surrender myself unto you whereto
overjoyed the rector made answermadam i am greatly honoured and
sooth to say i marvelled not a little how you should hold out so long
seeing that i have never had the like experience with any other woman
insomuch that i have at times saidwere women of silver they would
not be worth a denier for there is none but would give under the
hammer but no more of this when and where may we come together
sweet my lord replied the lady for the when tis just as we may
think best for i have no husband to whom to render account of my nights
but the where passes my wit to conjecture how so quoth the rector
why not in your own house sir replied the lady you know that i
have two brothers both young men who day and night bring their comrades
into the house which is none too large for which reason it might not be
done there unless we were minded to make ourselves as it were dumb and
blind uttering never a word not so much as a monosyllable and abiding
in the dark in such sort indeed it might be because they do not intrude
upon my chamber but theirs is so near to mine that the very least
whisper could not but be heard nay but madam returned the rector
let not this stand in our way for a night or two until i may bethink me
where else we might be more at our ease be that as you will sir
quoth the lady i do but entreat that the affair be kept close so that
never a word of it get wind have no fear on that score madam
replied the priest and if so it may be let us forgather tonight
with pleasure returned the lady and having appointed him how and when
to come she left him and went home
now the lady had a maid that was none too young and had a countenance
the ugliest and most misshapen that ever was seen for indeed she was
flatnosed wrymouthed and thicklipped with huge illset teeth eyes
that squinted and were ever bleared and a complexion betwixt green and
yellow that shewed as if she had spent the summer not at fiesole but at
sinigaglia besides which she was hipshot and somewhat halting on the
right side her name was ciuta but for that she was such a scurvy bitch
to look upon she was called by all folk ciutazza1 and being thus
misshapen of body she was also not without her share of guile so the
lady called her and saidciutazza so thou wilt do me a service
tonight i will give thee a fine new shift at the mention of the shift
ciutazza made answerso you give me a shift madam i will throw
myself into the very fire good said the lady then i would have
thee lie tonight in my bed with a man whom thou wilt caress but look
thou say never a word that my brothers who as thou knowest sleep in
the next room hear thee not and afterwards i will give thee the shift
sleep with a man quoth ciutazza why if need be i will sleep with
six so in the evening master rector came as he had been bidden and
the two young men as the lady had arranged being in their room and
making themselves very audible he stole noiselessly and in the dark
into the ladys room and got him on to the bed which ciutazza well
advised by the lady how to behave mounted from the other side whereupon
master rector thinking to have the lady by his side took ciutazza in
his arms and fell a kissing her saying never a word the while and
ciutazza did the like and so he enjoyed her plucking the boon which he
had so long desired
the rector and ciutazza thus closeted the lady charged her brothers to
execute the rest of her plan they accordingly stole quietly out of their
room and hied them to the piazza where fortune proved propitious beyond
what they had craved of her for it being a very hot night the bishop
had been seeking them purposing to go home with them and solace himself
with their society and quench his thirst with which desire he
acquainted them as soon as he espied them coming into the piazza and so
they escorted him to their house and there in the cool of their little
courtyard which was bright with many a lamp he took to his no small
comfort a draught of their good wine which donesir said the young
men since of your great courtesy you have deigned to visit our poor
house to which we were but now about to invite you we should be
gratified if you would be pleased to give a look at somewhat a mere
trifle though it be which we have here to shew you the bishop replied
that he would do so with pleasure whereupon one of the young men took a
lighted torch and led the way the bishop and the rest following to the
chamber where master rector lay with ciutazza
now the rector being in hot haste had ridden hard insomuch that he was
already gotten above three miles on his way when they arrived and so
being somewhat tired he was resting but hot though the night was he
still held ciutazza in his arms in which posture he was shewn to the
bishop when preceded by the young man bearing the light and followed
by the others he entered the chamber and being roused and observing
the light and the folk that stood about him master rector was mighty
ashamed and affrighted and popped his head under the clothes but the
bishop reprimanding him severely constrained him to thrust his head out
again and take a view of his bedfellow thus made aware of the trick
which the lady had played him the rector was now both on that score and
by reason of his signal disgrace the saddest man that ever was and his
discomfiture was complete when having donned his clothes he was
committed by the bishops command to close custody and sent to prison
there to expiate his offence by a rigorous penance
the bishop was then fain to know how it had come about that he had
forgathered there with ciutazza whereupon the young men related the
whole story which ended the bishop commended both the lady and the
young men not a little for that they had taken condign vengeance upon
him without imbruing their hands in the blood of a priest the bishop
caused him to bewail his transgression forty days but what with his
love and the scornful requital which it had received he bewailed it
more than forty and nine days not to mention that for a great while he
could not shew himself in the street but the boys would point the finger
at him and saythere goes he that lay with ciutazza which was such
an affliction to him that he was like to go mad on this wise the worthy
lady rid herself of the rectors vexatious importunity and ciutazza had
a jolly night and earned her shift

three young men pull down the breeches of a judge from the marches while
he is administering justice on the bench

so ended emilia her story and when all had commended the widow
ladytis now thy turn to speak quoth the queen fixing her gaze
upon filostrato who answered that he was ready and forthwith thus
begansweet my ladies by what i remember of that young man to wit
maso del saggio whom elisa named a while ago i am prompted to lay aside
a story that i had meant to tell you and to tell you another touching
him and some of his comrades which notwithstanding there are in it
certain words albeit tis not unseemly which your modesty forbears to
use is yet so laughable that i shall relate it
as you all may well have heard there come not seldom to our city
magistrates from the marches who for the most part are men of a mean
spirit and in circumstances so reduced and beggarly that their whole
life seems to be but a pettyfoggery and by reason of this their inbred
sordidness and avarice they bring with them judges and notaries that have
rather the air of men taken from the plough or the last than trained in
the schools of law1 now one of these marchers being come hither as
podesta brought with him judges not a few and among them one that
called himself messer niccola da san lepidio and looked liker to a
locksmith than aught else however this fellow was assigned with the
rest of the judges to hear criminal causes and as folk will often go to
the court though they have no concern whatever there it so befell that
maso del saggio went thither one morning in quest of one of his friends
and there chancing to set eyes on this messer niccola where he sate
deemed him a fowl of no common feather and surveyed him from head to
foot observing that the vair which he wore on his head was all begrimed
that he carried an inkhorn at his girdle that his gown was longer than
his robe and many another detail quite foreign to the appearance of a
man of birth and breeding of which that which he deemed most notable was
a pair of breeches which as he saw for the judges outer garments
being none too ample were open in front as he sate reached halfway
down his legs by which sight his mind was presently diverted from the
friend whom he came there to seek and forth he hied him in quest of
other two of his comrades the one ribi the other matteuzzo by name
fellows both of them not a whit less jolly than maso himself and having
found them he said to theman you love me come with me to the court
and i will shew you the queerest scarecrow that ever you saw so the two
men hied them with him to the court and there he pointed out to them the
judge and his breeches what they saw from a distance served to set them
laughing then drawing nearer to the dais on which master judge was
seated they observed that twas easy enough to get under the dais and
moreover that the plank on which the judges feet rested was broken so
that there was plenty of room for the passage of a hand and arm
whereupon quoth maso to his comradestwere a very easy matter to pull
these breeches right down wherefore i propose that we do so each of
the men had marked how it might be done and so having concerted both
what they should do and what they should say they came to the court
again next morning and the court being crowded matteuzzo observed by
never a soul slipped beneath the dais and posted himself right under
the spot where the judges feet rested while the other two men took
their stand on either side of the judge each laying hold of the hem of
his robe thensir sir i pray you for gods sake began maso
that before the pilfering rascal that is there beside you can make off
you constrain him to give me back a pair of jack boots that he has stolen
from me which theft he still denies though tis not a month since i saw
him getting them resoled meanwhile ribi at the top of his voice
shoutedbelieve him not sir the scurvy knave tis but that he knows
that i am come to demand restitution of a valise that he has stolen from
me that he now for the first time trumps up this story about a pair of
jack boots that i have had in my house down to the last day or two and
if you doubt what i say i can bring as witness trecca my neighbour and
grassa the tripewoman and one that goes about gathering the sweepings
of santa maria a verzaia who saw him when he was on his way back from
the farm but shout as he might maso was still even with him nor for
all that did ribi bate a jot of his clamour and while the judge stood
bending now towards the one now towards the other the better to hear
them matteuzzo seized his opportunity and thrusting his hand through
the hole in the plank caught hold of the judges breeches and tugged at
them amain whereby down they came straightway for the judge was a lean
man and shrunk in the buttocks the judge being aware of the accident
but knowing not how it had come about would have gathered his outer
garments together in front so as to cover the defect but maso on the
one side and ribi on the other held him fast shouting amain and in
chorusyou do me a grievous wrong sir thus to deny me justice nay
even a hearing and to think of quitting the court there needs no writ
in this city for such a trifling matter as this and thus they held him
by the clothes and in parley until all that were in the court perceived
that he had lost his breeches however after a while matteuzzo dropped
the breeches and slipped off and out of the court without being
observed and ribi deeming that the joke had gone far enough
exclaimedby god i vow i will appeal to the syndics while maso on
the other side let go the robe sayingnay but for my part i will
come here again and again and again until i find you less embarrassed
than you seem to be today and so the one this way the other that way
they made off with all speed whereupon master judge disbreeched before
all the world was as one that awakens from sleep albeit he was ware of
his forlorn condition and asked whither the parties in the case touching
the jack boots and the valise were gone however as they were not to be
found he fell a swearing by the bowels of god that twas meet and
proper that he should know and wit whether twas the custom at florence
to disbreech judges sitting in the seat of justice
when the affair reached the ears of the podesta he made no little stir
about it but being informed by some of his friends that twould not
have happened but that the florentines were minded to shew him that in
place of the judges he should have brought with him he had brought but
gowks to save expense he deemed it best to say no more about it and so
for that while the matter went no further
1 it was owing to their internal dissensions that the florentines were
from time to time fain to introduce these stranger podestas
novel vi

bruno and buffalmacco steal a pig from calandrino and induce him to
essay its recovery by means of pills of ginger and vernaccia of the said
pills they give him two one after the other made of dogginger
compounded with aloes and it then appearing as if he had had the pig
himself they constrain him to buy them off if he would not have them
tell his wife

filostratos story which elicited not a little laughter was no sooner
ended than the queen bade filomena follow suit wherefore thus filomena
beganas gracious ladies twas the name of maso del saggio that
prompted filostrato to tell the story that you have but now heard even
so tis with me in regard of calandrino and his comrades of whom i am
minded to tell you another story which you will i think find
entertaining who calandrino bruno and buffalmacco were i need not
explain you know them well enough from the former story and therefore i
will tarry no longer than to say that calandrino had a little estate not
far from florence which his wife had brought him by way of dowry and
which yielded them yearly among other matters a pig and twas his
custom every year in the month of december to resort to the farm with his
wife there to see to the killing and salting of the said pig now one
of these years it so happened that his wife being unwell calandrino went
thither alone to kill the pig and bruno and buffalmacco learning that he
was gone to the farm and that his wife was not with him betook them to
the house of a priest that was their especial friend and a neighbour of
calandrino there to tarry a while upon their arrival calandrino who
had that very morning killed the pig met them with the priest and
accosted them sayinga hearty welcome to you i should like you to
see what an excellent manager i am and so he took them into his house
and shewed them the pig they observed that twas a very fine pig and
learned from calandrino that he was minded to salt it for household
consumption then thou art but a fool quoth bruno sell it man and
let us have a jolly time with the money and tell thy wife that twas
stolen not i replied calandrino she would never believe me and
would drive me out of the house urge me no further for i will never do
it the others said a great deal more but to no purpose and calandrino
bade them to supper but so coldly that they declined and left him
presentlyshould we not steal this pig from him tonight quoth bruno
to buffalmacco could we so returned buffalmacco how why as to
that rejoined bruno i have already marked how it may be done if he
bestow not the pig elsewhere so be it then said buffalmacco we
will steal it and then perchance our good host master priest will
join us in doing honour to such good cheer that right gladly will i
quoth the priest whereuponsome address though quoth bruno will
be needful thou knowest buffalmacco what a niggardly fellow calandrino
is and how greedily he drinks at other folks expense go we therefore
and take him to the tavern and there let the priest make as if to do us
honour he would pay the whole score and suffer calandrino to pay never
a soldo and he will grow tipsy and then we shall speed excellent well
because he is alone in the house
as bruno proposed so they did and calandrino finding that the priest
would not suffer him to pay drank amain and took a great deal more
aboard than he had need of and the night being far spent when he left
the tavern he dispensed with supper and went home and thinking to have
shut the door got him to bed leaving it open buffalmacco and bruno
went to sup with the priest and after supper taking with them certain
implements with which to enter calandrinos house where bruno thought it
most feasible they stealthily approached it but finding the door open
they entered and took down the pig and carried it away to the priests
house and having there bestowed it safely went to bed in the morning
when calandrino his head at length quit of the fumes of the wine got
up and came downstairs and found that his pig was nowhere to be seen
and that the door was open he asked this that and the other man
whether they wist who had taken the pig away and getting no answer he
began to make a great outcryalas alas luckless man that i am that
my pig should have been stolen from me meanwhile bruno and buffalmacco
being also risen made up to him to hear what he would say touching the
pig whom he no sooner saw than wellnigh weeping he called them
sayingalas my friends my pig is stolen from me bruno stepped up
to him and said in a low tonetis passing strange if thou art in the
right for once alas returned calandrino what i say is but too
true why then out with it man quoth bruno cry aloud that all
folk may know that tis so calandrino then raised his voice and
saidby the body o god i say of a truth that my pig has been stolen
from me so quoth bruno but publish it man publish it lift up
thy voice make thyself well heard that all may believe thy report
thou art enough to make me give my soul to the enemy replied
calandrino i saydost not believe methat hang me by the neck if the
pig is not stolen from me nay but quoth bruno how can it be i
saw it here but yesterday dost think to make me believe that it has
taken to itself wings and flown away all the same tis as i tell
thee returned calandrino is it possible quoth bruno ay indeed
replied calandrino tis even so and i am undone and know not how to
go home never will my wife believe me or if she do so i shall know no
peace this year upon my hope of salvation quoth bruno tis indeed
a bad business if so it really is but thou knowest calandrino that
twas but yesterday i counselled thee to make believe that twas so i
should be sorry to think thou didst befool thy wife and us at the same
time ah vociferated calandrino wilt thou drive me to despair and
provoke me to blaspheme god and the saints and all the company of heaven
i tell thee that the pig has been stolen from me in the night
whereuponif so it be quoth buffalmacco we must find a way if we
can to recover it find a way said calandrino how can we compass
that why replied buffalmacco tis certain that no one has come
from india to steal thy pig it must have been one of thy neighbours and
if thou couldst bring them together i warrant thee i know how to make
the assay with bread and cheese and we will find out in a trice who has
had the pig ay struck in bruno make thy assay with bread and
cheese in the presence of these gentry hereabout one of whom i am sure
has had the pig why the thing would be seen through and they would not
come what shall we do then said buffalmacco whereto bruno made
answerit must be done with good pills of ginger and good vernaccia
and they must be bidden come drink with us they will suspect nothing
and will come and pills of ginger can be blessed just as well as bread
and cheese beyond a doubt thou art right quoth buffalmacco and
thou calandrino what sayst thou shall we do as bruno says nay i
entreat you for the love of god quoth calandrino do even so for if i
knew but who had had the pig i should feel myself half consoled for my
loss go to now quoth bruno i am willing to do thy errand to
florence for these commodities if thou givest me the money
calandrino had some forty soldi upon him which he gave to bruno who
thereupon hied him to florence to a friend of his that was an apothecary
and bought a pound of good pills of ginger two of which being of
dogginger he caused to be compounded with fresh hepatic aloes and then
to be coated with sugar like the others and lest they should be lost or
any of the others mistaken for them he had a slight mark set upon them
by which he might readily recognize them he also bought a flask of good
vernaccia and thus laden returned to the farm and said to
calandrinotomorrow morning thou wilt bid those whom thou suspectest
come hither to drink with thee as twill be a saints day they will all
come readily enough and tonight i and buffalmacco will say the
incantation over the pills which in the morning i will bring to thee
here and for our friendships sake will administer them myself and do
and say all that needs to be said and done so calandrino did as bruno
advised and on the morrow a goodly company as well of young men from
florence that happened to be in the village as of husbandmen being
assembled in front of the church around the elm bruno and buffalmacco
came bearing a box containing the ginger and the flask of wine and
ranged the folk in a circle whereupon gentlemen said bruno tis
meet i tell you the reason why you are gathered here that if aught
unpleasant to you should befall you may have no ground for complaint
against me calandrino here was the night before last robbed of a fine
pig and cannot discover who has had it and for that it must have been
stolen by some one of us here he would have each of you take and eat one
of these pills and drink of this vernaccia wherefore i forthwith do you
to wit that whoso has had the pig will not be able to swallow the pill
but will find it more bitter than poison and will spit it out and so
rather than he should suffer this shame in presence of so many twere
perhaps best that he that has had the pig should confess the fact to the
priest and i will wash my hands of the affair
all professed themselves ready enough to eat the pills and so having
set them in a row with calandrino among them bruno beginning at one
end proceeded to give each a pill and when he came to calandrino he
chose one of the pills of dogginger and put it in his hand calandrino
thrust it forthwith between his teeth and began to chew it but no sooner
was his tongue acquainted with the aloes than finding the bitterness
intolerable he spat it out now the eyes of all the company being fixed
on one another to see who should spit out his pill bruno who not
having finished the distribution feigned to be concerned with nought
else heard some one in his rear sayha calandrino what means this
and at once turning round and marking that calandrino had spit out his
pillwait a while quoth he perchance twas somewhat else that
caused thee to spit take another and thereupon whipping out the other
pill of dogginger he set it between calandrinos teeth and finished
the distribution bitter as calandrino had found the former pill he
found this tenfold more so but being ashamed to spit it out he kept it
a while in his mouth and chewed it and as he did so tears stood in his
eyes that shewed as large as filberts and at length being unable to
bear it any longer he spat it out as he had its predecessor which
being observed by buffalmacco and bruno who were then administering the
wine and by all the company twas averred by common consent that
calandrino had committed the theft himself for which cause certain of
them took him severely to task
however the company being dispersed and bruno and buffalmacco left
alone with calandrino buffalmacco began on this wisei never doubted
but that thou hadst had it thyself and wast minded to make us believe
that it had been stolen from thee that we might not have of thee so much
as a single drink out of the price which thou gottest for it
calandrino with the bitterness of the aloes still on his tongue fell a
swearing that he had not had it whereuponnay but comrade quoth
buffalmacco upon thy honour what did it fetch six florins whereto
calandrino being now on the verge of desperation bruno addednow be
reasonable calandrino among the company that ate and drank with us
there was one that told me that thou hadst up there a girl that thou
didst keep for thy pleasure giving her what by hook or by crook thou
couldst get together and that he held it for certain that thou hadst
sent her this pig and thou art grown expert in this sort of cozenage
thou tookest us one while adown the mugnone a gathering black stones and
having thus started us on a wildgoose chase thou madest off and then
wouldst fain have us believe that thou hadst found the stone and now in
like manner thou thinkest by thine oaths to persuade us that this pig
which thou hast given away or sold has been stolen from thee but we
know thy tricks of old never another couldst thou play us and to be
round with thee this spell has cost us some trouble wherefore we mean
that thou shalt give us two pair of capons or we will let monna tessa
know all seeing that he was not believed and deeming his mortification
ample without the addition of his wifes resentment calandrino gave them
the two pair of capons with which when the pig was salted they
returned to florence leaving calandrino with the loss and the laugh
against him
novel vii

a scholar loves a widow lady who being enamoured of another causes him
to spend a winters night awaiting her in the snow he afterwards by a
stratagem causes her to stand for a whole day in july naked upon a
tower exposed to the flies the gadflies and the sun

over the woes of poor calandrino the ladies laughed not a little and had
laughed yet more but that it irked them that those that had robbed him
of the pig should also take from him the capons however the story being
ended the queen bade pampinea give them hers and thus forthwith
pampinea begandearest ladies it happens oftentimes that the artful
scorner meets his match wherefore tis only little wits that delight to
scorn in a series of stories we have heard tell of tricks played without
aught in the way of reprisals following by mine i purpose in some degree
to excite your compassion for a gentlewoman of our city albeit the
retribution that came upon her was but just whose flout was returned in
the like sort and to such effect that she wellnigh died thereof the
which to hear will not be unprofitable to you for thereby you will learn
to be more careful how you flout others and therein you will do very
wisely
tis not many years since there dwelt at florence a lady young and fair
and of a high spirit as also of right gentle lineage and tolerably well
endowed with temporal goods now elenasuch was the ladys namebeing
left a widow was minded never to marry again being enamoured of a
handsome young gallant of her own choosing with whom she recking nought
of any other lover did by the help of a maid in whom she placed much
trust not seldom speed the time gaily and with marvellous delight
meanwhile it so befell that a young nobleman of our city rinieri by
name who had spent much time in study at paris not that he might
thereafter sell his knowledge by retail but that he might learn the
reasons and causes of things which accomplishment shews to most
excellent advantage in a gentleman returned to florence and there lived
as a citizen in no small honour with his fellows both by reason of his
rank and of his learning but as it is often the case that those who are
most versed in deep matters are the soonest mastered by love so was it
with rinieri for at a festal gathering to which one day he went there
appeared before his eyes this elena of whom we spoke clad in black as
is the wont of our florentine widows and shewing to his mind so much
fairer and more debonair than any other woman that he had ever seen that
happy indeed he deemed the man might call himself to whom god in his
goodness should grant the right to hold her naked in his arms so now and
again he eyed her stealthily and knowing that boons goodly and precious
are not to be gotten without trouble he made up his mind to study and
labour with all assiduity how best to please her that so he might win
her love and thereby the enjoyment of her
the young gentlewoman was not used to keep her eyes bent ever towards the
infernal regions but rating herself at no less if not more than her
deserts she was dexterous to move them to and fro and thus busily
scanning her company soon detected the men who regarded her with
pleasure by which means having discovered rinieris passion she inly
laughed and saidtwill turn out that twas not for nothing that i
came here today for if i mistake not i have caught a gander by the
bill so she gave him an occasional sidelong glance and sought as best
she might to make him believe that she was not indifferent to him
deeming that the more men she might captivate by her charms the higher
those charms would be rated and most especially by him whom she had made
lord of them and her love the erudite scholar bade adieu to
philosophical meditation for the lady entirely engrossed his mind and
having discovered her house he thinking to please her found divers
pretexts for frequently passing by it whereon the lady her vanity
flattered for the reason aforesaid plumed herself not a little and
shewed herself pleased to see him thus encouraged the scholar found
means to make friends with her maid to whom he discovered his love
praying her to do her endeavour with her mistress that he might have her
favour the maid was profuse of promises and gave her mistress his
message which she no sooner heard than she was convulsed with laughter
and repliedhe brought sense enough hither from paris knowest thou
where he has since been to lose it go to now let us give him that
which he seeks tell him when he next speaks to you of the matter that
i love him vastly more than he loves me but that i must have regard to
my reputation so that i may be able to hold my head up among other
ladies which if he is really the wise man they say will cause him to
affect me much more ah poor woman poor woman she little knew my
ladies how rash it is to try conclusions with scholars
the maid found the scholar and did her mistresss errand the scholar
overjoyed proceeded to urge his suit with more ardour to indite
letters and send presents the lady received all that he sent her but
vouchsafed no answers save such as were couched in general terms and on
this wise she kept him dangling a long while at last having disclosed
the whole affair to her lover who evinced some resentment and jealousy
she to convince him that his suspicions were groundless and for that
she was much importuned by the scholar sent word to him by her maid
that never since he had assured her of his love had occasion served her
to do him pleasure but that next christmastide she hoped to be with him
wherefore if he were minded to await her in the courtyard of her house
on the night of the day next following the feast she would meet him
there as soon as she could elated as neer another the scholar hied him
at the appointed time to the ladys house and being ushered into a
courtyard by the maid who forthwith turned the key upon him addressed
himself there to await the ladys coming
now the ladys lover by her appointment was with her that evening and
when they had gaily supped she told him what she had in hand that night
addingand so thou wilt be able to gauge the love which i have borne
and bear this scholar whom thou hast foolishly regarded as a rival the
lover heard the ladys words with no small delight and waited in eager
expectancy to see her make them good the scholar hanging about there in
the courtyard began to find it somewhat chillier than he would have
liked for it had snowed hard all day long so that the snow lay
everywhere thick on the ground however he bore it patiently expecting
to be recompensed by and by after a while the lady said to her
lovergo we to the chamber and take a peep through a lattice at him of
whom thou art turned jealous and mark what he does and how he will
answer the maid whom i have bidden go speak with him so the pair hied
them to a lattice wherethrough they could see without being seen and
heard the maid call from another lattice to the scholar
sayingrinieri my lady is distressed as never woman was for that one
of her brothers is come here tonight and after talking a long while
with her must needs sup with her and is not yet gone but i think he
will soon be off and that is the reason why she has not been able to
come to thee but she will come soon now she trusts it does not irk thee
to wait so long whereto the scholar supposing that twas true made
answertell my lady to give herself no anxiety on my account until
she can conveniently come to me but to do so as soon as she may
whereupon the maid withdrew from the window and went to bed while the
lady said to her lovernow what sayst thou thinkst thou that if i
had that regard for him which thou fearest i would suffer him to tarry
below there to get frozen which said the lady and her now partly
reassured lover got them to bed where for a great while they disported
them right gamesomely laughing together and making merry over the
luckless scholar
the scholar meanwhile paced up and down the courtyard to keep himself
warm nor indeed had he where to sit or take shelter in this plight he
bestowed many a curse upon the ladys brother for his long tarrying and
never a sound did he hear but he thought that twas the lady opening the
door but vain indeed were his hopes the lady having solaced herself
with her lover until hard upon midnight then said to himhow ratest
thou our scholar my soul whether is the greater his wit or the love i
bear him thinkst thou will the cold that of my ordaining he now
suffers banish from thy breast the suspicion which my light words the
other day implanted there ay indeed heart of my body replied the
lover well wot i now that even as thou art to me my weal my
consolation my bliss so am i to thee so quoth the lady then i
must have full a thousand kisses from thee to prove that thou sayst
sooth the lovers answer was to strain her to his heart and give her
not merely a thousand but a hundred thousand kisses in such converse
they dallied a while longer and thenget we up now quoth the lady
that we may go see if tis quite spent that fire with which as he
wrote to me daily this new lover of mine used to burn so up they got
and hied them to the lattice which they had used before and peering out
into the courtyard saw the scholar dancing a hornpipe to the music that
his own teeth made a chattering for extremity of cold nor had they ever
seen it footed so nimbly and at such a pace whereuponhow sayst thou
sweet my hope quoth the lady know i not how to make men dance without
the aid of either trumpet or cornemuse indeed thou dost my hearts
delight replied the lover quoth then the ladyi have a mind that we
go down to the door thou wilt keep quiet and i will speak to him and
we shall hear what he says which peradventure we shall find no less
diverting than the sight of him
so they stole softly out of the chamber and down to the door which
leaving fast closed the lady set her lips to a little hole that was
there and with a low voice called the scholar who hearing her call
him praised god making too sure that he was to be admitted and being
come to the door saidhere am i madam open for gods sake let me
in for i die of cold oh ay replied the lady i know thou hast a
chill and of course there being a little snow about tis mighty cold
but well i wot the nights are colder far at paris i cannot let thee in
as yet because my accursed brother that came to sup here this evening
is still with me but he will soon take himself off and then i will let
thee in without a moments delay i have but now with no small difficulty
given him the slip to come and give thee heart that the waiting irk thee
not nay but madam replied the scholar for the love of god i
entreat you let me in that i may have a roof over my head because for
some time past there has been never so thick a fall of snow and tis yet
snowing and then i will wait as long as you please alas sweet my
love quoth the lady that i may not for this door makes such a din
when one opens it that my brother would be sure to hear were i to let
thee in but i will go tell him to get him gone and so come back and
admit thee go at once then returned the scholar and prithee see
that a good fire be kindled that when i get in i may warm myself for
i am now so chilled through and through that i have scarce any feeling
left that can scarce be rejoined the lady if it be true what thou
hast so protested in thy letters that thou art all afire for love of me
tis plain to me now that thou didst but mock me i now take my leave of
thee wait and be of good cheer
so the lady and her lover who to his immense delight had heard all
that passed betook them to bed however little sleep had they that
night but spent the best part of it in disporting themselves and making
merry over the unfortunate scholar who his teeth now chattering to such
a tune that he seemed to have been metamorphosed into a stork perceived
that he had been befooled and after making divers fruitless attempts to
open the door and seeking means of egress to no better purpose paced to
and fro like a lion cursing the villainous weather the long night his
simplicity and the perversity of the lady against whom the vehemence
of his wrath suddenly converting the love he had so long borne her to
bitter and remorseless enmity he now plotted within himself divers and
grand schemes of revenge on which he was far more bent than ever he had
been on forgathering with her
slowly the night wore away and with the first streaks of dawn the maid
by her mistresss direction came down opened the door of the courtyard
and putting on a compassionate air greeted rinieri withfoul fall him
that came here yestereve he has afflicted us with his presence all night
long and has kept thee a freezing out here but harkye take it not
amiss that which might not be tonight shall be another time well wot i
that nought could have befallen that my lady could so ill brook for all
his wrath the scholar witting like the wise man he was that menaces
serve but to put the menaced on his guard kept pent within his breast
that which unbridled resentment would have uttered and said quietly and
without betraying the least trace of angerin truth twas the worst
night i ever spent but i understood quite well that the lady was in no
wise to blame for that she herself being moved to pity of me came down
here to make her excuses and to comfort me and as thou sayst what has
not been tonight will be another time wherefore commend me to her and
so adieu then wellnigh paralysed for cold he got him as best he
might home where weary and fit to die for drowsiness he threw himself
on his bed and fell into a deep sleep from which he awoke to find that
he had all but lost the use of his arms and legs he therefore sent for
some physicians and having told them what a chill he had gotten caused
them have a care to his health but though they treated him with active
and most drastic remedies it cost them some time and no little trouble
to restore to the cramped muscles their wonted pliancy and indeed but
for his youth and the milder weather that was at hand twould have gone
very hard with him
however recover he did his health and lustihood and nursing his enmity
feigned to be vastly more enamoured of his widow than ever before and so
it was that after a while fortune furnished him with an opportunity of
satisfying his resentment for the gallant of whom the widow was
enamoured utterly regardless of the love she bore him grew enamoured of
another lady and was minded no more to pleasure the widow in aught
either by word or by deed wherefore she now pined in tears and
bitterness of spirit however her maid who commiserated her not a
little and knew not how to dispel the dumps that the loss of her lover
had caused her espying the scholar pass along the street as he had been
wont conceived the silly idea that the ladys lover might be induced to
return to his old love by some practice of a necromantic order wherein
she doubted not that the scholar must be a thorough adept which idea she
imparted to her mistress the lady being none too well furnished with
sense never thinking that if the scholar had been an adept in
necromancy he would have made use of it in his own behoof gave heed to
what her maid said and forthwith bade her learn of the scholar whether
he would place his skill at her service and assure him that if he so
did she in guerdon thereof would do his pleasure the maid did her
mistresss errand well and faithfully the scholar no sooner heard the
message than he said to himselfpraised be thy name o god that the
time is now come when with thy help i may be avenged upon this wicked
woman of the wrong she did me in requital of the great love i bore her
then turning to the maid he saidtell my lady to set her mind at
ease touching this matter for that were her lover in india i would
forthwith bring him hither to crave her pardon of that wherein he has
offended her as to the course she should take in the matter i tarry but
her pleasure to make it known to her when and where she may think fit
tell her so and bid her from me to be of good cheer the maid carried
his answer to her mistress and arranged that they should meet in the
church of santa lucia of prato thither accordingly they came the lady
and the scholar and conversed apart and the lady quite oblivious of
the illusage by which she had wellnigh done him to death opened all
her mind to him and besought him if he had any regard to her welfare
to aid her to the attainment of her desire madam replied the scholar
true it is that among other lore that i acquired at paris was this of
necromancy whereof indeed i know all that may be known but as tis
in the last degree displeasing to god i had sworn never to practise it
either for my own or for any others behoof tis also true that the love
i bear you is such that i know not how to refuse you aught that you would
have me do for you and so were this single essay enough to consign me
to hell i would adventure it to pleasure you but i mind me that tis a
matter scarce so easy of performance as perchance you suppose most
especially when a woman would fain recover the love of a man or a man
that of a woman for then it must be done by the postulant in proper
person and at night and in lonely places and unattended so that it
needs a stout heart nor know i whether you are disposed to comply with
these conditions the lady too enamoured to be discreet made
answerso shrewdly does love goad me that there is nought i would not
do to bring him back to me who wrongfully has deserted me but tell me
prithee wherein it is that i have need of this stout heart madam
returned the despiteful scholar twill be my part to fashion in tin an
image of him you would fain lure back to you and when i have sent you
the image twill be for you when the moon is well on the wane to dip
yourself being stark naked and the image seven times in a flowing
stream and this you must do quite alone about the hour of first sleep
and afterwards still naked you must get you upon some tree or some
deserted house and facing the north with the image in your hand say
certain words that i shall give you in writing seven times which when
you have done there will come to you two damsels the fairest you ever
saw who will greet you graciously and ask of you what you would fain
have to whom you will disclose frankly and fully all that you crave and
see to it that you make no mistake in the name and when you have said
all they will depart and you may then descend and return to the spot
where you left your clothes and resume them and go home and rest
assured that before the ensuing midnight your lover will come to you in
tears and crave your pardon and mercy and that thenceforth he will
never again desert you for any other woman
the lady gave entire credence to the scholars words and deeming her
lover as good as in her arms again recovered half her wonted spirits
whereforemake no doubt quoth she that i shall do as thou biddest
and indeed i am most favoured by circumstance for in upper val darno i
have an estate adjoining the river and tis now july so that to bathe
will be delightful ay and now i mind me that at no great distance from
the river there is a little tower which is deserted save that now and
again the shepherds will get them up by the chestnutwood ladder to the
roof thence to look out for their strayed sheep tis a place lonely
indeed and quite out of ken and when i have clomb it as climb it i
will i doubt not twill be the best place in all the world to give
effect to your instructions
well pleased to be certified of the ladys intention the scholar to
whom her estate and the tower were very well known made answeri was
never in those parts madam and therefore know neither your estate nor
the tower but if tis as you say twill certainly be the best place in
the world for your purpose so when time shall serve i will send you
the image and the orison but i pray you when you shall have your
hearts desire and know that i have done you good service do not forget
me but keep your promise to me that will i without fail quoth the
lady and so she bade him farewell and went home the scholar gleefully
anticipating the success of his enterprise fashioned an image and
inscribed it with certain magical signs and wrote some gibberish by way
of orison which in due time he sent to the lady bidding her the very
next night do as he had prescribed and thereupon he hied him privily
with one of his servants to the house of a friend hard by the tower
there to carry his purpose into effect the lady on her part set out
with her maid and betook her to her estate and night being come sent
the maid to bed as if she were minded to go to rest herself and about
the hour of first sleep stole out of the house and down to the tower
beside the arno and when having carefully looked about her she was
satisfied that never a soul was to be seen or heard she took off her
clothes and hid them under a bush then with the image in her hand she
dipped herself seven times in the river which done she hied her with
the image to the tower the scholar having at nightfall couched himself
with his servant among the willows and other trees that fringed the bank
marked all that she did and how as she passed by him the whiteness of
her flesh dispelled the shades of night and scanning attentively her
bosom and every other part of her body and finding them very fair felt
as he bethought him what would shortly befall them some pity of her
while on the other hand he was suddenly assailed by the solicitations
of the flesh which caused that to stand which had been inert and
prompted him to sally forth of his ambush and take her by force and have
his pleasure of her and what with his compassion and passion he was
like to be worsted but then as he bethought him who he was and what a
grievous wrong had been done him and for what cause and by whom his
wrath thus rekindled got the better of the other affections so that he
swerved not from his resolve but suffered her to go her way
the lady ascended the tower and standing with her face to the north
began to recite the scholars orison while he having stolen into the
tower but a little behind her cautiously shifted the ladder that led up
to the roof on which the lady stood and waited to observe what she would
say and do seven times the lady said the orison and then awaited the
appearance of the two damsels and so long had she to waitnot to
mention that the night was a good deal cooler than she would have
likedthat she saw day break whereupon disconcerted that it had not
fallen out as the scholar had promised she said to herselfi misdoubt
me he was minded to give me such a night as i gave him but if such was
his intent he is but maladroit in his revenge for this night is not as
long by a third as his was besides which the cold is of another
quality and that day might not overtake her there she began to think of
descending but finding that the ladder was removed she felt as if the
world had come to nought beneath her feet her senses reeled and she
fell in a swoon upon the floor of the roof when she came to herself she
burst into tears and piteous lamentations and witting now very well that
twas the doing of the scholar she began to repent her that she had
first offended him and then trusted him unduly having such good cause
to reckon upon his enmity in which frame she abode long time then
searching if haply she might find some means of descent and finding
none she fell a weeping again and bitterly to herself she saidalas
for thee wretched woman what will thy brothers thy kinsmen thy
neighbours nay what will all florence say of thee when tis known that
thou hast been found here naked thy honour hitherto unsuspect will be
known to have been but a shew and shouldst thou seek thy defence in
lying excuses if any such may be fashioned the accursed scholar who
knows all thy doings will not suffer it ah poor wretch that at one
and the same time hast lost thy too dearly cherished gallant and thine
own honour and therewith she was taken with such a transport of grief
that she was like to cast herself from the tower to the ground then
bethinking her that if she might espy some lad making towards the tower
with his sheep she might send him for her maid for the sun was now
risen she approached one of the parapets of the tower and looked out
and so it befell that the scholar awakening from a slumber in which he
had lain a while at the foot of a bush espied her and she him
whereupongoodday madam quoth heare the damsels yet come the
lady saw and heard him not without bursting afresh into a flood of tears
and besought him to come into the tower that she might speak with him a
request which the scholar very courteously granted the lady then threw
herself prone on the floor of the roof and only her head being visible
through the aperture thus through her sobs she spokeverily rinieri
if i gave thee a bad night thou art well avenged on me for though it
be july meseemed i was sore a cold last night standing here with never
a thread upon me and besides i have so bitterly bewept both the trick
i played thee and my own folly in trusting thee that i marvel that i
have still eyes in my head wherefore i implore thee not for love of me
whom thou hast no cause to love but for the respect thou hast for
thyself as a gentleman that thou let that which thou hast already done
suffice thee to avenge the wrong i did thee and bring me my clothes
that i may be able to get me down from here and spare to take from me
that which however thou mightst hereafter wish thou couldst not restore
to me to wit my honour whereas if i deprived thee of that one night
with me tis in my power to give thee many another night in recompense
thereof and thou hast but to choose thine own times let this then
suffice and like a worthy gentleman be satisfied to have taken thy
revenge and to have let me know it put not forth thy might against a
woman tis no glory to the eagle to have vanquished a dove wherefore
for gods and thine own honours sake have mercy on me
the scholar albeit his haughty spirit still brooded on her evil
entreatment of him yet saw her not weep and supplicate without a certain
compunction mingling with his exultation but vengeance he had desired
above all things to have wreaked it was indeed sweet and albeit his
humanity prompted him to have compassion on the hapless woman yet it
availed not to subdue the fierceness of his resentment wherefore thus he
made answermadam elena had my prayers albeit art i had none to
mingle with them tears and honeyed words as thou dost with thine
inclined thee that night when i stood perishing with cold amid the snow
that filled thy courtyard to accord me the very least shelter twere
but a light matter for me to hearken now to thine but if thou art now
so much more careful of thy honour than thou wast wont to be and it irks
thee to tarry there naked address thy prayers to him in whose arms it
irked thee not naked to pass that night thou mindest thee of albeit thou
wist that i with hasty foot was beating time upon the snow in thy
courtyard to the accompaniment of chattering teeth tis he that thou
shouldst call to succour thee to fetch thy clothes to adjust the ladder
for thy descent tis he in whom thou shouldst labour to inspire this
tenderness thou now shewest for thy honour that honour which for his
sake thou hast not scrupled to jeopardize both now and on a thousand
other occasions why then callst thou not him to come to thy succour
to whom pertains it rather than to him thou art his and of whom will he
have a care whom will he succour if not thee thou askedst him that
night when thou wast wantoning with him whether seemed to him the
greater my folly or the love thou didst bear him call him now foolish
woman and see if the love thou bearest him and thy wit and his may
avail to deliver thee from my folly tis now no longer in thy power to
shew me courtesy of that which i no more desire nor yet to refuse it
did i desire it reserve thy nights for thy lover if so be thou go hence
alive be they all thine and his one of them was more than i cared for
tis enough for me to have been flouted once ay and by thy cunning of
speech thou strivest might and main to conciliate my goodwill calling
me worthy gentleman by which insinuation thou wouldst fain induce me
magnanimously to desist from further chastisement of thy baseness but
thy cajoleries shall not now cloud the eyes of my mind as did once thy
false promises i know myself and better now for thy one nights
instruction than for all the time i spent at paris but granted that i
were disposed to be magnanimous thou art not of those to whom tis meet
to shew magnanimity a wild beast such as thou having merited vengeance
can claim no relief from suffering save death though in the case of a
human being twould suffice to temper vengeance with mercy as thou
saidst wherefore i albeit no eagle witting thee to be no dove but a
venomous serpent mankinds most ancient enemy am minded bating no jot
of malice or of might to harry thee to the bitter end natheless this
which i do is not properly to be called vengeance but rather just
retribution seeing that vengeance should be in excess of the offence
and this my chastisement of thee will fall short of it for were i
minded to be avenged on thee considering what account thou madest of my
heart and soul twould not suffice me to take thy life no nor the
lives of a hundred others such as thee for i should but slay a vile and
base and wicked woman and what the devil art thou more than any other
pitiful baggage that i should spare thy little store of beauty which a
few years will ruin covering thy face with wrinkles and yet twas not
for want of will that thou didst fail to do to death a worthy gentleman
as thou but now didst call me of whom in a single day of his life the
world may well have more profit than of a hundred thousand like thee
while the world shall last wherefore by this rude discipline i will
teach thee what it is to flout men of spirit and more especially what it
is to flout scholars that if thou escape with thy life thou mayst have
good cause ever hereafter to shun such folly but if thou art so fain to
make the descent why cast not thyself down whereby god helping thou
wouldst at once break thy neck be quit of the torment thou endurest and
make me the happiest man alive i have no more to say to thee twas my
art and craft thus caused thee climb be it thine to find the way down
thou hadst cunning enough when thou wast minded to flout me
while the scholar thus spoke the hapless lady wept incessantly and
before he had done to aggravate her misery the sun was high in the
heaven however when he was silent thus she made answerah ruthless
man if that accursed night has so rankled with thee and thou deemest my
fault so grave that neither my youth and beauty nor my bitter tears nor
yet my humble supplications may move thee to pity let this at least move
thee and abate somewhat of thy remorseless severity that twas my act
alone in that of late i trusted thee and discovered to thee all my
secret that did open the way to compass thy end and make me cognizant
of my guilt seeing that had i not confided in thee on no wise mightst
thou have been avenged on me which thou wouldst seem so ardently to have
desired turn thee then turn thee i pray thee from thy wrath and
pardon me so thou wilt pardon me and get me down hence right gladly
will i give up for ever my faithless gallant and thou shalt be my sole
lover and lord albeit thou sayst hard things of my beauty slight and
shortlived as thou wouldst have it to be which however it may compare
with others is i wot to be prized if for no other reason yet for
this that tis the admiration and solace and delight of young men and
thou art not yet old and albeit i have been harshly treated by thee yet
believe i cannot that thou wouldst have me do myself so shamefully to
death as to cast me down like some abandoned wretch before thine eyes
in which unless thou wast then as thou hast since shewn thyself a
liar i found such favour ah have pity on me for gods and mercys
sake the sun waxes exceeding hot and having suffered not a little by
the cold of last night i now begin to be sorely afflicted by the heat
madam rejoined the scholar who held her in parley with no small
delight twas not for any love that thou didst bear me that thou
trustedst me but that thou mightst recover that which thou hadst lost
for which cause thou meritest but the greater punishment and foolish
indeed art thou if thou supposest that such was the sole means available
for my revenge i had a thousand others and while i feigned to love
thee i had laid a thousand gins for thy feet into one or other of which
in no long time though this had not occurred thou must needs have
fallen and that too to thy more grievous suffering and shame nor was it
to spare thee but that i might be the sooner rejoiced by thy
discomfiture that i took my present course and though all other means
had failed me i had still the pen with which i would have written of
thee such matters and in such a sort that when thou wist them as thou
shouldst have done thou wouldst have regretted a thousand times that
thou hadst ever been born the might of the pen is greater far than they
suppose who have not proved it by experience by god i swear so may he
who has prospered me thus far in this my revenge prosper me to the end
that i would have written of thee things that would have so shamed thee
in thine ownnot to speak of otherssight that thou hadst put out
thine eyes that thou mightst no more see thyself wherefore chide not the
sea for that it has sent forth a tiny rivulet for thy love or whether
thou be mine or no nought care i be thou still his whose thou hast
been if thou canst hate him as i once did i now love him by reason of
his present entreatment of thee ye go getting you enamoured ye women
and nought will satisfy you but young gallants because ye mark that
their flesh is ruddier and their beards are blacker than other folks
and that they carry themselves well and foot it featly in the dance and
joust but those that are now more mature were even as they and possess
a knowledge which they have yet to acquire and therewithal ye deem that
they ride better and cover more miles in a day than men of riper age
now that they dust the pelisse with more vigour i certainly allow but
their seniors being more experienced know better the places where the
fleas lurk and spare and dainty diet is preferable to abundance without
savour moreover hard trotting will gall and jade even the youngest
whereas an easy pace though it bring one somewhat later to the inn at
any rate brings one thither fresh ye discern not witless creatures that
ye are how much of evil this little shew of bravery serves to hide your
young gallant is never content with one woman but lusts after as many as
he sets eyes on nor is there any but he deems himself worthy of her
wherefore tis not possible that their love should be lasting as thou
hast but now proved and mayst only too truly witness moreover to be
worshipped to be caressed by their ladies they deem but their due nor
is there aught whereon they plume and boast them so proudly as their
conquests which impertinence has caused not a few women to surrender to
the friars who keep their own counsel peradventure thou wilt say that
never a soul save thy maid and i wist aught of thy loves but if so
thou hast been misinformed and if thou so believest thou dost
misbelieve scarce aught else is talked of either in his quarter or in
thine but most often tis those most concerned whose ears such matters
reach last moreover they rob you these young gallants whereas the
others make you presents so then having made a bad choice be thou
still his to whom thou hast given thyself and leave me whom thou didst
flout to another for i have found a lady of much greater charms than
thine and that has understood me better than thou didst and that thou
mayst get thee to the other world better certified of the desire of my
eyes than thou wouldst seem to be here by my words delay no more but
cast thyself down whereby thy soul taken forthwith as i doubt not she
will be into the embrace of the devil may see whether thy headlong fall
afflicts mine eyes or no but for that i doubt thou meanest not thus to
gladden me i bid thee if thou findest the sun begin to scorch thee
remember the cold thou didst cause me to endure wherewith by admixture
thou mayst readily temper the suns heat
the hapless lady seeing that the scholars words were ever to the same
ruthless effect burst afresh into tears and saidlo now since
nought that pertains to me may move thee be thou at least moved by the
love thou bearest this lady of whom thou speakest who thou sayst is
wiser than i and loves thee and for love of her pardon me and fetch me
my clothes that i may resume them and get me down hence whereat the
scholar fell a laughing and seeing that twas not a little past tierce
made answerlo now i know not how to deny thee adjuring me as thou
dost by such a lady tell me then where thy clothes are and i will go
fetch them and bring thee down the lady believing him was somewhat
comforted and told him where she had laid her clothes the scholar then
quitted the tower bidding his servant on no account to stir from his
post but to keep close by and as best he might bar the tower against
all comers until his return which said he betook him to the house of
his friend where he breakfasted much at his ease and thereafter went to
sleep left alone upon the tower the lady somewhat cheered by her fond
hope but still exceeding sorrowful drew nigh to a part of the wall
where there was a little shade and there sate down to wait and now lost
in most melancholy brooding now dissolved in tears now plunged in
despair of ever seeing the scholar return with her clothes but never
more than a brief while in any one mood spent with grief and the nights
vigil she by and by fell asleep the sun was now in the zenith and
smote with extreme fervour full and unmitigated upon her tender and
delicate frame and upon her bare head insomuch that his rays did not
only scorch but bit by bit excoriate every part of her flesh that was
exposed to them and so shrewdly burn her that albeit she was in a deep
sleep the pain awoke her and as by reason thereof she writhed a little
she felt the scorched skin part in sunder and shed itself as will happen
when one tugs at a parchment that has been singed by the fire while her
head ached so sore that it seemed like to split and no wonder nor might
she find place either to lie or to stand on the floor of the roof but
ever went to and fro weeping besides which there stirred not the least
breath of wind and flies and gadflies did swarm in prodigious quantity
which settling upon her excoriate flesh stung her so shrewdly that
twas as if she received so many stabs with a javelin and she was ever
restlessly feeling her sores with her hands and cursing herself her
life her lover and the scholar
thus by the exorbitant heat of the sun by the flies and gadflies
harassed goaded and lacerated tormented also by hunger and yet more
by thirst and thereto by a thousand distressful thoughts she panted
herself erect on her feet and looked about her if haply she might see
or hear any one with intent come what might to call to him and crave
his succour but even this hostile fortune had disallowed her the
husbandmen were all gone from the fields by reason of the heat and
indeed there had come none to work that day in the neighbourhood of the
tower for that all were employed in threshing their corn beside their
cottages wherefore she heard but the cicalas while arno tantalizing
her with the sight of his waters increased rather than diminished her
thirst ay and in like manner wherever she espied a copse or a patch
of shade or a house twas a torment to her for the longing she had for
it what more is to be said of this hapless woman only this that what
with the heat of the sun above and the floor beneath her and the
scarification of her flesh in every part by the flies and gadflies that
flesh which in the night had dispelled the gloom by its whiteness was
now become red as madder and so besprent with clots of blood that whoso
had seen her would have deemed her the most hideous object in the world
thus resourceless and hopeless she passed the long hours expecting
death rather than aught else until half none was come and gone when
his siesta ended the scholar bethought him of his lady and being minded
to see how she fared hied him back to the tower and sent his servant
away to break his fast as soon as the lady espied him she came spent
and crushed by her sore affliction to the aperture and thus addressed
himrinieri the cup of thy vengeance is full to overflowing for if i
gave thee a night of freezing in my courtyard thou hast given me upon
this tower a day of scorching nay of burning and therewithal of
perishing of hunger and thirst wherefore by god i entreat thee to come
up hither and as my heart fails me to take my life take it thou for
tis death i desire of all things such and so grievous is my suffering
but if this grace thou wilt not grant at least bring me a cup of water
wherewith to lave my mouth for which my tears do not suffice so parched
and torrid is it within well wist the scholar by her voice how spent
she was he also saw a part of her body burned through and through by the
sun whereby and by reason of the lowliness of her entreaties he felt
some little pity for her but all the same he made answernay wicked
woman tis not by my hands thou shalt die thou canst die by thine own
whenever thou art so minded and to temper thy heat thou shalt have just
as much water from me as i had fire from thee to mitigate my cold i only
regret that for the cure of my chill the physicians were fain to use
foulsmelling muck whereas thy burns can be treated with fragrant
rosewater and that whereas i was like to lose my muscles and the use
of my limbs thou for all thy excoriation by the heat wilt yet be fair
again like a snake that has sloughed off the old skin alas woes
me replied the lady for charms acquired at such a cost god grant
them to those that hate me but thou most fell of all wild beasts how
hast thou borne thus to torture me what more had i to expect of thee or
any other had i done all thy kith and kin to death with direst torments
verily i know not what more cruel suffering thou couldst have inflicted
on a traitor that had put a whole city to the slaughter than this which
thou hast allotted to me to be thus roasted and devoured of the flies
and therewithal to refuse me even a cup of water though the very
murderers condemned to death by the law as they go to execution not
seldom are allowed wine to drink so they but ask it lo now i see that
thou art inexorable in thy ruthlessness and on no wise to be moved by my
suffering wherefore with resignation i will compose me to await death
that god may have mercy on my soul and may this that thou doest escape
not the searching glance of his just eyes which said she dragged
herself sore suffering toward the middle of the floor despairing of
ever escaping from her fiery torment besides which not once only but a
thousand times she thought to choke for thirst and ever she wept
bitterly and bewailed her evil fate but at length the day wore to
vespers and the scholar being sated with his revenge caused his
servant to take her clothes and wrap them in his cloak and hied him with
the servant to the hapless ladys house where finding her maid sitting
disconsolate and woebegone and resourceless at the doorgood woman
quoth he what has befallen thy mistress wheretosir i know not
replied the maid i looked to find her this morning abed for methought
she went to bed last night but neither there nor anywhere else could i
find her nor know i what is become of her wherefore exceeding great is
my distress but have you sir nought to say of the matter only
this returned the scholar that i would i had had thee with her there
where i have had her that i might have requited thee of thy offence
even as i have requited her of hers but be assured that thou shalt not
escape my hands until thou hast from me such wage of thy labour that
thou shalt never flout man more but thou shalt mind thee of me then
turning to his servant he saidgive her these clothes and tell her
that she may go bring her mistress away if she will the servant did
his bidding and the maid what with the message and her recognition of
the clothes was mightily afraid lest they had slain the lady and
scarce suppressing a shriek took the clothes and bursting into tears
set off as soon as the scholar was gone at a run for the tower
now one of the ladys husbandmen had had the misfortune to lose two of
his hogs that day and seeking them came to the tower not long after
the scholar had gone thence and peering about in all quarters if haply
he might have sight of his hogs heard the woeful lamentation that the
hapless lady made and got him up into the tower and called out as loud
as he mightwho wails up there the lady recognized her husbandmans
voice and called him by name sayingprithee go fetch my maid and
cause her come up hither to me the husbandman knowing her by her
voice repliedalas madam who set you there your maid has been
seeking you all day long but who would ever have supposed that you were
there whereupon he took the props of the ladder and set them in
position and proceeded to secure the rounds to them with withies thus
engaged he was found by the maid who as she entered the tower beat her
face and breast and unable longer to keep silence cried outalas
sweet my lady where are you whereto the lady made answer as loud as
she mighto my sister here above am i weep not but fetch me my
clothes forthwith wellnigh restored to heart to hear her mistresss
voice the maid assisted by the husbandman ascended the ladder which
he had now all but set in order and gaining the roof and seeing her
lady lie there naked spent and fordone and liker to a halfburned stump
than to a human being she planted her nails in her face and fell a
weeping over her as if she were a corpse however the lady bade her for
gods sake be silent and help her to dress and having learned from her
that none knew where she had been save those that had brought her her
clothes and the husbandman that was there present was somewhat consoled
and besought her for gods sake to say nought of the matter to any thus
long time they conversed and then the husbandman took the lady on his
shoulders for walk she could not and bore her safely out of the tower
the unfortunate maid following after with somewhat less caution
slipped and falling from the ladder to the ground broke her thigh and
roared for pain like any lion so the husbandman set the lady down upon a
grassy mead while he went to see what had befallen the maid whom
finding her thigh broken he brought and laid beside the lady who
seeing her woes completed by this last misfortune and that she of whom
most of all she had expected succour was lamed of a thigh was
distressed beyond measure and wept again so piteously that not only was
the husbandman powerless to comfort her but was himself fain to weep
however as the sun was now low that they might not be there surprised
by night he with the disconsolate ladys approval hied him home and
called to his aid two of his brothers and his wife who returned with
him bearing a plank whereon they laid the maid and so they carried her
to the ladys house there by dint of cold water and words of cheer
they restored some heart to the lady whom the husbandman then took upon
his shoulders and bore to her chamber the husbandmans wife fed her
with sops of bread and then undressed her and put her to bed they also
provided the means to carry her and the maid to florence and so twas
done there the lady who was very fertile in artifices invented an
entirely fictitious story of what had happened as well in regard of her
maid as of herself whereby she persuaded both her brothers and her
sisters and every one else that twas all due to the enchantments of
evil spirits the physicians lost no time and albeit the ladys
suffering and mortification were extreme for she left more than one skin
sticking to the sheets they cured her of a high fever and certain
attendant maladies as also the maid of her fractured thigh the end of
all which was that the lady forgot her lover and having learned
discretion was thenceforth careful neither to love nor to flout and the
scholar learning that the maid had broken her thigh deemed his
vengeance complete and was satisfied to say never a word more of the
affair such then were the consequences of her flouts to this foolish
young woman who deemed that she might trifle with a scholar with the
like impunity as with others not duly understanding that theyi say not
all but the more partknow where the devil keeps his tail1
wherefore my ladies have a care how you flout men and more especially
scholars
1 ie are a match for the devil himself in cunning
novel viii

two men keep with one another the one lies with the others wife the
other being ware thereof manages with the aid of his wife to have the
one locked in a chest upon which he then lies with the wife of him that
is locked therein

grievous and distressful was it to the ladies to hear how it fared with
elena but as they accounted the retribution in a measure righteous they
were satisfied to expend upon her but a moderate degree of compassion
albeit they censured the scholar as severe intemperately relentless and
indeed ruthless in his vengeance however pampinea having brought the
story to a close the queen bade fiammetta follow suit and prompt to
obey fiammetta thus spokedebonair my ladies as methinks your
feelings must have been somewhat harrowed by the severity of the
resentful scholar i deem it meet to soothe your vexed spirits with
something of a more cheerful order wherefore i am minded to tell you a
little story of a young man who bore an affront in a milder temper and
avenged himself with more moderation whereby you may understand that one
should be satisfied if the ass and the wall are quits nor by indulging a
vindictive spirit to excess turn the requital of a wrong into an occasion
of wrongdoing you are to know then that at siena as i have heard
tell there dwelt two young men of good substance and for plebeians of
good family the one spinelloccio tanena the other zeppa di mino by
name who their houses being contiguous in the camollia1 kept ever
together and by what appeared loved each other as brothers or even
more so and had each a very fine woman to wife now it so befell that
spinelloccio being much in zeppas house as well when zeppa was not as
when he was there grew so familiar with zeppas wife that he sometimes
lay with her and on this wise they continued to forgather a great while
before any one was ware of it however one of these days zeppa being at
home though the lady wist it not spinelloccio came in quest of him
and the lady sending word that he was not at home he forthwith went
upstairs and found the lady in the saloon and seeing none else there
kissed her as did she him
zeppa saw all that passed but said nothing and kept close being minded
to see how the game would end and soon saw his wife and spinelloccio
still in one anothers arms hie them to her chamber and lock themselves
in whereat he was mightily incensed but witting that to make a noise
or do aught else overt would not lessen but rather increase his
dishonour he cast about how he might be avenged on such wise that
without the affair getting wind he might content his soul and having
after long pondering hit as he thought upon the expedient he budged
not from his retreat until spinelloccio had parted from the lady
whereupon he hied him into the chamber and there finding the lady with
her headgear which spinelloccio in toying with her had disarranged
scarce yet readjustedmadam what dost thou quoth he
wheretowhy dost not see returned the lady troth do i rejoined
he and somewhat else have i seen that i would i had not and so he
questioned her of what had passed and she being mightily afraid did
after long parley confess that which she might not plausibly deny to
wit her intimacy with spinelloccio and fell a beseeching him with tears
to pardon her lo now wife quoth zeppa thou hast done wrong and
so thou wouldst have me pardon thee have a care to do exactly as i shall
bid thee to wit on this wise thou must tell spinelloccio to find some
occasion to part from me tomorrow morning about tierce and come hither
to thee and while he is here i will come back and when thou hearest me
coming thou wilt get him into this chest and lock him in there which
when thou hast done i will tell thee what else thou hast to do which
thou mayst do without the least misgiving for i promise thee i will do
him no harm the lady to content him promised to do as he bade and
she kept her word
the morrow came and zeppa and spinelloccio being together about tierce
spinelloccio having promised the lady to come to see her at that hour
said to zeppai must go breakfast with a friend whom i had lief not
keep in waiting therefore adieu nay but quoth zeppa tis not
yet breakfasttime no matter returned spinelloccio i have business
on which i must speak with him so i must be in good time whereupon
spinelloccio took his leave of zeppa and having reached zeppas house by
a slightly circuitous route and finding his wife there was taken by her
into the chamber where they had not been long together when zeppa
returned hearing him come the lady feigning no small alarm bundled
spinelloccio into the chest as her husband had bidden her and having
locked him in left him there as zeppa came upstairswife quoth he
is it breakfast time ay husband tis so replied the lady
whereuponspinelloccio is gone to breakfast with a friend today
quoth zeppa leaving his wife at home get thee to the window and call
her and bid her come and breakfast with us the lady whose fear for
herself made her mighty obedient did as her husband bade her and after
much pressing spinelloccios wife came to breakfast with them though she
was given to understand that her husband would not be of the company so
she being come zeppa received her most affectionately and taking her
familiarly by the hand bade his wife in an undertone get her to the
kitchen he then led spinelloccios wife into the chamber and locked the
door hearing the key turn in the lockalas quoth the lady what
means this zeppa ist for this you have brought me here is this the
love you bear spinelloccio is this your loyalty to him as your friend
and comrade by the time she had done speaking zeppa still keeping
fast hold of her was beside the chest in which her husband was locked
whereforemadam quoth he spare me thy reproaches until thou hast
heard what i have to say to thee i have loved i yet love spinelloccio
as a brother and yesterday though he knew it not i discovered that the
trust i reposed in him has for its guerdon that he lies with my wife as
with thee now for that i love him i purpose not to be avenged upon him
save in the sort in which he offended he has had my wife and i intend
to have thee so thou wilt not grant me what i crave of thee be sure i
shall not fail to take it and having no mind to let this affront pass
unavenged will make such play with him that neither thou nor he shall
ever be happy again the lady hearkening and by dint of his repeated
asseverations coming at length to believe himzeppa mine quoth she
as this thy vengeance is to light upon me well content am i so only
thou let not this which we are to do embroil me with thy wife with whom
notwithstanding the evil turn she has done me i am minded to remain at
peace have no fear on that score replied zeppa nay i will give
thee into the bargain a jewel so rare and fair that thou hast not the
like which said he took her in his arms and fell a kissing her and
having laid her on the chest in which her husband was safe under lock
and key did there disport himself with her to his hearts content as
she with him
spinelloccio in the chest heard all that zeppa had said and how he was
answered by the lady and the trevisan dance that afterwards went on over
his head whereat his mortification was such that for a great while he
scarce hoped to live through it and but for the fear he had of zeppa
he would have given his wife a sound rating close prisoner though he
was but as he bethought him that twas he that had given the first
affront and that zeppa had good cause for acting as he did and that he
had dealt with him considerately and as a good fellow should he resolved
that if it were agreeable to zeppa they should be faster friends than
ever before however zeppa having had his pleasure with the lady got
down from the chest and being reminded by the lady of his promise of the
jewel opened the door of the chamber and brought his wife in quoth she
with a laughmadam you have given me tit for tat and never a word
more whereuponopen the chest quoth zeppa and she obeying he
shewed the lady her spinelloccio lying therein twould be hard to say
whether of the twain was the more shamestricken spinelloccio to be
confronted with zeppa knowing that zeppa wist what he had done or the
lady to meet her husbands eyes knowing that he had heard what went on
above his head lo here is the jewel i give thee quoth zeppa to her
pointing to spinelloccio who as he came forth of the chest blurted
outzeppa we are quits and so twere best as thou saidst a while
ago to my wife that we still be friends as we were wont and as we had
nought separate save our wives that henceforth we have them also in
common content quoth zeppa and so in perfect peace and accord they
all four breakfasted together and thenceforth each of the ladies had two
husbands and each of the husbands two wives nor was there ever the
least dispute or contention between them on that score
1 a suburb of siena
novel ix

bruno and buffalmacco prevail upon master simone a physician to betake
him by night to a certain place there to be enrolled in a company that
go the course buffalmacco throws him into a foul ditch and there they
leave him

when the ladies had made merry a while over the partnership in wives
established by the two sienese the queen who now unless she were
minded to infringe dioneos privilege alone remained to tell began on
this wisefairly earned indeed loving ladies was the flout that
spinelloccio got from zeppa wherefore my judgment jumps with that which
pampinea expressed a while ago to wit that he is not severely to be
censured who bestows a flout on one that provokes it or deserves it and
as spinelloccio deserved it so tis my purpose to tell you of one that
provoked it for i deem that those from whom he received it were rather
to be commended than condemned the man that got it was a physician who
albeit he was but a blockhead returned from bologna to florence in
mantle and hood of vair
tis matter of daily experience that our citizens come back to us from
bologna this man a judge that a physician and the other a notary
flaunting it in ample flowing robes and adorned with the scarlet and the
vair and other array most goodly to see and how far their doings
correspond with this fair seeming is also matter of daily experience
among whom tis not long since master simone da villa one whose
patrimony was more ample than his knowledge came back wearing the
scarlet and a broad stripe1 on the shoulder and a doctor as he called
himself and took a house in the street that we now call via del
cocomero now this master simone being thus as we said come back had
this among other singular habits that he could never see a soul pass
along the street but he must needs ask any that was by who that man
was and he was as observant of all the doings of men and as sedulous to
store his memory with such matters as if they were to serve him to
compound the drugs that he was to give his patients now of all that he
saw those that he eyed most observantly were two painters of whom here
today mention has twice been made bruno to wit and buffalmacco who
were ever together and were his neighbours and as it struck him that
they daffed the world aside and lived more lightheartedly than any others
that he knew as indeed they did he enquired of not a few folk as to
their rank and learning on all hands that they were poor men and
painters he could not conceive it possible that they should live thus
contentedly in poverty but made his mind up that being as he was
informed clever fellows they must have some secret source from which
they drew immense gains for which reason he grew all agog to get on
friendly terms with them or any rate with one of them and did succeed
in making friends with bruno
bruno who had not needed to be much with him in order to discover that
this physician was but a dolt had never such a jolly time in palming off
his strange stories upon him while the physician on his part was
marvellously delighted with bruno to whom having bidden him to
breakfast and thinking that for that reason he might talk familiarly
with him he expressed the amazement with which he regarded both him and
buffalmacco for that being but poor men they lived so lightheartedly
and asked him to tell him how they managed at which fresh proof of the
doctors simplicity and fatuity bruno was inclined to laugh but
bethinking him that twere best to answer him according to his folly he
saidmaster there are not many persons to whom i would disclose our
manner of life but as you are my friend and i know you will not let it
go further i do not mind telling you the fact is that my comrade and i
live not only as lightheartedly and jovially as you see but much more
so and yet neither our art nor any property that we possess yields us
enough to keep us in water not that i would have you suppose that we go
a thieving no tis that we go the course and thereby without the least
harm done to a soul we get all that we need nay all that we desire and
thus it is that we live so lightheartedly as you see which explanation
the doctor believing none the less readily that he knew not what it
meant was lost in wonder and forthwith burned with a most vehement
desire to know what going the course might be and was instant with bruno
to expound it assuring him that he would never tell a soul alas
master said bruno what is this you ask of me tis a mighty great
secret you would have me impart to you twould be enough to undo me to
send me packing out of the world nay into the very jaws of lucifer of
san gallo2 if it came to be known but such is the respect in which i
hold your quiditative pumpionship of legnaia and the trust i repose in
you that i am not able to deny you aught you ask of me and so i will
tell it you on condition that you swear by the cross at montesone that
you will keep your promise and never repeat it to a soul
the master gave the required assurance whereuponyou are then to
know quoth bruno sweet my master that tis not long since there was
in this city a great master in necromancy hight michael scott for that
he was of scotland and great indeed was the honour in which he was held
by not a few gentlemen most of whom are now dead and when the time came
that he must needs depart from florence he at their instant entreaty
left behind him two pupils adepts both whom he bade hold themselves
ever ready to pleasure those gentlemen who had done him honour and very
handsomely they did serve the said gentlemen in certain of their love
affairs and other little matters and finding the city and the manners of
the citizens agreeable to them they made up their minds to stay here
always and grew friendly and very intimate with some of the citizens
making no distinction between gentle and simple rich or poor so only
they were such as were conformable to their ways and to gratify these
their friends they formed a company of perhaps twentyfive men to meet
together at least twice a month in a place appointed by them where when
they are met each utters his desire and forthwith that same night they
accomplish it now buffalmacco and i being extraordinarily great and
close friends with these two adepts were by them enrolled in this
company and are still members of it and i assure you that as often as
we are assembled together the adornments of the saloon in which we eat
are a marvel to see ay and the tables laid as for kings and the
multitudes of stately and handsome servants as well women as men at the
beck and call of every member of the company and the basins and the
ewers the flasks and the cups and all else that is there for our
service in eating and drinking of nought but gold and silver and
therewithal the abundance and variety of the viands suited to the taste
of each that are set before us each in due course these too be
marvels twere vain for me to seek to describe to you the sweet concord
that is there of innumerable instruments of music and the tuneful songs
that salute our ears nor might i hope to tell you how much wax is burned
at these banquets or compute the quantity of the comfits that are eaten
or the value of the wines that are drunk nor my pumpkin o wit would i
have you suppose that when we are there we wear our common clothes
such as you now see me wear nay there is none there so humble but he
shews as an emperor so sumptuous are our garments so splendid our
trappings but among all the delights of the place none may compare with
the fair ladies who so one do but wish are brought thither from every
part of the world why you might see there my lady of the barbanichs
the queen of the basques the consort of the soldan the empress of
osbech the ciancianfera of nornieca the semistante of berlinzone and
the scalpedra of narsia but why seek to enumerate them all they include
all the queens in the world ay even to the schinchimurra of prester
john who has the horns sprouting out of her nether end so theres for
you now when these ladies have done with the wine and the comfits they
tread a measure or two each with the man at whose behest she is come
and then all go with their gallants to their chambers and know that each
of these chambers shews as a very paradise so fair is it ay and no
less fragrant than the cases of aromatics in your shop when you are
pounding the cumin and therein are beds that you would find more goodly
than that of the doge of venice and tis in them we take our rest and
how busily they ply the treadle and how lustily they tug at the frame to
make the stuff close and compact i leave you to imagine however among
the luckiest of all i reckon buffalmacco and myself for that buffalmacco
for the most part fetches him the queen of france and i do the like with
the queen of england who are just the finest women in the world and we
have known how to carry it with them so that we are the very eyes of
their heads so i leave it to your own judgment to determine whether we
have not good cause to live and bear ourselves with a lighter heart than
others seeing that we are beloved of two such great queens to say
nothing of the thousand or two thousand florins that we have of them
whenever we are so minded now this in the vulgar we call going the
course because as the corsairs prey upon all the world so do we
albeit with this difference that whereas they never restore their
spoil we do so as soon as we have done with it so now my worthy
master you understand what we mean by going the course but how close it
behoves you to keep such a secret you may see for yourself so i spare
you any further exhortations
the master whose skill did not reach perhaps beyond the treatment of
children for the scurf took all that bruno said for gospel and burned
with so vehement a desire to be admitted into this company that he could
not have longed for the summum bonum itself with more ardour so after
telling bruno that indeed twas no wonder they bore them lightheartedly
he could scarce refrain from asking him there and then to have him
enrolled albeit he deemed it more prudent to defer his suit until by
lavishing honour upon him he had gained a right to urge it with more
confidence he therefore made more and more of him had him to breakfast
and sup with him and treated him with extraordinary respect in short
such and so constant was their intercourse that it seemed as though the
master wist not how to live without bruno as it went so well with him
bruno to mark his sense of the honour done him by the doctor painted in
his saloon a picture symbolical of lent and an agnus dei at the entrance
of his chamber and an alembic over his front door that those who would
fain consult him might know him from other physicians besides a battle
of rats and mice in his little gallery which the doctor thought an
extremely fine piece and from time to time when he had not supped with
the master he would say to himlast night i was with the company and
being a little tired of the queen of england i fetched me the gumedra of
the great can of tarisi gumedra quoth the master what is she i
know not the meaning of these words thereat master replied bruno
i marvel not for i have heard tell that neither porcograsso nor
vannacena say aught thereof thou wouldst say ippocrasso and avicenna
returned the master ifaith i know not quoth bruno i as ill know
the meaning of your words as you of mine but gumedra in the speech of
the great can signifies the same as empress in ours ah a fine woman you
would find her and plenty of her i warrant she would make you forget
your drugs and prescriptions and plasters and so bruno from time to
time whetting the masters appetite and the master at length thinking
that by his honourable entreatment of him he had fairly made a conquest
of bruno it befell that one evening while he held the light for bruno
who was at work on the battle of rats and mice he determined to discover
to him his desire and as they were alone thus he spokegod knows
bruno that there lives not the man for whom i would do as much as for
thee why if thou wast to bid me go all the way from here to
peretola3 i almost think i would do so wherefore i trust thou wilt
not deem it strange if i talk to thee as an intimate friend and in
confidence thou knowest tis not long since thou didst enlarge with me
on thy gay company and their doings which has engendered in me such a
desire as never was to know more thereof nor without reason as thou
wilt discover should i ever become a member of the said company for i
straightway give thee leave to make game of me should i not then fetch
me the fairest maid thou hast seen this many a day whom i saw last year
at cacavincigli and to whom i am entirely devoted and by the body of
christ i offered her ten bolognese groats that she should pleasure me
and she would not wherefore i do most earnestly entreat thee to instruct
me what i must do to fit myself for membership in the company and never
doubt that in me you will have a true and loyal comrade and one that
will do you honour and above all thou seest how goodly i am of my
person and how well furnished with legs and of face as fresh as a rose
and therewithal i am a doctor of medicine and i scarce think you have
any such among you and not a little excellent lore i have and many a
good song by heart of which i will sing thee one and forthwith he fell
a singing
bruno had such a mind to laugh that he could scarce contain himself but
still he kept a grave countenance and when the master had ended his
song and saidhow likes it thee he answeredverily no lyre of
straw could vie with you so artargutically4 you refine your strain
i warrant thee returned the master thou hadst never believed it
hadst thou not heard me ay indeed sooth sayst thou quoth bruno
and i have other songs to boot said the master but enough of this at
present thou must know that i such as thou seest me am a gentlemans
son albeit my father lived in the contado and on my mothers side i
come of the vallecchio family and as thou mayst have observed i have
quite the finest library and wardrobe of all the physicians in florence
gods faith i have a robe that cost all told close upon a hundred
pounds in bagattines5 more than ten years ago wherefore i make most
instant suit to thee that thou get me enrolled which if thou do gods
faith be thou never so ill thou shalt pay me not a stiver for my
tendance of thee whereupon bruno repeating to himself as he had done
many a time before that the doctor was a very numskullmaster quoth
he shew a little more light here and have patience until i have put
the finishing touches to the tails of these rats and then i will answer
you so he finished the tails and then putting on an air as if he were
not a little embarrassed by the requestmaster mine quoth he i
should have great things to expect from you that i know but yet what
you ask of me albeit to your great mind it seems but a little thing is
a weighty matter indeed for me nor know i a soul in the world to whom
though well able i would grant such a request save to you alone and
this i say not for friendships sake alone albeit i love you as i ought
but for that your discourse is so fraught with wisdom that tis enough
to make a beguine start out of her boots much more then to incline me
to change my purpose and the more i have of your company the wiser i
repute you whereto i may add that if for no other cause i should
still be well disposed towards you for the love i see you bear to that
fair piece of flesh of which you spoke but now but this i must tell you
tis not in my power to do as you would have me in this matter but
though i cannot myself do the needful in your behalf if you will pledge
your faith whole and solid as may be to keep my secret i will shew you
how to go about it for yourself and i make no doubt that having this
fine library and the other matters you spoke of a while ago you will
compass your end quoth then the masternay but speak freely i see
thou dost yet scarce know me and how well i can keep a secret there
were few things that messer guasparruolo da saliceto did when he was
podesta of forlinpopoli that he did not confide to me so safe he knew
they would be in my keeping and wouldst thou be satisfied that i say
sooth i assure you i was the first man whom he told that he was about to
marry bergamina so theres for thee well and good said bruno if
such as he confided in you well indeed may i do the like know then
that you will have to proceed on this wiseour company is governed by a
captain and a council of two who are changed every six months and on
the calends without fail buffalmacco will be captain and i councillor
tis so fixed and the captain has not a little power to promote the
admission and enrolment of whomsoever he will wherefore methinks you
would do well to make friends with buffalmacco and honourably entreat
him he is one that marking your great wisdom will take a mighty liking
to you forthwith and when you have just a little dazzled him with your
wisdom and these fine things of yours you may make your request to him
and he will not know how to say noi have already talked with him of
you and he is as well disposed to you as may beand having so done you
will leave the rest to me whereuponthy words are to me for an
exceeding great joy quoth the master and if he be one that loves to
converse with sages he has but to exchange a word or two with me and i
will answer for it that he will be ever coming to see me for so fraught
with wisdom am i that i could furnish a whole city therewith and still
remain a great sage
having thus set matters in train bruno related the whole affair point
by point to buffalmacco to whom it seemed a thousand years till he
should be able to give master noodle that of which he was in quest the
doctor now all agog to go the course lost no time and found no
difficulty in making friends with buffalmacco and fell to entertaining
him and bruno likewise at breakfast and supper in most magnificent
style while they fooled him to the top of his bent for being gentlemen
that appreciated excellent wines and fat capons besides other good cheer
in plenty they were inclined to be very neighbourly and needed no
second bidding but always letting him understand that there was none
other whose company they relished so much kept ever with him
however in due time the master asked of buffalmacco that which he had
before asked of bruno whereat buffalmacco feigned to be not a little
agitated and turning angrily to bruno made a great pother about his
ears sayingby the most high god of pasignano i vow i can scarce
forbear to give thee that over the head that should make thy nose fall
about thy heels traitor that thou art for tis thou alone that canst
have discovered these secrets to the master whereupon the master
interposed with no little vigour averring with oaths that twas from
another source that he had gotten his knowledge and buffalmacco at
length allowed himself to be pacified by the sages words so turning to
himmaster quoth he tis evident indeed that you have been at
bologna and have come back hither with a mouth that blabs not and that
twas on no pippin as many a dolt does but on the good long pumpkin
that you learned your a b c and if i mistake not you were baptized on
a sunday6 and though bruno has told me that twas medicine you studied
there tis my opinion that you there studied the art of catching men of
which what with your wisdom and your startling revelations you are the
greatest master that ever i knew he would have said more but the
doctor turning to bruno broke in withah what it is to consort and
converse with the wise who but this worthy man would thus have read my
mind through and through less quick by far to rate me at my true worth
wast thou but what said i when thou toldst me that buffalmacco delighted
to converse with sages confess now have i not kept my word verily
quoth bruno you have more than kept it then addressing
buffalmaccoah cried the master what hadst thou said hadst thou
seen me at bologna where there was none great or small doctor or
scholar but was devoted to me so well wist i how to entertain them with
my words of wisdom nay more let me tell thee that there was never a
word i spoke but set every one a laughing so great was the pleasure it
gave them and at my departure they all deplored it most bitterly and
would have had me remain and by way of inducement went so far as to
propose that i should be sole lecturer to all the students in medicine
that were there which offer i declined for that i was minded to return
hither having vast estates here that have ever belonged to my family
which accordingly i did quoth then bruno to buffalmaccohow shews
it now man thou didst not believe me when i told thee what he was by
the gospels there is never a physician in this city that has the lore of
asss urine by heart as he has verily thou wouldst not find his like
between here and the gates of paris now see if thou canst help doing as
he would have thee tis even as bruno says observed the doctor but
i am not understood here you florentines are somewhat slow of wit would
you could see me in my proper element among a company of doctors
whereuponof a truth master quoth buffalmacco your lore far
exceeds any i should ever have imputed to you wherefore addressing you
as tis meet to address a man of your wisdom i give you disjointedly to
understand that without fail i will procure your enrolment in our
company
after this promise the honours lavished by the doctor upon the two men
grew and multiplied in return for which they diverted themselves by
setting him a prancing upon every wildest chimera in the world and
promised among other matters to give him by way of mistress the
countess of civillari7 whom they averred to be the goodliest creature
to be found in all the netherlands of the human race and the doctor
asking who this countess might bemature my gherkin quoth
buffalmacco she is indeed a very great lady and few houses are there
in the world in which she has not some jurisdiction nay the very friars
minors to say nought of other folk pay her tribute to the sound of the
kettledrum and i may tell you that when she goes abroad she makes her
presence very sensibly felt albeit for the most part she keeps herself
close however tis no great while since she passed by your door one
night on her way to the arno to bathe her feet and get a breath of air
but most of her time she abides at laterina8 serjeants has she not a
few that go their rounds at short intervals bearing one and all the
rod and the bucket in token of her sovereignty and barons in plenty in
all parts as tamagnino della porta9 don meta10 manico di
scopa11 squacchera12 and others with whom i doubt not you are
intimately acquainted though you may not just now bear them in mind
such then is the great lady in whose soft arms we if we delude not
ourselves will certainly place you in which case you may well dispense
with her of cacavincigli
the doctor who had been born and bred at bologna and understood not
their words found the lady quite to his mind and shortly afterwards the
painters brought him tidings of his election into the company then came
the day of the nocturnal gathering and the doctor had the two men to
breakfast and when they had breakfasted he asked them after what manner
he was to join the company whereuponlo now master quoth
buffalmacco you have need of a stout heart otherwise you may meet with
some let to our most grievous hurt and for what cause you have need of
this stout heart you shall hear you must contrive to be tonight about
the hour of first sleep on one of the raised tombs that have been lately
placed outside of santa maria novella and mind that you wear one of your
best gowns that your first appearance may impress the company with a
proper sense of your dignity and also because as we are informed for
we were not present at the time the countess by reason that you are a
gentleman is minded to make you a knight of the bath at her own charges
so you will wait there until one whom we shall send come for you who
that you may know exactly what you have to expect will be a beast black
and horned of no great size and he will go snorting and bounding amain
about the piazza in front of you with intent to terrify you but when
he perceives that you are not afraid he will draw nigh you quietly and
when he is close by you then get you down from the tomb fearing
nothing and minding you neither of god nor of the saints mount him
and when you are well set on his back then fold your arms upon your
breast as in submission and touch him no more then going gently he
will bear you to us but once mind you of god or the saints or give way
to fear and i warn you he might give you a fall or dash you against
something that you would find scarce pleasant wherefore if your heart
misgives you you were best not to come for you would assuredly do
yourself a mischief and us no good at all quoth then the doctoryou
know me not as yet tis perchance because i wear the gloves and the long
robe that you misdoubt me ah did you but know what feats i have done in
times past at bologna when i used to go after the women with my
comrades you would be lost in amazement gods faith on one of those
nights there was one of them a poor sickly creature she was too and
stood not a cubit in height who would not come with us so first i
treated her to many a good cuff and then i took her up by main force
and carried her wellnigh as far as a crossbow will send a bolt and so
caused her willynilly come with us and on another occasion i mind me
that having none other with me but my servant a little after the hour
of ave maria i passed beside the cemetery of the friars minors and
though that very day a woman had been there interred i had no fear at
all so on this score you may make your minds easy for indeed i am a man
of exceeding great courage and prowess and to appear before you with due
dignity i will don my scarlet gown in which i took my doctors degree
and it remains to be seen if the company will not give me a hearty
welcome and make me captain out of hand let me once be there and you
will see how things will go else how is it that this countess that has
not yet seen me is already so enamoured of me that she is minded to make
me a knight of the bath and whether i shall find knighthood agreeable
or know how to support the dignity well or ill leave that to me
whereuponwell said excellent well said quoth buffalmacco but
look to it you disappoint us not either by not coming or by not being
found when we send for you and this i say because tis cold weather
and you medical gentlemen take great care of your health god forbid
replied the doctor i am none of your chilly folk i fear not the cold
tis seldom indeed when i leave my bed a nights to answer the call of
nature as one must at times that i do more than throw a pelisse over my
doublet so rest assured that i shall be there
so they parted and towards nightfall the master found a pretext for
leaving his wife and privily got out his fine gown which in due time he
donned and so hied him to the tombs and having perched himself on one
of them huddled himself together for twas mighty cold to await the
coming of the beast meanwhile buffalmacco who was a tall man and
strong provided himself with one of those dominos that were wont to be
worn in certain revels which are now gone out of fashion and enveloped
in a black pelisse turned inside out shewed like a bear save that the
domino had the face of a devil and was furnished with horns in which
guise bruno following close behind to see the sport he hied him to the
piazza of santa maria novella and no sooner wist he that the master was
on the tomb than he fell a careering in a most wild and furious manner
to and fro the piazza and snorting and bellowing and gibbering like one
demented insomuch that as soon as the master was ware of him each
several hair on his head stood on end and he fell a trembling in every
limb being in sooth more timid than a woman and wished himself safe at
home but as there he was he strove might and main to keep his spirits
up so overmastering was his desire to see the marvels of which bruno and
buffalmacco had told him however after a while buffalmacco allowed his
fury to abate and came quietly up to the tomb on which the master was
and stood still the master still all of a tremble with fear could not
at first make up his mind whether to get on the beasts back or no but
at length doubting it might be the worse for him if he did not mount the
beast he overcame the one dread by the aid of the other got down from
the tomb saying under his breathgod help me and seated himself
very comfortably on the beasts back and then still quaking in every
limb he folded his arms as he had been bidden
buffalmacco now started going on allfours at a very slow pace in the
direction of santa maria della scala and so brought the master within a
short distance of the convent of the ladies of ripoli now in that
quarter there were divers trenches into which the husbandmen of those
parts were wont to discharge the countess of civillari that she might
afterwards serve them to manure their land of one of which trenches as
he came by buffalmacco skirted the edge and seizing his opportunity
raised a hand and caught the doctor by one of his feet and threw him
off his back and headforemost right into the trench and then making a
terrific noise and frantic gestures as before went bounding off by santa
maria della scala towards the field of ognissanti where he found bruno
who had betaken him thither that he might laugh at his ease and there
the two men in high glee took their stand to observe from a distance how
the bemired doctor would behave finding himself in so loathsome a place
the master struggled might and main to raise himself and get out and
though again and again he slipped back and swallowed some drams of the
ordure yet bemired from head to foot woebegone and crestfallen he did
at last get out leaving his hood behind him then removing as much of
the filth as he might with his hands knowing not what else to do he got
him home where by dint of much knocking he at last gained admittance
and scarce was the door closed behind the malodorous master when bruno
and buffalmacco were at it all agog to hear after what manner he would
be received by his wife they were rewarded by hearing her give him the
soundest rating that ever bad husband got ah quoth she fine doings
these thou hast been with some other woman and wast minded to make a
brave shew in thy scarlet gown so i was not enough for thee not enough
for thee forsooth i that might content a crowd would they had choked
thee with the filth in which they have soused thee twas thy fit
restingplace now to think that a physician of repute and a married
man should go by night after strange women thus and with much more to
the like effect while the doctor was busy washing himself she ceased
not to torment him until midnight
on the morrow bruno and buffalmacco having painted their bodies all
over with livid patches to give them the appearance of having been
thrashed came to the doctors house and finding that he was already
risen went in being saluted on all hands by a foul smell for time had
not yet served thoroughly to cleanse the house the doctor being
informed that they were come to see him advanced to meet them and bade
them good morning whereto bruno and buffalmacco having prepared their
answer repliedno good morning shall you have from us rather we pray
god to give you bad years enough to make an end of you seeing that there
lives no more arrant and faithless traitor tis no fault of yours if
we that did our best to honour and pleasure you have not come by a
dogs death your faithlessness has cost us tonight as many sound blows
as would more than suffice to keep an ass a trotting all the way from
here to rome besides which we have been in peril of expulsion from the
company in which we arranged for your enrolment if you doubt our words
look but at our bodies what a state they are in and so baring their
breasts they gave him a glimpse of the patches they had painted there
and forthwith covered them up again the doctor would have made them his
excuses and recounted his misfortunes and how he had been thrown into
the trench but buffalmacco broke in withwould he had thrown you from
the bridge into the arno why must you needs mind you of god and the
saints did we not forewarn you gods faith returned the doctor
that did i not how quoth buffalmacco you did not you do so above
a little for he that we sent for you told us that you trembled like an
aspen and knew not where you were you have played us a sorry trick but
never another shall do so and as for you we will give you such requital
thereof as you deserve the doctor now began to crave their pardon and
to implore them for gods sake not to expose him to shame and used all
the eloquence at his command to make his peace with them and if he had
honourably entreated them before he thenceforth for fear they should
publish his disgrace did so much more abundantly and courted them both
by entertaining them at his table and in other ways and so you have
heard how wisdom is imparted to those that get it not at bologna

in lieu thereof water and tow

how much in divers passages the queens story moved the ladies to
laughter it boots not to ask none was there in whose eyes the tears
stood not full a dozen times for excess of merriment however it being
ended and dioneo witting that twas now his turn thus spake
hegracious ladies tis patent to all that wiles are diverting in the
degree of the wiliness of him that is by them beguiled wherefore albeit
stories most goodly have been told by you all i purpose to relate one
which should afford you more pleasure than any that has been told seeing
that she that was beguiled was far more cunning in beguiling others than
any of the beguiled of whom you have spoken
there was and perhaps still is a custom in all maritime countries that
have ports that all merchants arriving there with merchandise should
on discharging bring all their goods into a warehouse called in many
places dogana and maintained by the state or the lord of the land
where those that are assigned to that office allot to each merchant on
receipt of an invoice of all his goods and the value thereof a room in
which he stores his goods under lock and key whereupon the said officers
of the dogana enter all the merchants goods to his credit in the book of
the dogana and afterwards make him pay duty thereon or on such part as
he withdraws from the warehouse by which book of the dogana the brokers
not seldom find out the sorts and quantities of the merchandise that is
there and also who are the owners thereof with whom as occasion
serves they afterwards treat of exchanges barters sales and other
modes of disposing of the goods which custom obtained as in many other
places so also at palermo in sicily where in like manner there were and
are not a few women fair as fair can be but foes to virtue who by
whoso knows them not would be reputed great and most virtuous ladies and
being given not merely to fleece but utterly to flay men they no sooner
espy a foreign merchant in the city than they find out from the book of
the dogana how much he has there and what he is good for and then by
caressing and amorous looks and gestures and words of honeyed sweetness
they strive to entice and allure the merchant to their love and not
seldom have they succeeded and wrested from him great part or the whole
of his merchandise and of some they have gotten goods and ship and flesh
and bones so delightsomely have they known how to ply the shears
now tis not long since one of our young florentines niccolo da cignano
by name albeit he was called salabaetto arrived there being sent by
his masters with all the woollen stuffs that he had not been able to
dispose of at salerno fair which might perhaps be worth five hundred
florins of gold and having given the invoice to the officers of the
dogana and stored the goods salabaetto was in no hurry to get them out
of bond but took a stroll or two about the city for his diversion and
as he was freshcomplexioned and fair and not a little debonair it so
befell that one of these ladies that plied the shears and called herself
jancofiore began to ogle him whereof he taking note and deeming that
she was a great lady supposed that she was taken by his good looks and
cast about how he might manage this amour with all due discretion
wherefore saying nought to a soul he began to pass to and fro before
her house which she observing occupied herself for a few days in
inflaming his passion and then affecting to be dying of love for him
sent privily to him a woman that she had in her service and who was an
adept in the arts of the procuress she after not a little palaver told
him while the tears all but stood in her eyes that for his handsome
person and winsome air her mistress was so enamoured of him that she
found no peace by day or by night and therefore if twere agreeable to
him there was nought she desired so much as to meet him privily at a
bagnio whereupon she drew a ring from her purse and gave it him by way
of token from her mistress overjoyed as neer another to hear such good
news salabaetto took the ring and after drawing it across his eyes and
kissing it put it on his finger and told the good woman that if
madonna jancofiore loved him she was well requited for that he loved
her more dearly than himself and that he was ready to meet her wherever
and whenever she might see fit with which answer the procuress hied her
back to her mistress and shortly afterwards salabaetto was informed that
he was to meet the lady at a certain bagnio at vespers of the ensuing
day
so saying nought to a soul of the matter he hied him punctually at the
appointed hour to the bagnio and found that it had been taken by the
lady nor had he long to wait before two female slaves made their
appearance bearing on their heads the one a great and goodly mattress
of wadding and the other a huge and wellfilled basket and having laid
the mattress on a bedstead in one of the rooms of the bagnio they
covered it with a pair of sheets of the finest fabric bordered with
silk and a quilt of the whitest cyprus buckram with two
daintilyembroidered pillows the slaves then undressed and got into the
bath which they thoroughly washed and scrubbed whither soon afterwards
the lady attended by other two female slaves came and made haste to
greet salabaetto with the heartiest of cheer and when after heaving
many a mighty sigh she had embraced and kissed himi know not quoth
she who but thou could have brought me to this such a fire hast thou
kindled in my soul little dog of a tuscan whereupon she was pleased
that they should undress and get into the bath and two of the slaves
with them which accordingly they did and she herself suffering none
other to lay a hand upon him did with wondrous care wash salabaetto from
head to foot with soap perfumed with musk and cloves after which she let
the slaves wash and shampoo herself the slaves then brought two spotless
sheets of finest texture which emitted such a scent of roses that twas
as if there was nought there but roses in one of which having wrapped
salabaetto and in the other the lady they bore them both to bed where
the sheets in which they were enfolded being withdrawn by the slaves as
soon as they had done sweating they remained stark naked in the others
the slaves then took from the basket cruets of silver most goodly and
full this of rosewater that of water of orangeblossom a third of
water of jasmineblossom and a fourth of nanfa1 water wherewith they
sprinkled them after which boxes of comfits and the finest wines being
brought forth they regaled them a while to salabaetto twas as if he
were in paradise a thousand times he scanned the lady who was indeed
most beautiful and he counted each hour as a hundred years until the
slaves should get them gone and he find himself in the ladys arms
at length by the ladys command the slaves departed leaving a lighted
torch in the room and then the lady and salabaetto embraced and to
salabaettos prodigious delight for it seemed to him that she was all
but dissolved for love of him tarried there a good while however the
time came when the lady must needs rise so she called the slaves with
whose help they dressed regaled them again for a while with wine and
comfits and washed their faces and hands with the odoriferous waters
then as they were going quoth the lady to salabaettoif it be
agreeable to thee i should deem it a very great favour if thou wouldst
come tonight to sup and sleep with me salabaetto who captivated by
her beauty and her studied graciousness never doubted but he was dear to
her as her very heart made answermadam there is nought you can
desire but is in the last degree agreeable to me wherefore tonight and
ever tis my purpose to do whatsoever you may be pleased to command so
home the lady hied her and having caused a brave shew to be made in her
chamber with her dresses and other paraphernalia and a grand supper to
be prepared awaited salabaetto who being come there as soon as twas
dark had of her a gladsome welcome and was regaled with an excellent
and wellserved supper after which they repaired to the chamber where
he was saluted by a wondrous sweet odour of aloewood and observed that
the bed was profusely furnished with birds2 after the fashion of
cyprus and that not a few fine dresses were hanging upon the pegs which
circumstances did one and all beget in him the belief that this must be
a great and wealthy lady and though he had heard a hint or two to the
contrary touching her life he would by no means credit them nor
supposing that she had perchance taken another with guile would he
believe that the same thing might befall him so to his exceeding great
solace he lay with her that night and ever grew more afire for her on
the morrow as she was investing him with a fair and dainty girdle of
silver with a goodly purse attachedsweet my salabaetto quoth she
prithee forget me not even as my person so is all that i have at thy
pleasure and all that i can at thy command
salabaetto then embraced and kissed her and so bade her adieu and
betook him to the place where the merchants were wont to congregate and
so it befell that he continuing to consort with her from time to time
and being never a denier the poorer thereby disposed of his merchandise
for ready money and at no small profit whereof not by him but by another
the lady was forthwith advised and salabaetto being come to see her one
evening she greeted him gaily and gamesomely and fell a kissing and
hugging him and made as if she were so afire for love of him that she
was like to die thereof in his arms and offered to give him two most
goodly silver cups that she had which salabaetto would not accept
having already had from her taking one time with another fully thirty
florins of gold while he had not been able to induce her to touch so
much as a groat of his money but when by this shew of passion and
generosity she had thoroughly kindled his flame in came as she had
arranged one of her slaves and spoke to her whereupon out of the room
she went and after a while came back in tears and threw herself prone
on the bed and set up the most dolorous lamentation that ever woman
made whereat salabaetto wondering took her in his arms and mingled his
tears with hers and saidalas heart of my body what ails thee thus
of a sudden wherefore art thou so distressed ah tell me the reason my
soul the lady allowed him to run on in this strain for a good while
and thenalas sweet my lord quoth she i know not either what to
do or what to say i have but now received a letter from messina in
which my brother bids me sell if need be all that i have here and send
him without fail within eight days a thousand florins of gold otherwise
he will forfeit his head i know not how to come by them so soon had i
but fifteen days i would make a shift to raise them in a quarter where i
might raise a much larger sum or i would sell one of our estates but
as this may not be would i had been dead or eer this bad news had
reached me which said affecting to be utterly brokenhearted she
ceased not to weep
salabaetto the ardour of whose passion had in great measure deprived him
of the sagacity which the circumstances demanded supposed that the tears
were genuine enough and the words even more so whereforemadam
quoth he i could not furnish you with a thousand but if five hundred
florins of gold would suffice they are at your service if you think you
could repay them within fifteen days and you may deem yourself in lucks
way for twas only yesterday that i sold my woollens which had i not
done i could not have lent you a groat alas returned the lady then
thou hast been in straits for money oh why didst thou not apply to me
though i have not a thousand at my command i could have given thee quite
a hundred nay indeed two hundred florins by what thou hast said thou
hast made me hesitate to accept the service that thou proposest to render
me which words fairly delivered salabaetto into the ladys hands
insomuch thatmadam quoth he i would not have you decline my help
for such a scruple for had my need been as great as yours i should
certainly have applied to you quoth then the ladyah salabaetto
mine well i wot that the love thou bearest me is a true and perfect
love seeing that without waiting to be asked thou dost so handsomely
come to my aid with so large a sum of money and albeit i was thine
without this token of thy love yet assuredly it has made me thine in
an even greater degree nor shall i ever forget that tis to thee i owe
my brothers life but god knows i take thy money from thee reluctantly
seeing that thou art a merchant and tis by means of money that
merchants conduct all their affairs but as necessity constrains me and
i have good hope of speedily repaying thee i will even take it and by
way of security if i should find no readier method i will pawn all that
i have here which said she burst into tears and fell upon salabaetto
pressing her cheek upon his
salabaetto tried to comfort her and having spent the night with her on
the morrow being minded to shew himself her most devoted servant
brought her without awaiting any reminder five hundred fine florins of
gold which she laughing at heart while the tears streamed from her
eyes took salabaetto trusting her mere promise of repayment now that
the lady had gotten the money the complexion of affairs began to alter
and whereas salabaetto had been wont to have free access to her whenever
he was so minded now for one reason or another he was denied admittance
six times out of seven nor did she greet him with the same smile or
shower on him the same caresses or do him the same cheer as of yore so
a month two months passed beyond the time when he was to have been
repaid his money and when he demanded it he was put off with words
whereby salabaetto being now ware of the cheat which his slender wit had
suffered the evildisposed woman to put upon him and also that having
neither writing nor witness against her he was entirely at her mercy in
regard of his claim and being moreover ashamed to lodge any complaint
with any one as well because he had been forewarned of her character as
because he dreaded the ridicule to which his folly justly exposed him
was chagrined beyond measure and inly bewailed his simplicity and his
masters having written to him bidding him change the money and remit it
to them he being apprehensive that making default as he must he
should if he remained there be detected resolved to depart and having
taken ship he repaired not as he should have done to pisa but to
naples where at that time resided our gossip pietro dello canigiano
treasurer of the empress of constantinople a man of great sagacity and
acuteness and a very great friend of salabaetto and his kinsfolk to
whom trusting in his great discretion salabaetto after a while
discovered his distress telling him what he had done and the sorry
plight in which by consequence he stood and craving his aid and counsel
that he might the more readily find means of livelihood there for that
he was minded never to go back to florence impatient to hear of such
follytwas ill done of thee quoth canigiano thou hast misbehaved
thyself wronged thy masters and squandered an exorbitant sum in
lewdness however tis done and we must consider of the remedy and
indeed like the shrewd man that he was he had already bethought him
what was best to be done and forthwith he imparted it to salabaetto
which expedient salabaetto approving resolved to make the adventure and
having still a little money and being furnished with a loan by
canigiano he provided himself with not a few bales well and closely
corded and bought some twenty oilcasks which he filled and having put
all on shipboard returned to palermo there he gave the invoice of the
bales as also of the oilcasks to the officers of the dogana and
having them all entered to his credit laid them up in the storerooms
saying that he purposed to leave them there until the arrival of other
merchandise that he expected
which jancofiore learning and being informed that the merchandise that
he had brought with him was worth fully two thousand florins of gold or
even more besides that which he expected which was valued at more than
three thousand florins of gold bethought her that she had not aimed high
enough and that twere well to refund him the five hundred if so she
might make the greater part of the five thousand florins her own
wherefore she sent for him and salabaetto having learned his lesson of
cunning waited on her feigning to know nought of the cargo he had
brought with him she received him with marvellous cheer and
beganlo now if thou wast angry with me because i did not repay thee
thy money in due time but salabaetto interrupted her saying with a
laughmadam tis true i was a little vexed seeing that i would have
plucked out my heart to pleasure you but listen and you shall learn the
quality of my displeasure such and so great is the love i bear you that
i have sold the best part of all that i possess whereby i have already
in this port merchandise to the value of more than two thousand florins
and expect from the levant other goods to the value of above three
thousand florins and mean to set up a warehouse in this city and live
here to be ever near you for that i deem myself more blessed in your
love than any other lover that lives whereuponharkye salabaetto
quoth the lady whatever advantages thee is mighty grateful to me
seeing that i love thee more than my very life and right glad am i that
thou art come back with intent to stay for i hope to have many a good
time with thee but something i must say to thee by way of excuse for
that whilst thou wast thinking of taking thy departure there were times
when thou wast disappointed of seeing me and others when thou hadst not
as gladsome a welcome as thou wast wont to have and therewithal i kept
not the time promised for the repayment of thy money thou must know that
i was then in exceeding great trouble and tribulation and whoso is thus
bested love he another never so much cannot greet him with as gladsome
a mien or be as attentive to him as he had lief and thou must further
know that tis by no means an easy matter for a lady to come by a
thousand florins of gold why tis every day a fresh lie and never a
promise kept and so we in our turn must needs lie to others and twas
for this cause and not for any fault of mine that i did not repay thee
thy money however i had it but a little while after thy departure and
had i known whither to send it be sure i would have remitted it to thee
but as that i wist not i have kept it safe for thee she then produced
a purse in which were the very same coins that he had brought her and
placed it in his hand sayingcount and see if there are five hundred
there twas the happiest moment salabaetto had yet known as having
told them out and found the sum exact he made answermadam i know
that you say sooth and what you have done abundantly proves it
wherefore and for the love i bear you i warrant you there is no sum you
might ask of me on any occasion of need with which if twere in my
power i would not accommodate you whereof when i am settled here you
will be able to assure yourself
having thus in words reinstated himself as her lover he proceeded to
treat her as his mistress whereto she responded doing all that was in
her power to pleasure and honour him and feigning to be in the last
degree enamoured of him but salabaetto being minded to requite her
guile with his own went to her one evening being bidden to sup and
sleep with her with an aspect so melancholy and dolorous that he shewed
as he had lief give up the ghost jancofiore as she embraced and kissed
him demanded of him the occasion of his melancholy whereto he having
let her be instant with him a good while made answeri am undone for
that the ship having aboard her the goods that i expected has been
taken by the corsairs of monaco and held to ransom in ten thousand
florins of gold of which it falls to me to pay one thousand and i have
not a denier for the five hundred thou repaidst me i sent forthwith to
naples to buy stuffs for this market and were i to sell the merchandise
i have here as tis not now the right time to sell i should scarce get
half the value nor am i as yet so well known here as to come by any to
help me at this juncture and so what to do or what to say i know not
but this i know that if i send not the money without delay my
merchandise will be taken to monaco and i shall never touch aught of it
again whereat the lady was mightily annoyed being apprehensive of
losing all and bethought her how she might prevent the goods going to
monaco whereforegod knows quoth she that for the love i bear
thee i am not a little sorry for thee but what boots it idly to distress
oneself had i the money god knows i would lend it thee forthwith but i
have it not one indeed there is that accommodated me a day or two ago
with five hundred florins that i stood in need of but he requires a
heavy usance not less than thirty on the hundred and if thou shouldst
have recourse to him good security must be forthcoming now for my part
i am ready so i may serve thee to pledge all these dresses and my
person to boot for as much as he will tend thee thereon but how wilt
thou secure the balance
salabaetto divined the motive that prompted her thus to accommodate him
and that she was to lend the money herself which suiting his purpose
well he first of all thanked her and then said that being constrained
by necessity he would not stand out against exorbitant terms adding
that as to the balance he would secure it upon the merchandise that he
had at the dogana by causing it to be entered in the name of the lender
but that he must keep the key of the storerooms as well that he might be
able to shew the goods if requested as to make sure that none of them
should be tampered with or changed or exchanged the lady said that this
was reasonable and that twas excellent security so betimes on the
morrow the lady sent for a broker in whom she reposed much trust and
having talked the matter over with him gave him a thousand florins of
gold which the broker took to salabaetto and thereupon had all that
salabaetto had at the dogana entered in his name they then had the
script and counterscript made out and the arrangement thus concluded
went about their respective affairs salabaetto lost no time in getting
aboard a bark with his five hundred florins of gold and being come to
naples sent thence a remittance which fully discharged his obligation to
his masters that had entrusted him with the stuffs he also paid all that
he owed to pietro dello canigiano and all his other creditors and made
not a little merry with canigiano over the trick he had played the
sicilian lady he then departed from naples and being minded to have
done with mercantile affairs betook him to ferrara
jancofiore surprised at first by salabaettos disappearance from
palermo waxed after a while suspicious and when she had waited fully
two months seeing that he did not return she caused the broker to break
open the storerooms and trying first of all the casks she found them
full of seawater save that in each there was perhaps a hogshead of
oil floating on the surface then undoing the bales she found them all
save two that contained stuffs full of tow and in short their whole
contents put together were not worth more than two hundred florins
wherefore jancofiore knowing herself to have been outdone regretted
long and bitterly the five hundred florins of gold that she had refunded
and still more the thousand that she had lent repeating many a time to
herselfwho with a tuscan has to do had need of eyesight quick and
true thus left with the loss and the laugh against her she discovered
that there were others as knowing as she
1 neither the vocab degli accad della crusca nor the ricchezze
attempts to define the precise nature of this scent which fanfani
identifies with that of the orangeblossom
2 ie with a sort of musical boxes in the shape of birds
no sooner was dioneos story ended than lauretta witting that therewith
the end of her sovereignty was come bestowed her meed of praise on
pietro canigiano for his good counsel and also on salabaetto for the
equal sagacity which he displayed in carrying it out and then taking
off the laurel wreath set it on the head of emilia saying
graciouslyi know not madam how debonair a queen you may prove but
at least we shall have in you a fair one be it your care then that you
exercise your authority in a manner answerable to your charms which
said she resumed her seat
not so much to receive the crown as to be thus commended to her face and
before the company for that which ladies are wont to covet the most
emilia was a little shamefast a tint like that of the newlyblown rose
overspread her face and a while she stood silent with downcast eyes
then as the blush faded away she raised them and having given her
seneschal her commands touching all matters pertaining to the company
thus she spakesweet my ladies tis matter of common experience that
when the oxen have swunken a part of the day under the coercive yoke
they are relieved thereof and loosed and suffered to go seek their
pasture at their own sweet will in the woods nor can we fail to observe
that gardens luxuriant with diversity of leafage are not less but far
more fair to see than woods wherein is nought but oaks wherefore i deem
that as for so many days our discourse has been confined within the
bounds of certain laws twill be not only meet but profitable for us
being in need of relaxation to roam a while and so recruit our strength
to undergo the yoke once more and therefore i am minded that tomorrow
the sweet tenor of your discourse be not confined to any particular
theme but that you be at liberty to discourse on such wise as to each
may seem best for well assured am i that thus to speak of divers matters
will be no less pleasurable than to limit ourselves to one topic and by
reason of this enlargement my successor in the sovereignty will find you
more vigorous and be therefore all the more forward to reimpose upon you
the wonted restraint of our laws having so said she dismissed all the
company until suppertime
all approved the wisdom of what the queen had said and being risen
betook them to their several diversions the ladies to weave garlands and
otherwise disport them the young men to play and sing and so they
whiled away the hours until suppertime which being come they gathered
about the fair fountain and took their meal with gay and festal cheer
supper ended they addressed them to their wonted pastime of song and
dance at the close of which the queen notwithstanding the songs which
divers of the company had already gladly accorded them called for
another from pamfilo who without the least demur thus sang
so great o love the bliss
  through thee i prove so jocund my estate
  that in thy flame to burn i bless my fate
such plenitude of joy my heart doth know
  of that high joy and rare
  wherewith thou hast me blest
  as bounds disdaining still doth overflow
  and by my radiant air
  my blitheness manifest
  for by thee thus possessed
  with love where meeter twere to venerate
  i still consume within thy flame elate
well wot i love no song may eer reveal
  nor any sign declare
  what in my heart is pent
  nay might they so that were i best conceal
  whereof were others ware
  twould serve but to torment
  me whose is such content
  that weak were words and all inadequate
  a tittle of my bliss to adumbrate
who would have dreamed that eer in mine embrace
  her i should clip and fold
  whom there i still do feel
  or as gainst her face eer to lay my face
  attain such grace untold
  and unimagined weal
  wherefore my bliss i seal
  of mine own heart within the circuit strait
  and still in thy sweet flame luxuriate
so ended pamfilo his song whereto all the company responded in full
chorus nor was there any but gave to its words an inordinate degree of
attention endeavouring by conjecture to penetrate that which he
intimated that twas meet he should keep secret divers were the
interpretations hazarded but all were wide of the mark at length
however the queen seeing that ladies and men alike were fain of rest
bade all betake them to bed

endeth here the eighth day of the decameron beginneth the ninth in
which under the rule of emilia discourse is had at the discretion of
each of such matters as most commend themselves to each in turn

the luminary before whose splendour the night takes wing had already
changed the eighth heaven1 from azure to the lighter blue2 and in
the meads the flowerets were beginning to lift their heads when emilia
being risen roused her fair gossips and likewise the young men and
so the queen leading the way at an easy pace and the rest of the company
following they hied them to a copse at no great distance from the
palace where being entered they saw the goats and stags and other wild
creatures as if witting that in this time of pestilence they had nought
to fear from the hunter stand awaiting them with no more sign of fear
than if they had been tamed and so making now towards this now towards
the other of them as if to touch them they diverted themselves for a
while by making them skip and run but as soon as the sun was in the
ascendant by common consent they turned back and whoso met them
garlanded as they were with oakleaves and carrying store of fragrant
herbs or flowers in their hands might well have saideither shall
death not vanquish these or they will meet it with a light heart so
slowly wended they their way now singing now bandying quips and merry
jests to the palace where they found all things in order meet and
their servants in blithe and merry cheer a while they rested nor went
they to table until six ditties each gayer than that which went before
had been sung by the young men and the ladies which done they washed
their hands and all by the queens command were ranged by the seneschal
at the table and the viands being served they cheerily took their
meal wherefrom being risen they trod some measures to the accompaniment
of music and then by the queens command whoso would betook him to
rest however the accustomed hour being come they all gathered at the
wonted spot for their discoursing and the queen bending her regard upon
filomena bade her make a beginning of the days storytelling which she
with a smile did on this wise

novel i

madonna francesca having two lovers the one rinuccio the other
alessandro by name and loving neither of them induces the one to
simulate a corpse in a tomb and the other to enter the tomb to fetch him
out whereby neither satisfying her demands she artfully rids herself
of both

madam since so it pleases you well pleased am i that in this vast this
boundless field of discourse which you our lady bountiful have
furnished us withal tis mine to run the first course wherein if i do
well i doubt not that those who shall follow me will do not only well
but better such sweet my ladies has been the tenor of our discourse
that times not a few the might of love how great and singular it is has
been set forth but yet i doubt the topic is not exhausted nor would it
be so though we should continue to speak of nought else for the space of
a full year and as love not only leads lovers to debate with themselves
whether they were not best to die but also draws them into the houses of
the dead in quest of the dead i am minded in this regard to tell you a
story wherein you will not only discern the power of love but will also
learn how the ready wit of a worthy lady enabled her to disembarrass
herself of two lovers whose love was displeasing to her
know then that there dwelt aforetime in the city of pistoia a most
beauteous widow lady of whom it so befell that two of our citizens the
one rinuccio palermini the other alessandro chiarmontesi by name
tarrying at pistoia for that they were banished from florence became
neither witting how it stood with the other in the last degree
enamoured wherefore each used all his arts to win the love of madonna
francesca de lazzarisuch was the ladys nameand she being thus
continually plied with ambassages and entreaties on the part of both and
having indiscreetly lent ear to them from time to time found it no easy
matter discreetly to extricate herself when she was minded to be rid of
their pestering until it occurred to her to adopt the following
expedient to wit to require of each a service such as though not
impracticable she deemed none would actually perform to the end that
they making default she might have a decent and colourable pretext for
refusing any longer to receive their ambassages which expedient was on
this wise one day there died in pistoia and was buried in a tomb
outside the church of the friars minors a man who though his forbears
had been gentlefolk was reputed the very worst man not in pistoia only
but in all the world and therewithal he was of form and feature so
preternaturally hideous that whoso knew him not could scarce see him for
the first time without a shudder now the lady pondering her design on
the day of this mans death it occurred to her that he might in a
measure subserve its accomplishment wherefore she said to her
maidthou knowest to what worry and annoyance i am daily put by the
ambassages of these two florentines rinuccio and alessandro now i am
not disposed to gratify either of them with my love and therefore to
shake them off i am minded as they make such great protestations to
put them to the proof by requiring of each something which i am sure he
will not perform and thus to rid myself of their pestering so list what
i mean to do thou knowest that this morning there was interred in the
ground of the friars minors this scannadio such was the name of the bad
man of whom we spoke but now whose aspect while he yet lived appalled
even the bravest among us thou wilt therefore go privily to alessandro
and say to himmadonna francesca sends thee word by me that the time
is now come when thou mayst win that which thou hast so much desired to
wit her love and joyance thereof if thou be so minded on the following
terms for a reason which thou shalt learn hereafter one of her kinsmen
is to bring home to her tonight the corpse of scannadio who was buried
this morning and she standing in mortal dread of this dead man would
fain not see him wherefore she prays thee to do her a great service and
be so good as to get thee this evening at the hour of first sleep to the
tomb wherein scannadio is buried and go in and having wrapped thyself
in his graveclothes lie there as thou wert scannadio himself until
one come for thee when thou must say never a word but let him carry
thee forth and bear thee to madonna francescas house where she will
give thee welcome and let thee stay with her until thou art minded to
depart and for the rest thou wilt leave it to her and if he says
that he will gladly do so well and good if not then thou wilt tell him
from me never more to shew himself where i am and as he values his
life to have a care to send me no more ambassages which done thou wilt
go to rinuccio palermini and wilt say to himmadonna francesca lets
thee know that she is ready in all respects to comply with thy wishes so
thou wilt do her a great service which is on this wise tonight about
midnight thou must go to the tomb wherein was this morning interred
scannadio and saying never a word whatever thou mayst hear or otherwise
be ware of bear him gently forth to madonna francescas house where
thou shalt learn wherefore she requires this of thee and shalt have thy
solace of her and if thou art not minded to obey her in this see that
thou never more send her ambassage
the maid did her mistresss errand omitting nothing to both the men
and received from each the same answer to wit that to pleasure the
lady he would adventure a journey to hell to say nothing of entering a
tomb with which answer the maid returned to the lady who waited to see
if they would be such fools as to make it good night came and at the
hour of first sleep alessandro chiarmontesi stripped to his doublet
quitted his house and bent his steps towards scannadios tomb with
intent there to take the dead mans place as he walked there came upon
him a great fear and he fell a saying to himselfah what a fool am i
whither go i how know i that her kinsmen having detected my love and
surmising that which is not have not put her upon requiring this of me
in order that they may slay me in the tomb in which event i alone should
be the loser for nought would ever be heard of it so that they would
escape scotfree or how know i but that tis some machination of one of
my illwishers whom perchance she loves and is therefore minded to
abet and again quoth he to himselfbut allowing that tis neither the
one nor the other and that her kinsmen are really to carry me to her
house i scarce believe that tis either that they would fain embrace
scannadios corpse themselves or let her do so rather it must be that
they have a mind to perpetrate some outrage upon it for that perchance
he once did them an evil turn she bids me say never a word no matter
what i may hear or be otherwise ware of suppose they were to pluck out
my eyes or my teeth or cut off my hands or treat me to some other
horseplay of the like sort how then how could i keep quiet and if i
open my mouth they will either recognize me and perchance do me a
mischief or if they spare me i shall have been at pains for nought
for they will not leave me with the lady and she will say that i
disobeyed her command and i shall never have aught of her favours
as thus he communed with himself he was on the point of turning back
but his overmastering love plied him with opposing arguments of such
force that he kept on his way and reached the tomb which having opened
he entered and after stripping scannadio and wrapping himself in the
graveclothes closed it and laid himself down in scannadios place he
then fell a thinking of the dead man and his manner of life and the
things which he had heard tell of as happening by night and in other
less appalling places than the houses of the dead whereby all the hairs
of his head stood on end and he momently expected scannadio to rise and
cut his throat however the ardour of his love so fortified him that he
overcame these and all other timorous apprehensions and lay as if he
were dead awaiting what should betide him
towards midnight rinuccio bent likewise upon fulfilling his ladys
behest sallied forth of his house revolving as he went divers
forebodings of possible contingencies as that having scannadios corpse
upon his shoulders he might fall into the hands of the signory and be
condemned to the fire as a wizard or that should the affair get wind
it might embroil him with his kinsfolk or the like which gave him
pause but then with a revulsion of feeling shall i quoth he to
himself deny this lady whom i so much have loved and love the very
first thing that she asks of me and that too when i am thereby to win
her favour no though twere as much as my life is worth far be it from
me to fail of keeping my word so on he fared and arrived at the tomb
which he had no difficulty in opening and being entered laid hold of
alessandro who though in mortal fear had given no sign of life by the
feet and dragged him forth and having hoisted him on to his shoulders
bent his steps towards the ladys house and as he went being none too
careful of alessandro he swung him from time to time against one or
other of the angles of certain benches that were by the wayside and
indeed the night was so dark and murky that he could not see where he was
going and when he was all but on the threshold of the ladys house she
standing within at a window with her maid to mark if rinuccio would
bring alessandro and being already provided with an excuse for sending
them both away it so befell that the patrol of the signory who were
posted in the street in dead silence being on the lookout for a certain
bandit hearing the tramp of rinuccios feet suddenly shewed a light
the better to know what was toward and whither to go and advancing
targes and lances cried outwho goes there whereupon rinuccio
having little leisure for deliberation let alessandro fall and took to
flight as fast as his legs might carry him alessandro albeit encumbered
by the graveclothes which were very long also jumped up and made off
by the light shewn by the patrol the lady had very plainly perceived
rinuccio with alessandro on his back as also that alessandro had the
graveclothes upon him and much did she marvel at the daring of both
but for all that she laughed heartily to see rinuccio drop alessandro
and alessandro run away overjoyed at the turn the affair had taken and
praising god that he had rid her of their harass she withdrew from the
window and betook her to her chamber averring to her maid that for
certain they must both be mightily in love with her seeing that twas
plain they had both done her bidding
crestfallen and cursing his evil fortune rinuccio nevertheless went not
home but as soon as the street was clear of the patrol came back to
the spot where he had dropped alessandro and stooped down and began
feeling about if haply he might find him and so do his devoir to the
lady but as he found him not he supposed the patrol must have borne
him thence and so at last home he went as did also alessandro knowing
not what else to do and deploring his mishap on the morrow scannadios
tomb being found open and empty for alessandro had thrown the corpse
into the vault below all pistoia debated of the matter with no small
diversity of opinion the fools believing that scannadio had been carried
off by devils neither of the lovers however forbore to make suit to
the lady for her favour and love telling her what he had done and what
had happened and praying her to have him excused that he had not
perfectly carried out her instructions but she feigning to believe
neither of them disposed of each with the same curt answer to wit
that as he had not done her bidding she would never do aught for him
novel ii

an abbess rises in haste and in the dark with intent to surprise an
accused nun abed with her lover thinking to put on her veil she puts on
instead the breeches of a priest that she has with her the nun espying
her headgear and doing her to wit thereof is acquitted and thenceforth
finds it easier to forgather with her lover

so ended filomena and when all had commended the address shewn by the
lady in ridding herself of the two lovers that she affected not and
contrariwise had censured the hardihood of the two lovers as not love but
madness the queen turned to elisa and with a charming airnow
elisa follow quoth she whereupon elisa began on this wisedearest
ladies twas cleverly done of madonna francesca to disembarrass herself
in the way we have heard but i have to tell of a young nun who by a
happy retort and the favour of fortune delivered herself from imminent
peril and as you know that there are not a few most foolish folk who
notwithstanding their folly take upon themselves the governance and
correction of others so you may learn from my story that fortune at
times justly puts them to shame which befell the abbess who was the
superior of the nun of whom i am about to speak
you are to know then that in a convent in lombardy of very great repute
for strict and holy living there was among other ladies that there wore
the veil a young woman of noble family and extraordinary beauty now
isabettafor such was her namehaving speech one day of one of her
kinsmen at the grate became enamoured of a fine young gallant that was
with him who seeing her to be very fair and reading her passion in her
eyes was kindled with a like flame for her which mutual and unsolaced
love they bore a great while not without great suffering to both but at
length both being intent thereon the gallant discovered a way by which
he might with all secrecy visit his nun and she approving he paid her
not one visit only but many to their no small mutual solace but while
thus they continued their intercourse it so befell that one night one of
the sisters observed him take his leave of isabetta and depart albeit
neither he nor she was ware that they had thus been discovered the
sister imparted what she had seen to several others at first they were
minded to denounce her to the abbess one madonna usimbalda who was
reputed by the nuns and indeed by all that knew her to be a good and
holy woman but on second thoughts they deemed it expedient that there
might be no room for denial to cause the abbess to take her and the
gallant in the act so they held their peace and arranged between them
to keep her in watch and close espial that they might catch her
unawares of which practice isabetta recking witting nought it so
befell that one night when she had her lover to see her the sisters
that were on the watch were soon ware of it and at what they deemed the
nick of time parted into two companies of which one mounted guard at the
threshold of isabettas cell while the other hasted to the abbesss
chamber and knocking at the door roused her and as soon as they heard
her voice saidup madam without delay we have discovered that
isabetta has a young man with her in her cell
now that night the abbess had with her a priest whom she used not seldom
to have conveyed to her in a chest and the report of the sisters making
her apprehensive lest for excess of zeal and hurry they should force the
door open she rose in a trice and huddling on her clothes as best she
might in the dark instead of the veil that they wear which they call
the psalter she caught up the priests breeches and having clapped them
on her head hied her forth and locked the door behind her
sayingwhere is this woman accursed of god and so guided by the
sisters all so agog to catch isabetta a sinning that they perceived not
what manner of headgear the abbess wore she made her way to the cell
and with their aid broke open the door and entering they found the two
lovers abed in one anothers arms who as it were thunderstruck to be
thus surprised lay there witting not what to do the sisters took the
young nun forthwith and by command of the abbess brought her to the
chapterhouse the gallant left behind in the cell put on his clothes
and waited to see how the affair would end being minded to make as many
nuns as he might come at pay dearly for any despite that might be done
his mistress and to bring her off with him the abbess seated in the
chapterhouse with all her nuns about her and all eyes bent upon the
culprit began giving her the severest reprimand that ever woman got for
that by her disgraceful and abominable conduct should it get wind she
had sullied the fair fame of the convent whereto she added menaces most
dire shamefast and timorous the culprit essayed no defence and her
silence begat pity of her in the rest but while the abbess waxed more
and more voluble it chanced that the girl raised her head and espied the
abbesss headgear and the points that hung down on this side and that
the significance whereof being by no means lost upon her she quite
plucked up heart andmadam quoth she so help you god tie up your
coif and then you may say what you will to me whereto the abbess not
understanding her repliedwhat coif lewd woman so thou hast the
effrontery to jest thinkst thou that what thou hast done is a matter
meet for jests whereuponmadam quoth the girl again i pray you
tie up your coif and then you may say to me whatever you please which
occasioned not a few of the nuns to look up at the abbesss head and the
abbess herself to raise her hands thereto and so she and they at one and
the same time apprehended isabettas meaning wherefore the abbess
finding herself detected by all in the same sin and that no disguise was
possible changed her tone and held quite another sort of language than
before the upshot of which was that twas impossible to withstand the
assaults of the flesh and that accordingly observing due secrecy as
theretofore all might give themselves a good time as they had
opportunity so having dismissed isabetta to rejoin her lover in her
cell she herself returned to lie with her priest and many a time
thereafter in spite of the envious isabetta had her gallant to see her
the others that lacked lovers doing in secret the best they might to
push their fortunes

master simone at the instance of bruno and buffalmacco and nello makes
calandrino believe that he is with child calandrino accordingly gives
them capons and money for medicines and is cured without being
delivered

when elisa had ended her story and all had given thanks to god that he
had vouchsafed the young nun a happy escape from the fangs of her envious
companions the queen bade filostrato follow suit and without expecting
a second command thus filostrato beganfairest my ladies the uncouth
judge from the marches of whom i told you yesterday took from the tip
of my tongue a story of calandrino which i was on the point of
narrating and as nought can be said of him without mightily enhancing
our jollity albeit not a little has already been said touching him and
his comrades i will now give you the story which i had meant yesterday
to give you who they were this calandrino and the others that i am to
tell of in this story has already been sufficiently explained
wherefore without more ado i say that one of calandrinos aunts having
died leaving him two hundred pounds in petty cash calandrino gave out
that he was minded to purchase an estate and as if he had had ten
thousand florins of gold to invest engaged every broker in florence to
treat for him the negotiation always falling through as soon as the
price was named bruno and buffalmacco knowing what was afoot told him
again and again that he had better give himself a jolly time with them
than go about buying earth as if he must needs make pellets1 but so
far were they from effecting their purpose that they could not even
prevail upon him to give them a single meal whereat as one day they
grumbled being joined by a comrade of theirs one nello also a painter
they all three took counsel how they might wet their whistle at
calandrinos expense and their plan being soon concerted the next
morning calandrino was scarce gone out when nello met him
sayinggood day calandrino whereto calandrino repliedgod give
thee a good day and a good year nello then drew back a little and
looked him steadily in the face untilwhat seest thou to stare at
quoth calandrino hadst thou no pain in the night returned nello
thou seemest not thyself to me which calandrino no sooner heard than
he began to be disquieted andalas how sayst thou quoth he what
takst thou to be the matter with me why as to that i have nothing to
say returned nello but thou seemest to be quite changed perchance
tis not what i suppose and with that he left him
calandrino anxious though he could not in the least have said why went
on and soon buffalmacco who was not far off and had observed him part
from nello made up to him and greeted him asking him if he was not in
pain i cannot say replied calandrino twas but now that nello told
me that i looked quite changed can it be that there is aught the matter
with me aught quoth buffalmacco ay indeed there might be a
trifle the matter with thee thou lookst to be half dead man
calandrino now began to think he must have a fever and then up came
bruno and the first thing he said waswhy calandrino how ill thou
lookst thy appearance is that of a corpse how dost thou feel to be
thus accosted by all three left no doubt in calandrinos mind that he was
ill and sowhat shall i do quoth he in a great fright my
advice replied bruno is that thou go home and get thee to bed and
cover thee well up and send thy water to master simone who as thou
knowest is such a friend of ours he will tell thee at once what thou
must do and we will come to see thee and will do aught that may be
needful and nello then joining them they all three went home with
calandrino who now quite spent went straight to his room and said to
his wifecome now wrap me well up i feel very ill and so he laid
himself on the bed and sent a maid with his water to master simone who
had then his shop in the mercato vecchio at the sign of the pumpkin

i will go hear what the doctor has to say and if need be will bring him
hither prithee do so my friend quoth calandrino and bring me
word how it is with me for i feel as how i cannot say in my inside so
bruno hied him to master simone and before the maid arrived with the
water told him what was afoot the master thus primed inspected the
water and then said to the maidgo tell calandrino to keep himself
very warm and i will come at once and let him know what is the matter
with him and what he must do with which message the maid was scarce
returned when the master and bruno arrived and the master having
seated himself beside calandrino felt his pulse and by and by in the
presence of his wife saidharkye calandrino i speak to thee as a
friend and i tell thee that what is amiss with thee is just that thou
art with child whereupon calandrino cried out querulouslywoes me
tis thy doing tessa for that thou must needs be uppermost i told thee
plainly what would come of it whereat the lady being not a little
modest coloured from brow to neck and with downcast eyes withdrew from
the room saying never a word by way of answer calandrino ran on in the
same plaintive strainalas woes me what shall i do how shall i be
delivered of this child what passage can it find ah i see only too
plainly that the lasciviousness of this wife of mine has been the death
of me god make her as wretched as i would fain be happy were i as well
as i am not i would get me up and thrash her till i left not a whole
bone in her body albeit it does but serve me right for letting her get
the upper place but if i do win through this she shall never have it
again verily she might pine to death for it but she should not have
it
which to hear bruno and buffalmacco and nello were like to burst with
suppressed laughter and master scimmione2 laughed so frantically that
all his teeth were ready to start from his jaws however at length in
answer to calandrinos appeals and entreaties for counsel and
succourcalandrino quoth the master thou mayst dismiss thy fears
for god be praised we were apprised of thy state in such good time that
with but little trouble in the course of a few days i shall set thee
right but twill cost a little woes me returned calandrino be it
so master for the love of god i have here two hundred pounds with
which i had thoughts of buying an estate take them all all if you must
have all so only i may escape being delivered for i know not how i
should manage it seeing that women albeit tis much easier for them do
make such a noise in the hour of their labour that i misdoubt me if i
suffered so i should die before i was delivered disquiet not
thyself said the doctor i will have a potion distilled for thee of
rare virtue it is and not a little palatable and in the course of three
days twill purge thee of all and leave thee in better fettle than a
fish but thou wilt do well to be careful thereafter and commit no such
indiscretions again now to make this potion we must have three pair of
good fat capons and for divers other ingredients thou wilt give one of
thy friends here five pounds in small change to purchase them and thou
wilt have everything sent to my shop and so please god i will send
thee this distilled potion tomorrow morning and thou wilt take a good
beakerful each time whereuponbe it as you bid master mine quoth
calandrino and handing bruno five pounds and money enough to purchase
three pair of capons he begged him if it were not too much trouble to
do him the service to buy these things for him so away went the doctor
and made a little decoction by way of draught and sent it him bruno
bought the capons and all else that was needed to furnish forth the
feast with which he and his comrades and the doctor regaled them
calandrino drank of the decoction for three mornings after which he had
a visit from his friends and the doctor who felt his pulse and
thenbeyond a doubt calandrino quoth he thou art cured and so
thou hast no more occasion to keep indoors but needst have no fear to do
whatever thou hast a mind to much relieved calandrino got up and
resumed his accustomed way of life and wherever he found any one to
talk to was loud in praise of master simone for the excellent manner in
which he had cured him causing him in three days without the least
suffering to be quit of his pregnancy and bruno and buffalmacco and
nello were not a little pleased with themselves that they had so cleverly
got the better of calandrinos niggardliness albeit monna tessa who was
not deceived murmured not a little against her husband

novel iv

cecco son of messer fortarrigo loses his all at play at buonconvento
besides the money of cecco son of messer angiulieri whom running after
him in his shirt and crying out that he has robbed him he causes to be
taken by peasants he then puts on his clothes mounts his palfrey and
leaves him to follow in his shirt

all the company laughed beyond measure to hear what calandrino said
touching his wife but when filostrato had done neifile being bidden
by the queen thus begannoble ladies were it not more difficult for
men to evince their good sense and virtue than their folly and their
vice many would labour in vain to set bounds to their flow of words
whereof you have had a most conspicuous example in poor blundering
calandrino who for the better cure of that with which in his simplicity
he supposed himself to be afflicted had no sort of need to discover in
public his wifes secret pleasures which affair has brought to my mind
one that fell out contrariwise inasmuch as the guile of one discomfited
the good sense of another to the grievous loss and shame of the
discomfited the manner whereof i am minded to relate to you
tis not many years since there were in siena two young men both of age
and both alike named cecco the one being son of messer angiulieri the
other of messer fortarrigo who albeit in many other respects their
dispositions accorded ill agreed so well in one to wit that they both
hated their fathers that they became friends and kept much together
now angiulieri being a pretty fellow and wellmannered could not brook
to live at siena on the allowance made him by his father and learning
that there was come into the march of ancona as legate of the pope a
cardinal to whom he was much bounden resolved to resort to him there
thinking thereby to improve his circumstances so having acquainted his
father with his purpose he prevailed upon him to give him there and then
all that he would have given him during the next six months that he
might have the wherewith to furnish himself with apparel and a good
mount so as to travel in a becoming manner and as he was looking out
for some one to attend him as his servant fortarrigo hearing of it
came presently to him and besought him with all earnestness to take him
with him as his groom or servant or what he would and he would be
satisfied with his keep without any salary whatsoever whereto
angiulieri made answer that he was not disposed to take him not but that
he well knew that he was competent for any service that might be required
of him but because he was given to play and therewithal would at times
get drunk fortarrigo assured him with many an oath that he would be on
his guard to commit neither fault and added thereto such instant
entreaties that angiulieri was as it were vanquished and consented
so one morning they took the road for buonconvento being minded there to
breakfast now when angiulieri had breakfasted as twas a very hot day
he had a bed made in the inn and having undressed with fortarrigos
help he composed himself to sleep telling fortarrigo to call him on the
stroke of none angiulieri thus sleeping fortarrigo repaired to the
tavern where having slaked his thirst he sate down to a game with some
that were there who speedily won from him all his money and thereafter
in like manner all the clothes he had on his back wherefore he being
anxious to retrieve his losses went stripped as he was to his shirt to
the room where lay angiulieri and seeing that he was sound asleep he
took from his purse all the money that he had and so went back to the
gamingtable and staked it and lost it all as he had his own
by and by angiulieri awoke and got up and dressed and called for
fortarrigo and as fortarrigo answered not he supposed that he must have
had too much to drink and be sleeping it off somewhere as was his wont
he accordingly determined to leave him alone and doubting not to find a
better servant at corsignano he let saddle his palfrey and attach the
valise but when being about to depart he would have paid the host
never a coin could he come by whereat there was no small stir so that
all the inn was in an uproar angiulieri averring that he had been robbed
in the house and threatening to have them all arrested and taken to
siena when lo who should make his appearance but fortarrigo in his
shirt intent now to steal the clothes as he had stolen the moneys of
angiulieri and marking that angiulieri was accoutred for the roadhow
is this angiulieri quoth he are we to start so soon nay but wait a
little one will be here presently that has my doublet in pawn for
thirtyeight soldi i doubt not he will return it me for thirtyfive
soldi if i pay money down and while they were yet talking in came one
that made it plain to angiulieri that twas fortarrigo that had robbed
him of his money for he told him the amount that fortarrigo had lost
whereat angiulieri in a towering passion rated fortarrigo right
soundly and but that he stood more in fear of man than of god would
have suited action to word and so threatening to have him hanged by the
neck and proclaimed an outlaw at the gallowstree of siena he mounted
his horse
fortarrigo making as if twas not to him but to another that
angiulieri thus spoke made answercome now angiulieri we were best
have done with all this idle talk and consider the matter of substance
we can redeem for thirtyfive soldi if we pay forthwith but if we wait
till tomorrow we shall not get off with less than thirtyeight the
full amount of the loan and tis because i staked by his advice that he
will make me this allowance now why should not we save these three
soldi whereat angiulieri waxed wellnigh desperate more particularly
that he marked that the bystanders were scanning him suspiciously as if
so far from understanding that fortarrigo had staked and lost his
angiulieris money they gave him credit for still being in funds so he
cried outwhat have i to do with thy doublet tis high time thou wast
hanged by the neck that not content with robbing me and gambling away
my money thou must needs also keep me in parley here and make mock of
me when i would fain be gone fortarrigo however still persisted in
making believe that angiulieri did not mean this for him and only
saidnay but why wilt not thou save me these three soldi thinkst
thou i can be of no more use to thee prithee an thou lovst me do me
this turn wherefore in such a hurry we have time enough to get to
torrenieri this evening come now out with thy purse thou knowest i
might search siena through and not find a doublet that would suit me so
well as this and for all i let him have it for thirtyeight soldi tis
worth forty or more so thou wilt wrong me twice over vexed beyond
measure that after robbing him fortarrigo should now keep him clavering
about the matter angiulieri made no answer but turned his horses head
and took the road for torrenieri but fortarrigo with cunning malice
trotted after him in his shirt and twas still his doublet his doublet
that he would have of him and when they had thus ridden two good miles
and angiulieri was forcing the pace to get out of earshot of his
pestering fortarrigo espied some husbandmen in a field beside the road a
little ahead of angiulieri and fell a shouting to them amaintake
thief take thief whereupon they came up with their spades and their
mattocks and barred angiulieris way supposing that he must have robbed
the man that came shouting after him in his shirt and stopped him and
apprehended him and little indeed did it avail him to tell them who he
was and how the matter stood for up came fortarrigo with a wrathful
air andi know not quoth he why i spare to kill thee on the spot
traitor thief that thou art thus to despoil me and give me the slip
and then turning to the peasantsyou see gentlemen quoth he in
what a trim he left me in the inn after gambling away all that he had
with him and on him well indeed may i say that under god tis to you i
owe it that i have thus come by my own again for which cause i shall
ever be beholden to you angiulieri also had his say but his words
passed unheeded fortarrigo with the help of the peasants compelled him
to dismount and having stripped him donned his clothes mounted his
horse and leaving him barefoot and in his shirt rode back to siena
giving out on all hands that he had won the palfrey and the clothes from
angiulieri so angiulieri having thought to present himself to the
cardinal in the march a wealthy man returned to buonconvento poor and in
his shirt and being ashamed for the time to shew himself in siena
pledged the nag that fortarrigo had ridden for a suit of clothes and
betook him to his kinsfolk at corsignano where he tarried until he
received a fresh supply of money from his father thus then
fortarrigos guile disconcerted angiulieris judicious purpose albeit
when time and occasion served it was not left unrequited
novel v

calandrino being enamoured of a damsel bruno gives him a scroll
averring that if he but touch her therewith she will go with him he is
found with her by his wife who subjects him to a most severe and
vexatious examination

so at no great length ended neifile her story which the company
allowed to pass with none too much laughter or remark whereupon the
queen turning to fiammetta bade her follow suit fiammetta with mien
most gladsome made answer that she willingly obeyed and thus beganas
i doubt not ye know ladies most debonair be the topic of discourse
never so well worn it will still continue to please if the speaker
knows how to make due choice of time and occasion meet wherefore
considering the reason for which we are here how that tis to make merry
and speed the time gaily and that merely i deem that there is nought
that may afford us mirth and solace but here may find time and occasion
meet and after serving a thousand turns of discourse should still
prove not unpleasing for another thousand wherefore notwithstanding
that of calandrino and his doings not a little has from time to time been
said among us yet considering that as a while ago filostrato observed
there is nought that concerns him that is not entertaining i will make
bold to add to the preceding stories another which i might well had i
been minded to deviate from the truth have disguised and so recounted
it to you under other names but as whoso in telling a story diverges
from the truth does thereby in no small measure diminish the delight of
his hearers i purpose for the reason aforesaid to give you the narrative
in proper form
niccolo cornacchini one of our citizens and a man of wealth had among
other estates a fine one at camerata on which he had a grand house
built and engaged bruno and buffalmacco to paint it throughout in which
task for that twas by no means light they associated with them nello
and calandrino and so set to work there were a few rooms in the house
provided with beds and other furniture and an old female servant lived
there as caretaker but otherwise the house was unoccupied for which
cause niccolos son filippo being a young man and a bachelor was wont
sometimes to bring thither a woman for his pleasure and after keeping
her there for a few days to escort her thence again now on one of these
occasions it befell that he brought thither one niccolosa whom a vile
fellow named mangione kept in a house at camaldoli as a common
prostitute and a fine piece of flesh she was and wore fine clothes and
for one of her sort knew how to comport herself becomingly and talk
agreeably
now one day at high noon forth tripped the damsel from her chamber in a
white gown her locks braided about her head to wash her hands and face
at a well that was in the courtyard of the house and while she was so
engaged it befell that calandrino came there for water and greeted her
familiarly having returned his salutation she rather because
calandrino struck her as something out of the common than for any other
interest she felt in him regarded him attentively calandrino did the
like by her and being smitten by her beauty found reasons enough why he
should not go back to his comrades with the water but as he knew not
who she was he made not bold to address her she upon whom his gaze was
not lost being minded to amuse herself at his expense let her glance
from time to time rest upon him while she heaved a slight sigh or two
whereby calandrino was forthwith captivated and tarried in the
courtyard until filippo called her back into the chamber returned to
his work calandrino sighed like a furnace which bruno who was ever
regardful of his doings for the diversion they afforded him failed not
to mark and by and bywhat the devil is amiss with thee comrade
calandrino quoth he thou dost nought but puff and blow comrade
replied calandrino i should be in luck had i but one to help me how
so quoth bruno why returned calandrino tis not to go farther
but there is a damsel below fairer than a lamia and so mightily in love
with me that twould astonish thee i observed it but now when i went to
fetch the water nay but calandrino make sure she be not filippos
wife quoth bruno i doubt tis even so replied calandrino for he
called her and she joined him in the chamber but what signifies it i
would circumvent christ himself in such case not to say filippo of a
truth comrade i tell thee she pleases me i could not say how
comrade returned bruno i will find out for thee who she is and if
she be filippos wife two words from me will make it all straight for
thee for she is much my friend but how shall we prevent buffalmacco
knowing it i can never have a word with her but he is with me as to
buffalmacco replied calandrino i care not if he do know it but let
us make sure that it come not to nellos ears for he is of kin to monna
tessa and would spoil it all wheretothou art in the right
returned bruno
now bruno knew what the damsel was for he had seen her arrive and
moreover filippo had told him so calandrino having given over working
for a while and betaken him to her bruno acquainted nello and
buffalmacco with the whole story and thereupon they privily concerted
how to entreat him in regard of this love affair wherefore upon his
return quoth bruno softlydidst see her ay woes me replied
calandrino she has stricken me to the death quoth brunoi will go
see if she be the lady i take her to be and if i find that tis so
leave the rest to me whereupon down went bruno and found filippo and
the damsel and fully apprised them what sort of fellow calandrino was
and what he had told them and concerted with them what each should do
and say that they might have a merry time together over calandrinos
love affair he then rejoined calandrino sayingtis the very same
and therefore the affair needs very delicate handling for if filippo
were but ware thereof not all arnos waters would suffice to cleanse us
however what should i say to her from thee if by chance i should get
speech of her ifaith replied calandrino why first first of all
thou wilt tell her that i wish her a thousand bushels of the good seed of
generation and then that i am her servant and if she is fain
ofaughtthou takst me ay quoth bruno leave it to me
suppertime came and the days work done they went down into the
courtyard filippo and niccolosa being there and there they tarried a
while to advance calandrinos suit calandrinos gaze was soon riveted on
niccolosa and such and so strange and startling were the gestures that
he made that they would have given sight to the blind she on her part
used all her arts to inflame his passion primed as she had been by
bruno and diverted beyond measure as she was by calandrinos antics
while filippo buffalmacco and the rest feigned to be occupied in
converse and to see nought of what passed however after a while to
calandrinos extreme disgust they took their leave and as they bent
their steps towards florencei warrant thee quoth bruno to
calandrino she wastes away for thee like ice in the sunlight by the
body o god if thou wert to bring thy rebeck and sing her one or two of
thy lovesongs shed throw herself out of window to be with thee quoth
calandrinothinkst thou comrade thinkst thou twere well i
brought it ay indeed returned bruno whereuponah comrade
quoth calandrino so thou wouldst not believe me when i told thee
today of a truth i perceive theres neer another knows so well what he
would be at as i who but i would have known how so soon to win the love
of a lady like that lucky indeed might they deem themselves if they did
it those young gallants that go about day and night up and down a
strumming on the onestringed viol and would not know how to gather a
handful of nuts once in a millennium mayst thou be by to see when i
bring her the rebeck thou wilt see fine sport list well what i say i
am not so old as i look and she knows it right well ay and anyhow i
will soon let her know it when i come to grapple her by the very body
of christ i will have such sport with her that she will follow me as any
lovesick maid follows her swain oh quoth bruno i doubt not thou
wilt make her thy prey and i seem to see thee bite her dainty vermeil
mouth and her cheeks that shew as twin roses with thy teeth that are
as so many lutepegs and afterwards devour her bodily so encouraged
calandrino fancied himself already in action and went about singing and
capering in such high glee that twas as if he would burst his skin and
so next day he brought the rebeck and to the no small amusement of all
the company sang several songs to her and in short by frequently
seeing her he waxed so mad with passion that he gave over working and a
thousand times a day he would run now to the window now to the door and
anon to the courtyard on the chance of catching sight of her nor did
she astutely following brunos instructions fail to afford him
abundance of opportunity bruno played the gobetween bearing him her
answers to all his messages and sometimes bringing him messages from
her when she was not at home which was most frequently the case he
would send him letters from her in which she gave great encouragement to
his hopes at the same time giving him to understand that she was at the
house of her kinsfolk where as yet he might not visit her
on this wise bruno and buffalmacco so managed the affair as to divert
themselves inordinately causing him to send her as at her request now
an ivory comb now a purse now a little knife and other such dainty
trifles in return for which they brought him now and again a
counterfeit ring of no value with which calandrino was marvellously
pleased and calandrino to stimulate their zeal in his interest would
entertain them hospitably at table and otherwise flatter them now when
they had thus kept him in play for two good months and the affair was
just where it had been calandrino seeing that the work was coming to an
end and bethinking him that if it did so before he had brought his love
affair to a successful issue he must give up all hopes of ever so doing
began to be very instant and importunate with bruno so in the presence
of the damsel and by preconcert with her and filippo quoth bruno to
calandrinoharkye comrade this lady has vowed to me a thousand times
that she will do as thou wouldst have her and as for all that she does
nought to pleasure thee i am of opinion that she leads thee by the nose
wherefore as she keeps not her promises we will make her do so
willynilly if thou art so minded nay but for the love of god so
be it replied calandrino and that speedily darest thou touch her
then with a scroll that i shall give thee quoth bruno i dare
replied calandrino fetch me then quoth bruno a bit of the skin of
an unborn lamb a live bat three grains of incense and a blessed
candle and leave the rest to me to catch the bat taxed all
calandrinos art and craft for the whole of the evening but having at
length taken him he brought him with the other matters to bruno who
having withdrawn into a room by himself wrote on the skin some
cabalistic jargon and handed it to him sayingknow calandrino
that if thou touch her with this scroll she will follow thee forthwith
and do whatever thou shalt wish wherefore should filippo go abroad
today get thee somehow up to her and touch her and then go into the
barn that is herebytis the best place we have for never a soul goes
thereand thou wilt see that she will come there too when she is there
thou wottest well what to do calandrino overjoyed as neer another
took the scroll saying onlycomrade leave that to me
now nello whom calandrino mistrusted entered with no less zest than the
others into the affair and was their confederate for calandrinos
discomfiture accordingly by brunos direction he hied to florence and
finding monna tessathou hast scarce forgotten tessa quoth he
what a beating calandrino gave thee without the least cause that day
when he came home with the stones from mugnone for which i would have
thee be avenged and so thou wilt not call me no more kinsman or
friend he is fallen in love with a lady up there who is abandoned
enough to go closeting herself not seldom with him and tis but a short
while since they made assignation to forgather forthwith so i would have
thee go there and surprise him in the act and give him a sound
trouncing which when the lady heard she deemed it no laughing matter
but started up and broke out withalas the arrant knave ist thus he
treats me by the holy rood never fear but i will pay him out and
wrapping herself in her cloak and taking a young woman with her for
companion she sped more at a run than at a walk escorted by nello up
to camerata bruno espying her from afar said to filippolo here
comes our friend whereupon filippo went to the place where calandrino
and the others were at work and saidmy masters i must needs go at
once to florence slacken not on that account and so off he went and
hid himself where unobserved he might see what calandrino would do
calandrino waited only until he saw that filippo was at some distance
and then he went down into the courtyard where he found niccolosa alone
and fell a talking with her she knowing well what she had to do drew
close to him and shewed him a little more familiarity than she was wont
whereupon calandrino touched her with the scroll and having so done
saying never a word bent his steps towards the barn whither niccolosa
followed him and being entered shut the door and forthwith embraced
him threw him down on the straw that lay there and got astride of him
and holding him fast by the arms about the shoulders suffered him not to
approach his face to hers but gazing upon him as if he were the delight
of her hearto calandrino sweet my calandrino quoth she heart of
my body my very soul my bliss my consolation ah how long have i
yearned to hold thee in my arms and have thee all my own thy endearing
ways have utterly disarmed me thou hast made prize of my heart with thy
rebeck do i indeed hold thee in mine embrace calandrino scarce able
to move murmuredah sweet my soul suffer me to kiss thee
wheretonay but thou art too hasty replied niccolosa let me first
feast mine eyes on thee let me but sate them with this sweet face of
thine
meanwhile bruno and buffalmacco had joined filippo so that what passed
was seen and heard by all three and while calandrino was thus intent to
kiss niccolosa lo up came nello with monna tessa by god i swear they
are both there ejaculated nello as they entered the doorway but the
lady now fairly furious laid hold of him and thrust him aside and
rushing in espied niccolosa astride of calandrino niccolosa no sooner
caught sight of the lady than up she jumped and in a trice was beside
filippo monna tessa fell upon calandrino who was still on the floor
planted her nails in his face and scratched it all over she then seized
him by the hair and hauling him to and fro about the barnfoul
pestilent cur quoth she is this the way thou treatest me thou old
fool a murrain on the love i have borne thee hast thou not enough to do
at home that thou must needs go falling in love with strange women and
a fine lover thou wouldst make dost not know thyself knave dost not
know thyself wretch thou from whose whole body twere not possible to
wring enough sap for a sauce gods faith twas not tessa that got thee
with child gods curse on her whoever she was verily she must be a
poor creature to be enamoured of a jewel of thy rare quality at sight
of his wife calandrino suspended as it were between life and death
ventured no defence but his face torn to shreds his hair and clothes
all disordered fumbled about for his capuche which having found up he
got and humbly besought his wife not to publish the matter unless she
were minded that he should be cut to pieces for that she that was with
him was the wife of the master of the house then god give her a bad
year replied the lady whereupon bruno and buffalmacco who by this
time had laughed their fill with filippo and niccolosa came up as if
attracted by the noise and after not a little ado pacified the lady and
counselled calandrino to go back to florence and stay there lest
filippo should get wind of the affair and do him a mischief so
calandrino crestfallen and woebegone got him back to florence with his
face torn to shreds where daring not to shew himself at camerata again
he endured day and night the grievous torment of his wifes vituperation
such was the issue to which after ministering not a little mirth to his
comrades as also to niccolosa and filippo this ardent lover brought his
amour
novel vi

two young men lodge at an inn of whom the one lies with the hosts
daughter his wife by inadvertence lying with the other he that lay with
the daughter afterwards gets into her fathers bed and tells him all
taking him to be his comrade they bandy words whereupon the good woman
apprehending the circumstances gets her to bed with her daughter and by
divers apt words reestablishes perfect accord

calandrino as on former occasions so also on this moved the company to
laughter however when the ladies had done talking of his doings the
queen called for a story from pamfilo who thus spokeworshipful
ladies this niccolosa that calandrino loved has brought to my mind a
story of another niccolosa which i am minded to tell you because twill
shew you how a good woman by her quick apprehension avoided a great
scandal
in the plain of mugnone there was not long ago a good man that furnished
travellers with meat and drink for money and for that he was in poor
circumstances and had but a little house gave not lodging to every
comer but only to a few that he knew and if they were hard bested now
the good man had to wife a very fine woman and by her had two children
to wit a pretty and winsome girl of some fifteen or sixteen summers as
yet unmarried and a little boy not yet one year old whom the mother
suckled at her own breast the girl had found favour in the eyes of a
goodly and mannerly young gentleman of our city who was not seldom in
those parts and loved her to the point of passion and she being
mightily flattered to be loved by such a gallant studied how to comport
herself so debonairly as to retain his regard and while she did so grew
likewise enamoured of him and divers times by consent of both their
love had had its fruition but that pinucciosuch was the gallants
nameshrank from the disgrace that twould bring upon the girl and
himself alike but as his passion daily waxed apace pinuccio yearning
to find himself abed with her bethought him that he were best contrive
to lodge with her father deeming from what he knew of her fathers
economy that if he did so he might effect his purpose and never a
soul be the wiser which idea no sooner struck him than he set about
carrying it into effect
so late one evening pinuccio and a trusty comrade adriano by name to
whom he had confided his love hired two nags and having set upon them
two valises filled with straw or suchlike stuff sallied forth of
florence and rode by a circuitous route to the plain of mugnone which
they reached after nightfall and having fetched a compass so that it
might seem as if they were coming from romagna they rode up to the good
mans house and knocked at the door the good man knowing them both
very well opened to them forthwith whereuponthou must even put us
up tonight quoth pinuccio we thought to get into florence but for
all the speed we could make we are but arrived here as thou seest at
this hour pinuccio replied the host thou well knowest that i can
but make a sorry shift to lodge gentlemen like you but yet as night has
overtaken you here and time serves not to betake you elsewhere i will
gladly give you such accommodation as i may the two gallants then
dismounted and entered the inn and having first looked to their horses
brought out some supper that they had carried with them and supped with
the host
now the host had but one little bedroom in which were three beds set
as conveniently as he could contrive two on one side of the room and
the third on the opposite side but for all that there was scarce room
enough to pass through the host had the least discomfortable of the
three beds made up for the two friends and having quartered them there
some little while afterwards both being awake but feigning to be
asleep he caused his daughter to get into one of the other two beds
while he and his wife took their places in the third the good woman
setting the cradle in which was her little boy beside the bed such
then being the partition made of the beds pinuccio who had taken exact
note thereof waited only until he deemed all but himself to be asleep
and then got softly up and stole to the bed in which lay his beloved and
laid himself beside her and she according him albeit a timorous yet a
gladsome welcome he stayed there taking with her that solace of which
both were most fain
pinuccio being thus with the girl it chanced that certain things being
overset by a cat fell with a noise that aroused the good woman who
fearing that it might be a matter of more consequence got up as best she
might in the dark and betook her to the place whence the noise seemed to
proceed at the same time adriano not by reason of the noise which he
heeded not but perchance to answer the call of nature also got up and
questing about for a convenient place came upon the cradle beside the
good womans bed and not being able otherwise to go by took it up and
set it beside his own bed and when he had accomplished his purpose went
back and giving never a thought to the cradle got him to bed the good
woman searched until she found that the accident was no such matter as
she had supposed so without troubling to strike a light to investigate
it further she reproved the cat and returned to the room and groped
her way straight to the bed in which her husband lay asleep but not
finding the cradle there quoth she to herselfalas blunderer that i
am what was i about gods faith i was going straight to the guests
bed and proceeding a little further she found the cradle and laid
herself down by adriano in the bed that was beside it taking adriano for
her husband and adriano who was still awake received her with all due
benignity and tackled her more than once to her no small delight
meanwhile pinuccio fearing lest sleep should overtake him while he was
yet with his mistress and having satisfied his desire got up and left
her to return to his bed but when he got there coming upon the cradle
he supposed that twas the hosts bed and so going a little further he
laid him down beside the host who thereupon awoke supposing that he had
adriano beside himi warrant thee quoth pinuccio to the host there
was never so sweet a piece of flesh as niccolosa by the body of god
such delight have i had of her as never had man of woman and mark me
since i left thee i have gotten me up to the farm some six times which
tidings the host being none too well pleased to learn said first of all
to himselfwhat the devil does this fellow here then his resentment
getting the better of his prudencetis a gross affront thou hast put
upon me pinuccio quoth he nor know i what occasion thou hast to do
me such a wrong but by the body of god i will pay thee out pinuccio
who was not the most discreet of gallants albeit he was now apprised of
his error instead of doing his best to repair it retortedand how
wilt thou pay me out what canst thou do hark what high words our
guests are at together quoth meanwhile the hosts wife to adriano
deeming that she spoke to her husband let them be replied adriano
with a laughgod give them a bad year they drank too much yestereve
the good woman had already half recognized her husbands angry tones and
now that she heard adrianos voice she at once knew where she was and
with whom accordingly being a discreet woman she started up and
saying never a word took her childs cradle and though there was not a
ray of light in the room bore it divining rather than feeling her way
to the side of the bed in which her daughter slept and then as if
aroused by the noise made by her husband she called him and asked what
he and pinuccio were bandying words about hearest thou not replied
the husband what he says he has this very night done to niccolosa
tush he lies in the throat returned the good woman he has not lain
with niccolosa for what time he might have done so i laid me beside her
myself and i have been wide awake ever since and thou art a fool to
believe him you men take so many cups before going to bed that then you
dream and walk in your sleep and imagine wonders tis a great pity you
do not break your necks what does pinuccio there why keeps he not in
his own bed
whereupon adriano in his turn seeing how adroitly the good woman
cloaked her own and her daughters shamepinuccio quoth he i have
told thee a hundred times that thou shouldst not walk about at night
for this thy bad habit of getting up in thy dreams and relating thy
dreams for truth will get thee into a scrape some time or another come
back and god send thee a bad night hearing adriano thus confirm what
his wife had said the host began to think that pinuccio must be really
dreaming so he took him by the shoulder and fell a shaking him and
calling him by his name sayingpinuccio wake up and go back to thy
bed pinuccio taking his cue from what he had heard began as a dreamer
would be like to do to talk wanderingly whereat the host laughed amain
then feigning to be aroused by the shaking pinuccio uttered adrianos
name sayingist already day that thou callest me ay tis so
quoth adriano come hither whereupon pinuccio making as if he were
mighty drowsy got him up from beside the host and back to bed with
adriano on the morrow when they were risen the host fell a laughing
and making merry touching pinuccio and his dreams and so the jest passed
from mouth to mouth while the gallants horses were groomed and saddled
and their valises adjusted which done they drank with the host mounted
and rode to florence no less pleased with the manner than with the
matter of the nights adventure nor afterwards did pinuccio fail to
find other means of meeting niccolosa who assured her mother that he had
unquestionably dreamed for which cause the good woman calling to mind
adrianos embrace accounted herself the only one that had watched

talano di molese dreams that a wolf tears and rends all the neck and face
of his wife he gives her warning thereof which she heeds not and the
dream comes true

when pamfilo had brought his story to a close and all had commended the
good womans quick perception the queen bade pampinea tell hers and
thus pampinea begana while ago debonair my ladies we held discourse
of the truths that dreams shew forth which not a few of us deride for
which cause albeit the topic has been handled before i shall not spare
to tell you that which not long ago befell a neighbour of mine for that
she disbelieved a dream that her husband had
i wot not if you knew talano di molese a man right worthy to be had in
honour who having married a young wifemargarita by namefair as eer
another but without her match for whimsical fractious and perverse
humours insomuch that there was nought she would do at the instance of
another either for his or her own good found her behaviour most
grievous to bear but was fain to endure what he might not cure now it
so befell that talano and margarita being together at an estate that
talano had in the contado he sleeping saw in a dream a very beautiful
wood that was on the estate at no great distance from the house and his
lady there walking and as she went there leapt forth upon her a huge
and fierce wolf that griped her by the throat and bore her down to the
ground and she shrieking the while for succour would have carried her
off by main force but she got quit of his jaws albeit her neck and face
shewed as quite disfigured on the morrow as soon as he was risen
talano said to his wifealbeit for thy perversity i have not yet known
a single good day with thee yet i should be sorry wife that harm
should befall thee and therefore if thou take my advice thou wilt not
stir out of doors today wherefore quoth the lady and thereupon he
recounted to her all his dream
the lady shook her head sayingwho means ill dreams ill thou makest
as if thou wast mighty tender of me but thou bodest of me in thy dream
that which thou wouldst fain see betide me i warrant thee that today
and all days i will have a care to avoid this or any other calamity that
might gladden thy heart whereuponwell wist i replied talano
that thou wouldst so say for such is ever the requital of those that
comb scurfy heads but whatever thou mayst be pleased to believe i for
my part speak to thee for thy good and again i advise thee to keep
indoors today or at least not to walk in the wood good returned
the lady i will look to it and then she began communing with herself
on this wisedidst mark how artfully he thinks to have scared me from
going into the wood today doubtless tis that he has an assignation
there with some light o love with whom he had rather i did not find
him ah he would sup well with the blind and what a fool were i to
believe him but i warrant he will be disappointed and needs must i
though i stay there all day long see what commerce it is that he will
adventure in today
having so said she quitted the house on one side while her husband did
so on the other and forthwith shunning observation as best she might
she hied her to the wood and hid her where twas most dense and there
waited on the alert and glancing now this way and now that to see if
any were coming and while thus she stood nor ever a thought of a wolf
crossed her mind lo forth of a close covert hard by came a wolf of
monstrous size and appalling aspect and scarce had she time to say god
help me before he sprang upon her and griped her by the throat so
tightly that she might not utter a cry but passive as any lambkin was
borne off by him and had certainly been strangled had he not
encountered some shepherds who with shouts compelled him to let her go
the shepherds recognized the poor hapless woman and bore her home where
the physicians by dint of long and careful treatment cured her howbeit
the whole of her throat and part of her face remained so disfigured that
fair as she had been before she was ever thereafter most foul and
hideous to look upon wherefore being ashamed to shew her face she did
many a time bitterly deplore her perversity in that when it would have
cost her nothing she would nevertheless pay no heed to the true dream of
her husband

biondello gulls ciacco in the matter of a breakfast for which prank
ciacco is cunningly avenged on biondello causing him to be shamefully
beaten

all the company by common consent pronounced it no dream but a vision
that talano had had in his sleep so exactly no circumstance lacking
had it fallen out according as he had seen it however as soon as all
had done speaking the queen bade lauretta follow suit which lauretta
did on this wiseas most discreet my ladies those that have preceded
me today have almost all taken their cue from somewhat that has been
said before so prompted by the stern vengeance taken by the scholar in
pampineas narrative of yesterday i am minded to tell you of a vengeance
that was indeed less savage but for all that grievous enough to him on
whom it was wreaked
wherefore i say that there was once at florence one that all folk called
ciacco a man second to none that ever lived for inordinate gluttony
who lacking the means to support the expenditure which his gluttony
demanded and being for the rest wellmannered and well furnished with
excellent and merry jests did without turning exactly court jester
cultivate a somewhat biting wit and loved to frequent the houses of the
rich and such as kept good tables whither bidden or unbidden he not
seldom resorted for breakfast or supper there was also in those days at
florence one that was called biondello a man very short of stature and
not a little debonair more trim than any fly with his blond locks
surmounted by a coif and never a hair out of place and he and ciacco
were two of a trade
now one morning in lent biondello being in the fishmarket purchasing
two mighty fat lampreys for messer vieri de cerchi was observed thus
engaged by ciacco who came up to him andwhat means this quoth he
why replied biondello tis that yestereve messer corso donati had
three lampreys much finer than these and a sturgeon sent to his house
but as they did not suffice for a breakfast that he is to give certain
gentlemen he has commissioned me to buy him these two beside wilt thou
not be there ay marry that will i returned ciacco and in what he
deemed due time he hied him to messer corso donatis house where he
found him with some of his neighbours not yet gone to breakfast and
being asked by messer corso with what intent he was come he
answeredi am come sir to breakfast with you and your company and
welcome art thou returned messer corso go we then to breakfast for
tis now the time so to table they went where nought was set before
them but pease and the inward part of the tunny salted and afterwards
the common fish of the arno fried wherefore ciacco not a little wroth
at the trick that he perceived biondello had played him resolved to pay
him out and not many days after biondello who had meanwhile had many a
laugh with his friends over ciaccos discomfiture met him and after
greeting him asked him with a laugh what messer corsos lampreys had
been like that question replied ciacco thou wilt be able to answer
much better than i before eight days are gone by and parting from
biondello upon the word he went forthwith and hired a cozening rogue
and having thrust a glass bottle into his hand brought him within sight
of the loggia de cavicciuli and there pointing to a knight one messer
filippo argenti a tall man and stout and of a high courage and
haughty choleric and crossgrained as neer another he said to
himthou wilt go flask in hand to messer filippo and wilt say to
himi am sent to you sir by biondello who entreats you to be
pleased to colour this flask for him with some of your good red wine for
that he is minded to have a good time with his catamites and of all
things have a care that he lay not hands upon thee for he would make
thee rue the day and would spoil my sport have i aught else to say
enquired the rogue nothing more returned ciacco and now get thee
gone and when thou hast delivered the message bring me back the flask
and i will pay thee
so away went the rogue and did the errand to messer filippo who
forthwith being a hasty man jumped to the conclusion that biondello
whom he knew was making mock of him and while an angry flush overspread
his facecolour the flask forsooth quoth he and catamites god
send thee and him a bad year and therewith up he started and reached
forward to lay hold of the rogue who being on the alert gave him the
slip and was off and reported messer filippos answer to ciacco who had
observed what had passed having paid the rogue ciacco rested not until
he had found biondello to whomwast thou but now quoth he at the
loggia de cavicciuli indeed no replied biondello wherefore such a
question because returned ciacco i may tell thee that thou art
sought for by messer filippo for what cause i know not good quoth
biondello i will go thither and speak with him so away went
biondello and ciacco followed him to see what course the affair would
take
now having failed to catch the rogue messer filippo was still very
wroth and inly fumed and fretted being unable to make out aught from
what the rogue had said save that biondello was set on by some one or
another to flout him and while thus he vexed his spirit up came
biondello whom he no sooner espied than he made for him and dealt him a
mighty blow in the face and tore his hair and coif and cast his capuche
on the ground and to his alas sir what means this still beating him
amaintraitor cried he i will give thee to know what it means to
send me such a message colour the flask forsooth and catamites
dost take me for a stripling to be befooled by thee and therewith he
pummelled biondellos face all over with a pair of fists that were liker
to iron than aught else until it was but a mass of bruises he also tore
and dishevelled all his hair tumbled him in the mud rent all his
clothes upon his back and that without allowing him breathingspace to
ask why he thus used him or so much as utter a word colour me the
flask and catamites rang in his ears but what the words signified
he knew not in the end very badly beaten and in very sorry and ragged
trim many folk having gathered around them they albeit not without the
utmost difficulty rescued him from messer filippos hands and told him
why messer filippo had thus used him censuring him for sending him such
a message and adding that thenceforth he would know messer filippo
better and that he was not a man to be trifled with biondello told them
in tearful exculpation that he had never sent for wine to messer filippo
then when they had put him in a little better trim crestfallen and
woebegone he went home imputing his misadventure to ciacco and when
many days afterwards the marks of his illusage being gone from his
face he began to go abroad again it chanced that ciacco met him and
with a laughbiondello quoth he how didst thou relish messer
filippos wine why as to that replied biondello would thou hadst
relished the lampreys of messer corso as much so returned ciacco
such meat as thou then gavest me thou mayst henceforth give me as
often as thou art so minded and i will give thee even such drink as i
have given thee so biondello witting that against ciacco his might was
not equal to his spite prayed god for his peace and was careful never
to flout him again
novel ix

two young men ask counsel of solomon the one how he is to make himself
beloved the other how he is to reduce an unruly wife to order the king
bids the one to love and the other to go to the bridge of geese

none now remained to tell save the queen unless she were minded to
infringe dioneos privilege wherefore when the ladies had laughed their
fill over the misfortunes of biondello thus gaily the queen
beganobserve we lovesome ladies the order of things with a sound
mind and we shall readily perceive that we women are one and all
subjected by nature and custom and law unto man by him to be ruled and
governed at his discretion wherefore she that would fain enjoy quietude
and solace and comfort with the man to whom she belongs ought not only
to be chaste but lowly patient and obedient the which is the discreet
wifes chief and most precious possession and if the laws which in all
matters have regard unto the common weal and use and wont or custom
call it what you will a power very great and to be had in awe should
not suffice to school us thereto yet abundantly clear is the witness of
nature which has fashioned our frames delicate and sensitive and our
spirits timorous and fearful and has decreed that our bodily strength
shall be slight our voices tunable and our movements graceful which
qualities do all avouch that we have need of others governance and
whoso has need of succour and governance ought in all reason to be
obedient and submissive and reverent towards his governor and whom have
we to govern and succour us save men tis then our bounden duty to give
men all honour and submit ourselves unto them from which rule if any
deviate i deem her most deserving not only of grave censure but of
severe chastisement which reflections albeit they are not new to me i
am now led to make by what but a little while ago pampinea told us
touching the perverse wife of talano on whom god bestowed that
chastisement which the husband had omitted and accordingly it jumps with
my judgment that all such women as deviate from the graciousness
kindliness and compliancy which nature and custom and law prescribe
merit as i said stern and severe chastisement wherefore as a salutary
medicine for the healing of those of us who may be afflicted with this
disease i am minded to relate to you that which was once delivered by
solomon by way of counsel in such a case which let none that stands not
in need of such physic deem to be meant for her albeit a proverb is
current among men to wit
  good steed bad steed alike need the rowels prick
  good wife bad wife alike demand the stick
which whoso should construe as a merry conceit would find you all ready
enough to acknowledge its truth but even in its moral significance i say
that it ought to command assent for women are all by nature apt to be
swayed and to fall and therefore for the correction of the wrongdoing
of such as transgress the bounds assigned to them there is need of the
stick punitive and also for the maintenance of virtue in others that
they transgress not these appointed bounds there is need of the stick
auxiliary and deterrent however to cut short this preachment and to
come to that which i purpose to tell you i say
that the bruit of the incomparable renown of the prodigious wisdom of
solomon as also of the exceeding great liberality with which he accorded
proof thereof to all that craved such assurance being gone forth over
wellnigh all the earth many from divers parts were wont to resort to
him for counsel in matters of most pressing and arduous importance among
whom was a young man melisso by name a very wealthy nobleman who was
as had been his fathers before him of lazistan and there dwelt and as
melisso fared toward jerusalem on his departure from antioch he fell in
with another young man giosefo by name who was going the same way and
with whom after the manner of travellers he entered into converse
melisso having learned from giosefo who and whence he was asked him
whither he went and on what errand whereupon giosefo made an answer
that he was going to seek counsel of solomon how he should deal with his
wife who had not her match among women for unruliness and perversity
insomuch that neither entreaties nor blandishments nor aught else availed
him to bring her to a better frame and thereupon he in like manner asked
melisso whence he was and whither he was bound and on what errand
wheretoof lazistan i replied melisso and like thyself in evil
plight for albeit i am wealthy and spend my substance freely in
hospitably entertaining and honourably entreating my fellowcitizens yet
for all that passing strange though it be to think upon i find never a
soul to love me and therefore i am bound to the selfsame place as thou
to be advised how it may come to pass that i be beloved
so the two men fared on together and being arrived at jerusalem were
by the good offices of one of solomons barons ushered into his
presence and melisso having briefly laid his case before the king was
answered in one wordlove which said melisso was forthwith
dismissed and giosefo discovered the reason of his coming to whom
solomon made no answer butget thee to the bridge of geese whereupon
giosefo was likewise promptly ushered out of the kings presence and
finding melisso awaiting him told him what manner of answer he had
gotten which utterances of the king the two men pondered but finding
therein nought that was helpful or relevant to their need they doubted
the king had but mocked them and set forth upon their homeward journey
now when they had been some days on the road they came to a river which
was spanned by a fine bridge and a great caravan of sumpter mules and
horses being about to cross they must needs tarry until the caravan had
passed by the more part of which had done so when it chanced that a
mule turned sulky as we know they will not seldom do and stood stock
still wherefore a muleteer took a stick and fell a beating the mule
therewith albeit at first with no great vigour to urge the mule
forward the mule however swerving now to this now to the other side
of the bridge and sometimes facing about utterly refused to go forward
whereat the muleteer wroth beyond measure fell a belabouring him with
the stick now on the head now on the flanks and anon on the croup
never so lustily but all to no purpose which caused melisso and giosefo
ofttimes to say to himhow now caitiff what is this thou doest
wouldst kill the beast why not try if thou canst not manage him kindly
and gently he would start sooner so than for this cudgelling of thine
to whomyou know your horses replied the muleteer and i know my
mule leave me to deal with him which said he resumed his cudgelling
of the mule and laid about him on this side and on that to such purpose
that he started him and so the honours of the day rested with the
muleteer now as the two young men were leaving the bridge behind them
giosefo asked a good man that sate at its head what the bridge was
called and was answeredsir tis called the bridge of geese which
giosefo no sooner heard than he called to mind solomons words and
turning to melissonow comrade i warrant thee i may yet find
solomons counsel sound and good for that i knew not how to beat my wife
is abundantly clear to me and this muleteer has shewn me what i have to
do
now some days afterwards they arrived at antioch where giosefo prevailed
upon melisso to tarry with him and rest a day or two and meeting with
but a sorry welcome on the part of his wife he told her to take her
orders as to supper from melisso who seeing that such was giosefos
will briefly gave her his instructions which the lady as had been her
wont not only did not obey but contravened in almost every particular
which giosefo markingwast thou not told quoth he angrily after
what fashion thou wast to order the supper wheretoso replied the
lady haughtily what means this if thou hast a mind to sup why take
not thy supper no matter what i was told tis thus i saw fit to order
it if it like thee so be it if not tis thine affair melisso heard
the lady with surprise and inward disapprobation giosefo retorteday
wife thou art still as thou wast used to be but i will make thee mend
thy manners then turning to melissofriend quoth he thou wilt
soon prove the worth of solomons counsel but prithee let it not irk
thee to look on and deem that what i shall do is but done in sport and
if thou shouldst be disposed to stand in my way bear in mind how we were
answered by the muleteer when we pitied his mule i am in thy house
replied melisso and thy pleasure is to me law
thereupon giosefo took a stout cudgel cut from an oak sapling and hied
him into the room whither the lady had withdrawn from the table in high
dudgeon seized her by the hair threw her on to the floor at his feet
and fell a beating her amain with the cudgel the lady at first uttered a
shriek or two from which she passed to threats but seeing that for all
that giosefo slackened not by the time she was thoroughly well
thrashed she began to cry him mercy imploring him not to kill her and
adding that henceforth his will should be to her for law but still
giosefo gave not over but with ever fresh fury dealt her mighty
swingeing blows now about the ribs now on the haunches now over the
shoulders nor had he done with the fair lady until in short he had
left never a bone or other part of her person whole and he was fairly
spent then returning to melissotomorrow quoth he we shall see
whether get thee to the bridge of geese will prove to have been sound
advice or no and so having rested a while and then washed his hands
he supped with melisso with great pain the poor lady got upon her feet
and laid herself on her bed and having there taken such rest as she
might rose betimes on the morrow and craved to know of giosefo what he
was minded to have to breakfast giosefo laughing with melisso over the
message gave her his directions and when in due time they came to
breakfast they found everything excellently ordered according as it had
been commanded for which cause the counsel which they had at first
failed to understand now received their highest commendation
some few days later melisso having taken leave of giosefo went home
and told a wise man the counsel he had gotten from solomon
whereuponand no truer or sounder advice could he have given thee
quoth the sage thou knowest that thou lovest never a soul and that the
honours thou payest and the services thou renderest to others are not
prompted by love of them but by love of display love then as solomon
bade thee and thou shalt be loved on such wise was the unruly
chastised and the young man learning to love was beloved
novel x

dom gianni at the instance of his gossip pietro uses an enchantment to
transform pietros wife into a mare but when he comes to attach the
tail gossip pietro by saying that he will have none of the tail makes
the enchantment of no effect

the queens story evoked some murmurs from the ladies and some laughter
from the young men however when they were silent dioneo thus
begandainty my ladies a black crow among a flock of white doves
enhances their beauty more than would a white swan and so when many
sages are met together their ripe wisdom not only shews the brighter and
goodlier for the presence of one that is not so wise but may even derive
pleasure and diversion therefrom wherefore as you my ladies are one
and all most discreet and judicious i who know myself to be somewhat
scant of sense should for that by my demerit i make your merit shew the
more glorious be more dear to you than if by my greater merit i
eclipsed yours and by consequence should have more ample license to
reveal myself to you as i am and therefore have more patient sufferance
on your part than would be due to me were i more discreet in the
relation of the tale which i am about to tell you twill be then a
story none too long wherefrom you may gather with what exactitude it
behoves folk to observe the injunctions of those that for any purpose use
an enchantment and how slight an error committed therein make bring to
nought all the work of the enchanter
a year or so ago there was at barletta a priest named dom gianni di
barolo who to eke out the scanty pittance his church afforded him set
a packsaddle upon his mare and took to going the round of the fairs of
apulia buying and selling merchandise and so it befell that he clapped
up a close acquaintance with one pietro da tresanti who plied the same
trade as he albeit instead of a mare he had but an ass whom in token of
friendship and goodfellowship dom gianni after the apulian fashion
called ever gossip pietro and had him to his house and there lodged and
honourably entreated him as often as he came to barletta gossip pietro
on his part albeit he was very poor and had but a little cot at
tresanti that scarce sufficed for himself his fair young wife and
their ass nevertheless whenever dom gianni arrived at tresanti made
him welcome and did him the honours of his house as best he might in
requital of the hospitality which he received at barletta however as
gossip pietro had but one little bed in which he slept with his fair
wife twas not in his power to lodge dom gianni as comfortably as he
would have liked but the priests mare being quartered beside the ass in
a little stable the priest himself must needs lie beside her on the
straw many a time when the priest came the wife knowing how honourably
he entreated her husband at barletta would fain have gone to sleep with
a neighbour one zita carapresa di giudice leo that the priest might
share the bed with her husband and many a time had she told the priest
so howbeit he would never agree to it and on one occasiongossip
gemmata quoth he trouble not thyself about me i am well lodged for
when i am so minded i turn the mare into a fine lass and dally with her
and then when i would i turn her back into a mare wherefore i could
ill brook to part from her the young woman wondering but believing
told her husband what the priest had said addingif he is even such a
friend as thou sayst why dost thou not get him to teach thee the
enchantment so that thou mayst turn me into a mare and have both ass
and mare for thine occasions we should then make twice as much gain as
we do and thou couldst turn me back into a woman when we came home at
night
gossip pietro whose wit was somewhat blunt believed that twas as she
said approved her counsel and began adjuring dom gianni as
persuasively as he might to teach him the incantation dom gianni did
his best to wean him of his folly but as all was in vainlo now
quoth he as you are both bent on it we will be up as is our wont
before the sun tomorrow morning and i will shew you how tis done the
truth is that tis in the attachment of the tail that the great
difficulty lies as thou wilt see scarce a wink of sleep had either
gossip pietro or gossip gemmata that night so great was their anxiety
and towards daybreak up they got and called dom gianni who being
risen came in his shirt into gossip pietros little bedroom andi
know not quoth he that there is another soul in the world for whom i
would do this save you my gossips however as you will have it so i
will do it but it behoves you to do exactly as i bid you if you would
have the enchantment work they promised obedience and dom gianni
thereupon took a light which he handed to gossip pietro sayinglet
nought that i shall do or say escape thee and have a care so thou
wouldst not ruin all to say never a word whatever thou mayst see or
hear and pray god that the tail may be securely attached so gossip
pietro took the light and again promised obedience dom gianni caused
gossip gemmata to strip herself stark naked and stand on all fours like
a mare at the same time strictly charging her that whatever might
happen she must utter no word then touching her head and facebe
this a fine head of a mare quoth he in like manner touching her hair
he saidbe this a fine mane of a mare touching her armsbe these
fine legs and fine hooves of a mare then as he touched her breast and
felt its firm roundness and there awoke and arose one that was not
calledand be this a fine breast of a mare quoth he and in like
manner he dealt with her back belly croup thighs and legs last of
all the work being complete save for the tail he lifted his shirt and
took in his hand the tool with which he was used to plant men and
forthwith thrust it into the furrow made for it sayingand be this a
fine tail of a mare whereat gossip pietro who had followed everything
very heedfully to that point disapproving that last particular
exclaimedno dom gianni ill have no tail ill have no tail the
essential juice by which all plants are propagated was already
discharged when dom gianni withdrew the tool sayingalas gossip
pietro what hast thou done did i not tell thee to say never a word no
matter what thou mightst see the mare was all but made but by speaking
thou hast spoiled all and tis not possible to repeat the enchantment
well and good replied gossip pietro i would have none of that tail
why saidst thou not to memake it thou and besides thou wast
attaching it too low twas because returned dom gianni thou
wouldst not have known on the first essay how to attach it so well as
i whereupon the young woman stood up and in all good faith said to her
husbandfool that thou art wherefore hast thou brought to nought what
had been for the good of us both when didst thou ever see mare without a
tail so help me god poor as thou art thou deservest to be poorer
still so after gossip pietros illtimed speech there being no way
left of turning the young woman into a mare downcast and melancholy she
resumed her clothes and gossip pietro plied his old trade with his ass
and went with dom gianni to the fair of bitonto and never asked him so
to serve him again
what laughter this story drew from the ladies who understood it better
than dioneo had wished may be left to the imagination of the fair one
that now laughs thereat however as the stories were ended and the sun
now shone with a tempered radiance the queen witting that the end of
her sovereignty was come stood up and took off the crown and set it on
the head of pamfilo whom alone it now remained thus to honour and said
with a smilemy lord tis a great burden that falls upon thee seeing
that thou coming last art bound to make good my shortcomings and those
of my predecessors which god give thee grace to accomplish even as he
has given me grace to make thee king with gladsome acknowledgment of
the honouri doubt not replied pamfilo that thanks to your noble
qualities and those of my other subjects i shall win even such praise as
those that have borne sway before me then following the example of his
predecessors he made all meet arrangements in concert with the
seneschal after which he turned to the expectant ladies and thus
spokeenamoured my ladies emilia our queen of today deeming it
proper to allow you an interval of rest to recruit your powers gave you
license to discourse of such matters as should most commend themselves to
each in turn and as thereby you are now rested i judge that tis meet
to revert to our accustomed rule wherefore i ordain that for tomorrow
you do each of you take thought how you may discourse of the ensuing
theme to wit of such as in matters of love or otherwise have done
something with liberality or magnificence by the telling and still
more by the doing of such things your spirits will assuredly be duly
attuned and animated to emprise high and noble whereby our life which
cannot but be brief seeing that tis enshrined in a mortal body fame
shall perpetuate in glory which whoso serves not the belly as do the
beasts must not only covet but with all zeal seek after and labour to
attain
the gay company having one and all approved the theme rose at a word
from their new king and betook them to their wonted pastimes and so
according as they severally had most lief diverted them until they
blithely reunited for supper which being served with all due care and
despatched they rose up to dance as they were wont and when they had
sung perhaps a thousand ditties fitter to please by their words than
by any excellence of musical art the king bade neifile sing one on her
own account and promptly and graciously with voice clear and blithe
thus neifile sang
in prime of maidenhood and fair and feat
  mid springs fresh foison chant i merrily
  thanks be to love and to my fancies sweet
as oer the grassy mead i glancing fare
  i mark it white and yellow and vermeil dight
  with flowers the thorny rose the lily white
  and all alike to his face i compare
  who loving hath me taen and me shall eer
  hold bounden to his will sith i am she
  that in his will findeth her joy complete
whereof if so it be that i do find
  any that i most like to him approve
  that pluck i straight and kiss with words of love
  discovering all as best i may my mind
  yea all my hearts desire and then entwined
  i set it in the chaplet daintily
  and with my yellow tresses bind and pleat
and as mine eyes do drink in the delight
  which the flower yields them even so my mind
  fired with his sweet love doth such solace find
  as he himself were present to the sight
  but never word of mine discover might
  that which the flowers sweet smell awakes in me
  witness the true tale that my sighs repeat
for from my bosom gentle and hot they fly
  not like the gusty sighs that others heave
  whenas they languish and do sorely grieve
  and to my love incontinent they hie
  whereof when he is ware he by and by
  to meward hasting cometh suddenly
  whenlest i faint i cry come i entreat
the king and all the ladies did not a little commend neifiles song
after which as the night was far spent the king bade all go to rest
until the morrow

endeth here the ninth day of the decameron and beginneth the tenth in
which under the rule of pamfilo discourse is had of such as in matters
of love or otherwise have done something with liberality or
magnificence

some cloudlets in the west still shewed a vermeil flush albeit those of
the eastern sky as the suns rays smote them anear were already fringed
as with most lucent gold when uprose pamfilo and roused the ladies and
his comrades and all the company being assembled and choice made of the
place whither they should betake them for their diversion he
accompanied by filomena and fiammetta led the way at a slow pace
followed by all the rest so fared they no little space beguiling the
time with talk of their future way of life whereof there was much to
tell and much to answer until as the sun gained strength they
returned having made quite a long round to the palace and being
gathered about the fountain such as were so minded drank somewhat from
beakers rinsed in its pure waters and then in the delicious shade of the
garden they hied them hither and thither taking their pleasure until
breakfasttime their meal taken they slept as they were wont and then
at a spot chosen by the king they reassembled where neifile having
received his command to lead the way blithely thus began
novel i

a knight in the service of the king of spain deems himself ill requited
wherefore the king by most cogent proof shews him that the blame rests
not with him but with the knights own evil fortune after which he
bestows upon him a noble gift

highly graced indeed do i deem myself honourable my ladies that our
king should have given to me the precedence in a matter so arduous to
tell of as magnificence for as the sun irradiates all the heaven with
his glory and beauty even so does magnificence enhance the purity and
the splendour of every other virtue i shall therefore tell you a story
which to my thinking is not a little pretty and which assuredly it
must be profitable to call to mind
you are to know then that among other honourable knights that from
days of old even until now have dwelt in our city one and perchance the
worthiest of all was messer ruggieri de figiovanni who being wealthy
and magnanimous reflecting on the customs and manner of life of tuscany
perceived that by tarrying there he was like to find little or no
occasion of shewing his mettle and accordingly resolved to pass some
time at the court of alfonso king of spain who for the fame of his high
qualities was without a peer among the potentates of his age so being
well provided with arms and horses and retinue suitable to his rank he
hied him to spain where he was graciously received by the king there
tarrying accordingly messer ruggieri very soon as well by the splendid
style in which he lived as by the prodigious feats of arms that he did
gave folk to know his high desert
now having tarried there some while and observed the kings ways with
much care and how he would grant castles cities or baronies to this
that or the other of his subjects he deemed that the king shewed
therein but little judgment seeing that he would give them to men that
merited them not and for that nought was given to him he knowing his
merit deemed himself gravely injured in reputation wherefore he made up
his mind to depart the realm and to that end craved license of the king
which the king granted him and therewith gave him one of the best and
finest mules that was ever ridden a gift which messer ruggieri as he
had a long journey to make did not a little appreciate the king then
bade one of his discreet domestics contrive as best he might to ride
with messer ruggieri on such wise that it might not appear that he did so
by the kings command and charge his memory with whatever messer
ruggieri might say of him so that he might be able to repeat it which
done he was on the very next morning to bid ruggieri return to the king
forthwith the kings agent was on the alert and no sooner was ruggieri
out of the city than without any manner of difficulty he joined his
company giving out that he was going towards italy as thus they rode
talking of divers matters messer ruggieri being mounted on the mule
given him by the kingmethinks quoth the other it being then hard
upon tierce that twere well to give the beasts a voidance and by and
by being come to a convenient place they voided all the beasts save the
mule then as they continued their journey the squire hearkening
attentively to the knights words they came to a river and while there
they watered the beasts the mule made a voidance in the stream
whereatah foul fall thee beast quoth messer ruggieri that art
even as thy master that gave thee to me which remark as also many
another that fell from ruggieri as they rode together throughout the day
the squire stored in his memory but never another word did he hear
ruggieri say touching the king that was not laudatory to the last
degree
on the morrow when they were gotten to horse and had set their faces
towards tuscany the squire apprised ruggieri of the kings command and
thereupon ruggieri turned back on his arrival the king having already
heard what he had said touching the mule gave him gladsome greeting and
asked him wherefore he had likened him to the mule or rather the mule to
him whereto messer ruggieri answered franklymy lord i likened you
to the mule for that as you bestow your gifts where tis not meet and
where meet it were bestow them not so the mule where twas meet voided
not and where twas not meet voided messer ruggieri replied the
king tis not because i have not discerned in you a knight most good
and true for whose desert no gift were too great that i have not
bestowed on you such gifts as i have bestowed upon many others who in
comparison of you are nothing worth the fault is none of mine but solely
of your fortune which would not suffer me and that this which i say is
true i will make abundantly plain to you my lord returned messer
ruggieri mortified am i not that you gave me no gift for thereof i
had no desire being too rich but that you made no sign of recognition
of my desert however i deem your explanation sound and honourable and
whatever you shall be pleased that i should see that gladly will i
albeit i believe you without attestation
the king then led him into one of the great halls in which by his
preordinance were two chests closed under lock and key and not a few
others being present said to himmesser ruggieri one these chests
contains my crown sceptre and orb with many a fine girdle buckle
ring and whatever else of jewellery i possess the other is full of
earth choose then and whichever you shall choose be it yours thereby
you will discover whether tis due to me or to your fortune that your
deserts have lacked requital such being the kings pleasure messer
ruggieri chose one of the chests which at the kings command being
opened and found to be that which contained the earthnow messer
ruggieri quoth the king with a laugh your own eyes may warrant you of
the truth of what i say touching fortune but verily your merit demands
that i take arms against her in your cause i know that you are not
minded to become a spaniard and therefore i shall give you neither
castle nor city but that chest which fortune denied you i bestow on
you in her despite that you may take it with you to your own country
and there with your neighbours justly vaunt yourself of your deserts
attested by my gifts messer ruggieri took the chest and having thanked
the king in a manner befitting such a gift returned therewith well
pleased to tuscany
novel ii

ghino di tacco captures the abbot of cluny cures him of a disorder of
the stomach and releases him the abbot on his return to the court of
rome reconciles ghino with pope boniface and makes him prior of the
hospital

when an end was made of extolling the magnificence shewn by king alfonso
towards the florentine knight the king who had listened to the story
with no small pleasure bade elisa follow suit and forthwith elisa
begandainty my ladies undeniable it is that for a king to be
magnificent and to entreat magnificently one that has done him service
is a great matter and meet for commendation what then shall we say when
the tale is of a dignitary of the church that shewed wondrous
magnificence towards one whom he might well have entreated as an enemy
and not have been blamed by a soul assuredly nought else than that what
in the king was virtue was in the prelate nothing less than a miracle
seeing that for superlative greed the clergy one and all outdo us
women and wage war to the knife upon every form of liberality and
albeit all men are by nature prone to avenge their wrongs tis notorious
that the clergy however they may preach longsuffering and commend of
all things the forgiving of trespasses are more quick and hot to be
avenged than the rest of mankind now this to wit after what manner a
prelate shewed magnificence will be made manifest to you in my story
ghino di tacco a man redoubtable by reason of his truculence and his
highhanded deeds being banished from siena and at enmity with the
counts of santa fiore raised radicofani in revolt against the church of
rome and there abiding harried all the surrounding country with his
soldiers plundering all wayfarers now pope boniface viii being at
rome there came to court the abbot of cluny who is reputed one of the
wealthiest prelates in the world and having there gotten a disorder of
the stomach he was advised by the physicians to go to the baths of
siena where they averred he would certainly be cured so having
obtained the popes leave reckless of the bruit of ghinos exploits he
took the road being attended by a great and wellequipped train of
sumpterhorses and servants ghino di tacco getting wind of his
approach spread his nets to such purpose as without the loss of so much
as a boy to surround the abbot with all his servants and effects in a
strait pass from which there was no exit which done he sent one of his
men the cunningest of them all with a sufficient retinue to the abbot
who most lovingly on ghinos part besought the abbot to come and visit
ghino at the castle whereto the abbot very wroth made answer that he
would none of it for that nought had he to do with ghino but that he
purposed to continue his journey and would fain see who would hinder
him sir returned the envoy assuming a humble tone you are come to
a part of the country where we have no fear of aught save the might of
god and where excommunications and interdicts are one and all under the
ban wherefore you were best be pleased to shew yourself agreeable to
ghino in this particular as they thus spoke ghinos soldiers shewed
themselves on every side and it being thus manifest to the abbot that he
and his company were taken prisoners he albeit mightily incensed
suffered himself with all his train and effects to be conducted by the
envoy to the castle where the abbot being alighted was lodged in a
small and very dark and discomfortable room while his retinue according
to their several conditions were provided with comfortable quarters in
divers parts of the castle the horses well stabled and all the effects
secured none being in any wise tampered with which done ghino hied him
to the abbot andsir quoth he ghino whose guest you are sends
me to entreat you to be pleased to inform him of your destination and
the purpose of your journey the abbot vailing his pride like a wise
man told whither he was bound and for what purpose whereupon ghino left
him casting about how he might cure him without a bath to which end he
kept a great fire ever burning in the little chamber and had it closely
guarded and returned not to the abbot until the ensuing morning when he
brought him in a spotless napkin two slices of toast and a great beaker
of vernaccia of corniglia being of the abbots own vintage andsir
quoth he to the abbot ghino as a young man made his studies in
medicine and avers that he then learned that there is no better
treatment for disorder of the stomach than that which he will afford you
whereof the matters that i bring you are the beginning wherefore take
them and be of good cheer
the abbot being far too hungry to make many words about the matter ate
albeit in high dudgeon the toast and drank the vernaccia which done
he enlarged on his wrongs in a high tone with much questioning and
perpending and above all he demanded to see ghino part of what the
abbot said ghino disregarded as of no substance to other part he replied
courteously enough and having assured him that ghino would visit him as
soon as might be he took his leave of him nor did he return until the
morrow when he brought him toast and vernaccia in the same quantity as
before and so he kept him several days then having marked that the
abbot had eaten some dried beans that he had secretly brought and left
there of set purpose he asked him in ghinos name how he felt in the
stomach were i but out of ghinos hands replied the abbot i should
feel myself well indeed next to which i desire most of all a good
breakfast so excellent a cure have his medicines wrought on me
whereupon ghino caused the abbots servants to furnish a goodly chamber
with the abbots own effects and there on the morrow make ready a grand
banquet at which all the abbots suite and not a few of the garrison
being assembled he hied him to the abbot andsir quoth he tis
time you left the infirmary seeing that you now feel yourself well and
so saying he took him by the hand and led him into the chamber made
ready for him and having left him there with his own people made it his
chief concern that the banquet should be magnificent the abbots spirits
revived as he found himself again among his men with whom he talked a
while telling them how he had been entreated wherewith they contrasted
the signal honour which they on the other hand had one and all
received from ghino
breakfasttime came and with order meet the abbot and the rest were
regaled with good viands and good wines ghino still suffering not the
abbot to know who he was but when the abbot had thus passed several
days ghino having first had all his effects collected in a saloon and
all his horses to the poorest jade in the courtyard below hied him to
the abbot and asked him how he felt and if he deemed himself strong
enough to ride the abbot replied that he was quite strong enough and
that twould be well indeed with him were he once out of ghinos hands
ghino then led him into the saloon in which were his effects and all his
retinue and having brought him to a window whence he might see all his
horsessir abbot quoth he you must know that tis not for that he
has an evil heart but because being a gentleman he is banished from
his home and reduced to poverty and has not a few powerful enemies
that in defence of his life and honour ghino di tacco whom you see
before you has become a robber of highways and an enemy to the court of
rome but such as i am i have cured you of your malady of the stomach
and taking you to be a worthy lord i purpose not to treat you as i would
another from whom were he in my hands as you are i should take such
part of his goods as i should think fit but i shall leave it to you
upon consideration of my need to assign to me such portion of your goods
as you yourself shall determine here are they before you undiminished
and unimpaired and from this window you may see your horses below in the
courtyard wherefore take the part or take the whole as you may see fit
and be it at your option to tarry here or go hence from this hour
forth
the abbot marvelled to hear a highway robber speak thus liberally and
such was his gratification that his wrath and fierce resentment departed
from him nay were transformed into kindness insomuch that in all
cordial amity he hasted to embrace ghino sayingby god i swear that
to gain the friendship of a man such i now deem thee to be i would be
content to suffer much greater wrong than that which until now meseemed
thou hadst done me cursed be fortune that constrains thee to ply so
censurable a trade which said he selected a very few things and none
superfluous from his ample store and having done likewise with the
horses ceded all else to ghino and hied him back to rome where seeing
him the pope who to his great grief had heard of his capture asked him
what benefit he had gotten from the baths whereto the abbot made answer
with a smileholy father i found nearer here than the baths a worthy
physician who has wrought a most excellent cure on me he then recounted
all the circumstances whereat the pope laughed afterwards still
pursuing the topic the abbot yielding to the promptings of
magnificence asked a favour of the pope who expecting that he would
ask somewhat else than he did liberally promised to give him whatever he
should demand whereuponholy father quoth the abbot that which i
would crave of you is that you restore ghino di tacco my physician to
your favour seeing that among the good men and true and meritorious that
i have known he is by no means of the least account and for the evil
life that he leads i impute it to fortune rather than to him change
then his fortune by giving him the means whereby he may live in manner
befitting his rank and i doubt not that in a little while your judgment
of him will jump with mine whereto the pope being magnanimous and an
admirer of good men and true made answer that so he would gladly do if
ghino should prove to be such as the abbot said and that he would have
him brought under safe conduct to rome thither accordingly under safe
conduct came ghino to the abbots great delight nor had he been long at
court before the pope approved his worth and restored him to his favour
granting him a great office to wit that of prior of the hospital
whereof he made him knight which office he held for the rest of his
life being ever a friend and vassal of holy church and the abbot of
cluny
novel iii

mitridanes holding nathan in despite by reason of his courtesy journeys
with intent to kill him and falling in with him unawares is advised by
him how to compass his end following his advice he finds him in a
copse and recognizing him is shamestricken and becomes his friend

verily like to a miracle seemed it to all to hear that a prelate had done
aught with magnificence but when the ladies had made an end of their
remarks the king bade filostrato follow suit and forthwith filostrato
begannoble ladies great was the magnificence of the king of spain
and perchance a thing unheardof the magnificence of the abbot of cluny
but peradventure twill seem not a whit less marvellous to you to hear of
one who to shew liberality towards another did resolve artfully to
yield to him his blood nay his very life for which the other thirsted
and had so done had the other chosen to take them as i shall shew you
in a little story
beyond all question if we may believe the report of certain genoese and
other folk that have been in those regions there dwelt of yore in the
parts of cathay one nathan a man of noble lineage and incomparable
wealth who having a seat hard by a road by which whoso would travel
from the west eastward or from the east westward must needs pass and
being magnanimous and liberal and zealous to approve himself such in
act did set on work cunning artificers not a few and cause one of the
finest and largest and most luxurious palaces that ever were seen to be
there builded and furnished in the goodliest manner with all things meet
for the reception and honourable entertainment of gentlemen and so
keeping a great array of excellent servants he courteously and
hospitably did the honours of his house to whoso came and went in which
laudable way of life he persevered until not only the east but
wellnigh all the west had heard his fame which thus what time he was
wellstricken in years albeit not for that cause grown weary of shewing
courtesy reached the ears of one mitridanes a young man of a country
not far distant who knowing himself to be no less wealthy than nathan
grew envious of the renown that he had of his good deeds and resolved to
obliterate or at least to obscure it by a yet greater liberality so he
had built for himself a palace like that of nathan of which he did the
honours with a lavish courtesy that none had ever equalled to whoso came
or went that way and verily in a short while he became famous enough
now it so befell that on a day when the young man was all alone in the
courtyard of the palace there came in by one of the gates a poor woman
who asked of him an alms and had it but not content therewith came
again to him by the second gate and asked another alms and had it and
after the like sort did even unto the twelfth time but she returning
for the thirteenth timemy good woman quoth mitridanes thou art
not a little pertinacious in thy begging howbeit he gave her an alms
whereuponah the wondrous liberality of nathan quoth the
beldamthirtytwo gates are there to his palace by every one of which
i have entered and asking alms of him was neverfor aught he
shewedrecognized or refused and here though i have entered as yet by
but thirteen gates i am recognized and reprimanded and therewith she
departed and returned no more mitridanes who accounted the mention of
nathans fame an abatement of his own was kindled by her words with a
frenzy of wrath and began thus to commune with himselfalas when
shall i attain to the grandeur of nathans liberality to say nought of
transcending it as i would fain seeing that in the veriest trifles i
cannot approach him of a surety my labour is in vain if i rid not the
earth of him which since old age relieves me not of him i must
forthwith do with mine own hands and in the flush of his despite up he
started and giving none to know of his purpose got to horse with a
small company and after three days arrived at the place where nathan
abode and having enjoined his comrades to make as if they were none of
his and knew him not and to go quarter themselves as best they might
until they had his further orders he being thus alone towards evening
came upon nathan also alone at no great distance from his splendid
palace nathan was recreating himself by a walk and was very simply
clad so that mitridanes knowing him not asked him if he could shew him
where nathan dwelt my son replied nathan gladsomely that can none
in these parts better than i wherefore so it please thee i will bring
thee thither the young man replied that twould be mighty agreeable to
him but that if so it might be he had a mind to be neither known nor
seen by nathan and herein also returned nathan since tis thy
pleasure i will gratify thee whereupon mitridanes dismounted and with
nathan who soon engaged him in delightsome discourse walked to the
goodly palace arrived there nathan caused one of his servants take the
young mans horse and drawing close to him bade him in a whisper to see
to it without delay that none in the house should tell the young man that
he was nathan and so twas done
being come into the palace nathan quartered mitridanes in a most goodly
chamber where none saw him but those whom he had appointed to wait upon
him and he himself kept him company doing him all possible honour of
whom mitridanes albeit he reverenced him as a father yet being thus
with him forbore not to ask who he was whereto nathan made answeri
am a petty servant of nathan old as i am i have been with him since my
childhood and never has he advanced me to higher office than this
wherein thou seest me wherefore howsoever other folk may praise him
little cause have i to do so which words afforded mitridanes some hope
of carrying his wicked purpose into effect with more of plan and less of
risk than had otherwise been possible by and by nathan very courteously
asked him who he was and what business brought him thither offering him
such counsel and aid as he might be able to afford him mitridanes
hesitated a while to reply but at last he resolved to trust him and
when with no little circumlocution he had demanded of him fidelity
counsel and aid he fully discovered to him who he was and the purpose
and motive of his coming thither now albeit to hear mitridanes thus
unfold his horrid design caused nathan no small inward commotion yet
twas not long before courageously and composedly he thus made
answernoble was thy father mitridanes and thou art minded to shew
thyself not unworthy of him by this lofty emprise of thine to wit of
being liberal to all comers and for that thou art envious of nathans
merit i greatly commend thee for were many envious for a like cause the
world from being a most wretched would soon become a happy place doubt
not that i shall keep secret the design which thou hast confided to me
for the furtherance whereof tis good advice rather than substantial aid
that i have to offer thee which advice is this hence perhaps half a
mile off thou mayst see a copse in which almost every morning nathan is
wont to walk taking his pleasure for quite a long while twill be an
easy matter for thee to find him there and deal with him as thou mayst
be minded now shouldst thou slay him thou wilt get thee home with less
risk of let if thou take not the path by which thou camest hither but
that which thou seest issue from the copse on the left for though tis
somewhat more rough it leads more directly to thy house and will be
safer for thee
possessed of this information mitridanes when nathan had left him
privily apprised his comrades who were likewise lodged in the palace of
the place where they were to await him on the ensuing day which being
come nathan inflexibly determined to act in all respects according to
the advice which he had given mitridanes hied him forth to the copse
unattended to meet his death mitridanes being risen took his bow and
sword for other arms he had none with him mounted his horse and rode
to the copse through which while he was yet some way off he saw nathan
passing quite alone and being minded before he fell upon him to see
his face and hear the sound of his voice as riding at a smart pace he
came up with him he laid hold of him by his headgear
exclaiminggreybeard thou art a dead man whereto nathan answered
nought butthen tis but my desert but mitridanes hearing the
voice and scanning the face forthwith knew him for the same man that
had welcomed him heartily consorted with him familiarly and counselled
him faithfully whereby his wrath presently subsided and gave place to
shame wherefore casting away the sword that he held drawn in act to
strike he sprang from his horse and weeping threw himself at nathans
feet sayingyour liberality dearest father i acknowledge to be
beyond all question seeing with what craft you did plot your coming
hither to yield me your life for which by mine own avowal you knew
that i albeit cause i had none did thirst but god more regardful of
my duty than i myself has now in this moment of supreme stress opened
the eyes of my mind that wretched envy had fast sealed the prompter was
your compliance the greater is the debt of penitence that i owe you for
my fault wherefore wreak even such vengeance upon me as you may deem
answerable to my transgression but nathan raised mitridanes to his
feet and tenderly embraced him sayingmy son thy enterprise
howsoever thou mayst denote it whether evil or otherwise was not such
that thou shouldst crave or i give pardon thereof for twas not in
malice but in that thou wouldst fain have been reputed better than i that
thou ensuedst it doubt then no more of me nay rest assured that none
that lives bears thee such love as i who know the loftiness of thy
spirit bent not to heap up wealth as do the caitiffs but to dispense
in bounty thine accumulated store think it no shame that to enhance thy
reputation thou wouldst have slain me nor deem that i marvel thereat to
slay not one man as thou wast minded but countless multitudes to waste
whole countries with fire and to raze cities to the ground has been
wellnigh the sole art by which the mightiest emperors and the greatest
kings have extended their dominions and by consequence their fame
wherefore if thou to increase thy fame wouldst fain have slain me
twas nothing marvellous or strange but wonted
whereto mitridanes made answer not to excuse his wicked design but to
commend the seemly excuse found for it by nathan whom at length he told
how beyond measure he marvelled that nathan had not only been consenting
to the enterprise but had aided him therein by his counsel but nathan
answeredliefer had i mitridanes that thou didst not marvel either
at my consent or at my counsel for that since i was my own master and
of a mind to that emprise whereon thou art also bent never a soul came
to my house but so far as in me lay i gave him all that he asked of
me thou camest lusting for my life and so when i heard thee crave it
of me i forthwith that thou mightst not be the only guest to depart
hence ill content resolved to give it thee and to that end i gave thee
such counsel as i deemed would serve thee both to the taking of my life
and the preservation of thine own wherefore yet again i bid thee nay i
entreat thee if so thou art minded to take it for thy satisfaction i
know not how i could better bestow it i have had the use of it now for
some eighty years and pleasure and solace thereof and i know that by
the course of nature and the common lot of man and all things mundane it
can continue to be mine for but a little while and so i deem that twere
much better to bestow it as i have ever bestowed and dispensed my
wealth than to keep it until against my will it be reft from me by
nature twere but a trifle though twere a hundred years how
insignificant then the six or eight years that are all i have to give
take it then if thou hadst lief take it i pray thee for long as i
have lived here none have i found but thee to desire it nor know i when
i may find another if thou take it not to demand it of me and if
peradventure i should find one such yet i know that the longer i keep
it the less its worth will be wherefore ere it be thus cheapened take
it i implore thee
sore shamestricken mitridanes made answernow god forefend that i
should so much as harbour as but now i did such a thought not to say
do such a deed as to wrest from you a thing so precious as your life
the years whereof so far from abridging i would gladly supplement with

couldst add thy years to mine and cause me to serve thee as i never yet
served any man to wit to take from thee that which is thine i that

mitridanes by nathans desire returned to the palace where nathan for
some days honourably entreated mitridanes and by his sage counsel
confirmed and encouraged him in his high and noble resolve after which

of nathan fully persuaded that twas not possible to surpass him in
liberality
novel iv

messer gentile de carisendi being come from modena disinters a lady
that he loves who has been buried for dead she being reanimated gives
birth to a male child and messer gentile restores her with her son to
niccoluccio caccianimico her husband

a thing marvellous seemed it to all that for liberality a man should be
ready to sacrifice his own life and herein they averred that nathan had
without doubt left the king of spain and the abbot of cluny behind
however when they had discussed the matter diversely and at large the
king bending his regard on lauretta signified to her his will that she
should tell and forthwith accordingly lauretta begangoodly matters
are they and magnificent that have been recounted to you young ladies
nay so much of our field of discourse is already filled by their
grandeur that for us that are yet to tell there is methinks no room
left unless we seek our topic there where matter of discourse germane to
every theme does most richly abound to wit in the affairs of love for
which cause as also for that our time of life cannot but make us
especially inclinable thereto i am minded that my story shall be of a
feat of magnificence done by a lover which all things considered will
peradventure seem to you inferior to none that have been shewn you so
it be true that to possess the beloved one men will part with their
treasures forget their enmities and jeopardize their own lives their
honour and their reputation in a thousand ways
know then that at bologna that most famous city of lombardy there
dwelt a knight messer gentile carisendi by name worshipful alike for
his noble lineage and his native worth who in his youth being enamoured
of a young gentlewoman named madonna catalina wife of one niccoluccio
caccianimico and wellnigh despairing for that the lady gave him but a
sorry requital of his love betook him to modena being called thither as
podesta now what time he was there niccoluccio being also away from
bologna and his lady gone for that she was with child to lie in at a
house she had some three miles or so from the city it befell that she
was suddenly smitten with a sore malady of such and so virulent a quality
that it left no sign of life in her so that the very physicians
pronounced her dead and for that the women that were nearest of kin to
her professed to have been told by her that she was not so far gone in
pregnancy that the child could be perfectly formed they without more
ado laid her in a tomb in a neighbouring church and after long
lamentation closed it upon her
whereof messer gentile being forthwith apprised by one of his friends
did for all she had been most niggardly to him of her favour grieve not
a little and at length fell a communing with himself on this wiseso
madonna catalina thou art dead while thou livedst never a glance of
thine might i have wherefore now that thou art dead tis but right
that i go take a kiss from thee twas night while he thus mused and
forthwith observing strict secrecy in his departure he got him to horse
with a single servant and halted not until he was come to the place
where the lady was interred and having opened the tomb he cautiously
entered it then having lain down beside her he set his face against
hers and again and again weeping profusely the while he kissed it but
as tis matter of common knowledge that the desires of men and more
especially of lovers know no bounds but crave ever an ampler
satisfaction even so messer gentile albeit he had been minded to tarry
there no longer now said to himselfwherefore touch i not her bosom a
while i have never yet touched it nor shall i ever touch it again
obeying which impulse he laid his hand on her bosom and keeping it
there some time felt as he thought her heart faintly beating
whereupon banishing all fear and examining the body with closer
attention he discovered that life was not extinct though he judged it
but scant and flickering and so aided by his servant he bore her as
gently as he might out of the tomb and set her before him upon his
horse and brought her privily to his house at bologna where dwelt his
wise and worthy mother who being fully apprised by him of the
circumstances took pity on the lady and had a huge fire kindled and a
bath made ready whereby she restored her to life whereof the first sign
she gave was to heave a great sigh and murmuralas where am i to
which the worthy lady made answerbe of good cheer thou art well
lodged by and by the lady coming to herself looked about her and
finding herself she knew not where and seeing messer gentile before her
was filled with wonder and besought his mother to tell her how she came
to be there
messer gentile thereupon told her all sore distressed thereat the lady
after a while thanked him as best she might after which she besought
him by the love that he had borne her and of his courtesy that she
might while she tarried in his house be spared aught that could impair
her honour and her husbands and that at daybreak he would suffer her to
return home madam replied messer gentile however i did affect you
in time past since god in his goodness has by means of the love i bore
you restored you to me alive i mean not now or at any time hereafter
to entreat you either here or elsewhere save as a dear sister but yet
the service i have tonight rendered you merits some guerdon and
therefore lief had i that you deny me not a favour which i shall ask of
you whereto the lady graciously made answer that she would be prompt to
grant it so only it were in her power and consonant with her honour
said then messer gentileyour kinsfolk madam one and all nay all
the folk in bologna are fully persuaded that you are dead there is
therefore none to expect you at home wherefore the favour i crave of you
is this that you will be pleased to tarry privily here with my mother
until such timewhich will be speedilyas i return from modena and
tis for that i purpose to make solemn and joyous donation of you to your
husband in presence of the most honourable folk of this city that i ask
of you this grace mindful of what she owed the knight and witting that
what he craved was seemly the lady albeit she yearned not a little to
gladden her kinsfolk with the sight of her in the flesh consented to do
as messer gentile besought her and thereto pledged him her faith and
scarce had she done so when she felt that the hour of her travail was
come and so tenderly succoured by messer gentiles mother she not long
after gave birth to a fine boy which event did mightily enhance her own
and messer gentiles happiness then having made all meet provision for
her and left word that she was to be tended as if she were his own wife
messer gentile observing strict secrecy returned to modena
his time of office there ended in anticipation of his return to bologna
he appointed for the morning of his arrival in the city a great and
goodly banquet at his house whereto were bidden not a few of the
gentlemen of bologna and among them niccoluccio caccianimico whom when
he was returned and dismounted he found awaiting him as also the lady
fairer and more healthful than ever and her little son doing well and
so with a gladness beyond compare he ranged his guests at table and
regaled them with many a course magnificently served and towards the
close of the feast having premonished the lady of his intention and
concerted with her how she should behave thus he spokegentlemen i
mind me to have once heard tell of as i deem it a delightsome custom
which they have in persia to wit that when one would do his friend
especial honour he bids him to his house and there shews him that
treasure be it wife or mistress or daughter or what not that he
holds most dear assuring him that yet more gladly were it possible he
would shew him his heart which custom i am minded to observe here in
bologna you of your courtesy have honoured my feast with your
presence and i propose to do you honour in the persian fashion by
shewing you that which in all the world i do and must ever hold most
dear but before i do so tell me i pray you how you conceive of a nice
question that i shall lay before you suppose that one has in his house a
good and most faithful servant who falls sick of a grievous disorder
and that the master tarries not for the death of the servant but has him
borne out into the open street and concerns himself no more with him
that then a stranger comes by is moved to pity of the sick man and
takes him to his house and by careful tendance and at no small cost
restores him to his wonted health now i would fain know whether the
first master has in equity any just cause to complain of or be aggrieved
with the second master if he retain the servant in his employ and
refuse to restore him when so required
the gentlemen discussed the matter after divers fashions and all agreed
in one sentence which they committed to niccoluccio caccianimico for
that he was an eloquent and accomplished speaker to deliver on the part
of them all niccoluccio began by commending the persian custom after
which he said that he and the others were all of the same opinion to
wit that the first master had no longer any right in his servant since
he had not only abandoned but cast him forth and that by virtue of the
second masters kind usage of him he must be deemed to have become his
servant wherefore by keeping him he did the first master no mischief
no violence no wrong whereupon the rest that were at the table said
one and all being worthy men that their judgment jumped with
niccoluccios answer the knight well pleased with the answer and that
twas niccoluccio that gave it affirmed that he was of the same opinion
addingtis now time that i shew you that honour which i promised
you he then called two of his servants and sent them to the lady whom
he had caused to be apparelled and adorned with splendour charging them
to pray her to be pleased to come and gladden the gentlemen with her
presence so she bearing in her arms her most lovely little son came
attended by the two servants into the saloon and by the knights
direction took a seat beside a worthy gentleman
whereupongentlemen quoth the knight this is the treasure that i
hold and mean ever to hold more dear than aught else behold and judge
whether i have good cause
the gentlemen said not a little in her honour and praise averring that
the knight ought indeed to hold her dear then as they regarded her more
attentively there were not a few that would have pronounced her to be
the very woman that she was had they not believed that woman to be dead
but none scanned her so closely as niccoluccio who the knight being
withdrawn a little space could no longer refrain his eager desire to
know who she might be but asked her whether she were of bologna or from
other parts the lady hearing her husbands voice could scarce forbear
to answer but yet not to disconcert the knights plan she kept
silence another asked her if that was her little boy and yet another
if she were messer gentiles wife or in any other wise his connection
to none of whom she vouchsafed an answer then messer gentile coming
upsir quoth one of the guests this treasure of yours is goodly
indeed but she seems to be dumb is she so gentlemen quoth messer
gentile that she has not as yet spoken is no small evidence of her
virtue then tell us you who she is returned the other that
quoth the knight will i right gladly so you but promise me that no
matter what i may say none of you will stir from his place until i have
ended my story all gave the required promise and when the tables had
been cleared messer gentile being seated beside the lady thus
spokegentlemen this lady is that loyal and faithful servant
touching whom a brief while ago i propounded to you my question whom her
own folk held none too dear but cast out into the open street as a thing
vile and no longer good for aught but i took thence and by my careful
tendance wrested from the clutch of death whom god regardful of my good
will has changed from the appalling aspect of a corpse to the thing of
beauty that you see before you but for your fuller understanding of this
occurrence i will briefly explain it to you he then recounted to them
in detail all that had happened from his first becoming enamoured of the
lady to that very hour whereto they hearkened with no small wonder after
whichand so he added unless you and more especially niccoluccio
are now of another opinion than you were a brief while ago the lady
rightly belongs to me nor can any man lawfully reclaim her of me
none answered for all were intent to hear what more he would say but
while niccoluccio and some others that were there wept for sympathy
messer gentile stood up and took the little boy in his arms and the lady
by the hand and approached niccoluccio sayingrise my gossip i do
not indeed restore thee thy wife whom thy kinsfolk and hers cast
forth but i am minded to give thee this lady my gossip with this her
little boy whom i know well to be thy son and whom i held at the font
and named gentile and i pray thee that she be not the less dear to thee
for that she has tarried three months in my house for i swear to thee by
that god who peradventure ordained that i should be enamoured of her
to the end that my love might be as it has been the occasion of her
restoration to life that never with her father or her mother or with
thee did she live more virtuously than with my mother in my house
which said he turned to the lady sayingmadam i now release you
from all promises made to me and so deliver you to niccoluccio then
leaving the lady and the child in niccoluccios embrace he returned to
his seat
thus to receive his wife and son was to niccoluccio a delight great in
the measure of its remoteness from his hope wherefore in the most
honourable terms at his command he thanked the knight whom all the rest
weeping for sympathy greatly commended for what he had done as did also
all that heard thereof the lady welcomed home with wondrous cheer was
long a portent to the bolognese who gazed on her as on one raised from
the dead messer gentile lived ever after as the friend of niccoluccio
and his and the ladys kinsfolk
now what shall be your verdict gracious ladies a kings largess though
it was of his sceptre and crown an abbots reconciliation at no cost to
himself of a malefactor with the pope or an old mans submission of his
throat to the knife of his enemywill you adjudge that such acts as
these are comparable to the deed of messer gentile who though young
and burning with passion and deeming himself justly entitled to that
which the heedlessness of another had discarded and he by good fortune
had recovered not only tempered his ardour with honour but having that
which with his whole soul he had long been bent on wresting from another
did with liberality restore it assuredly none of the feats aforesaid
seem to me like unto this
novel v

madonna dianora craves of messer ansaldo a garden that shall be as fair
in january as in may messer ansaldo binds himself to a necromancer and
thereby gives her the garden her husband gives her leave to do messer
ansaldos pleasure he being apprised of her husbands liberality
releases her from her promise and the necromancer releases messer
ansaldo from his bond and will take nought of his

each of the gay company had with superlative commendation extolled messer
gentile to the skies when the king bade emilia follow suit and with a
good courage as burning to speak thus emilia begandelicate my
ladies none can justly say that twas not magnificently done of messer
gentile but if it be alleged that twas the last degree of magnificence
twill perchance not be difficult to shew that more was possible as is
my purpose in the little story that i shall tell you
in friuli a country which though its air is shrewd is pleasantly
diversified by fine mountains and not a few rivers and clear fountains
is a city called udine where dwelt of yore a fair and noble lady
madonna dianora by name wife of a wealthy grandee named giliberto a
very pleasant gentleman and debonair now this lady for her high
qualities was in the last degree beloved by a great and noble baron
messer ansaldo gradense by name a man of no little consequence and
whose fame for feats of arms and courtesy was spread far and wide but
though with all a lovers ardour he left nought undone that he might do
to win her love and to that end frequently plied her with his
ambassages twas all in vain and the lady being distressed by his
importunity and that refuse as she might all that he asked of her he
none the less continued to love her and press his suit upon her
bethought her how she might rid herself of him by requiring of him an
extraordinary and as she deemed impossible feat so one day a woman
that came oftentimes from him to her being with hergood woman quoth
she thou hast many a time affirmed that messer ansaldo loves me above
all else and thou hast made proffer to me on his part of wondrous rich
gifts which i am minded he keep to himself for that i could never bring
myself to love him or pleasure him for their sake but if i might be
certified that he loves me as much as thou sayst then without a doubt i
should not fail to love him and do his pleasure wherefore so he give
me the assurance that i shall require i shall be at his command what
is it madam returned the good woman that you would have him do
this replied the lady i would have this next ensuing january hard
by this city a garden full of green grass and flowers and flowering
trees just as if it were may and if he cannot provide me with this
garden bid him never again send either thee or any other to me for
that should he harass me any further i shall no longer keep silence as
i have hitherto done but shall make my complaint to my husband and all
my kinsmen and it shall go hard but i will be quit of him
the gentleman being apprised of his ladys stipulation and promise
notwithstanding that he deemed it no easy matter nay a thing almost
impossible to satisfy her and knew besides that twas but to deprive
him of all hope that she made the demand did nevertheless resolve to do
his endeavour to comply with it and causing search to be made in divers
parts of the world if any he might find to afford him counsel or aid he
lit upon one who for a substantial reward offered to do the thing by
necromancy so messer ansaldo having struck the bargain with him for an
exceeding great sum of money gleefully expected the appointed time
which being come with extreme cold insomuch that there was nought but
snow and ice the adept on the night before the calends of january
wrought with his spells to such purpose that on the morrow as was
averred by eyewitnesses there appeared in a meadow hard by the city one
of the most beautiful gardens that was ever seen with no lack of grass
and trees and fruits of all sorts at sight whereof messer ansaldo was
overjoyed and caused some of the finest fruits and flowers that it
contained to be gathered and privily presented to his lady whom he bade
come and see the garden that she had craved that thereby she might have
assurance of his love and mind her of the promise that she had given him
and confirmed with an oath and as a loyal lady take thought for its
performance when she saw the flowers and fruits the lady who had
already heard not a few folk speak of the wondrous garden began to
repent her of her promise but for all that being fond of strange
sights she hied her with many other ladies of the city to see the
garden and having gazed on it with wonderment and commended it not a
little she went home the saddest woman alive bethinking her to what it
bound her and so great was her distress that she might not well conceal
it but being written on her face twas marked by her husband who was
minded by all means to know the cause thereof
the lady long time kept silence but at last she yielded to his urgency
and discovered to him the whole matter from first to last whereat
giliberto was at first very wroth but on second thoughts considering
the purity of the ladys purpose he was better advised and dismissing
his angerdianora quoth he tis not the act of a discreet or
virtuous lady to give ear to messages of such a sort nor to enter into
any compact touching her chastity with any man on any terms words that
the ears convey to the heart have a potency greater than is commonly
supposed and there is scarce aught that lovers will not find possible
twas then ill done of thee in the first instance to hearken as
afterwards to make the compact but for that i know the purity of thy
soul that thou mayst be quit of thy promise i will grant thee that
which perchance no other man would grant being also swayed thereto by
fear of the necromancer whom messer ansaldo shouldst thou play him
false might peradventure cause to do us a mischief i am minded then
that thou go to him and contrive if on any wise thou canst to get thee
quit of this promise without loss of virtue but if otherwise it may not
be then for the nonce thou mayst yield him thy body but not thy soul
whereat the lady weeping would none of such a favour at her husbands
hands but giliberto for all the ladys protestations was minded that
so it should be
accordingly on the morrow about dawn apparelled none too ornately
preceded by two servants and followed by a chambermaid the lady hied her
to messer ansaldos house apprised that his lady was come to see him
messer ansaldo marvelling not a little rose and having called the
necromanceri am minded quoth he that thou see what goodly gain i
have gotten by thine art and the twain having met the lady ansaldo
gave way to no unruly appetite but received her with a seemly obeisance
and then the three repaired to a goodly chamber where there was a great
fire and having caused the lady to be seated thus spoke
ansaldomadam if the love that i have so long borne you merit any
guerdon i pray you that it be not grievous to you to discover to me the
true occasion of your coming to me at this hour and thus accompanied
shamefast and the tears all but standing in her eyes the lady made
answersir tis neither love that i bear you nor pledged you that
brings me hither but the command of my husband who regarding rather
the pains you have had of your unbridled passion than his own or my
honour has sent me hither and for that he commands it i for the
nonce am entirely at your pleasure
if messer ansaldo had marvelled to hear of the ladys coming he now
marvelled much more and touched by gilibertos liberality and passing
from passion to compassionnow god forbid madam quoth he that
it being as you say i should wound the honour of him that has compassion
on my love wherefore no otherwise than as if you were my sister shall
you abide here while you are so minded and be free to depart at your
pleasure nor crave i aught of you but that you shall convey from me to
your husband such thanks as you shall deem meet for courtesy such as his
has been and entreat me ever henceforth as your brother and servant
whereat overjoyed in the last degreenought quoth the lady by what
i noted of your behaviour could ever have caused me to anticipate other
sequel of my coming hither than this which i see is your will and for
which i shall ever be your debtor she then took her leave and
attended by a guard of honour returned to giliberto and told him what
had passed between whom and messer ansaldo there was thenceforth a most
close and loyal friendship
now the liberality shewn by giliberto towards messer ansaldo and by
messer ansaldo towards the lady having been marked by the necromancer
when messer ansaldo made ready to give him the promised rewardnow god
forbid quoth he that as i have seen giliberto liberal in regard of
his honour and you liberal in regard of your love i be not in like
manner liberal in regard of my reward which accordingly witting that
tis in good hands i am minded that you keep the knight was abashed
and strove hard to induce him to take if not the whole at least a part
of the money but finding that his labour was in vain and that the
necromancer having caused his garden to vanish after the third day was
minded to depart he bade him adieu and the carnal love he had borne the
lady being spent he burned for her thereafter with a flame of honourable
affection now what shall be our verdict in this case lovesome ladies a
lady as it were dead and a love grown lukewarm for utter hopelessness
shall we set a liberality shewn in such a case above this liberality of
messer ansaldo loving yet as ardently and hoping perchance yet more
ardently than ever and holding in his hands the prize that he had so
long pursued folly indeed should i deem it to compare that liberality
with this
novel vi

king charles the old being conqueror falls in love with a young maiden
and afterward growing ashamed of his folly bestows her and her sister
honourably in marriage

who might fully recount with what diversity of argument the ladies
debated which of the three giliberto or messer ansaldo or the
necromancer behaved with the most liberality in the affair of madonna
dianora too long were it to tell however when the king had allowed
them to dispute a while he with a glance at fiammetta bade her rescue
them from their wrangling by telling her story fiammetta made no demur
but thus beganillustrious my ladies i have ever been of opinion that
in companies like ours one should speak so explicitly that the import of
what is said should never by excessive circumscription afford matter for
disputation which is much more in place among students in the schools
than among us whose powers are scarce adequate to the management of the
distaff and the spindle wherefore i that had in mind a matter of
perchance some nicety now that i see you all at variance touching the
matters last mooted am minded to lay it aside and tell you somewhat
else which concerns a man by no means of slight account but a valiant
king being a chivalrous action that he did albeit in no wise thereto
actuated by his honour
there is none of you but may not seldom have heard tell of king charles
the old or the first by whose magnificent emprise and the ensuing
victory gained over king manfred the ghibellines were driven forth of
florence and the guelfs returned thither for which cause a knight
messer neri degli uberti by name departing florence with his household
and not a little money resolved to fix his abode under no other sway
than that of king charles and being fain of a lonely place in which to
end his days in peace he betook him to castello da mare di stabia and
there perchance a crossbowshot from the other houses of the place
amid the olives and hazels and chestnuts that abound in those parts he
bought an estate on which he built a goodly house and commodious with a
pleasant garden beside it in the midst of which having no lack of
running water he set after our florentine fashion a pond fair and
clear and speedily filled it with fish and while thus he lived daily
occupying himself with nought else but how to make his garden more fair
it befell that king charles in the hot season betook him to castello da
mare to refresh himself a while and hearing of the beauty of messer
neris garden was desirous to view it and having learned to whom it
belonged he bethought him that as the knight was an adherent of the
party opposed to him he would use more familiarity towards him than he
would otherwise have done and so he sent him word that he and four
comrades would sup privily with him in his garden on the ensuing evening
messer neri felt himself much honoured and having made his preparations
with magnificence and arranged the order of the ceremonies with his
household did all he could and knew to make the king cordially welcome
to his fair garden
when the king had viewed the garden throughout as also messer neris
house and commended them he washed and seated himself at one of the
tables which were set beside the pond and bade count guy de montfort
who was one of his companions sit on one side of him and messer neri on
the other and the other three to serve as they should be directed by
messer neri the dishes that were set before them were dainty the wines
excellent and rare the order of the repast very fair and commendable
without the least noise or aught else that might distress whereon the
king bestowed no stinted praise as thus he gaily supped wellpleased
with the lovely spot there came into the garden two young maidens each
perhaps fifteen years old blonde both their golden tresses falling all
in ringlets about them and crowned with a dainty garland of
periwinkleflowers and so delicate and fair of face were they that they
shewed liker to angels than aught else each clad in a robe of finest
linen white as snow upon their flesh closefitting as might be from the
waist up but below the waist ample like a pavilion to the feet she
that was foremost bore on her shoulders a pair of nets which she held
with her left hand carrying in her right a long pole her companion
followed bearing on her left shoulder a fryingpan under her left arm a
bundle of faggots and in her left hand a tripod while in the other hand
she carried a cruse of oil and a lighted taper at sight of whom the king
marvelled and gazed intent to learn what it might import the two young
maidens came forward with becoming modesty and did obeisance to the
king which done they hied them to the place of ingress to the pond and
she that had the fryingpan having set it down and afterward the other
things took the pole that the other carried and so they both went down
into the pond being covered by its waters to their breasts whereupon
one of messer neris servants having forthwith lit a fire and set the
tripod on the faggots and oil therein addressed himself to wait until
some fish should be thrown to him by the girls who the one searching
with the pole in those parts where she knew the fish lay hid while the
other made ready the nets did in a brief space of time to the exceeding
great delight of the king who watched them attentively catch fish not a
few which they tossed to the servant who set them before the life was
well out of them in the fryingpan after which the maidens as
prearranged addressed them to catch some of the finest fish and cast
them on to the table before the king and count guy and their father
the fish wriggled about the table to the prodigious delight of the king
who in like manner took some of them and courteously returned them to
the girls with which sport they diverted them until the servant had
cooked the fish that had been given him which by messer neris command
were set before the king rather as a sidedish than as aught very rare or
delicious
when the girls saw that all the fish were cooked and that there was no
occasion for them to catch any more they came forth of the pond their
fine white garments cleaving everywhere close to their flesh so as to
hide scarce any part of their delicate persons took up again the things
that they had brought and passing modestly before the king returned to
the house the king and the count and the other gentlemen that waited
had regarded the maidens with no little attention and had one and all
inly bestowed on them no little praise as being fair and shapely and
therewithal sweet and debonair but twas in the kings eyes that they
especially found favour indeed as they came forth of the water the
king had scanned each part of their bodies so intently that had one then
pricked him he would not have felt it and his thoughts afterwards
dwelling upon them though he knew not who they were nor how they came
to be there he felt stir within his heart a most ardent desire to
pleasure them whereby he knew very well that if he took not care he
would grow enamoured howbeit he knew not whether of the twain pleased
him the more so like was each to the other having thus brooded a while
he turned to messer neri and asked who the two damsels were
wheretosire replied messer neri they are my twin daughters and
they are called the one ginevra the fair and the other isotta the
blonde whereupon the king was loud in praise of them and exhorted
messer neri to bestow them in marriage to which messer neri demurred
for that he no longer had the means and nought of the supper now
remaining to serve save the fruit in came the two young damsels in
gowns of taffeta very fine bearing in their hands two vast silver
salvers full of divers fruits such as the season yielded and set them
on the table before the king which done they withdrew a little space
and fell a singing to music a ditty of which the opening words were as
follows
  love many words would not suffice
  there where i am come to tell
and so dulcet and delightsome was the strain that to the king his eyes
and ears alike charmed it seemed as if all the nine orders of angels
were descended there to sing the song ended they knelt and respectfully
craved the kings leave to depart which though sorely against his will
he gave them with a forced gaiety
supper ended the king and his companions having remounted their horses
took leave of messer neri and conversing of divers matters returned to
the royal quarters where the king still harbouring his secret passion
nor despite affairs of state that supervened being able to forget the
beauty and sweetness of ginevra the fair for whose sake he likewise
loved her twin sister was so limed by love that he could scarce think of
aught else so feigning other reasons he consorted familiarly with
messer neri and did much frequent his garden that he might see ginevra
and at length being unable to endure his suffering any longer and being
minded for that he could devise no other expedient to despoil their
father not only of the one but of the other damsel also he discovered
both his love and his project to count guy who being a good man and
true thus made answersire your tale causes me not a little
astonishment and that more especially because of your conversation from
your childhood to this very day i have methinks known more than any
other man and as no such passion did i ever mark in you even in your
youth when love should more readily have fixed you with his fangs as
now i discern when you are already on the verge of old age tis to me
so strange so surprising that you should veritably love that i deem it
little short of a miracle and were it meet for me to reprove you well
wot i the language i should hold to you considering that you are yet in
arms in a realm but lately won among a people as yet unknown to you and
wily and treacherous in the extreme and that the gravest anxieties and
matters of high policy engross your mind so that you are not as yet able
to sit you down and nevertheless amid all these weighty concerns you
have given harbourage to false flattering love this is not the wisdom
of a great king but the folly of a featherpated boy and moreover what
is far worse you say that you are resolved to despoil this poor knight
of his two daughters whom entertaining you in his house and honouring
you to the best of his power he brought into your presence all but
naked testifying thereby how great is his faith in you and how assured
he is that you are a king and not a devouring wolf have you so soon
forgotten that twas manfreds outrageous usage of his subjects that
opened you the way into this realm what treachery was he ever guilty of
that better merited eternal torment than twould be in you to wrest from
one that honourably entreats you at once his hope and his consolation
what would be said of you if so you should do perchance you deem that
twould suffice to sayi did it because he is a ghibelline is it
then consistent with the justice of a king that those be they who they
may who seek his protection as this man has sought yours should be
entreated after this sort king i bid you remember that exceeding great
as is your glory to have vanquished manfred yet to conquer oneself is a
still greater glory wherefore you to whom belongs the correction of
others see to it that you conquer yourself and refrain this unruly
passion and let not such a blot mar the splendour of your achievements
sore stricken at heart by the counts words and the more mortified that
he acknowledged their truth the king heaved a fervent sigh or two and
thencount quoth he that enemy there is none however mighty but
to the practised warrior is weak enough and easy to conquer in comparison
of his own appetite i make no doubt but great though the struggle will
be and immeasurable the force that it demands so shrewdly galled am i by
your words that not many days will have gone by before i shall without
fail have done enough to shew you that i that am the conqueror of
others am no less able to gain the victory over myself and indeed but
a few days thereafter the king on his return to naples being minded at
once to leave himself no excuse for dishonourable conduct and to
recompense the knight for his honourable entreatment of him did albeit
twas hard for him to endow another with that which he had most ardently
desired for himself none the less resolve to bestow the two damsels in
marriage and that not as messer neris daughters but as his own
wherefore messer neri consenting he provided both with magnificent
dowries and gave ginevra the fair to messer maffeo da palizzi and
isotta the blonde to messer guglielmo della magna noble knights and
great barons both which done sad at heart beyond measure he betook him
to apulia and by incessant travail did so mortify his vehement appetite
that he snapped and broke in pieces the fetters of love and for the rest
of his days was no more vexed by such passion
perchance there will be those who say that tis but a trifle for a king
to bestow two girls in marriage nor shall i dispute it but say we that
a king in love bestowed in marriage her whom he loved neither having
taken nor taking of his love leaf or flower or fruit then this i say
was a feat great indeed nay as great as might be
after such a sort then did this magnificent king at once generously
rewarding the noble knight commendably honouring the damsels that he
loved and stoutly subduing himself
novel vii

king pedro being apprised of the fervent love borne him by lisa who
thereof is sick comforts her and forthwith gives her in marriage to a
young gentleman and having kissed her on the brow ever after professes
himself her knight

when fiammetta was come to the end of her story and not a little praise
had been accorded to the virile magnificence of king charles albeit one
there was of the ladies who being a ghibelline joined not therein
pampinea having received the kings command thus begannone is there
of discernment worshipful my ladies that would say otherwise than you
have said touching good king charles unless for some other cause she
bear him a grudge however for that there comes to my mind the
perchance no less honourable entreatment of one of our florentine girls
by one of his adversaries i am minded to recount the same to you
what time the french were driven forth of sicily there dwelt at palermo
one of our florentines that was an apothecary bernardo puccini by name
a man of great wealth that by his lady had an only and exceeding fair
daughter then of marriageable age now king pedro of arragon being
instated in the sovereignty of the island did at palermo make with his
barons marvellous celebration thereof during which as he tilted after
the catalan fashion it befell that bernardos daughter lisa by name
being with other ladies at a window did thence espy him in the course
whereat being prodigiously delighted she regarded him again and again
and grew fervently enamoured of him nor yet when the festivities were
ended and she was at home with her father was there aught she could
think of but this her exalted and aspiring love in regard whereof that
which most irked her was her sense of her low rank which scarce
permitted her any hope of a happy issue but for all that give over her
love for the king she would not nor yet for fear of worse to come
dared she discover it the king meanwhile recking witting nothing of
the matter her suffering waxed immeasurable intolerable and her love
ever growing with ever fresh accessions of melancholy the fair maiden
overborne at last fell sick and visibly day by day wasted like snow in
sunlight distraught with grief thereat her father and mother afforded
her such succour as they might with words of good cheer and counsel of
physicians and physic but all to no purpose for that she in despair of
her love was resolved no more to live
now her father assuring her that there was no whim of hers but should be
gratified the fancy took her that if she might find apt means she
would before she died make her love and her resolve known to the king
wherefore one day she besought her father to cause minuccio darezzo to
come to her which minuccio was a singer and musician of those days
reputed most skilful and well seen of king pedro bernardo deeming that
lisa desired but to hear him play and sing a while conveyed her message
to him and he being an agreeable fellow came to her forthwith and
after giving her some words of loving cheer sweetly discoursed some airs
upon his viol and then sang her some songs whereby while he thought to
comfort her he did but add fire and flame to her love presently the
girl said that she would fain say a few words to him in private and when
all else were withdrawn from the chamberminuccio quoth she thee
have i chosen deeming thee most trusty to be the keeper of my secret
relying upon thee in the first place never to betray it to a soul and
next to lend me in regard thereof such aid as thou mayst be able and so
i pray thee to do thou must know then minuccio mine that on the day
when our lord king pedro held the great festival in celebration of his
triumph i seeing him tilt was so smitten with love of him that thereof
was kindled within my soul the fire which has brought me as thou seest
to this pass and knowing how ill it beseems me to love a king and being
unable i say not to banish it from my heart but so much as to bring it
within bounds and finding it exceeding grievous to bear i have made
choice of death as the lesser pain and die i shall but should he wot
not of my love before i die sore disconsolate should i depart and
knowing not by whom more aptly than by thee i might give him to know this
my frame i am minded to entrust the communication thereof to thee which
office i entreat thee not to refuse and having discharged it to let me
know that dying thus consoled i may depart this pain which said she
silently wept
marvelling at the loftiness of the girls spirit and her desperate
determination minuccio commiserated her not a little and presently it
occurred to him that there was a way in which he might honourably serve
her whereforelisa quoth he my faith i plight thee wherein thou
mayst place sure confidence that i shall never play thee false and
lauding thy high emprise to wit the setting thine affections upon so
great a king i proffer thee mine aid whereby so thou wilt be of good
cheer i hope and believe that before thou shalt see the third day
from now go by i shall have brought thee tidings which will be to thee
for an exceeding great joy and not to lose time i will set to work at
once and so lisa assuring him that she would be of good cheer and
plying him afresh with instant obsecrations bade him godspeed and
minuccio having taken leave of her hied him to one mico da siena a
very expert rhymester of those days who at his instant request made the
ensuing song
hence hie thee love and hasting to my king
  give him to know what torment dire i bear
  how that to death i fare
  still close for fear my passion harbouring
lo love to thee with clasped hands i turn
  and pray thee seek him where he tarrieth
  and tell him how i oft for him do yearn
  so sweetly he my heart enamoureth
  and of the fire wherewith i throughly burn
  i think to die but may the hour uneath
  say when my grievous pain shall with my breath
  surcease till when neither may fear nor shame
  the least abate the flame
  ah to his ears my woeful story bring
since of him i was first enamoured
  never hast thou o love my fearful heart
  with any such fond hope encouraged
  as eer its message to him to impart
  to him my lord that me so sore bested
  holds dying thus twere grievous to depart
  perchance were he to know my cruel smart
  twould not displease him might i but make bold
  my soul to him to unfold
  and shew him all my woeful languishing
love since twas not thy will me to accord
  such boldness as that eer unto my king
  i may discover my sad hearts full hoard
  or any word or sign thereof him bring
  this all my prayer to thee o sweet my lord
  hie thee to him and so him whispering
  mind of the day i saw him tourneying
  with all his paladins environed
  and grew enamoured
  evn to my very hearts disrupturing
which words minuccio forthwith set to music after a soft and plaintive
fashion befitting their sense and on the third day thereafter hied him
to court while king pedro was yet at breakfast and being bidden by the
king to sing something to the accompaniment of his viol he gave them
this song with such sweet concord of words and music that all the folk
that were in the kings hall seemed as it were entranced so intent and
absorbed stood they to listen and the king rather more than the rest
and when minuccio had done singing the king asked whence the song came
that as far as he knew he had never heard it before sire replied
minuccio tis not yet three days since twas made words and music
alike and being asked by the king in regard of whom twas madei
dare not quoth he discover such a secret save to you alone bent on
hearing the story the king when the tables were cleared took minuccio
into his privy chamber and there minuccio told him everything exactly as
he had heard it from lisas lips whereby the king was much gratified
and lauded the maiden not a little and said that a girl of such high
spirit merited considerate treatment and bade minuccio be his envoy to
her and comfort her and tell her that without fail that very day at
vespers he would come to visit her overjoyed to bear the girl such
gladsome tidings minuccio tarried not but hied him back to the girl
with his viol and being closeted with her told her all that had passed
and then sang the song to the accompaniment of his viol whereby the girl
was so cheered and delighted that forthwith there appeared most marked
and manifest signs of the amendment of her health while with passionate
longing albeit none in the house knew or divined it she awaited the
vesper hour when she was to see her lord
knowing the girl very well and how fair she was and pondering divers
times on what minuccio had told him the king being a prince of a
liberal and kindly disposition grew ever more compassionate so about
vespers he mounted his horse and rode forth as if for mere pleasure
and being come to the apothecarys house demanded access to a very
goodly garden that the apothecary had and having dismounted after a
while enquired of bernardo touching his daughter and whether he had yet
bestowed her in marriage sire replied bernardo she is not yet
married and indeed she has been and still is very ill howbeit since none
she is wonderfully amended the significance of which amendment being
forthwith apprehended by the kingin good faith quoth he twere a
pity so fair a creature were reft from the world so early we would go in
and visit her and presently attended only by two of his lords and
bernardo he betook him to her chamber where being entered he drew nigh
the bed whereon the girl half reclined half sate in eager expectation
of his coming and taking her by the handmadonna quoth he what
means this a maiden like you should be the comfort of others and you
suffer yourself to languish we would entreat you that for love of us you
be of good cheer so as speedily to recover your health to feel the
touch of his hand whom she loved above all else the girl albeit
somewhat shamefast was so enraptured that twas as if she was in
paradise and as soon as she was ablemy lord she said twas the
endeavour weak as i am to sustain a most grievous burden that brought
this sickness upon me but twill not be long ere you will see me quit
thereof thanks to your courtesy the hidden meaning of which words was
apprehended only by the king who momently made more account of the girl
and again and again inly cursed fortune that had decreed that she should
be the daughter of such a man and yet a while he tarried with her and
comforted her and so took his leave which gracious behaviour of the
king was not a little commended and accounted a signal honour to the
apothecary and his daughter
the girl glad at heart as was ever lady of her lover mended with
reviving hope and in a few days recovered her health and therewith more
than all her wonted beauty whereupon the king having taken counsel with
the queen how to reward so great a love got him one day to horse with a
great company of his barons and hied him to the apothecarys house and
being come into the garden he sent for the apothecary and his daughter
and there being joined by the queen with not a few ladies who received
the girl into their company they made such cheer as twas a wonder to
see and after a while the king and queen having called lisa to them
quoth the kinghonourable damsel by the great love that you have
borne us we are moved greatly to honour you and we trust that for love
of us the honour that we design for you will be acceptable to you now
tis thus we would honour you to wit that seeing that you are of
marriageable age we would have you take for husband him that we shall
give you albeit tis none the less our purpose ever to call ourself your
knight demanding no other tribute of all your love but one sole kiss
scarlet from brow to neck the girl making the kings pleasure her own
thus with a low voice repliedmy lord very sure am i that should it
come to be known that i was grown enamoured of you most folk would hold
me for a fool deeming perchance that i was out of my mind and witless
alike of my own rank and yours but god who alone reads the hearts of us
mortals knows that even then when first i did affect you i wist that
you were the king and i but the daughter of bernardo the apothecary and
that to suffer my passion to soar so high did ill become me but as you
know far better than i none loves of set and discreet purpose but only
according to the dictates of impulse and fancy which law my forces
albeit not seldom opposed being powerless to withstand i loved and
still love and shall ever love you but as no sooner knew i myself
subjugated to your love than i vowed to have ever no will but yours
therefore not only am i compliant to take right gladly him whom you shall
be pleased to give me for husband thereby conferring upon me great
honour and dignity but if you should bid me tarry in the fire delighted
were i to obey so thereby i might pleasure you how far it beseems me to
have you my king for my knight you best know and therefore i say
nought thereof nor will the kiss which you crave as your sole tribute of
my love be granted you save by leave of my lady the queen natheless may
you have of this great graciousness that you and my lady the queen have
shewn me and which i may not requite abundant recompense in the
blessing and favour of god and so she was silent
the queen was mightily delighted with the girls answer and deemed her
as discreet as the king had said the king then sent for the girls
father and mother and being assured that his intention had their
approval summoned to his presence a young man perdicone by name that
was of gentle birth but in poor circumstances and put certain rings
into his hand and he nowise gainsaying wedded him to lisa which done
besides jewels many and precious that he and the queen gave the girl he
forthwith bestowed upon perdicone two domains right goodly and of ample
revenues to wit ceffalu and calatabellotta sayingwe give them to
thee for thy wifes dowry what we have in store for thee thou wilt learn
hereafter which said he turned to the girl andnow quoth he we
are minded to cull that fruit which is due to us of thy love and so
taking her head between both his hands he kissed her brow wherefore
great was the joy of perdicone and the father and mother of lisa and
lisa herself and mighty the cheer they made and gaily did they
celebrate the nuptials and as many affirm right well did the king keep
his promise to the girl for that ever while he lived he called himself
her knight nor went to any passage of arms bearing other device than
that which he had from her
now tis by doing after this sort that sovereigns win the hearts of their
subjects give others occasion of welldoing and gain for themselves an
imperishable renown at which mark few or none in our times have bent the
bow of their understanding the more part of the princes having become
but cruel tyrants
novel viii

sophronia albeit she deems herself wife to gisippus is wife to titus
quintius fulvus and goes with him to rome where gisippus arrives in
indigence and deeming himself scorned by titus to compass his own
death avers that he has slain a man titus recognizes him and to save
his life alleges that twas he that slew the man whereof he that did
the deed being witness he discovers himself as the murderer whereby it
comes to pass that they are all three liberated by octavianus and titus
gives gisippus his sister to wife and shares with him all his substance

so ceased pampinea and when all the ladies and most of all the
ghibelline had commended king pedro filomena by command of the king
thus beganmagnificent my ladies who wots not that there is nought so
great but kings when they have a mind may accomplish it as also that
tis of them that magnificence is most especially demanded now whoso
being powerful does that which it appertains to him to do does well
but therein is no such matter of marvel or occasion of extolling him to
the skies as in his deed of whom for that his power is slight less is
demanded wherefore as you are so profuse of your words in exaltation of
the fine deeds as you deem them of monarchs i make no manner of doubt
but that the doings of our peers must seem to you yet more delectable and
commendable when they equal or surpass those of kings accordingly tis
a transaction laudable and magnificent that passed between two
citizens who were friends that i purpose to recount to you in my story
i say then that what time octavianus caesar not as yet hight augustus
but being in the office called triumvirate swayed the empire of rome
there dwelt at rome a gentleman publius quintius fulvus by name who
having a son titus quintius fulvus that was a very prodigy of wit sent
him to athens to study philosophy and to the best of his power commended
him to a nobleman of that city chremes by name who was his very old
friend chremes lodged titus in his own house with his son gisippus and
placed both titus and gisippus under a philosopher named aristippus to
learn of him his doctrine and the two youths thus keeping together
found each the others conversation so congruous with his own that there
grew up between them a friendship so close and brotherly that twas never
broken by aught but death nor knew either rest or solace save when he
was with the other so gifted alike with preeminent subtlety of wit
they entered on their studies and with even pace and prodigious applause
scaled together the glorious heights of philosophy in which way of life
to the exceeding great delight of chremes who entreated titus as no less
his son than gisippus they continued for full three years at the end
whereof it befell after the common course of things mundane that
chremes being now aged departed this life whom with equal grief they
mourned as a common father and the friends and kinsfolk of chremes were
alike at a loss to determine whether of the twain stood in need of the
more consolation upon the bereavement
some months afterward the friends and kinsfolk of gisippus came to him
and exhorted him as did also titus to take a wife and found him a
maiden wondrous fair of one of the most noble houses of athens her
name sophronia and her age about fifteen years so a time was appointed
for their nuptials and one day when twas near at hand gisippus bade
titus come see the maiden whom as yet he had not seen and they being
come into her house and she sitting betwixt them titus as he were fain
to observe with care the several charms of his friends wife that was to
be surveyed her with the closest attention and being delighted beyond
measure with all that he saw grew as inly he extolled her charms to the
skies enamoured of her with a love as ardent albeit he gave no sign of
it as ever lover bore to lady however after they had tarried a while
with her they took their leave and went home where titus repaired to
his chamber and there gave himself over to solitary musing on the
damsels charms and the longer he brooded the more he burned for her
whereon as he reflected having heaved many a fervent sigh thus he began
to commune with himselfah woe worth thy life titus whom makest thou
the mistress of thy soul thy love thy hope knowest thou not that by
reason as well of thy honourable entreatment by chremes and his kin as of
the wholehearted friendship that is between thee and gisippus it behoves
thee to have his betrothed in even such pious regard as if she were thy
sister whither art thou suffering beguiling love delusive hope to
hurry thee open the eyes of thine understanding and see thyself
wretched man as thou art obey the dictates of thy reason refrain thy
carnal appetite control thine inordinate desires and give thy thoughts
another bent join battle with thy lust at the outset and conquer
thyself while there is yet time this which thou wouldst have is not
meet is not seemly this which thou art minded to ensue thou wouldst
rather though thou wert as thou art not sure of its attainment
eschew hadst thou but the respect thou shouldst have for the claims of
true friendship so then titus what wilt thou do what but abandon
this unseemly love if thou wouldst do as it behoves thee
but then as he remembered sophronia his thoughts took the contrary
direction and he recanted all he had said musing on this wisethe
laws of love are of force above all others they abrogate not only the
law of human friendship but the law divine itself how many times ere
now has father loved daughter brother sister stepmother stepson
aberrations far more notable than that a friend should love his friends
wife which has happened a thousand times besides which i am young and
youth is altogether subject to the laws of love loves pleasure then
should be mine the seemly is for folk of riper years tis not in my
power to will aught save that which love wills so beauteous is this
damsel that there is none but should love her and if i love her who am
young who can justly censure me i love her not because she is the
affianced of gisippus no matter whose she was i should love her all the
same herein is fortune to blame that gave her to my friend gisippus
rather than to another and if she is worthy of love as for beauty she
is gisippus if he should come to know that i love her ought to be less
jealous than another
then scorning himself that he should indulge such thoughts he relapsed
into the opposing mood albeit not to abide there but ever veering to
and fro he spent not only the whole of that day and the ensuing night
but many others insomuch that being able neither to eat nor to sleep
he grew so weak that he was fain to take to his bed gisippus who had
marked his moodiness for some days and now saw that he was fairly sick
was much distressed and with sedulous care never quitting his side he
tended and strove as best he might to comfort him not seldom and most
earnestly demanding to know of him the cause of his melancholy and his
sickness many were the subterfuges to which titus resorted but as
gisippus was not to be put off with his fables finding himself hard
pressed by him with sighs and sobs he made answer on this
wisegisippus had such been the will of the gods i were fain rather
to die than to live seeing that fortune has brought me to a strait in
which needs must my virtue be put to the ordeal and to my most grievous
shame tis found wanting whereof i confidently expect my due reward to
wit death which will be more welcome to me than to live haunted ever
by the memory of my baseness which as there is nought that from thee i
either should or can conceal i not without burning shame will discover
to thee and so he recounted the whole story from first to last the
occasion of his melancholy its several moods their conflict and with
which of them the victory rested averring that he was dying of love for
sophronia and that knowing how ill such love beseemed him he had for
penance elected to die and deemed the end was now not far off
gisippus hearing his words and seeing his tears for a while knew not
what to say being himself smitten with the damsels charms albeit in a
less degree than titus but ere long he made up his mind that sophronia
must be less dear to him than his friends life
and so moved to tears by his friends tearstitus quoth he between
his sobs but that thou art in need of comfort i should reproach thee
that thou hast offended against our friendship in that thou hast so long
kept close from me this most distressful passion and albeit thou didst
deem it unseemly yet unseemly things should no more than things seemly
be withheld from a friend for that as a friend rejoices with his friend
in things seemly so he does his endeavour to wean his friend from things
unseemly but enough of this for the nonce i pass to that which i wot
is of greater moment if thou ardently lovest sophronia my affianced so
far from marvelling thereat i should greatly marvel were it not so
knowing how fair she is and how noble is thy soul and thus the apter to
be swayed by passion the more excelling is she by whom thou art charmed
and the juster the cause thou hast to love sophronia the greater is the
injustice with which thou complainest of fortune albeit thou dost it not
in so many words for giving her to me as if thy love of her had been
seemly had she belonged to any other but me whereas if thou art still
the wise man thou wast wont to be thou must know that to none could
fortune have assigned her with such good cause for thee to thank her as
to me had any other had her albeit thy love had been seemly he had
loved her as his own rather than as thine which if thou deem me even
such a friend to thee as i am thou wilt not apprehend from me seeing
that i mind me not that since we were friends i had ever aught that was
not as much thine as mine and so should i entreat thee herein as in all
other matters were the affair gone so far that nought else were
possible but as it is i can make thee sole possessor of her and so i
mean to do for i know not what cause thou shouldst have to prize my
friendship if where in seemly sort it might be done i knew not how to
surrender my will to thine tis true that sophronia is my betrothed and
that i loved her much and had great cheer in expectation of the
nuptials but as thou being much more discerning than i dost more
fervently affect this rare prize rest assured that she will enter my
chamber not mine but thine wherefore away with thy moodiness banish
thy melancholy recover thy lost health thy heartiness and jollity and
gladsomely even from this very hour anticipate the guerdon of thy love
a love worthier far than mine
delightful as was the prospect with which hope flattered titus as he
heard gisippus thus speak no less was the shame with which right reason
affected him admonishing him that the greater was the liberality of
gisippus the less it would become him to profit thereby wherefore
still weeping he thus constrained himself to make answergisippus
thy generous and true friendship leaves me in no doubt as to the manner
in which it becomes me to act god forefend that her whom as to the
more worthy he has given to thee i should ever accept of thee for mine
had he seen fit that she should be mine far be it from thee or any other
to suppose that he would ever have awarded her to thee renounce not
then that which thy choice and wise counsel and his gift have made
thine and leave me to whom as unworthy he has appointed no such
happiness to waste my life in tears for either i shall conquer my
grief which will be grateful to thee or it will conquer me and so i
shall be quit of my pain quoth then gisippusif our friendship
titus is of such a sort as may entitle me to enforce thee to ensue
behests of mine or as may induce thee of thine own free will to ensue
the same such is the use to which most of all i am minded to put it
and if thou lend not considerate ear unto my prayers i shall by force
that force which is lawful in the interest of a friend make sophronia
thine i know the might of love how redoubtable it is and how not once
only but oftentimes it has brought illstarred lovers to a miserable
death and thee i see so hard bested that turn back thou mightst not nor
get the better of thy grief but holding on thy course must succumb and
perish and without doubt i should speedily follow thee and so had i no
other cause to love thee thy life is precious to me in that my own is
bound up with it sophronia then shall be thine for thou wouldst not
lightly find another so much to thy mind and i shall readily find
another to love and so shall content both thee and me in which matter
peradventure i might not be so liberal were wives so scarce or hard to
find as are friends wherefore as tis so easy a matter for me to find
another wife i had lieferi say not lose her for in giving her to thee
lose her i shall not but only transfer her to one that is my alter ego
and that to her advantagei had liefer i say transfer her to thee than
lose thee and so if aught my prayers avail with thee i entreat thee
extricate thyself from this thy woeful plight and comfort at once
thyself and me and in good hope address thyself to pluck that boon
which thy fervent love craves of her for whom thou yearnest
still scrupling for shame to consent that sophronia should become his
wife titus remained yet a while inexorable but yielding at last to the
solicitations of love reinforced by the exhortations of gisippus thus
he made answerlo now gisippus i know not how to call it whether
tis more thy pleasure than mine this which i do seeing that tis as
thy pleasure that thou so earnestly entreatest me to do it but as thy
liberality is such that my shame though becoming may not withstand it
i will even do it but of this rest assured that i do so witting well
that i receive from thee not only the lady i love but with her my very
life and fate permitting may the gods grant me to make thee such
honourable and goodly requital as may shew thee how sensible i am of the
boon which thou more compassionate of me than i am of myself
conferrest on me quoth then gisippusnow for the giving effect to
our purpose methinks titus we should proceed on this wise thou
knowest that sophronia by treaty at length concluded between my family
and hers is become my betrothed were i now to say that she should not
be my wife great indeed were the scandal that would come thereof and i
should affront both her family and mine own whereof indeed i should
make no account so it gave me to see her become thine but i fear that
were i to give her up at this juncture her family would forthwith bestow
her upon another perchance than thee and so we should both be losers
wherefore methinks that so thou approve i were best to complete what i
have begun bring her home as my wife and celebrate the nuptials and
thereafter we can arrange that thou lie with her privily as thy wife
then time and occasion serving we will disclose the whole affair and
if they are satisfied well and good if not twill be done all the
same and as it cannot be undone they must perforce make the best of
it
which counsel being approved by titus gisippus brought the lady home as
his wife titus being now recovered and quite himself again and when
they had made great cheer and night was come the ladies having bedded
the bride took their departure now the chambers of titus and gisippus
were contiguous and one might pass from one into the other gisippus
therefore being come into his room extinguished every ray of light and
stole into that of titus and bade him go get him to bed with his lady
whereat titus gave way to shame and would have changed his mind and
refused to go in but gisippus no less zealous at heart than in words to
serve his friend after no small contention prevailed on him to go
thither now no sooner was titus abed with the lady than taking her in
his arms he as if jestingly asked in a low tone whether she were
minded to be his wife she taking him to be gisippus answered yes
whereupon he set a fair and costly ring on her finger sayingand i am
minded to be thy husband and having presently consummated the marriage
he long and amorously disported him with her neither she nor any other
being ever aware that another than gisippus lay with her
now titus and sophronia being after this sort wedded publius the father
of titus departed this life for which cause titus was bidden by letter
to return forthwith to rome to see to his affairs wherefore he took
counsel with gisippus how he might take sophronia thither with him which
might not well be done without giving her to know how matters stood
whereof accordingly one day having called her into the chamber they
fully apprised her titus for her better assurance bringing to her
recollection not a little of what had passed between them whereat she
after glancing from one to the other somewhat disdainfully burst into a
flood of tears and reproached gisippus that he had so deluded her and
forthwith saying nought of the matter to any there she hied her forth
of gisippus house and home to her father to whom and her mother she
recounted the deceit which gisippus had practised upon them as upon her
averring that she was the wife not of gisippus as they supposed but of
titus whereby her father was aggrieved exceedingly and prolonged and
grave complaint was made thereof by him and his own and gisippus
families and there was not a little parleying and a world of pother
gisippus earned the hatred of both his own and sophronias kin and all
agreed that he merited not only censure but severe punishment he
however averred that he had done a thing seemly and that sophronias
kinsfolk owed him thanks for giving her in marriage to one better than
himself
all which titus witnessed with great suffering and witting that twas
the way of the greeks to launch forth in high words and menaces and
refrain not until they should meet with one that answered them whereupon
they were wont to grow not only humble but even abject was at length
minded that their clavers should no longer pass unanswered and as with
his roman temper he united athenian subtlety he cleverly contrived to
bring the kinsfolk as well of gisippus as of sophronia together in a
temple where being entered attended only by gisippus thus they being
intent to hear he harangued themtis the opinion of not a few
philosophers that whatsoever mortals do is ordained by the providence of
the immortal gods for which cause some would have it that nought either
is or ever shall be done save of necessity albeit others there are
that restrict this necessity to that which is already done regard we but
these opinions with some little attention and we shall very plainly
perceive that to censure that which cannot be undone is nought else but
to be minded to shew oneself wiser than the gods by whom we must suppose
that we and our affairs are swayed and governed with uniform and unerring
wisdom whereby you may very readily understand how vain and foolish a
presumption it is to pass judgment on their doings and what manner and
might of chains they need who suffer themselves to be transported to such
excess of daring among whom in my judgment you must one and all be
numbered if tis true what i hear to wit that you have complained and
do continue to complain that sophronia albeit you gave her to gisippus
is nevertheless become my wife not considering that twas ordained
from all eternity that she should become not the wife of gisippus but
mine as the fact does now declare
but for that discourse of the secret providence and purposes of the
gods seems to many a matter hard and scarce to be understood i am
willing to assume that they meddle in no wise with our concerns and to
descend to the region of human counsels in speaking whereof i must needs
do two things quite at variance with my wont to wit in some degree
praise myself and censure or vilify another but as in either case i
mean not to deviate from the truth and tis what the occasion demands i
shall not fail so to do with bitter upbraidings animated rather by rage
than by reason you cease not to murmur nay to cry out against
gisippus and to harass him with your abuse and hold him condemned for
that her whom you saw fit to give him he has seen fit to give me to
wife wherein i deem him worthy of the highest commendation and that for
two reasons first because he has done the office of a friend and
secondly because he has done more wisely than you did after what sort
the sacred laws of friendship prescribe that friend shall entreat friend
tis not to my present purpose to declare twill suffice to remind you
that the tie of friendship should be more binding than that of blood or
kinship seeing that our friends are of our own choosing whereas our
kinsfolk are appointed us by fortune wherefore if my life was more to
gisippus than your goodwill since i am as i hold myself his friend
can any wonder thereat
but pass we to my second reason in the exposition whereof i must needs
with yet more cogency prove to you that he has been wiser than you
seeing that methinks you wot nought of the providence of the gods and
still less of the consequences of friendship i say then that as twas
your premeditated and deliberate choice that gave sophronia to this young
philosopher gisippus so twas his that gave her to another young
philosopher twas your counsel that gave her to an athenian twas his
that gave her to a roman twas your counsel that gave her to a man of
gentle birth twas his that gave her to one of birth yet gentler
wealthy was he to whom your counsel gave her most wealthy he to whom his
counsel gave her not only did he to whom your counsel gave her love her
not but he scarce knew her whereas twas to one that loved her beyond
all other blessings nay more dearly than his own life that his counsel
gave her and to the end that it may appear more plainly that tis even
as i say and gisippus counsel more to be commended than yours let us
examine it point by point that i like gisippus am young and a
philosopher my countenance and my pursuits may without making more
words about the matter sufficiently attest we are also of the same age
and have ever kept pace together in our studies now true it is that he
is an athenian and i am a roman but as touching the comparative glory
of the cities should the matter be mooted i say that i am of a free
city and he of a city tributary that i am of a city that is mistress of
all the world and he of one that is subject to mine that i am of a city
that flourishes mightily in arms in empire and in arts whereas he
cannot boast his city as famous save in arts
moreover albeit you see me here in the guise of a most humble scholar
i am not born of the dregs of the populace of rome my halls and the
public places of rome are full of the antique effigies of my forefathers
and the annals of rome abound with the records of triumphs led by the
quintii to the roman capitol and so far from age having withered it
today yet more abundantly than ever of yore flourishes the glory of
our name of my wealth i forbear for shame to speak being mindful that
honest poverty is the timehonoured and richest inheritance of the noble
citizens of rome but allowing for the nonce the opinion of the vulgar
which holds poverty in disrepute and highly appraises wealth i albeit
i never sought it yet as the favoured of fortune have abundant store
thereof now well i wot that gisippus being of your own city you justly
prized and prize an alliance with him but not a whit less should you
prize an alliance with me at rome considering that there you will have
in me an excellent host and a patron apt zealous and potent to serve
you as well in matters of public interest as in your private concerns
who then dismissing all bias from his mind and judging with impartial
reason would deem your counsel more commendable than that of gisippus
assuredly none sophronia then being married to titus quintius fulvus
a citizen of rome of an ancient and illustrious house and wealthy and
a friend of gisippus whoso takes umbrage or offence thereat does that
which it behoves him not to do and knows not what he does
perchance some will say that their complaint is not that sophronia is
the wife of titus but that she became his wife after such a sort to
wit privily by theft neither friend nor any of her kin witting aught
thereof but herein is no matter of marvel no prodigy as yet unheardof
i need not instance those who before now have taken to them husbands in
defiance of their fathers will or have eloped with their lovers and
been their mistresses before they were their wives or of whose marriages
no word has been spoken until their pregnancy or parturition published
them to the world and necessity sanctioned the fact nought of this has
happened in the case of sophronia on the contrary twas in proper form
and in meet and seemly sort that gisippus gave her to titus and others
peradventure will say that twas by one to whom such office belonged not
that she was bestowed in marriage nay but this is but vain and womanish
querulousness and comes of scant consideration know we not then that
fortune varies according to circumstances her methods and her means of
disposing events to their predetermined ends what matters it to me if
it be a cobbler rather than a philosopher that fortune has ordained to
compass something for me whether privily or overtly so only the result
is as it should be i ought indeed to take order if the cobbler be
indiscreet that he meddle no more in affairs of mine but at the same
time i ought to thank him for what he has done if gisippus has duly
bestowed sophronia in marriage it is gratuitous folly to find fault with
the manner and the person if you mistrust his judgment have a care that
it be not in his power to do the like again but thank him for this turn
natheless you are to know that i used no cunning practice or deceit to
sully in any degree the fair fame of your house in the person of
sophronia and albeit i took her privily to wife i came not as a
ravisher to despoil her of her virginity nor in any hostile sort was i
minded to make her mine on dishonourable terms and spurn your alliance
but being fervently enamoured of her bewitching beauty and her noble
qualities i wist well that should i make suit for her with those
formalities which you perchance will say were due then for the great
love you bear her and for fear lest i should take her away with me to
rome i might not hope to have her accordingly i made use of the secret
practice which is now manifest to you and brought gisippus to consent in
my interest to that whereto he was averse and thereafter ardently
though i loved her i sought not to commingle with her as a lover but as
a husband nor closed with her until as she herself by her true witness
may assure you i had with apt words and with the ring made her my lawful
wife asking her if she would have me to husband whereto she answered
yes wherein if she seem to have been tricked tis not i that am to
blame but she for that she asked me not who i was
this then is the great wrong sin crime whereof for love and
friendships sake gisippus and i are guilty that sophronia is privily
become the wife of titus quintius tis for this that you harass him with
your menaces and hostile machinations what more would you do had he
given her to a villein to a caitiff to a slave where would you find
fetters dungeons crosses adequate to your vengeance but enough of this
at present an event which i did not expect has now happened my father
is dead and i must needs return to rome wherefore being fain to take
sophronia with me i have discovered to you that which otherwise i had
perchance still kept close whereto if you are wise you will gladly
reconcile yourselves for that if i had been minded to play you false
or put an affront upon you i might have scornfully abandoned her to you
but god forefend that such baseness be ever harboured in a roman breast
sophronia then by the will of the gods by force of law and by my own
lovetaught astuteness is mine the which it would seem that you
deeming yourselves peradventure wiser than the gods or the rest of
mankind do foolishly set at nought and that in two ways alike most
offensive to me inasmuch as you both withhold from me sophronia in whom
right as against me you have none and also entreat as your enemy
gisippus to whom you are rightfully bounden the folly whereof i purpose
not at present fully to expound to you but in friendly sort to counsel
you to abate your wrath and abandon all your schemes of vengeance and
restore sophronia to me that i may part from you on terms of amity and
alliance and so abide but of this rest assured that whether this
which is done like you or not if you are minded to contravene it i
shall take gisippus hence with me and once arrived in rome shall in
your despite find means to recover her who is lawfully mine and pursuing
you with unremitting enmity will apprise you by experience of the full
measure and effect of a romans wrath
having so said titus started to his feet his countenance distorted by
anger and took gisippus by the hand and with manifest contempt for all
the rest shaking his head at them and threatening them led him out of
the temple they that remained in the temple being partly persuaded by
his arguments to accept his alliance and friendship partly terrified by
his last words resolved by common consent that twas better to have the
alliance of titus as they had lost that of gisippus than to add to that
loss the enmity of titus wherefore they followed titus and having come
up with him told him that they were well pleased that sophronia should
be his and that they should prize his alliance and the friendship of
dear gisippus and having ratified this treaty of amity and alliance with
mutual cheer they departed and sent sophronia to titus sophronia
discreetly making a virtue of necessity transferred forthwith to titus
the love she had borne gisippus and being come with titus to rome was
there received with no small honour gisippus tarried in athens held in
little account by wellnigh all the citizens and being involved in
certain of their broils was not long afterwards with all his
household banished the city poor nay destitute and condemned to
perpetual exile thus hard bested and at length reduced to mendicancy
he made his way so as least discomfortably he might to rome being
minded to see whether titus would remember him and there learning that
titus lived and was much affected by all the romans and having found
out his house he took his stand in front of it and watched until titus
came by to whom for shame of the sorry trim that he was in he ventured
no word but did his endeavour that he might be seen of him hoping that
titus might recognize him and call him by his name but titus passing
on gisippus deeming that he had seen and avoided him and calling to
mind that which aforetime he had done for him went away wroth and
desperate and fasting and penniless andfor twas now nightknowing
not whither he went and yearning above all for death he wandered by
chance to a spot which albeit twas within the city had much of the
aspect of a wilderness and espying a spacious grotto he took shelter
there for the night and worn out at last with grief on the bare ground
wretchedly clad as he was he fell asleep
now two men that had that night gone out a thieving having committed the
theft came towards morning to the grotto and there quarrelled and the
stronger slew the other and took himself off aroused by the noise
gisippus witnessed the murder and deeming that he had now the means of
compassing without suicide the death for which he so much longed
budged not a jot but stayed there until the serjeants of the court
which had already got wind of the affair came on the scene and laid
violent hands upon him and led him away being examined he confessed
that he had slain the man and had then been unable to make his escape
from the grotto wherefore the praetor marcus varro by name sentenced
him to death by crucifixion as was then the custom but titus who
happened at that moment to come into the praetorium being told the crime
for which he was condemned and scanning the poor wretchs face
presently recognized him for gisippus and marvelled how he should come
to be there and in such a woeful plight and most ardently desiring to
succour him nor seeing other way to save his life except to exonerate
him by accusing himself he straightway stepped forward and said with a
loud voicemarcus varro call back the poor man on whom thou hast
passed sentence for he is innocent tis enough that i have incurred the
wrath of the gods by one deed of violence to wit the murder of him whom
your serjeants found dead this morning without aggravating my offence by
the death of another innocent man perplexed and vexed that he should
have been heard by all in the praetorium but unable honourably to avoid
compliance with that which the laws enjoined varro had gisippus brought
back and in presence of titus said to himhow camest thou to be so
mad as though no constraint was put upon thee to confess a deed thou
never didst thy life being at stake thou saidst that twas thou by whom
the man was slain last night and now comes this other and says that
twas not thou but he that slew him gisippus looked and seeing titus
wist well that being grateful for the service rendered by him in the
past titus was now minded to save his life at the cost of his own
wherefore affected to tears he saidnay but varro in very sooth i
slew him and tis now too late this tender solicitude of titus for my
deliverance but on his partpraetor quoth titus thou seest this
man is a stranger and was found unarmed beside the murdered man thou
canst not doubt that he was fain of death for very wretchedness
wherefore discharge him and let punishment light on me who have merited
it
marvelling at the importunity of both varro readily surmised that
neither was guilty and while he was casting about how he might acquit
them lo in came a young man one publius ambustus a desperate
character and known to all the romans for an arrant thief he it was
that had verily committed the murder and witting both the men to be
innocent of that of which each accused himself so sore at heart was he
by reason of their innocence that overborne by an exceeding great
compassion he presented himself before varro andpraetor quoth he
tis destiny draws me hither to loose the knot of these mens
contention and some god within me leaves me no peace of his whips and
stings until i discover my offence wherefore know that neither of these
men is guilty of that of which each accuses himself tis verily i that
slew the man this morning about daybreak and before i slew him while i
was sharing our plunder with him i espied this poor fellow asleep there
nought need i say to clear titus the general bruit of his illustrious
renown attests that he is not a man of such a sort discharge him
therefore and exact from me the penalty prescribed by the laws
the affair had by this time come to the ears of octavianus who caused
all three to be brought before him and demanded to know the causes by
which they had been severally moved to accuse themselves and each
having told his story octavianus released the two by reason of their
innocence and the third for love of them titus took gisippus home
having first chidden him not a little for his faintheartedness and
diffidence and there sophronia receiving him as a brother did him
marvellous cheer and having comforted him a while and arrayed him in
apparel befitting his worth and birth he first shared with him all his
substance and then gave him his sister a young damsel named fulvia to
wife and said to himchoose now gisippus whether thou wilt tarry
here with me or go back to achaia with all that i have given thee
partly perforce of his banishment from his city partly for that the
sweet friendship of titus was justly dear to him gisippus consented to
become a roman and so long and happily they lived together at rome
gisippus with his fulvia and titus with his sophronia in the same
house growing if possible greater friends day by day
exceeding sacred then is friendship and worthy not only to be had in
veneration but to be extolled with neverending praise as the most
dutiful mother of magnificence and seemliness sister of gratitude and
charity and foe to enmity and avarice ever without waiting to be
asked ready to do as generously by another as she would be done by
herself rarely indeed is it today that twain are found in whom her
most holy fruits are manifest for which is most shamefully answerable
the covetousness of mankind which regarding only private interest has
banished friendship beyond earths farthest bourne there to abide in
perpetual exile how should love or wealth or kinship how should aught
but friendship have so quickened the soul of gisippus that the tears and
sighs of titus should incline his heart to cede to him the fair and
gracious lady that was his betrothed and his beloved laws menaces
terror how should these how should aught but friendship have withheld
gisippus in lonely places in hidden retreats in his own bed from
enfolding not perchance unsolicited by her the fair damsel within his
youthful embrace honours rewards gains would gisippus for these
would he for aught but friendship have made nothing of the loss of
kindredhis own and sophroniashave made nothing of the injurious
murmurs of the populace have made nothing of mocks and scorns so only
he might content his friend and on the other hand for what other cause
than friendship had titus when he might decently have feigned not to
see have striven with the utmost zeal to compass his own death and set
himself upon the cross in gisippus stead and what but friendship had
left no place for suspicion in the soul of titus and filled it with a
most fervent desire to give his sister to gisippus albeit he saw him to
be reduced to extreme penury and destitution but so it is that men covet
hosts of acquaintance troops of kinsfolk offspring in plenty and the
number of their dependants increases with their wealth and they reflect
not that there is none of these be he who he may but will be more
apprehensive of the least peril threatening himself than cumbered to
avert a great peril from his lord or kinsman whereas between friends we
know tis quite contrariwise
novel ix

saladin in guise of a merchant is honourably entreated by messer
torello the crusade ensuing messer torello appoints a date after which
his wife may marry again he is taken prisoner and by training hawks
comes under the soldans notice the soldan recognizes him makes himself
known to him and entreats him with all honour messer torello falls
sick and by magic arts is transported in a single night to pavia where
his wifes second marriage is then to be solemnized and being present
thereat is recognized by her and returns with her to his house

so ended filomena her story and when all alike had commended the
magnificence shewn by titus in his gratitude the king reserving the
last place for dioneo thus beganlovesome my ladies true beyond all
question is what filomena reports of friendship and with justice did she
deplore in her closing words the little account in which tis held today
among mortals and were we here for the purpose of correcting or even of
censuring the vices of the age i should add a copious sequel to her
discourse but as we have another end in view it has occurred to me to
set before you in a narrative which will be of considerable length but
entertaining throughout an instance of saladins magnificence to the
end that albeit by reason of our vices it may not be possible for us
to gain to the full the friendship of any yet by the matters whereof you
shall hear in my story we may at least be incited to take delight in
doing good offices in the hope that sooner or later we may come by our
reward thereof
i say then that in the time of the emperor frederic i as certain
writers affirm the christians made common emprise for the recovery of
the holy land whereof that most valiant prince saladin then soldan of
babylonia being in good time apprised resolved to see for himself the
preparations made by the christian potentates for the said emprise that
he might put himself in better trim to meet them so having ordered all
things to his mind in egypt he made as if he were bound on a pilgrimage
and attended only by two of his chiefest and sagest lords and three
servants took the road in the guise of a merchant and having surveyed
many provinces of christendom as they rode through lombardy with intent
to cross the alps they chanced between milan and pavia to fall in with
a gentleman one messer torello distria da pavia who with his servants
and his dogs and falcons was betaking him to a fine estate that he had on
the ticino there to tarry a while now messer torello no sooner espied
saladin and his lords than he guessed them to be gentlemen and
foreigners and being zealous to do them honour when saladin asked one
of his servants how far off pavia might still be and if he might win
there in time to enter the town he suffered not the servant to make
answer butno gentlemen quoth he by the time you reach pavia
twill be too late for you to enter so replied saladin then might
you be pleased to direct us as we are strangers where we may best be
lodged that gladly will i returned messer torello i was but now
thinking to send one of these my men on an errand to pavia i will send
him with you and he will guide you to a place where you will find very
comfortable quarters then turning to one of his most trusty servants
he gave him his instructions and despatched him with them after which
he repaired to his estate and forthwith as best he might caused a
goodly supper to be made ready and the tables set in his garden which
done he stationed himself at the gate on the lookout for his guests
the servant conversing with the gentlemen of divers matters brought
them by devious roads to his lords estate without their being ware of
it whom as soon as messer torello espied he came forth afoot to meet
them and said with a smilea hearty welcome to you gentlemen now
saladin being very quick of apprehension perceived that the knight had
doubted when he met them that were he to bid them to his house they
might not accept his hospitality and accordingly that it might not be
in their power to decline it had brought them to his house by a ruse
and so returning his greetingsir quoth he were it meet to find
fault with those that shew courtesy we should have a grievance against
you for that to say nought of somewhat delaying our journey you have
in guerdon of a single greeting constrained us to accept so noble a
courtesy as yours whereto the knight who was of good understanding and
wellspoken made answergentlemen such courtesy as we shew you will
in comparison of that which by what i gather from your aspect were meet
for you prove but a sorry thing but in sooth this side of pavia you
might not anywhere have been well lodged wherefore take it not amiss
that you have come somewhat out of your way to find less discomfortable
quarters and as he spoke about them flocked the servants who having
helped them to dismount saw to their horses whereupon messer torello
conducted them to the chambers that were made ready for them where
having caused them to be relieved of their boots and refreshed with the
coolest of wines he held pleasant converse with them until suppertime
saladin and his lords and servants all knew latin so that they both
understood and made themselves understood very well and there was none
of them but adjudged this knight to be the most agreeable and debonair
man and therewithal the best talker that he had ever seen while to
messer torello on the other hand they shewed as far greater magnificoes
than he had at first supposed whereby he was inly vexed that he had not
been able that evening to do them the honours of company and a more
ceremonious banquet for which default he resolved to make amends on the
ensuing morning wherefore having imparted to one of his servants that
which he would have done he sent him to his most judicious and
highminded lady at pavia which was close by and where never a gate was
locked which done he brought the gentlemen into the garden and
courteously asked them who they were we are cypriote merchants
replied saladin and tis from cyprus we come and we are on our way to
paris on business quoth then messer torellowould to god that our
country bred gentlemen of such a quality as are the merchants that i see
cyprus breeds from which they passed to discourse of other matters
until suppertime being come he besought them to seat them at table
whereat considering that the supper was but improvised their
entertainment was excellent and wellordered
the tables being cleared messer torello surmising that they must be
weary kept them no long time from their rest but bestowed them in most
comfortable beds and soon after went to rest himself meanwhile the
servant that he had sent to pavia did his lords errand to the lady who
in the style rather of a queen than of a housewife forthwith assembled
not a few of messer torellos friends and vassals and caused all meet
preparation to be made for a magnificent banquet and by messengers
bearing torches bade not a few of the noblest of the citizens thereto
and had store of silken and other fabrics and vair brought in and all
set in order in every point as her husband had directed day came and
the gentlemen being risen messer torello got him to horse with them and
having sent for his hawks brought them to a ford and shewed them how
the hawks flew by and by saladin requesting of him a guide to the best
inn at paviai myself will be your guide returned messer torello
for i have occasion to go thither which offer they nothing doubting
did gladly accept and so with him they set forth and about tierce
being come to the city and expecting to be directed to the best inn
they were brought by messer torello to his own house where they were
forthwith surrounded by full fifty of the greatest folk of the city
gathered there to give the gentlemen a welcome and twas who should hold
a bridle or a stirrup while they dismounted whereby saladin and his
lords more than guessing the truthmesser torello quoth they twas
not this that we craved of you honour enough had we from you last night
and far in excess of our desires wherefore thou mightst very well have
left us to go our own road wheretogentlemen replied messer
torello for that which was done yestereve i have to thank fortune
rather than you seeing that fortune surprised you on the road at an hour
when you must needs repair to my little house for that which shall be
done this morning i shall be beholden to you as will also these
gentlemen that surround you with whom if you deem it courteous so to
do you may refuse to breakfast if you like
fairly conquered saladin and his lords dismounted and heartily welcomed
by the gentlemen were conducted to the chambers which had been most
sumptuously adorned for their use and having laid aside their riding
dress and taken some refreshment repaired to the saloon where all had
been made ready with splendour there having washed their hands they
sat them down to table and were regaled with a magnificent repast of
many courses served with all stately and fair ceremony insomuch that
had the emperor himself been there twould not have been possible to do
him more honour and albeit saladin and his lords were grandees and used
to exceeding great displays of pomp and state nevertheless this shewed
to them as not a little marvellous and one of the greatest they had ever
seen having regard to the quality of their host whom they knew to be
but a citizen and no lord breakfast done and the tables cleared they
conversed a while of high matters and then as twas very hot all the
gentlemen of paviaso it pleased messer torelloretired for their
siesta while he remained with his three guests with whom he presently
withdrew into a chamber whither that there might be nought that he held
dear which they had not seen he called his noble lady and so the dame
exceeding fair and stately of person and arrayed in rich apparel with
her two little boys that shewed as two angels on either hand presented
herself before them and graciously greeted them whereupon they rose
and returned her salutation with reverence and caused her to sit down
among them and made much of her two little boys but after some
interchange of gracious discourse messer torello being withdrawn
somewhat apart she asked them courteously whence they came and whither
they were bound and had of them the same answer that messer torello had
received so quoth the lady with a joyful air then i see that my
womans wit will be of service to you wherefore i pray you as a special
favour neither to reject nor to despise the little gift that i am about
to present to you but reflecting that as women have but small minds so
they make but small gifts accept it having regard rather to the good
will of the giver than the magnitude of the gift she then caused bring
forth for each of them two pair of robes lined the one with silk the
other with vair no such robes as citizens or merchants but such as
lords use to wear and three vests of taffeta besides linen clothes
andtake them quoth she the robes i give you are even such as i
have arrayed my lord withal the other things considering that you are
far from your wives and have come a long way and have yet a long way to
go and that merchants love to be neat and trim may albeit they are of
no great value be yet acceptable to you
wondering the gentlemen acknowledged without reserve that there was no
point of courtesy wherein messer torello was not minded to acquit himself
towards them and noting the lordly fashion of the robes unsuited to the
quality of merchants they misdoubted that messer torello had recognized
them however quoth one of them to the ladygifts great indeed are
these madam nor such as lightly to accept were it not that thereto we
are constrained by your prayers to which we may on no account say no
whereupon messer torello being now come back the lady bade them adieu
and took her leave of them and in like manner did she cause their
servants to be supplied with equipment suitable to them the gentlemen
being much importuned thereto by messer torello consented to tarry the
rest of the day with him and so having slept they donned their robes
and rode a while with him about the city and suppertime being come
they feasted magnificently and with a numerous and honourable company
and so in due time they betook them to rest and at daybreak being
risen they found in lieu of their jaded nags three stout and excellent
palfreys and in like manner fresh and goodly mounts for their servants
which saladin marking turned to his lords andby god quoth he
never was gentleman more complete and courteous and considerate than
this messer torello and if the christian kings are as kingly as he is
knightly there is none of them whose onset the soldan of babylon might
well abide to say nought of so many as we see making ready to fall upon
him however knowing that twas not permissible to refuse he very
courteously thanked messer torello and so they got them to horse messer
torello with a numerous company escorted them far beyond the gate of the
city until loath though saladin was to part from him so greatly did he
now affect him yet as he must needs speed on he besought him to turn
back whereupon albeit it irked him to take leave of themgentlemen
quoth messer torello since such is your pleasure i obey but this i
must say to you who you are i know not nor would i know more than you
are pleased to impart but whoever you may be you will not make me
believe that you are merchants this while and so adieu to whom
saladin having already taken leave of all his company thus made
answerperadventure sir we shall one day give you to see somewhat of
our merchandise and thereby confirm your belief and so adieu
thus parted saladin and his company from messer torello saladin burning
with an exceeding great desire if life should be continued to him and
the war which he anticipated should not undo him to shew messer
torello no less honour than he had received at his hands and conversing
not a little with his lords both of messer torello himself and of his
lady and all that he did and that in any wise concerned him ever more
highly commending them however having with much diligence spied out all
the west he put to sea and returned with his company to alexandria and
having now all needful information he put himself in a posture of
defence messer torello his mind full of his late guests returned to
pavia but though he long pondered who they might be he came never at
or anywhere near the truth
then with great and general mustering of forces came the time for
embarking on the emprise and messer torello heeding not the tearful
entreaties of his wife resolved to join therein so being fully
equipped and about to take horse he said to his lady whom he most
dearly lovedwife for honours sake and for the weal of my soul i
go as thou seest on this emprise our substance and our honour i
commend to thy care certain i am of my departure but for the thousand
accidents that may ensue certitude have i none of my return wherefore i
would have thee do me this grace that whatever be my fate shouldst
thou lack certain intelligence that i live thou wilt expect me a year
and a month and a day from this my departure before thou marry again
whereto the lady weeping bitterly made answermesser torello i know
not how i shall support the distress in which thus departing you leave
me but should my life not fail beneath it and aught befall thee live
and die secure that i shall live and die the wife of messer torello and
of his memory whereuponwife returned messer torello well
assured i am that so far as in thee shall lie this promise of thine
will be kept but thou art young and fair and of a great family and
thy virtue is rare and generally known wherefore i make no doubt that
should there be any suspicion of my death thou wilt be asked of thy
brothers and kinsmen by many a great gentleman against whose attacks
though thou desire it never so thou wilt not be able to hold out but
wilt perforce be fain to gratify one or other of them for which cause it
is that i ask thee to wait just so long and no longer as i have said
replied the lady so in so far as i may i shall do and if i must
needs do otherwise rest assured that of this your behest i shall render
you obedience but i pray god that he bring neither you nor me to such a
strait yet a while which said the lady wept and having embraced
messer torello drew from her finger a ring and gave it to him
sayingshould it betide that i die before i see you again mind you of
me when you look upon it
messer torello took the ring and got him to horse and having bidden all
adieu fared forth on his journey and being arrived with his company at
genoa he embarked on a galley and having departed thence in no long
time arrived at acre and joined the main christian host wherein there
by and by broke out an exceeding great and mortal sickness during which
whether owing to saladins strategy or his good fortune he made an easy
capture of wellnigh all the remnant of the christians that were escaped
and quartered them in divers prisons in many cities of which captives
messer torello being one was brought to alexandria and there confined
where not being known and fearing to make himself known he under
constraint of necessity applied him to the training of hawks whereof he
was a very great master and thereby he fell under the notice of saladin
who took him out of the prison and made him his falconer the soldan
called him by no other name than christian and neither recognized nor
was recognized by him who his whole soul ever in pavia essayed many a
time to escape that he might return thither but still without success
wherefore certain genoese that were come to alexandria as ambassadors
to the soldan for the redemption of some of their townsfolk being about
to return he resolved to write to his lady how that he lived and would
come back to her as soon as he might and that she should expect his
return and having so done he earnestly besought one of the ambassadors
whom he knew to see that the letter reached the hands of the abbot of
san pietro in ciel doro who was his uncle
now such being the posture of messer torellos affairs it befell one
day that while he talked with saladin of his hawks he smiled whereby
his mouth shaped itself in a fashion of which saladin had taken
particular note while he was at pavia and so recalling messer torello
to mind he fixed his gaze upon him and it seemed to him that twas
indeed messer torello wherefore leaving the matter of which they were
conversingtell me christian quoth he of what country art thou in
the west my lord replied messer torello i am a lombard of a city
called pavia a poor man and of humble condition which when he heard
saladin wellnigh resolved of his doubt said joyfully to himselfgod
has provided me with occasion meet to prove to this man what store i set
by his courtesy and without another word he brought him into a room
where he kept all his wearing apparel and saidlook christian if
among these robes there be any that thou hast ever seen before so
messer torello examined the robes and espied those which his lady had
given to saladin but deeming they could not be the same he
repliedmy lord there is no robe here that i recognize albeit tis
true that those two robes are such as i once wore myself in company with
three merchants that came to my house whereupon saladin could refrain
himself no longer but tenderly embracing himyou quoth he are
messer torello distria and i am one of those three merchants to whom
your lady gave these robes and now is the time to warrant you of the
quality of my merchandise as when i parted from you i told you might
come to pass which to hear messer torello was at once overjoyed and
abashed overjoyed to have entertained so illustrious a guest and
abashed for that it seemed to him that he had given him but a sorry
entertainment to whommesser torello quoth saladin since hither
has god sent you to me deem that tis no more i that am lord here but
you and so they made great cheer together and then saladin caused
messer torello to be royally arrayed and presented him to all his
greatest lords and having extolled his merit in no stinted measure bade
all as they hoped for grace from him honour messer torello even as
himself and so from that hour did they all but most especially the two
lords that had been with saladin at messer torellos house
the glory to which messer torello thus suddenly found himself raised
somewhat diverted his mind from the affairs of lombardy and the more so
for that he entertained no doubt that his letter had reached his uncles
hands but for that in the camp or rather army of the christians on
the day when they were taken by saladin there died and was buried one
messer torello de dignes an obscure knight of provence whereas messer
torello distria was known to all the host for a right noble gentleman
whoso heard tell that messer torello was dead supposed that twas messer
torello distria and not messer torello de dignes nor did what happened
after to wit the capture avail to undeceive them for not a few
italians had carried the report home with them among whom there were
some who made bold to say that they had seen messer torello distrias
dead body and had been present at its interment which rumour coming to
the ears of his lady and his kinsfolk great indeed nay immeasurable
was the distress that it occasioned not only to them but to all that had
known him the mode and measure of his ladys grief her mourning her
lamentation twere tedious to describe enough that after some months
spent in almost unmitigated tribulation her sorrow shewed signs of
abatement whereupon suit being made for her hand by some of the
greatest men of lombardy her brothers and other kinsfolk began to
importune her to marry again times not a few and with floods of tears
she refused but overborne at last she consented to do as they would
have her upon the understanding that she was to remain unmarried until
the term for which she had bound herself to messer torello was fulfilled
now the ladys affairs being in this posture at pavia it befell that
some eight days or so before the time appointed for her marriage messer
torello one day espied in alexandria one that he had observed go with the
genoese ambassadors aboard the galley that took them to genoa wherefore
he called him and asked him what sort of a voyage they had had and when
they had reached genoa my lord replied the other the galley made
but a sorry voyage of it as i learned in crete where i remained for
that while she was nearing sicily there arose a terrible gale from the
north that drove her on to the shoals of barbary and never a soul
escaped and among the rest my two brothers were lost which report
believingand twas indeed most trueand calling to mind that in a few
days the term that he had asked of his wife would be fulfilled and
surmising that there could be no tidings of him at pavia messer torello
made no question but that the lady was provided with another husband
whereby he sank into such a depth of woe that he lost all power to eat
and betook him to his bed and resigned himself to die which when
saladin by whom he was most dearly beloved learned he came to him and
having plied him with many and most instant entreaties learned at length
the cause of his distress and sickness and having chidden him not a
little that he had not sooner apprised him thereof he besought him to
put on a cheerful courage assuring him that if so he did he would
bring it to pass that he should be in pavia at the time appointed and
told him how believing saladins words the more readily that he had many
times heard that twas possible and had not seldom been done messer
torello recovered heart and was instant with saladin that he should make
all haste
accordingly saladin bade one of his necromancers of whose skill he had
already had proof to devise a method whereby messer torello should be
transported abed in a single night to pavia the necromancer made answer
that it should be done but that twere best he put messer torello to
sleep the matter being thus arranged saladin hied him back to messer
torello and finding him most earnestly desirous to be in pavia at the
time appointed if so it might be and if not to diemesser torello
quoth he if you dearly love your lady and misdoubt that she may become
the bride of another no wise god wot do i censure you for that of
all the ladies that ever i saw she for bearing manners and
addressto say nought of beauty which is but the flower that
perishesseems to me the most worthy to be lauded and cherished much
had i been gratified since fortune has sent you hither to me that
while you and i yet live we had exercised equal lordship in the
governance of this my realm and if such was not gods will and this
must needs come upon you that you are fain either to be at pavia at the
time appointed or to die i had desired of all things to have been
apprised thereof at such a time that i might have sent you home with such
honourable circumstance and state and escort as befit your high desert
which not being vouchsafed me and as nought will content you but to be
there forthwith i do what i can and speed you thither on such wise as i
have told you my lord replied messer torello had you said nought
you have already done enough to prove your goodwill towards me and that
in so high a degree as is quite beyond my deserts and most assured of
the truth of what you say shall i live and die and so had done had you
not said it but seeing that my resolve is taken i pray you that that
which you promise to do be done speedily for that after tomorrow i may
no longer count on being expected
saladin assured him that twas so ordered that he should not be
disappointed and on the morrow it being his purpose to speed him on his
journey that same night he caused to be set up in one of his great halls
a most goodly and sumptuous bed composed of mattresses all as was their
wont of velvet and cloth of gold and had it covered with a quilt
adorned at certain intervals with enormous pearls and most rare precious
stones insomuch that twas in after time accounted a priceless treasure
and furnished with two pillows to match it which done he bade array
messer torello who was now quite recovered in a robe after the
saracenic fashion the richest and goodliest thing of the kind that was
ever seen and wrap about his head according to their wont one of their
huge turbans then at a late hour saladin attended by certain of his
lords entered the chamber where messer torello was and seating himself
beside him all but wept as thus he beganmesser torello the time is
nigh at hand when you and i must part wherefore since i may neither
give you my own nor others company the journey that you are about to
make not permitting it i am come here as tis fitting in this chamber
to take my leave of you wherefore before i bid you adieu i entreat
you by that friendship that love which is between us that you forget
me not and that if it be possible when you have settled your affairs
in lombardy you come at least once before our days are ended to visit
me that thereby i may both have the delight of seeing you again and
make good that omission which by reason of your haste i must needs now
make and that in the meanwhile it irk thee not to visit me by letter
and to ask of me whatever you shall have a mind to and be sure that
there lives not the man whom i shall content more gladly than you
messer torello could not refrain his tears and so with words few and
broken by his sobs he answered that twas impossible that the soldans
generous deeds and chivalrous character should ever be forgotten by him
and that without fail he would do as he bade him so soon as occasion
should serve him whereupon saladin tenderly embraced and kissed him and
with many a tear bade him adieu and quitted the chamber his lords then
took leave of messer torello and followed saladin into the hall where
he had had the bed made ready
twas now late and the necromancer being intent to hasten messer
torellos transit a physician brought him a potion and having first
shewn him what he was to give him by way of viaticum caused him to drink
it and not long after he fell asleep in which state he was carried by
saladins command and laid on the goodly bed whereon he set a large and
fair and most sumptuous crown marking it in such sort that there could
be no mistake that it was sent by saladin to messer torellos wife he
next placed on messer torellos finger a ring in which was set a
carbuncle of such brilliance that it shewed as a lighted torch and of
wellnigh inestimable value after which he girded on him a sword the
appointments of which might not readily be appraised and therewithal he
adorned him in front with a pendant wherein were pearls the like of
which had never been seen and not a few other rare jewels and
moreover on either side of him he set two vast basins of gold full of
pistoles and strings of pearls not a few and rings and girdles and
other things which twere tedious to enumerate he disposed around him
which done he kissed messer torello again and bade the necromancer
speed him on his journey whereupon forthwith the bed with messer
torello thereon was borne away from before saladins eyes and he and
his barons remained conversing thereof
the bed as messer torello had requested had already been deposited in
the church of san piero in ciel doro at pavia and messer torello with
all the aforesaid jewels and ornaments upon and about him was lying
thereon and still slept when upon the stroke of matins the sacristan
came into the church light in hand and presently setting eyes on the
sumptuous bed was not only amazed but mightily terrified insomuch that
he turned back and took to flight which the abbot and monks observing
with no small surprise asked wherefore he fled and he told them
whereuponoh quoth the abbot thou art no longer a child nor yet
so new to this church that thou shouldst so lightly be appalled go we
now and see who it is that has given thee this childish fright so
with a blaze of torches the abbot attended by his monks entered the
church and espied this wondrous costly bed whereon the knight slept and
while hesitant and fearful daring not to approach the bed they scanned
the rare and splendid jewels it befell that the efficacy of the potion
being exhausted messer torello awoke and heaved a great sigh whereat
the monks and the abbot quaking and crying outlord help us one and
all took to flight messer torello opening his eyes and looking about
him saw to his no small satisfaction that without a doubt he was in
the very place where he had craved of saladin to be so up he sate and
taking particular note of the matters with which he was surrounded
accounted the magnificence of saladin to exceed even the measure great
though it was that he already knew however he still kept quiet save
that perceiving the monks in flight and surmising the reason he began
to call the abbot by name bidding him be of good courage for that he
was his nephew torello whereat the abbot did but wax more terrified
for that he deemed torello had been many a month dead but after a
while as he heard himself still called sound judgment got the better of
his fears and making the sign of the cross he drew nigh torello who
said to himfather what ist you fear by gods grace i live and
hither am come back from overseas whom for all he had grown a long
beard and was dressed in the saracenic fashion the abbot after a while
recognized and now quite reassured took by the hand sayingson
welcome home thenno cause hast thou to marvel at our fears he
went on seeing that there is never a soul in these parts but firmly
believes thee to be dead insomuch that i may tell thee that madonna
adalieta thy wife overborne by the entreaties and menaces of her
kinsfolk and against her will is provided with another husband to whom
she is this morning to go and all is made ready for the nuptials and the
attendant festivities
whereupon messer torello being risen from the sumptuous bed did the
abbot and the monks wondrous cheer and besought them one and all to
tell never a soul of his return until he had completed something that he
had on hand after which having put the costly jewels in safe keeping
he recounted to the abbot all the story of his adventures to that very
hour the abbot rejoicing in his good fortune joined with him in
offering thanks to god messer torello then asked him who might be his
wifes new husband and the abbot told him quoth then messer
torellobefore my return be known i purpose to see how my wife will
comport herself at the nuptials wherefore though tis not the wont of
men of religion to go to such gatherings i had lief that for love of me
you arranged for us to go thither together the abbot answered that he
would gladly do so and as soon as twas day he sent word to the
bridegroom that he had thoughts of being present at his nuptials
accompanied by a friend whereto the gentleman made answer that he was
much gratified so at the breakfast hour messer torello dressed as he
was hied him with the abbot to the bridegrooms house as many as saw
them gazing on him with wonder but none recognizing him and the abbot
giving all to understand that he was a saracen sent by the soldan as
ambassador to the king of france messer torello was accordingly seated
at a table directly opposite that of his lady whom he eyed with
exceeding great delight the more so that he saw that in her face which
shewed him that she was chagrined by the nuptials she in like manner
from time to time bent her regard on him howbeit what with his long
beard and his foreign garb and her firm persuasion that he was dead
she had still no sort of recollection of him however messer torello at
length deemed it time to make trial of her whether she would remember
him wherefore he took the ring that the lady had given him on his
departure and keeping it close in the palm of his hand he called to him
a page that waited upon her and said to himtell the bride from me
that tis the custom in my country that when a stranger such as i
eats with a bride like herself at her weddingfeast she in token that
he is welcome to her board sends him the cup from which she herself
drinks full of wine and when the stranger has drunk his fill he closes
the cup and the bride drinks what is left therein
the page carried the message to the lady who being of good
understanding and manners and supposing him to be some very great man
by way of shewing that she was gratified by his presence commanded that
a gilt cup that was on the table before her should be rinsed and
filled with wine and borne to the gentleman which being done messer
torello having privily conveyed her ring into his mouth let it fall
while he drank into the cup on such wise that none wist thereof and
leaving but a little wine at the bottom closed the cup and returned it
to the lady who having taken it that she might do full honour to the
custom of her guests country lifted the lid and set the cup to her
mouth whereby espying the ring she thereon mutely gazed a while and
recognizing it for that which she had given messer torello on his
departure she steadfastly regarded the supposed stranger whom now she
also recognized whereupon wellnigh distracted oversetting the table in
front of her she exclaimedtis my lord tis verily messer torello
and rushing to the table at which he sate giving never a thought to her
apparel or aught that was on the table she flung herself upon it and
reaching forward as far as she could she threw her arms about him and
hugged him nor for aught that any said or did could she be induced to
release his neck until messer torello himself bade her forbear a while
for that she would have time enough to kiss him thereafter the lady then
stood up and for a while all was disorder albeit the feast was yet more
gladsome than before by reason of the recovery of so honourable a knight
then at messer torellos entreaty all were silent while he recounted
to them the story of his adventures from the day of his departure to that
hour concluding by saying that the gentleman who deeming him to be
dead had taken his lady to wife ought not to be affronted if he being
alive reclaimed her the bridegroom albeit he was somewhat crestfallen
made answer in frank and friendly sort that twas for messer torello to
do what he liked with his own the lady resigned the ring and the crown
that her new spouse had given her and put on the ring she had taken from
the cup and likewise the crown sent her by the soldan and so forth
they hied them and with full nuptial pomp wended their way to messer
torellos house and there for a great while they made merry with his
late disconsolate friends and kinsfolk and all the citizens who
accounted his restoration as little short of a miracle
messer torello having bestowed part of his rare jewels upon him who had
borne the cost of the weddingfeast and part on the abbot and many
other folk and having by more than one messenger sent word of his safe
homecoming and prosperous estate to saladin acknowledging himself ever
his friend and vassal lived many years thereafter with his worthy lady
acquitting himself yet more courteously than of yore such then was the
end of the troubles of messer torello and his dear lady and such the
reward of their cheerful and ready courtesies
now some there are that strive to do offices of courtesy and have the
means but do them with so ill a grace that ere they are done they
have in effect sold them at a price above their worth wherefore if no
reward ensue to them thereof neither they nor other folk have cause to
marvel
novel x

the marquis of saluzzo overborne by the entreaties of his vassals
consents to take a wife but being minded to please himself in the
choice of her takes a husbandmans daughter he has two children by her
both of whom he makes her believe that he has put to death afterward
feigning to be tired of her and to have taken another wife he turns her
out of doors in her shift and brings his daughter into the house in
guise of his bride but finding her patient under it all he brings her
home again and shews her her children now grown up and honours her
and causes her to be honoured as marchioness

ended the kings long story with which all seemed to be very well
pleased quoth dioneo with a laughthe good man that looked that night
to cause the bogeys tail to droop would scarce have contributed two
pennyworth of all the praise you bestow on messer torello then witting
that it now only remained for him to tell thus he begangentle my
ladies this day meseems is dedicate to kings and soldans and folk of
the like quality wherefore that i stray not too far from you i am
minded to tell you somewhat of a marquis certes nought magnificent but
a piece of mad folly albeit there came good thereof to him in the end
the which i counsel none to copy for that great pity twas that it
turned out well with him
there was in olden days a certain marquis of saluzzo gualtieri by name
a young man but head of the house who having neither wife nor child
passed his time in nought else but in hawking and hunting and of taking
a wife and begetting children had no thought wherein he should have been
accounted very wise but his vassals brooking it ill did oftentimes
entreat him to take a wife that he might not die without an heir and
they be left without a lord offering to find him one of such a pattern
and of such parentage that he might marry with good hope and be well
content with the sequel to whommy friends replied gualtieri you
enforce me to that which i had resolved never to do seeing how hard it
is to find a wife whose ways accord well with ones own and how
plentiful is the supply of such as run counter thereto and how grievous
a life he leads who chances upon a lady that matches ill with him and to
say that you think to know the daughters by the qualities of their
fathers and mothers and therebyso you would argueto provide me with
a wife to my liking is but folly for i wot not how you may penetrate
the secrets of their mothers so as to know their fathers and granted
that you do know them daughters oftentimes resemble neither of their
parents however as you are minded to rivet these fetters upon me i am
content that so it be and that i may have no cause to reproach any but
myself should it turn out ill i am resolved that my wife shall be of my
own choosing but of this rest assured that no matter whom i choose if
she receive not from you the honour due to a lady you shall prove to
your great cost how sorely i resent being thus constrained by your
importunity to take a wife against my will
the worthy men replied that they were well content so only he would
marry without more ado and gualtieri who had long noted with approval
the mien of a poor girl that dwelt on a farm hard by his house and found
her fair enough deemed that with her he might pass a tolerably happy
life wherefore he sought no further but forthwith resolved to marry
her and having sent for her father who was a very poor man he
contracted with him to take her to wife which done gualtieri assembled
all the friends he had in those parts andmy friends quoth he you
were and are minded that i should take a wife and rather to comply with
your wishes than for any desire that i had to marry i have made up my
mind to do so you remember the promise you gave me to wit that
whomsoever i should take you would pay her the honour due to a lady
which promise i now require you to keep the time being come when i am to
keep mine i have found hard by here a maiden after mine own heart whom
i purpose to take to wife and to bring hither to my house in the course
of a few days wherefore bethink you how you may make the nuptial feast
splendid and welcome her with all honour that i may confess myself
satisfied with your observance of your promise as you will be with my
observance of mine the worthy men one and all answered with alacrity
that they were well content and that whoever she might be they would
entreat her as a lady and pay her all due honour as such after which
they all addressed them to make goodly and grand and gladsome celebration
of the event as did also gualtieri he arranged for a wedding most
stately and fair and bade thereto a goodly number of his friends and
kinsfolk and great gentlemen and others of the neighbourhood and
therewithal he caused many a fine and costly robe to be cut and fashioned
to the figure of a girl who seemed to him of the like proportions as the
girl that he purposed to wed and laid in store besides of girdles and
rings with a costly and beautiful crown and all the other paraphernalia
of a bride
the day that he had appointed for the wedding being come about half
tierce he got him to horse with as many as had come to do him honour and
having made all needful dispositionsgentlemen quoth he tis time
to go bring home the bride and so away he rode with his company to the
village where being come to the house of the girls father they found
her returning from the spring with a bucket of water making all the
haste she could that she might afterwards go with the other women to see
gualtieris bride come by whom gualtieri no sooner saw than he called
her by her name to wit griselda and asked her where her father was to
whom she modestly made answermy lord he is in the house whereupon
gualtieri dismounted and having bidden the rest await him without
entered the cottage alone and meeting her father whose name was
giannucoloi am come quoth he to wed griselda but first of all
there are some matters i would learn from her own lips in thy presence
he then asked her whether if he took her to wife she would study to
comply with his wishes and be not wroth no matter what he might say or
do and be obedient with not a few other questions of a like sort to
all which she answered ay whereupon gualtieri took her by the hand led
her forth and before the eyes of all his company and as many other folk
as were there caused her to strip naked and let bring the garments that
he had had fashioned for her and had her forthwith arrayed therein and
upon her unkempt head let set a crown and then while all
wonderedgentlemen quoth he this is she whom i purpose to make my
wife so she be minded to have me for husband then she standing
abashed and astonied he turned to her sayinggriselda wilt thou
have me for thy husband to whomay my lord answered she and i
will have thee to wife said he and married her before them all and
having set her upon a palfrey he brought her home with pomp
the wedding was fair and stately and had he married a daughter of the
king of france the feast could not have been more splendid it seemed as
if with the change of her garb the bride had acquired a new dignity of
mind and mien she was as we have said fair of form and feature and
therewithal she was now grown so engaging and gracious and debonair that
she shewed no longer as the shepherdess and the daughter of giannucolo
but as the daughter of some noble lord insomuch that she caused as many
as had known her before to marvel moreover she was so obedient and
devoted to her husband that he deemed himself the happiest and luckiest
man in the world and likewise so gracious and kindly was she to her
husbands vassals that there was none of them but loved her more dearly
than himself and was zealous to do her honour and prayed for her
welfare and prosperity and aggrandisement and instead of as erstwhile
saying that gualtieri had done foolishly to take her to wife now averred
that he had not his like in the world for wisdom and discernment for
that save to him her noble qualities would ever have remained hidden
under her sorry apparel and the garb of the peasant girl and in short
she so comported herself as in no long time to bring it to pass that not
only in the marquisate but far and wide besides her virtues and her
admirable conversation were matter of common talk and if aught had been
said to the disadvantage of her husband when he married her the
judgment was now altogether to the contrary effect
she had not been long with gualtieri before she conceived and in due
time she was delivered of a girl whereat gualtieri made great cheer
but soon after a strange humour took possession of him to wit to put
her patience to the proof by prolonged and intolerable hard usage
wherefore he began by afflicting her with his gibes putting on a vexed
air and telling her that his vassals were most sorely dissatisfied with
her by reason of her base condition and all the more so since they saw
that she was a mother and that they did nought but most ruefully murmur
at the birth of a daughter whereto griselda without the least change of
countenance or sign of discomposure made answermy lord do with me
as thou mayst deem best for thine own honour and comfort for well i wot
that i am of less account than they and unworthy of this honourable
estate to which of thy courtesy thou hast advanced me by which answer
gualtieri was well pleased witting that she was in no degree puffed up
with pride by his or any others honourable entreatment of her a while
afterwards having in general terms given his wife to understand that the
vassals could not endure her daughter he sent her a message by a
servant so the servant came andmadam quoth he with a most
dolorous mien so i value my life i must needs do my lords bidding he
has bidden me take your daughter and he said no more but the lady by
what she heard and read in his face and remembered of her husbands
words understood that he was bidden to put the child to death whereupon
she presently took the child from the cradle and having kissed and
blessed her albeit she was very sore at heart she changed not
countenance but placed it in the servants arms sayingsee that thou
leave nought undone that my lord and thine has charged thee to do but
leave her not so that the beasts and the birds devour her unless he have
so bidden thee so the servant took the child and told gualtieri what
the lady had said and gualtieri marvelling at her constancy sent him
with the child to bologna to one of his kinswomen whom he besought to
rear and educate the child with all care but never to let it be known
whose child she was
soon after it befell that the lady again conceived and in due time was
delivered of a son whereat gualtieri was overjoyed but not content
with what he had done he now even more poignantly afflicted the lady
and one day with a ruffled mienwife quoth he since thou gavest
birth to this boy i may on no wise live in peace with my vassals so
bitterly do they reproach me that a grandson of giannucolo is to succeed
me as their lord and therefore i fear that so i be not minded to be
sent a packing hence i must even do herein as i did before and in the
end put thee away and take another wife the lady heard him patiently
and answered onlymy lord study how thou mayst content thee and best
please thyself and waste no thought upon me for there is nought i
desire save in so far as i know that tis thy pleasure not many days
after gualtieri in like manner as he had sent for the daughter sent
for the son and having made a shew of putting him to death provided for
his as for the girls nurture at bologna whereat the lady shewed no
more discomposure of countenance or speech than at the loss of her
daughter which gualtieri found passing strange and inly affirmed that
there was never another woman in the world that would have so done and
but that he had marked that she was most tenderly affectionate towards
her children while twas well pleasing to him he had supposed that she
was tired of them whereas he knew that twas of her discretion that she
so did his vassals who believed that he had put the children to death
held him mightily to blame for his cruelty and felt the utmost
compassion for the lady she however said never aught to the ladies
that condoled with her on the death of her children but that the
pleasure of him that had begotten them was her pleasure likewise
years not a few had passed since the girls birth when gualtieri at
length deemed the time come to put his wifes patience to the final
proof accordingly in the presence of a great company of his vassals he
declared that on no wise might he longer brook to have griselda to wife
that he confessed that in taking her he had done a sorry thing and the
act of a stripling and that he therefore meant to do what he could to
procure the popes dispensation to put griselda away and take another
wife for which cause being much upbraided by many worthy men he made no
other answer but only that needs must it so be whereof the lady being
apprised and now deeming that she must look to go back to her fathers
house and perchance tend the sheep as she had aforetime and see him
to whom she was utterly devoted engrossed by another woman did inly
bewail herself right sorely but still with the same composed mien with
which she had borne fortunes former buffets she set herself to endure
this last outrage nor was it long before gualtieri by counterfeit
letters which he caused to be sent to him from rome made his vassals
believe that the pope had thereby given him a dispensation to put
griselda away and take another wife wherefore having caused her to be
brought before him he said to her in the presence of not a fewwife
by license granted me by the pope i am now free to put thee away and
take another wife and for that my forbears have always been great
gentlemen and lords of these parts whereas thine have ever been
husbandmen i purpose that thou go back to giannucolos house with the
dowry that thou broughtest me whereupon i shall bring home a lady that i
have found and who is meet to be my wife
twas not without travail most grievous that the lady as she heard this
announcement got the better of her womans nature and suppressing her
tears made answermy lord i ever knew that my low degree was on no
wise congruous with your nobility and acknowledged that the rank i had
with you was of your and gods bestowal nor did i ever make as if it
were mine by gift or so esteem it but still accounted it as a loan
tis your pleasure to recall it and therefore it should be and is my
pleasure to render it up to you so here is your ring with which you
espoused me take it back you bid me take with me the dowry that i
brought you which to do will require neither paymaster on your part nor
purse nor packhorse on mine for i am not unmindful that naked was i when
you first had me and if you deem it seemly that that body in which i
have borne children by you begotten be beheld of all naked will i
depart but yet i pray you be pleased in guerdon of the virginity that
i brought you and take not away to suffer me to bear hence upon my back
a single shifti crave no morebesides my dowry there was nought of
which gualtieri was so fain as to weep but yet setting his face as a
flint he made answeri allow thee a shift to thy back so get thee
hence all that stood by besought him to give her a robe that she who
had been his wife for thirteen years and more might not be seen to quit
his house in so sorry and shameful a plight having nought on her but a
shift but their entreaties went for nothing the lady in her shift and
barefoot and bareheaded having bade them adieu departed the house and
went back to her father amid the tears and lamentations of all that saw
her giannucolo who had ever deemed it a thing incredible that gualtieri
should keep his daughter to wife and had looked for this to happen every
day and had kept the clothes that she had put off on the morning that
gualtieri had wedded her now brought them to her and she having
resumed them applied herself to the petty drudgery of her fathers
house as she had been wont enduring with fortitude this cruel
visitation of adverse fortune
now no sooner had gualtieri dismissed griselda than he gave his vassals
to understand that he had taken to wife a daughter of one of the counts
of panago he accordingly made great preparations as for the nuptials
during which he sent for griselda to whom being come quoth hei am
bringing hither my new bride and in this her first homecoming i purpose
to shew her honour and thou knowest that women i have none in the house
that know how to set chambers in due order or attend to the many other
matters that so joyful an event requires wherefore do thou that
understandest these things better than another see to all that needs be
done and bid hither such ladies as thou mayst see fit and receive them
as if thou wert the lady of the house and then when the nuptials are
ended thou mayst go back to thy cottage albeit each of these words
pierced griseldas heart like a knife for that in resigning her good
fortune she had not been able to renounce the love she bore gualtieri
neverthelessmy lord she made answer i am ready and prompt to do
your pleasure and so clad in her sorry garments of coarse romagnole
she entered the house which but a little before she had quitted in her
shift and addressed her to sweep the chambers and arrange arras and
cushions in the halls and make ready the kitchen and set her hand to
everything as if she had been a paltry servingwench nor did she rest
until she had brought all into such meet and seemly trim as the occasion
demanded this done she invited in gualtieris name all the ladies of
those parts to be present at his nuptials and awaited the event the day
being come still wearing her sorry weeds but in heart and soul and mien
the lady she received the ladies as they came and gave each a gladsome
greeting
now gualtieri as we said had caused his children to be carefully
nurtured and brought up by a kinswoman of his at bologna which kinswoman
was married into the family of the counts of panago and the girl being
now twelve years old and the loveliest creature that ever was seen and
the boy being about six years old he had sent word to his kinswomans
husband at bologna praying him to be pleased to come with this girl and
boy of his to saluzzo and to see that he brought a goodly and honourable
company with him and to give all to understand that he brought the girl
to him to wife and on no wise to disclose to any who she really was
the gentleman did as the marquis bade him and within a few days of his
setting forth arrived at saluzzo about breakfasttime with the girl and
her brother and a noble company and found all the folk of those parts
and much people besides gathered there in expectation of gualtieris new
bride who being received by the ladies was no sooner come into the
hall where the tables were set than griselda advanced to meet her
saying with hearty cheerwelcome my lady so the ladies who had
with much instance but in vain besought gualtieri either to let
griselda keep in another room or at any rate to furnish her with one of
the robes that had been hers that she might not present herself in such
a sorry guise before the strangers sate down to table and the service
being begun the eyes of all were set on the girl and every one said
that gualtieri had made a good exchange and griselda joined with the
rest in greatly commending her and also her little brother and now
gualtieri sated at last with all that he had seen of his wifes
patience marking that this new and strange turn made not the least
alteration in her demeanour and being well assured that twas not due to
apathy for he knew her to be of excellent understanding deemed it time
to relieve her of the suffering which he judged her to dissemble under a
resolute front and so having called her to him in presence of them all
he said with a smileand what thinkst thou of our bride my lord
replied griselda i think mighty well of her and if she be but as
discreet as she is fairand so i deem heri make no doubt but you may
reckon to lead with her a life of incomparable felicity but with all
earnestness i entreat you that you spare her those tribulations which
you did once inflict upon another that was yours for i scarce think she
would be able to bear them as well because she is younger as for that
she has been delicately nurtured whereas that other had known no respite
of hardship since she was but a little child marking that she made no
doubt but that the girl was to be his wife and yet spoke never a whit
the less sweetly gualtieri caused her to sit down beside him
andgriselda said he tis now time that thou see the reward of thy
long patience and that those who have deemed me cruel and unjust and
insensate should know that what i did was done of purpose aforethought
for that i was minded to give both thee and them a lesson that thou
mightst learn to be a wife and they in like manner might learn how to
take and keep a wife and that i might beget me perpetual peace with thee
for the rest of my life whereof being in great fear when i came to take
a wife lest i should be disappointed i therefore to put the matter to
the proof did and how sorely thou knowest harass and afflict thee and
since i never knew thee either by deed or by word to deviate from my
will i now deeming myself to have of thee that assurance of happiness
which i desired am minded to restore to thee at once all that step by
step i took from thee and by extremity of joy to compensate the
tribulations that i inflicted on thee receive then this girl whom
thou supposest to be my bride and her brother with glad heart as thy
children and mine these are they whom by thee and many another it has
long been supposed that i did ruthlessly to death and i am thy husband
that loves thee more dearly than aught else deeming that other there is
none that has the like good cause to be well content with his wife
which said he embraced and kissed her and then while she wept for joy
they rose and hied them there where sate the daughter all astonied to
hear the news whom as also her brother they tenderly embraced and
explained to them and many others that stood by the whole mystery
whereat the ladies transported with delight rose from table and betook
them with griselda to a chamber and with better omen divested her of
her sorry garb and arrayed her in one of her own robes of state and so
in guise of a lady howbeit in her rags she had shewed as no less they
led her back into the hall wondrous was the cheer which there they made
with the children and all overjoyed at the event they revelled and
made merry amain and prolonged the festivities for several days and
very discreet they pronounced gualtieri albeit they censured as
intolerably harsh the probation to which he had subjected griselda and
most discreet beyond all compare they accounted griselda
some days after the count of panago returned to bologna and gualtieri
took giannucolo from his husbandry and established him in honour as his
fatherinlaw wherein to his great solace he lived for the rest of his
days gualtieri himself having mated his daughter with a husband of high
degree lived long and happily thereafter with griselda to whom he ever
paid all honour
now what shall we say in this case but that even into the cots of the
poor the heavens let fall at times spirits divine as into the palaces of
kings souls that are fitter to tend hogs than to exercise lordship over
men who but griselda had been able with a countenance not only
tearless but cheerful to endure the hard and unheardof trials to which
gualtieri subjected her who perhaps might have deemed himself to have
made no bad investment had he chanced upon one who having been turned
out of his house in her shift had found means so to dust the pelisse of
another as to get herself thereby a fine robe
so ended dioneos story whereof the ladies diversely inclining one to
censure where another found matter for commendation had discoursed not a
little when the king having glanced at the sky and marked that the sun
was now low insomuch that twas nigh the vesper hour still keeping his
seat thus beganexquisite my ladies as methinks you wot tis not
only in minding them of the past and apprehending the present that the
wit of mortals consists but by one means or the other to be able to
foresee the future is by the sages accounted the height of wisdom now
tomorrow as you know twill be fifteen days since in quest of
recreation and for the conservation of our health and life we shunning
the dismal and dolorous and afflicting spectacles that have ceased not in
our city since this season of pestilence began took our departure from
florence wherein to my thinking we have done nought that was not
seemly for if i have duly used my powers of observation albeit some
gay stories and of a kind to stimulate concupiscence have here been
told and we have daily known no lack of dainty dishes and good wine nor
yet of music and song things one and all apt to incite weak minds to
that which is not seemly neither on your part nor on ours have i
marked deed or word or aught of any kind that called for reprehension
but by what i have seen and heard seemliness and the sweet intimacy of
brothers and sisters have ever reigned among us which assuredly for
the honour and advantage which you and i have had thereof is most
grateful to me wherefore lest too long continuance in this way of life
might beget some occasion of weariness and that no man may be able to
misconstrue our too long abidance here and as we have all of us had our
days share of the honour which still remains in me i should deem it
meet so you be of like mind that we now go back whence we came and
that the rather that our company the bruit whereof has already reached
divers others that are in our neighbourhood might be so increased that
all our pleasure would be destroyed and so if my counsel meet with your
approval i will keep the crown i have received of you until our
departure which i purpose shall be tomorrow morning should you decide
otherwise i have already determined whom to crown for the ensuing day
much debate ensued among the ladies and young men but in the end they
approved the kings proposal as expedient and seemly and resolved to do
even as he had said the king therefore summoned the seneschal and
having conferred with him of the order he was to observe on the morrow
he dismissed the company until suppertime so the king being risen the
ladies and the rest likewise rose and betook them as they were wont to
their several diversions suppertime being come they supped with
exceeding great delight which done they addressed them to song and
music and dancing and while lauretta was leading a dance the king bade
fiammetta give them a song whereupon fiammetta right debonairly sang on
this wise
so came but love and brought no jealousy
  so blithe i wot as i
  dame were there none be she whoeer she be
if youths fresh lusty pride
  may lady of her lover well content
  or valours just renown
  hardihood prowess tried
  wit noble mien discourse most excellent
  and of all grace the crown
  that she am i who fain for love to swoun
  there where my hope doth lie
  these several virtues all conjoined do see
but for that i less wise
  than me no whit do other dames discern
  trembling with sore dismay
  i still the worst surmise
  deeming their hearts with the same flame to burn
  that of mine maketh prey
  wherefore of him that is my hopes one stay
  disconsolate i sigh
  yea mightily and daily do me dree
if but my lord as true
  as worthy to be loved i might approve
  i were not jealous then
  but for that charmer new
  doth all too often gallant lure to love
  forsworn i hold all men
  and sick at heart i am of death full fain
  nor lady doth him eye
  but i do quake lest she him wrest from me
fore god then let each she
  list to my prayer nor eer in my despite
  such grievous wrong essay
  for should there any be
  that by or speech or miens allurements light
  of him to rob me may
  study or plot i witting shall find way
  my beauty it aby
  to cause her sore lament such frenesie
as soon as fiammetta had ended her song dioneo who was beside her said
with a laughmadam twould be a great courtesy on your part to do all
ladies to wit who he is that he be not stolen from you in ignorance
seeing that you threaten such dire resentment several other songs
followed and it being then nigh upon midnight all as the king was
pleased to order betook them to rest with the first light of the new
day they rose and the seneschal having already conveyed thence all
their chattels they following the lead of their discreet king hied
them back to florence and in santa maria novella whence they had set
forth the three young men took leave of the seven ladies and departed
to find other diversions elsewhere while the ladies in due time repaired
to their homes
the authors epilogue
most noble damsels for whose solace i addressed me to this long and
toilsome task meseems that aided by the divine grace the bestowal
whereof i impute to the efficacy of your pious prayers and in no wise to
merits of mine i have now brought this work to the full and perfect
consummation which in the outset thereof i promised you wherefore it
but remains for me to render first to god and then to you my thanks
and so to give a rest to my pen and weary hand but this i purpose not to
allow them until briefly as to questions tacitly mootedfor well
assured i am that these stories have no especial privilege above any
others nay i forget not that at the beginning of the fourth day i have
made the same plaini shall have answered certain trifling objections
that one of you maybe or some other might advance peradventure then
some of you will be found to say that i have used excessive license in
the writing of these stories in that i have caused ladies at times to
tell and oftentimes to list matters that whether to tell or to list
do not well beseem virtuous women the which i deny for that there is
none of these stories so unseemly but that it may without offence be
told by any one if but seemly words be used which rule methinks has
here been very well observed but assume we that tis even so for with
you i am not minded to engage in argument witting that you would
vanquish me then i say that for answer why i have so done reasons
many come very readily to hand in the first place if aught of the kind
in any of these stories there be twas but such as was demanded by the
character of the stories which let but any person of sound judgment scan
with the eye of reason and twill be abundantly manifest that unless i
had been minded to deform them they could not have been otherwise
recounted and if perchance they do after all contain here and there
a trifling indiscretion of speech such as might ill sort with one of
your precious prudes who weigh words rather than deeds and are more
concerned to appear than to be good i say that so to write was as
permissible to me as tis to men and women at large in their converse to
make use of such terms as hole and pin and mortar and pestle and
sausage and polony and plenty more besides of a like sort and
therewithal privilege no less should be allowed to my pen than to the
pencil of the painter who without incurring any or at least any just
censure not only will depict st michael smiting the serpent or st
george the dragon with sword or lance at his discretion but male he
paints us christ and female eve and his feet that for the salvation of
our race willed to die upon the cross he fastens thereto now with one
now with two nails
moreover tis patent to all that twas not in the church of matters
whereto pertaining tis meet we speak with all purity of heart and
seemliness of phrase albeit among her histories there are to be found
not a few that will ill compare with my writings nor yet in the schools
of the philosophers where as much as anywhere seemliness is demanded
nor in any place where clergy or philosophers congregate but in gardens
in pleasaunces and among folk young indeed but not so young as to be
seducible by stories and at a time when if so one might save ones
life the most sedate might without disgrace walk abroad with his
breeches for headgear that these stories were told which stories such
as they are may like all things else be baneful or profitable
according to the quality of the hearer who knows not that wine is as
cinciglione and scolaio1 and many another aver an excellent thing for
the living creature and yet noxious to the fevered patient are we for
the mischief it does to the feverstricken to say that tis a bad thing
who knows not that fire is most serviceable nay necessary to mortals
are we to say that because it burns houses and villages and cities it
is a bad thing arms in like manner are the safeguard of those that
desire to live in peace and also by them are men not seldom maliciously
slain albeit the malice is not in them but in those that use them for a
malicious purpose corrupt mind did never yet understand any word in a
wholesome sense and as such a mind has no profit of seemly words so
such as are scarce seemly may as little avail to contaminate a healthy
mind as mud the radiance of the sun or the deformities of earth the
splendours of the heavens what books what words what letters are more
sacred more excellent more venerable than those of holy writ and yet
there have been not a few that perversely construing them have brought
themselves and others to perdition everything is in itself good for
somewhat and being put to a bad purpose may work manifold mischief and
so i say it is with my stories if any man shall be minded to draw from
them matters of evil tendency or consequence they will not gainsay him
if perchance such matters there be in them nor will such matters fail
to be found in them if they be wrested and distorted nor if any shall
seek profit and reward in them will they deny him the same and censured
or accounted as less than profitable and seemly they can never be if the
times or the persons when and by whom they are read be such as when they
were recounted if any lady must needs say paternosters or make cakes or
tarts for her holy father let her leave them alone there is none after
whom they will run a begging to be read howbeit there are little
matters that even the beguines tell ay and do now and again
in like manner there will be some who will say that there are stories
here which twere better far had been omitted granted but twas neither
in my power nor did it behove me to write any but such stories as were
narrated wherefore twas for those by whom they were told to have a
care that they were proper in which case they would have been no less so
as i wrote them but assuming that i not only wrote but invented the
stories as i did not i say that i should take no shame to myself that
they were not all proper seeing that artist there is none to be found
save god that does all things well and perfectly and charlemagne
albeit he created the paladins wist not how to make them in such numbers
as to form an army of them alone it must needs be that in the multitude
of things there be found diversities of quality no field was ever so
well tilled but that here and there nettle or thistle or brier would be
found in it amid the goodlier growths whereto i may add that having to
address me to young and unlearned ladies as you for the most part are i
should have done foolishly had i gone about searching and swinking to
find matters very exquisite and been sedulous to speak with great
precision however whoso goes a reading among these stories let him
pass over those that vex him and read those that please him that none
may be misled each bears on its brow the epitome of that which it hides
within its bosom
again i doubt not there will be such as will say that some of the
stories are too long to whom once more i answer that whoso has aught
else to do would be foolish to read them albeit they were short and
though now that i approach the end of my labours tis long since i
began to write i am not therefore oblivious that twas to none but
leisured ladies that i made proffer of my pains nor can aught be long to
him that reads but to pass the time so only he thereby accomplish his
purpose succinctness were rather to be desired by students who are at
pains not merely to pass but usefully to employ their time than by
you who have as much time at your disposal as you spend not in amorous
delights besides which as none of you goes either to athens or to
bologna or to paris to study tis meet that what is meant for you
should be more diffuse than what is to be read by those whose minds have
been refined by scholarly pursuits
nor make i any doubt but there are yet others who will say that the said
stories are too full of jests and merry conceits and that it ill beseems
a man of weight and gravity to have written on such wise to these i am
bound to render and do render my thanks for that prompted by
wellmeant zeal they have so tender a regard to my reputation but to
that which they urge against me i reply after this sortthat i am of
weight i acknowledge having been often weighed in my time wherefore in
answer to the fair that have not weighed me i affirm that i am not of
gravity on the contrary i am so light that i float on the surface of the
water and considering that the sermons which the friars make when they
would chide folk for their sins are today for the most part full of
jests and merry conceits and drolleries i deemed that the like stuff
would not ill beseem my stories written as they were to banish womens
dumps however if thereby they should laugh too much they may be
readily cured thereof by the lament of jeremiah the passion of the
saviour or the complaint of the magdalen
and who shall question but that yet others there are who will say that i
have an evil tongue and venomous because here and there i tell the truth
about the friars now for them that so say there is forgiveness for that
tis not to be believed but that they have just cause seeing that the
friars are good folk and eschew hardship for the love of god and grind
intermittently and never blab and were they not all a trifle
malodorous intercourse with them would be much more agreeable
nevertheless i acknowledge that the things of this world have no
stability but are ever undergoing change and this may have befallen my
tongue albeit no great while ago one of my fair neighboursfor in
what pertains to myself i trust not my own judgment but forgo it to the
best of my powertold me twas the goodliest and sweetest tongue in the
world and in sooth when this occurred few of the said stories were yet
to write nor for that those who so tax me do it despitefully am i
minded to vouchsafe them any further answer
so then be every lady at liberty to say and believe whatever she may
think fit but tis now time for me to bring these remarks to a close
with humble thanks to him by whose help and guidance i after so long
travail have been brought to the desired goal and may you sweet my
ladies rest ever in his grace and peace and be not unmindful of me if
peradventure any of you may in any measure have been profited by
reading these stories
