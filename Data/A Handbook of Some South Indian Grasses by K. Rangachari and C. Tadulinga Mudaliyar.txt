preface
this book is intended to serve as a guide to the study of grasses of the
plains of south india for the past few years i have been receiving
grasses for identification almost every week from the officers of the
agricultural and forest departments and others interested in grasses
the requirements of these men and the absence of a suitable book induced
me to write this book
i have included in this book about one hundred grasses of wide
distribution in the plains of south india many of them occur also in
other parts of india the rarer grasses of the plains and those growing
on the hills are omitted with a view to deal with them separately
the value of grasses can be realized from the fact that man can supply
all his needs from them alone and their importance in agriculture is
very great as the welfare of the cattle is dependent upon grasses
farmers as a rule take no interest in them although profitable
agriculture is impossible without grasses very few of them can give the
names of at least half a dozen grasses growing on their land they
neglect grasses because they are common and are found everywhere they
cannot discriminate between them to a farmer grass is grass and that
is all he cares to trouble himself about about grasses robinson writes
grass is king it rules and governs the world it is the very
foundation of all commerce without it the earth would be a barren
waste and cotton gold and commerce all dead
in the early days when the population was very much limited and when
land not brought under cultivation was extensive plenty of green grasses
was upon it and pastures were numerous so the farmer paid no attention
to the grasses and it did not matter much but now population has
increased unoccupied land has decreased very much and the cattle have
increased in number consequently he has to pay more attention to
grasses
on account of the scarcity of fodder people interested in agriculture
and cattle rearing have very often imported foreign grasses and fodder
plants into this country but so far no one has succeeded in
establishing any one of them on any large scale usually a great amount
of labour and much money is spent in these attempts if the same amount
of attention is bestowed on indigenous grasses better results can be
obtained with less labour and money there are many indigenous grasses
that will yield plenty of stuff if they are given a chance to grow the
present deterioration of grasses is mainly due to overgrazing and
trampling by men and cattle
to prove the beneficial effects which result from preventing overgrazing
and trampling mr g r hilson deputy director of agriculture now
cotton expert selected some portion of the waste land in the
neighbourhood of the farm at hagari and closed it for men and cattle as
a result of this measure in two years a number of grasses and other
plants were found growing on the enclosed area very well and all of
them seeded well of course the unenclosed areas were bare as usual
in the preparation of this book i received considerable help from
mrry c tadulinga mudaliyar avargal fls assistant lecturing and
systematic botanist in the description of species and i am indebted to
mrry ps jivanna rao ma teaching assistant for assistance in
proofreading
i have to express my deep obligation to mr g a d stuart ics
director of agriculture for encouragement to undertake this work and to
the madras government for ordering its publication
for the excellence in the get up of the book i am indebted to mr f l

a handbook of some common south
indian grasses
chapter i
introduction
grasses occupy wide tracts of land and they are evenly distributed in
all parts of the world they occur in every soil in all kinds of
situations and under all climatic conditions in certain places grasses
form a leading feature of the flora as grasses do not like shade they
are not usually abundant within the forests either as regards the number
of individuals or of species but in open places they do very well and
sometimes whole tracts become grasslands then a very great portion of
the actual vegetation would consist of grasses
on account of their almost universal distribution and their great
economic value grasses are of great importance to man and yet very few
people appreciate the worth of grasses although several families of
plants supply the wants of man the grass family exceeds all the others
in the amount and the value of its products the grasses growing in
pasture land and the cereals grown all over the world are of more value
to man and his domestic animals than all the other plants taken
together
to the popular mind grasses are only herbaceous plants with narrow
leaves such as the hariali ginger grass and the kolakattai grass but
in the grass family or gramine the cereals sugarcane and bamboos are
also included
grasses are rather interesting in that they are usually successful in
occupying large tracts of land to the exclusion of other plants if we
take into consideration the number of individuals of any species of
grass they will be found to outnumber those of any species of any
other family even as regards the number of species this family ranks
fifth the first four places being occupied respectively by composit
leguminos orchide and rubiace
as grasses form an exceedingly natural family it is very difficult for
beginners to readily distinguish them from one another
the leaves and branches of grasses are very much alike and the flowers
are so small that they are liable to be passed by unnoticed the
recognition of even our common grasses is quite a task for a botanist
to understand the general structure of grasses and to become familiar
with them it is necessary to study closely some common grasses we shall
begin our study by selecting as a type one of the species of the genus
panicum
panicum javanicum is an annual herb with stems radiating in all
directions from a centre the plant is fixed to the soil by a tuft of
fibrous roots all springing from the bases of the stems in addition to
this crown of fibrous roots there may be roots at the nodes of some of
the prostrate branches the stems and branches are short at first and
leaves arise on them one after the other in rapid succession after the
appearance of a fair number of leaves the stem elongates gradually and
it finally ends in an inflorescence
illustration fig 1panicum javanicum full plant
the stem consists of nodes and internodes the internodes are
cylindrical and somewhat flattened on the side towards the axillary bud
when young they are completely covered by the leaves and the older ones
have only their lower portions covered by the leafsheaths usually they
complete their growth in length very soon but the lower portion of the
internode just above the node and enclosed by the sheath retains its
power of growth for some time
the leaf consists of the two parts the leafsheath and the
leafblade at the junction of these two parts there is a very thin
narrow membrane with fine hairs on its free margin this is called the
ligule see fig 2
the leafsheath is attached at its base to the node and it is slightly
swollen just above the place of insertion it covers the internode one
margin being inside and the other outside the surface of the sheath is
sparsely covered with long hairs springing from small tubercles the
outer margin of the sheath bears fine hairs all along its length see
fig 2
the leafblade is broadly lanceolate with a tip finely drawn out its
base is rounded and the margin wavy especially so towards the base on
the margin towards the base long hairs are seen and some of these arise
from small tubercles the margin has a hyaline border which is very
minutely serrate there is a distinct midrib and on holding the leaf
against the light four or five small veins come in to view in the
spaces between these veins lie many fine veins all the veins run
parallel from the base to the apex at the base of the blade the veins
get into the leafsheath and therefore the sheath becomes striated just
above the ligule and at the base of the leafblade there is a colourless
narrow zone this is called the collar
illustration fig 2leaf of panicum javanicum
a full leaf b a portion of the leaf showing 1 the ligule and 2 the
collar
as already stated the inflorescences appear at the free ends of
branches every branch sooner or later terminates in an inflorescence
which is a compound raceme there are usually five or six racemes in the
inflorescence each raceme has an axis called the rachis which bears
unilaterally two rows of budlike bodies these budlike bodies are the
units of the inflorescence and they are called spikelets see fig
3
illustration fig 3the inflorescence of panicum javanicum
1 inflorescence 2 and 3 the front and the back view of a raceme
the spikelets are softly hairy and are shortly stalked the pedicels of
spikelets are hairy and sometimes one or two long hairs are also found
on them each of these spikelets consists of four green membranous
structures called glumes the first two glumes are unequal the first
being very small the second and the third glumes are broadly
ovateoblong with acute tips both are of the same height and texture
but the second is 7nerved and the third 5nerved the fourth glume is
membranous when young but later on it becomes thick coriaceous and
rugose at the surface just opposite to the fourth glume there is a flat
structure with two nerves similar to the glume in texture this is
called the palea the fourth glume and its palea adhere together by
their margins inside the fourth glume and between it and the palea
there are three stamens and an ovary with two styles ending in feathery
stigmas just in front of the ovary and outside the stamens two very
small scalelike bodies are found these are the lodicules they are
fleshy and well developed in flowers that are about to open in the
spikelet there is only one full flower the third glume contains no
flower in it but occasionally there may be in its axil three stamens
the first two glumes are always empty and so they are called empty
glumes see fig 4 in mature spikelets the grain which is free is
enclosed by the fourth glume and its palea

chapter ii
the vegetative organs
grasses vary very much in their habit some grasses grow erect forming
tufts and others form cushions with the branches creeping along the
ground see figs 5 and 6 we usually find all intermediate stages
from the erect to the prostrate habit underground stems such as stolons
and rhizomes occur in some grasses grasses of one particular species
generally retain the same habit but this does not always hold good for
example tragus racemosus grows with all its branches quite prostrate
in a poor dry open soil if on the other hand this happens to grow
in rich soils or amidst other plants or grasses it assumes an erect
somewhat tufted habit andropogon contortus and andropogon pertusus
are other grasses with a tendency for variation in habit plants that
are usually small often attain large dimensions under favourable
conditions of growth ordinarily the grass panicum javanicum grows
only to 1 or 2 feet see fig 1 the same plant in a good rich soil
grew to about 6 feet in four months see fig 7
illustration fig 5eleusine gyptiaca
some grasses are annual while others are perennial it is often
difficult to determine whether a certain grass is annual or perennial
but by examining the shootsystem this can be ascertained easily in an
annual all the stems and branches usually end in inflorescences and they
will all be of the same year if on the other hand both young leafy
branches and old branches ending in inflorescences are found mixed it
must be a perennial grass the presence of the remains of old leaves
underground stolons and rhizomes is also evidence showing the perennial
character of the plant
grasses are eminently adapted to occupy completely large areas of land
they are also capable of very rapid extension over large areas on
account of the production of stolons rhizomes and the formation of
adventitious roots
the rootsystemthe rootsystem of grasses is very striking in its
character in most grasses especially in erect ones several roots all
of about the same diameter arise in a dense tuft from nearly the same
level and from the lowermost nodes of the stems the roots are all thin
and fibrous in the vast majority of these plants and they are tough and
wiry only in a few cases such as in the case of the roots of pennisetum
cenchroides p alopecuros ischmum pilosum and andropogon
schoenanthus
on a close examination it will become evident that all the roots of a
grass plant are adventitious inasmuch as the growth of the primary root
is soon overtaken by other roots growing from the stem all the roots
happen to be of the same size roots arise from the nodes just above the
insertion of the leaf and they grow piercing the leafsheath
illustration fig 6panicum crusgalli
grasses in which stolons and prostrate branches occur have in addition
to the usual radiating crown of roots at the base aerial roots growing
out of the upper nodes of the branches and fixing them to the soil such
roots become supporting or prop roots and are particularly conspicuous
in several stout tall grasses such as andropogon sorghum zea mays
and pennisetum typhoideum see figs 8 and 9
all the roots bear branchroots which originate from the inner portion
of the mother roots in the usual manner the character and the extent of
the development of the rootsystem is to a large extent dependent upon
the nature of the soil and its moisture content in light dry soils
roots remain generally stunted and in well drained rich soils they
attain their maximum development in clayey soils roots penetrate only
to short distances when the soil is rich and sandy roots go deeper and
extend in all directions the rootsystems of most grasses are
superficial and so are best adapted for surfacefeeding
illustration fig 7panicum javanicum
the shootsystemthe shootsystem varies with the duration of the
life of the plant in annual grasses stems are in most cases erect and
even if they are not entirely so they become erect at the time of
flowering they are attached to the soil by a tuft of fibrous roots
arising from the base of the stems but in perennials in addition to
erect branches creeping branches stolons and rhizomes may occur
illustration fig 8prop roots of andropogon sorghum
illustration fig 9aerial roots of ischmum ciliare
the stem is either cylindrical or compressed and consists of nodes and
internodes in most grasses the internodes are usually hollow the
cavity being lined by the remains of the original pith cells however
there are also grasses in which the stems remain solid throughout in
many grasses the basal portions of stems are more leafy and the
internodes are short but in the upper portions the internodes become
longer separating the leaves one from the other
in young shoots the leaves grow much faster than the internodes and
consequently internodes remain small and leaves become very
conspicuous the youngest portions of the shoots are by this means
always well protected by the surrounding leafsheaths as soon as leaves
have grown fully the internodes begin to elongate rapidly separating
the leaves at first growth in length takes place throughout its length
in the internode and when it gets older this elongation ceases but
however the lower portion of the internode close to the node and which
is enclosed by the leafsheath retains its power of growth for a
considerable time
branches arise from the axils of leaves and when a considerable number
of the axillary buds especially from the lower nodes develop into
branches the plant becomes tufted in habit in most grasses branches
grow upwards through the sheath and emerge at its mouth as aerial
branches such branches are called intravaginal branches or stems but
in some grasses axillary buds instead of growing straight up through
the sheath pierce the leafsheath come out and then they grow out as
branches this may be seen in the underground stolons of panicum
repens and in the ordinary aerial branches of arundo donax branches
that pierce through the sheaths are called extravaginal branches see
fig 10
illustration fig 10extravaginal shoots of 1 panicum repens and 2
arundo donax
illustration fig 11nodes
1 glabrous node 2 bearded node 3 node cut longitudinally
the nodes are in most cases very conspicuous and they are often found
swollen however it must be remembered that the enlargement at the node
is not due to the increase in size of the actual node but due to growth
in thickness of the base of the leafsheath see fig 113 nodes may
be pale or coloured glabrous hairy or bearded with long hairs when
the stem is erect the nodes are short and of uniform size all round
but if the stem is bent down or tipped over by accident the nodes
begin to grow longer on the lower side until a curvature sufficient to
bring the stem to the erect position is formed and then it ceases to
grow
as already noted some perennial grasses have creeping stems and stolons
while others may have rhizomes the grass cynodon dactylon develops
several underground stolons which are covered with white scale leaves
and whose terminal buds are hard and sharp so that they may be able to
make their way through the soil the rhizomes when continuous and
elongated are usually sympodia formed by the lower portions of the
aerial shoots the aerial shoot comes into the air and its lower portion
is continued by a branch arising from a lower leaf axil beneath the
soil
the leafleaves are tworanked and alternate and very often they
become crowded at the lower portions of the shoots so as to form basal
tufts though they are farther apart in the upper portions of these
shoots three distinct kinds of leaves are met with in grasses first
we have the fully formed foliage leaves so characteristic of grasses
these are most conspicuous and are formed in large numbers
the other two kinds of leaves are neither so conspicuous nor so numerous
as the foliage leaves at the base of shoots occur abortive leaves which
are really rudimentary sheaths these are called scales the third
kind of leaf is a modified structure called the prophyll or
prophyllum see fig 12 it is the first leaf occurring in every
branch on the side next to the main shoot and it is a twokeeled
membranous structure resembling somewhat the palea found in the
spikelets of grasses the portion of the prophyll between the keels is
concave due to the pressure of the main stem while the sides beyond the
keels bend forward clasping the stem
illustration fig 12prophylla

prophyllum
the ordinary foliage leaves of grasses consist of the two parts the
flat expanded upper portion called the blade and the lower part called
the sheath that encircles the stem above the node from which it
arises the leafsheaths usually fit close to the stem but they may
also be loose or even inflated though the leafsheath surrounds the
internode like a tube it is not a closed tube it is really a flat
structure rolled firmly round the stem with one edge overlapping the
other in most cases it is cylindrical and it may be compressed in a few
cases occasionally it may have a prominent ridge or keel down its back
the sheath may be glabrous or hairy smooth or striate externally and
the outer margin is often ciliate in a few grasses the sheaths become
coloured especially below or on the side exposed to the sun

the ligule is a structure peculiar to grasses and it varies very much
in some grasses it is a distinct membrane narrow or broad with an even
truncate or erose margin or finely ciliate very often it is only a
line or fringe of hairs whilst in some it may be entirely absent as in
the leaves of panicum colonum when it is a membrane it may be broad
and oblong ovate and obtuse or lanceolate and acute see fig 13
the function of the ligule is probably to facilitate the shedding of
water which may run down the leaf and thus lessen the danger of rotting
of the stem which is sure to follow if the water were to find its way
into the interior of the sheath sometimes in addition to the ligule
other appendages may be present in grass leaves as in oryza sativa
such outgrowths are called auricles or auricular outgrowths see
fig 13
the leafblade is well developed in the foliage leaves and in most cases
it follows directly on the sheath but in bamboos and some species of
ischmum there occurs a short petiole or stalk between the leafblade
and the sheath the sheath corresponds morphologically to the leaf base
of a leaf of other flowering plants
illustration fig 15margins of leaves
1 and 2 finely serrate 3 glandular 4 and 5 very minutely serrate
6 very minutely serrate and ciliate
in grasses the leafblades usually grow more in length than in any other
direction and there is no limit to the length they may attain some
grasses have very short leaves others very long ones the leafblade in
most grasses is more or less of some elongated form such as linear
linearlanceolate lanceolate etc see fig 14 in a few grasses the
leafblade is ovate but this is a rare condition therefore in noting
the general shape of the leafblade the relation of the length to the
breadth the amount of tapering towards the apex and base and the nature
of the apex should be considered
the veins in the leafblade can usually be seen on holding the leaf up
to the light all the veins run parallel in most cases the midrib is
prominent and in some cases there may be also a distinct keel amongst
the veins running through the leafblade some are large and prominent
while others are small and not conspicuous on account of this
disparity very often ridges and furrows become prominent on the upper
or lower or on both the surfaces of the leafblades generally the two
surfaces of the leafblade are distinct and they may be glabrous or
hairy in most grasses the surfaces are rough or scabrid to the touch
owing to the presence of regular rows of exceedingly fine sharp pointed
minute hairs
the apex of the blade is generally sharp and pointed acute or
acuminate or sometimes it may be drawn to a very fine point by gradual
tapering blunt or obtuse tips are not altogether absent but it is not
a common feature the leafblades in panicum colonum and in some
species of andropogon are rounded or obtuse at the apex
the margins of the leafblade are somewhat hyaline and they may be
perfectly even or cut into serrations of fine teeth in various ways
see fig 15 in addition to these minute teeth there may be long or
short cilia sometimes the margins are glandular as in eragrostis
willdenoviana and eragrostis major
the base of the leaf may be narrower broader than or about the same as
the breadth of the leafsheath it may be rounded amplexicaul or
narrowed at the base and just above the ligular region there will
always be a white distinct zone in the lamina of all grasses called the
collar this collar varies in length and breadth according to the
species of grass

convolute 1 and 2 leafsheaths 3 and 4 leafblades
in young shoots all the leafblades are usually found folded at the
terminal portions in most cases the leafblade is rolled up inwards
from one end to the other so that one margin is inside and the other
outside this folding is termed convolute this is the kind of folding
that is found in most grasses however there are some grasses such as
eleusine gyptiaca and chloris barbata in which the folding is
different in these grasses the laminas are folded flat on their midribs
so that each half of the blade is folded flat on the other the inner
surfaces being in contact the leaves are said to be conduplicate in
this case when the leaves are conduplicate the shoots are more or less
compressed see fig 16
chapter iii
the inflorescence and flower
the flowers of grasses are reduced to their essential organs the
stamens and the pistil the flowers are aggregated together on distinct
shoots constituting the inflorescence of grasses sooner or later all
the branches of a grassplant terminate in inflorescences which usually
stand far above the foliage leaves as in other flowering plants in
grasses also different forms of inflorescence are met with but in
grasses the unit of the inflorescence is the spikelet and not the
flower
the forms of inflorescence usually met with are the spike raceme and
panicle when the spikelets are sessile or borne directly along an
elongated axis as in enteropogon melicoides the inflorescence is a
spike if the spikelets borne by the axis are all stalked however
short the pedicels may be it is a raceme it must however be
remembered that true spikes are very rare an inflorescence may appear
to be a spike but on a close examination it will be seen to consist of
spikelets more or less pedicelled such an inflorescence strictly
speaking is a spiciform raceme the branches of the inflorescence in
paspalum scrobiculatum or panicum javanicum are racemes and the
whole inflorescence is a compound raceme the inflorescence is a
panicle when the spikelets are borne on secondary tertiary or further
subdivided branches panicles differ very much in appearance according
to the relative length and stoutness of the branches in eragrostis
tremula the panicle is very diffuse in eragrostis willdenoviana less
so the panicle in sporobolus coromandelianus is pyramidal and the
branches are all verticillate the lower being longer than the upper
the branches of a panicle are usually loose spreading or drooping in
most grasses but in some species of grasses such as pennisetum
alopecuros and setaria glauca the paniculate inflorescences become
so contracted that the pedicels and the short branches are hidden and
the inflorescence appears to be a spike such inflorescences as these
are called spiciform panicles the inflorescences in several species
of andropogon consist of racemes so much modified as to appear exactly
like a spike what looks like a spike in these cases consists of a
jointed axis and each joint bears a pair of spikelets one sessile and
the other pedicelled
the name rachis is given to the axis of the spike raceme and panicle
whether the axis is the main one or of the branch the rachis of the
inflorescence is usually cylindrical in some grasses it is zigzag as in
pennisetum cenchroides it is very much flattened in paspalum
scrobiculatum but somewhat trigonous in digitaria sanguinalis in
very many grasses the rachis is continuous but in a few cases it
consists of internodes or joints which disarticulate at maturity many
species of andropogon have such jointed rachises sometimes the joints
become greatly thickened and the surface hollowed out the spikelets
fitting in the cavities as in rottboellia and manisuris
in panicles especially when they are diffuse the primary branches may
be disposed irregularly or in verticils on the main axis for example in
the panicle of eragrostis willdenoviana the branches are irregularly
disposed whereas in sporobolus coromandelianus the branches are
verticillate in both these grasses fleshy cushions are developed in the
axils of the branches these swellings help to spread out the branches
especially at the time of anthesis the branches at the top spread out
earlier than those below
sometimes at the base of the rachises main or secondary glandular
streaks are seen as in the rachises of sporobolus coromandelianus
these glands secrete a viscid juice at the time of anthesis
illustration fig 17the spikelet of dinebra arabica
1 and 2 empty glumes 3 4 5 and 6 flowering glumes with flowers
the spikelet may be considered as a specialised branch consisting of a
short axis the rachilla bearing a series of modified bracts the
glumes the lower pair being empty but the others bearing flowers in
their axils the glumes are tworanked and imbricating as a type for
the spikelet that of an eragrostis or dinebra may be chosen see fig
17 in this spikelet the rachilla bears a number of glumes alternating
and imbricating the first two glumes at the base of the spikelet do not
bear any flowers and so these two glumes are usually called empty
glumes this is the case in almost all the species of grasses the third
and the subsequent glumes are regularly arranged on the slender rachilla
alternately in two rows in the axils of each of these glumes there is a
flower except perhaps in the topmost glume the flower is usually
enclosed by the glume and another structure found opposite the glume and
differing very much from the glume this is the palea it is attached
to the axis of the flower and its back is towards the rachilla
generally there are two nerves in a palea and its margins are enclosed
within those of the glume the palea is homologous with the prophyllum
which it very much resembles the prophyllum is usually found in the
branches of grasses but it is not confined to grasses alone it occurs
in the branches of some species of commelina
the spikelets vary very much in their structure the spikelets in
grasses of several genera consist of only four glumes as usual the
first two glumes are empty and the remaining two are flowerbearing
glumes both these glumes may have perfect flowers as in isachne or the
terminal one may contain a perfect flower the lower having either a
staminate flower or only a palea very often the spikelets are unisexual
and the male and female spikelets may be on the same plant as in coix
lachrymajobi and polytoca barbata or they may be on different
plants as in spinifex squarrosus
the glumes of a spikelet are really modified bracts and some
differentiate the flowering glumes from the empty ones by giving them
different names the first two empty glumes are called glumes by all
agrostologists some in europe call the flowering glume lower palea to
distinguish it from the real palea which they call the upper palea some
american authors have recently adopted for the flowering glume the term
lemma introduced by piper
considerable variation is met with in the case of the empty glumes
generally they are unequal the first being smaller very often the
first glume becomes very small and it may be altogether absent in some
species of panicum the first glume is very small in digitaria it is
very minute and in paspalum and eriochloa it is entirely suppressed the
flowering glumes are generally uniform when there are many in the
spikelet having only four glumes the fourth glume differs from the
others mainly in texture instead of being thin and herbaceous it
becomes rigid and hard smooth or rugose externally as in panicum
flowering glumes instead of being like empty glumes become very thin
shorter and hyaline in andropogon sometimes the flowering glumes are
awned all of them may be awned as in chloris or only the fourth glume
as in andropogon
the palea is fairly uniform in its structure in many grasses but it is
also subject to variation it becomes shorter in some and is absent in
others instead of having two nerves it may have one and rarely more
than two the palea can easily be distinguished from the glume because
its insertion in the spikelet is different from that of the glume
illustration fig 18flower of chloris
1 lodicules 2 stamens 3 ovary
the lodicules are small organs and they are the vestiges of the
perianth in most grasses there are only two but in ochlandra and other
bamboos we meet with three lodicules there are also some species with
many lodicules in shape they are mostly of some form referable to the
cuneate form they are of somewhat elongated form in aristida and
chloris the function of the lodicules seems to be to separate the glume
and its palea so as to enable the stamens to come out and hang freely at
the time of anthesis so it is only at the time of the opening of the
flowers that the lodicules are at their best then they are fairly
large fleshy and thick and conspicuous in the bud stage they are
usually small and after the opening of the flower they shrivel up and
are inconspicuous there are also species of grasses in which the
lodicules are not found
the stamens are three in number in the majority of grasses and six are
met with in leersia hygrorhiza and bamboos each stamen consists of a
very delicate long filament and an anther basifixed to the filament but
as the anthers are long and the connective is reduced to its minimum
they appear as if versatile when the stamens are out when there are
three stamens one stands in front of the flowering glumes and the other
two in front of the palea one opposite each edge of the palea the
relative positions of the parts of the floret are shown in the floral
diagrams see figs 18 and 19
illustration fig 19floral diagrams
the first is that of chloris second of panicum and the third of oryza
the pistil consists of an ovary and two styles ending in plumose
stigmas the ovary is 1celled and 1ovuled it is one carpelled
according to the views of hackel and his followers and there are also
some who consider it as 3carpelled because of the occurrence of three
styles in the pistil of some bamboos
the rachilla is usually well developed and elongated in manyflowered
spikelets while in 1flowered spikelets it remains very small so that
the flower appears to be terminal it often extends beyond the insertion
of the terminal flower and its glume and then lies hidden appressed to
the palea this may be seen in the spikelets of the species of cynodon
this prolonged rachilla sometimes bears a minute glume which is of
course rudimentary usually the glumes are rather close together on the
rachilla so that the internodes are very short but in some grasses as
in dinebra arabica the glumes are rather distant and so the
internodes are somewhat longer and conspicuous in some species of
panicum the rachilla is jointed to the pedicel below the empty glumes
whereas it is articulated just above these glumes in chloris barbata
sometimes the rachilla is articulated between the flowers this is the
case in the spikelet of dinebra arabica
pollination in most grasses is brought about by wind though in a few
cases selfpollination occurs the terminal position of the
inflorescence its protrusion far above the level of the foliage leaves
the swinging and dangling anthers the abundance of nonsticking pollen
and the plumose stigmas are all intended to facilitate pollination by
wind furthermore the stamens and the stigmas do not mature at the same
time in some grasses the stamens mature earlier protandry while in
others the stigmas protrude long before the stamens protogyny as
the result of the pollination the ovary developes into a dry 1seeded
indehiscent fruit the seed fills the cavity fully and the pericarp
fuses with the seedcoat and so they are inseparable such a fruit is
termed a caryopsis or grain though in the vast majority of grasses
the pericarp is inseparable in a few cases it is free from the
seedcoat as in sporobolus indicus and eleusine indica

the caryopsis consists of an embryo on one side at the base and the
endosperm occupies the remaining portion the embryo can be made out on
the side of the grain facing the glume as it is outlined as an oval
area on the other face of the grain which is towards the palea the
hilum is seen at the base the grain varies in shape considerably it
may be rounded oval ellipsoidal narrow and cylindrical oblong terete
or furrowed there is considerable variation as regards the colour also
the embryo consists of an axis and a scutellum the axis which is
differentiated into the plumule directed upward and the radicle
downward is small and straight and it is covered more or less by the
edges of the scutellum the scutellum is attached to the axis at about
its middle and its outer surface is in contact with the endosperm this
is an important organ as its function is to absorb nourishment from the
endosperm during germination the scutellum is considered to represent
the first leaf or cotyledon the endosperm consists mostly of starch
just outside the endosperm and within the epidermis lies a layer of
cells containing much proteid substance this layer is called the
aleurone layer see fig 21 as an illustration of the caryopsis
the grain of andropogon sorghum may be studied all the structural
details are shown in fig 20 which is a longitudinal section of the
grain
the primary axis of the embryo is enclosed by a closed sheath both above
and below the sheath which envelopes the radicle is called coleorhiza
and that of the plumule pileole or germsheath
chapter iv
histology of the vegetative organs
the shoots and roots of grasses conform in their internal structure to
the monocotyledonous type in all grasses numerous threads are found
running longitudinally within the stem and some of these pass into the
leaves at the nodes and run as nerves in the blades of the leaves
these threads are the vascular bundles the rest of the tissue of the
stem and leaves consists of thinwalled parenchymatous cells of
different sorts
the general structure of these bundles is more or less the same in all
grasses a vascular bundle consists of only xylem and phlom without
the cambium and so no secondary thickening can take place in the stems
of grasses such bundles as these are called closed vascular bundles
to distinguish them from the dicotyledonous type of vascular bundles
which are called open vascular bundles on account of the existence of
the cambium
illustration fig 22transverse section of a vascular bundle  250
1 annular vessel 2 spiral vessel 3 pitted vessel 4 phlom or
sieve tubes 5 sclerenchyma
the component parts and elements of which the vascular bundles in
grasses are composed may be learnt by studying the transverse and
longitudinal sections of these bundles in any grass the cross and
longitudinal sections of a vascular bundle of the stem of pennisetum
cenchroides are shown in figs 22 and 23 in the figure of the
transverse section the two large cavities indicated by the number 3 and
the two small circular cavities with thick walls lying between the
larger ones and indicated by the numbers 1 and 2 are the chief elements
of the xylem
by looking at the longitudinal section it is obvious that these elements
are really vessels the larger being pitted and the smaller annular and
spiral vessels these vessels together with the numerous small
thickwalled cells lying between the pitted vessels constitute the
xylem just above the xylem there is a group of large and small
thinwalled cells this is the phlom and it consists of sieve tubes and
thinwalled cells all round the xylem and the phlom there are many
thickwalled cells these are really fibres forming the bundlesheath
on account of this bundlesheath the bundles are called fibrovascular
bundles

structure of the stemthe stem of a grass consists of a mass of
parenchymatous cells with a number of fibrovascular bundles imbedded in
it and it is covered externally by a protective layer of cells the
epidermis the stem is usually solid in all grasses in the young stage
but as it matures the internodes become hollow in many grasses and they
remain solid in a few in the internodes the fibrovascular bundles run
longitudinally and are parallel but in the nodes they run in all
directions and form a net work from which emerge a few bundles to enter
the leaves so far as the broad general features are concerned the
stems of many grasses are more or less similar in structure however
when we take into consideration the arrangement of bundles the
development and arrangement of sclerenchyma every species of grass has
its own special characteristics and these are so striking and constant
that it may be possible to identify the species from these characters
alone
we may take as a type the stem of rottboellia exaltata this stem is
somewhat semicircular in transverse section and it is almost straight
and flat in the front the side towards the axillary bud the
peripheral portion of the stem becomes somewhat rigid and thick due to
the aggregation of vascular bundles some small and others large the
outermost series of bundles consisting of small and larger bundles are
in contact with the layers of the cells lying just beneath the epidermis
and these cells are also thickwalled a few are away from these being
separated by three or four layers of cells from the peripheral bundles
in all these vascular bundles the bundlesheath is very strongly
developed all round and is very much developed especially at the sides
it is this great development of sclerenchyma that makes the outer
portion of the cortex hard within the ground tissue are found a number
of vascular bundles scattered more or less uniformly these bundles have
no continuous bundlesheaths but have instead groups of fibres at the
sides and in front of the phlom the cavities near the annular vessels
are somewhat larger and conspicuous in these bundles
illustration fig 25transverse section of the stem of pennisetum
cenchroides  20
the epidermal cells are all thickened very much and the outer layer is
cutinized and impregnated with silica this is the case in the epidermis
of the stems and leaves of most grasses see fig 24
in order to give a general idea of the variations in the structure of
the stem in grasses a few examples are chosen and the details of the
structure of the stems of these grasses are dealt with here
illustration fig 26transverse section of a portion of the stem of
pennisetum cenchroides  70
1 epidermis 2 sclerenchyma 3 vascular bundle
the stem of pennisetum cenchroides is somewhat round in outline in the
transverse section with a slight curvature in the front the vascular
bundles are rather numerous and irregularly scattered all over the
ground tissue the peripheral bundles are not so close to the periphery
of the stem as in rottboellia exaltata these are separated from the
epidermis by several layers of parenchymatous cells further these
peripheral bundles are all imbedded in a continuous sclerenchymatous
band which runs round the stem in the form of a ring the epidermal
cells as well as the layer of cells in immediate contact with it are
thickwalled in the vascular bundles of the ground tissue the
bundlesheath is rather prominent and the phlom portion is well
developed see figs 25 and 26
illustration fig 27transverse section of the stem of eriochloa
polystachya  25
in the stem of eriochloa polystachya all the vascular bundles are
more or less peripheral in position leaving a wide area of
parenchymatous cells in the centre the outline of the stem in cross
section is rotund or ovaterotund with the front side somewhat flattened
and straight the epidermal cells alone are thickened a well developed
continuous ring of sclerenchyma is present and this is connected with
the epidermal layer at short intervals by means of short
sclerenchymatous bands so the parenchymatous cells of the cortex lying
outside the sclerenchymatous ring are divided into small isolated areas
there are three series of vascular bundles
illustration fig 28transverse section of a portion of the stem of
eriochloa polystachya  70
1 epidermis 2 sclerenchyma 3 vascular bundle
one series consists of small bundles lying inside the sclerenchyma ring
at the base of each of the connecting bands the second series is made
up of large vascular bundles imbedded in the ring so as to bulge out
inside the ring the vascular bundles of the third series are found just
away from the ring and separated from it by a few layers of
parenchymatous cells see figs 27 and 28

another stem in which the vascular bundles are more or less peripheral
in position and enclosing a wide parenchyma is that of setaria glauca
in the transverse section of the stem the outline is ovate laterally
compressed obtusely keeled at the back and somewhat concave in the
front the sclerenchymatous band is narrow and continuous and very close
to the epidermis being separated from it only by two or three layers of
thinwalled cells the epidermal cells alone are thickened as to the
vascular bundles there are three sets one set of bundles lying just
outside the sclerenchymatous ring consists of small ones connecting the
ring with the epidermis just inside the sclerenchymatous ring lies a
series of bundles which are connected with it still inside at some
distance from the sclerenchymatous band are seen vascular bundles
forming a row and enclosing a large space of the ground tissue
consisting of only parenchyma see figs 29 and 30

the stem of panicum ramosum is semicircular and somewhat flat on one
side the epidermal cells alone are thickened there is a broad well
developed continuous band of sclerenchyma which is connected at regular
intervals with the epidermis by small vascular bundles another row of
vascular bundles lies just inside the sclerenchymatous ring and each of
these bundles is in contact with the band away from the ring lie a
number of bundles forming a series disposed in two irregular rings
around a broad portion of the ground tissue see figs 31 and 32

with them are thickwalled the sclerenchymatous ring though present is
very narrow and not very conspicuous it consists of one or two layers
of cells connecting a few vascular bundles forming the outermost set
there is a series of vascular bundles inside the ring which surrounds a
large area of the ground tissue two isolated bundles one in front and
another at the back of the ground tissue are found the cells of the
ground tissue lying just inside the vascular bundles are all very much
thickened see figs 33 and 34

the stems of panicum isachne and eragrostis interrupta are hollow
the stem of the former is circular in outline in cross section though
wavy there is a sclerenchymatous ring close to the epidermis but
separated from it by a few layers of parenchyma one set of bundles is
imbedded in the band and another set just touches the inner border of
it a third series is disposed around a fairly large amount of ground
tissue which may or may not have a cavity in the centre the stem of
eragrostis interrupta has more or less the same structure but the
cortex has air spaces here and there other minor differences may be
seen on referring to figs 35 and 36
illustration fig 39transverse section of a portion of the stem of
panicum colonum  70
1 epidermis 2 sclerenchyma 3 vascular bundle
the stems of grasses growing in wet or marshy situations differ in
structure from those detailed above as examples the stems of panicum
flavidum panicum colonum panicum crusgalli and panicum
fluitans may be considered the stem of panicum flavidum is broadly
ovate in cross section with a flat front and is more or less solid
though occasionally the parenchymatous cells in the centre get broken
two rows of vascular bundles surround a fairly large amount of
parenchymatous cells of the ground tissue there is a continuous ring of
sclerenchyma separated from the epidermis by a fairly broad cortex the
cortex has a number of fairly large aircavities separated by bands of
parenchymatous cells within the sclerenchymatous band lie small
vascular bundles at regular intervals just towards the cortex a few
isolated bundles are in contact with the inner border see figs 37 and
38
the stems of panicum colonum panicum stagninum and panicum
crusgalli have in their centre in the ground tissue stellate cells
with aircavities this part is surrounded by a fairly broad portion of
parenchymatous cells in which are imbedded two rows of bundles outside
these bundles runs round the stem a narrow sclerenchymatous band with a
few bundles in it of which some touch it inside and others outside two
bundles are found by themselves in the tissue of stellate cells in
panicum crusgalli three or four bundles are met with amidst the
stellate cells

panicum crusgalli  70

the cortex outside the band of sclerenchyma is full of aircavities
small and large in panicum colonum the outline of the stem is
ellipsoidal with the front quite flat and the cortex is narrow at the
sides and very broad in front and at the back the sclerenchymatous ring
is circular in outline the stem of panicum crusgalli is broadly
ovoid and the cortex is uniformly broad the epidermal cells as well as
the lower cells are thickened in the stems of panicum fluitans and
panicum crusgalli but in the stems of panicum colonum and panicum
flavidum the epidermis alone is thickened in the cortical portion
outside the sclerenchymatous band small vascular bundles occur in the
stems of panicum colonum panicum crusgalli and panicum fluitans
see figs 39 40 42 and 43

the stem of panicum fluitans is round in outline in the transverse
section and has a large cavity just close to the cavity and separated
from it by only one or two parenchymatous cells are found vascular
bundles forming a series outside this series of bundles lies a
sclerenchymatous band which is wavy following the lower edges of the
large aircavities one series of bundles is connected with this
sclerenchymatous ring the aircavities are large and uniform and are
separated by bands of parenchymatous cells in each of these bands lies
a vascular bundle on the upper side near the periphery sometimes we
find especially in young stages diaphragms of stellulate cells
stretched across the aircavities later as the stem matures these
disappear and the cavities become conspicuous see figs 42 and 43
structure of the rootas already stated the roots of grasses
conform to the monocotyledonous type but the variations met with in
their structure are not so great as in the case of the stem the
roottips are protected by rootcaps and the actual tip of the root is
very distinct in the roots of all grasses and it can be seen very
clearly in a longitudinal section of the root the actual tip of the
root is sharply distinct from the rootcap as there are two distinct
sets of cells one giving rise to the roottip and the other to the
rootcap
the young roottips are always free from roothairs and they are
confined to the portions behind the roottips the extent of the
roothair region will vary according to the vigour and development of
the roots and the nature of the soil the roothairs are mere
protrusions of the cells of the outermost layer of the cortex of the
root and this layer is called the piliferous layer

pericycle 6 xylem 7 phlom
to learn the structure of the roots of grasses we may select as types
the roots of pennisetum cenchroides and andropogon sorghum and
consider their structural details in the transverse sections of these
roots we find a fairly broad cortex consisting of thinwalled
parenchymatous cells more or less regularly arranged see figs 44 and
45 just below the piliferous layer two or three layers of thickwalled
cells are seen in the roots of andropogon sorghum these thickwalled
cells are very conspicuous as they consist of several layers these
layers of thickwalled cells constitute the exodermis see fig 46
the innermost layer of cells of the cortex is called the endodermis
and it becomes conspicuous on account of the thickening in the lateral
and inner walls of the cells of this layer see figs 44 and 47

andropogon sorghum  25

rh roothair pl piliferous layer ex exodermis co cortex
the rest of the root forming the central core is the stele and at its
periphery there is a single layer of cells called the pericycle the
arrangement of the xylem and the phlom is different from that of the
stem they lie side by side on different radii and not one behind the
other on the same radius as in the stem the number of xylem groups is
fairly large and the development of the xylem is from the pericycle
towards the centre of the stele see figs 44 and 45 the
parenchymatous cells in the centre of the stele become thickwalled in
older roots
structure of the leafthe structure of the leaf of grasses is quite
characteristic of the family in every leaf a number of vascular
bundles some small and others large pass from the base to the apex
externally the leaf is covered on both the sides by the epidermis the
spaces existing between the vascular bundles and the epidermis are
filled with parenchymatous cells the larger vascular bundles consist of
xylem and phlom surrounded by a bundle sheath of a single layer of
cells in the smaller bundles the xylem is very much reduced around
every vascular bundle there is a single row of somewhat large cells
densely packed with large chloroplasts the chlorophyllous layer the
vascular bundles are strengthened by fibres on both the sides in the
case of larger bundles and on only one side in small bundles

for a detailed study of the structure of the leaves of grasses the leaf
of the grass panicum javanicum may be chosen in a transverse section
of this leaf the vascular bundles are very conspicuous the larger
bundles are normal in every way while in the smaller ones the xylem
elements are considerably reduced around every one of the vascular
bundles there is a single row of large cells containing large
chlorophyll grains the chlorophyllous layer in a well developed large
vascular bundle the chlorophyllous layer is open below just close to the
sclerenchymatous band on both sides of the larger vascular bundle there
are bands of sclerenchyma in the case of smaller bundles some are
strengthened by sclerenchyma on the lower side and others have none the
spaces between the bundles are occupied by thinwalled parenchymatous
cells containing small chlorophyll grains

javanicum  300
illustration fig 50lower epidermis of the leaf of panicum
javanicum  300
the lower epidermis of the leaf in the transverse section is even and
consists of small and large round cells the upper epidermis is slightly
wavy and it is made up of some small round cells alternating with groups
of larger cells the epidermal cells lying over sclerenchyma and the
smaller vascular bundles are small and round while those lying over the
furrows between the vascular bundles are large and are called motor or
bulliform cells the presence of motor cells is a characteristic
feature of the leaves of many grasses
the continuity of both the upper and the lower epidermis is interrupted
by the stomata aircavities are seen below these stomata the
arrangement of the stomata the shape of the guard cells and the
characteristics of the epidermal cells become clear on examining a piece
of epidermis see figs 49 and 50
the structure of the leaf of panicum javanicum may be taken as typical
of the structure of the leaves of most grasses the leaves of eriochloa
polystachya cynodon and paspalums are very much like the leaves of
panicum javanicum in their internal structure
considerable amount of variation however occurs in the leaves of
grasses especially as regards the arrangement of fibres and motor cells

of eriochloa polystachya  120
1 motor cell 2 stomata 3 sclerenchyma 4 chlorophyllous layer
every large primary vascular bundle in the leaves of many grasses
possesses sclerenchymatous bands both above and below the other
vascular bundles may have bands of sclerenchyma on both sides or on one
side only or none for example in the leaves of panicum repens both
the primary and secondary bundles are provided with sclerenchyma on both
the sides while those of the third order may have it on one side or
not the hyaline margin of this leaf and of the leaves of other grasses
consists entirely of sclerenchyma see fig 53
illustration fig 52transverse section of a portion of the leaf of
panicum repens  120
1 motor cells 2 stomata 3 sclerenchyma 4 chlorophyllous layer
all the vascular bundles in the leaves of aristida setacea have broad
sclerenchymatous bands on both the sides besides these bands arranged
like a girder above and below each bundle there are on the lower side
bands of sclerenchyma so the sclerenchyma becomes almost continuous on
the lower side

the sclerenchyma lying on the lower side of the primary bundles are
contiguous with the bundle while those above are separated from the
bundle by the chlorophyllous layer see fig 55 in the case of
secondary and tertiary bundles the sclerenchymatous bands lying on the
lower side are in contact with the chlorophyllous layer whereas the
upper bands are either in contact with this layer or separated from it
by a few parenchymatous cells
all the vascular bundles in the leaves of eragrostis willdenoviana are
provided with sclerenchyma on both the sides the lower band of the
primary vascular bundles is continuous with the vascular bundle the
chlorophyllous layer being open below the upper bands of the primary
and the lower bands of the secondary vascular bundles just touch the
chlorophyllous layer in the secondary bundles the sclerenchyma band
above is separated from the chlorophyllous layer by two layers of
parenchyma in the case of the leaves of panicum flavidum p
colonum p fluitans and pennisetum cenchroides the sclerenchyma is
separated from the chlorophyllous layer by layers of parenchyma

even from the few examples dealt with above it is obvious that the
range of variation of sclerenchyma in leaves is very great in the
leaves of aristida setacea there is a considerable amount of
sclerenchyma whilst in some leaves such as those of panicum colonum
p flavidum and panicum fluitans the sclerenchyma is reduced to its
minimum

panicum fluitans  30

in the leaves of grasses growing in dry situations the development of
sclerenchyma is generally very considerable the grass aristida
setacea is a good example of a xerophytic grass the seashore grass
spinifex squarrosus is another example of the same kind but in the
leaves of this grass the development of sclerenchyma is not very
considerable but there is a great development of parenchymatous cells
free from chlorophyll within the leaf the chlorophyll bearing cells
being confined to the upper and the lower surfaces of the leaves

the upper and the lower surfaces of the leaves of many grasses are more
or less even but in the case of a few grasses the upper surface
consists of ridges and furrows instead of being even in the leaves of
panicum repens and eragrostis willdenoviana the upper surface is
wavy and consists of shallow furrows and slightly raised ridges but in
the leaves of aristida setacea and panicum fluitans the furrows are
deeper and the ridges are more prominent in aristida setacea the
ridges are flattopped and they are rounded with broad furrows in
panicum fluitans

the epidermis covering the leaves consists of elongated cells with plane
or sinuous walls various kinds of short cells intercalated between the
ends of long cells motorcells and stomata hairs of different sorts
occur as outgrowths of the epidermis the roughness of the surface of
the leaves of grasses is due to the presence of very minute short hairs
borne by the epidermis in most cases these short hairs are found in
regular rows although the epidermis is more or less even in the leaves
of several grasses such as panicum repens p flavidum and
eriochloa polystachya it is wavy or undulating in the leaves of a few
grasses for example the upper epidermis in the leaves of panicum
fluitans is undulating as it follows the contour of the ridges and
furrows
the epidermal cells have even surfaces in the leaves of most grasses but
in some they bulge out in the leaves of panicum flavidum the cells of
the lower epidermis are quite even whilst those of the upper epidermis
bulge out the cells of both the upper and the lower epidermis are
distinctly bulging out in the leaves of panicum colonum in panicum
fluitans the cells of the upper epidermis bulge out so much as to form
distinct papill
the free surface of the epidermis is more or less cutinised in the
leaves of all grasses in some leaves the cuticle is very thick and even
papillate as in the leaves of aristida setacea and panicum repens
whilst in others it is very thin as in the leaves of panicum colonum
and p fluitans cutinisation is rather prominent in the leaves of
grasses growing under dry conditions and it is less pronounced in
mesophytic grasses

as regards size the epidermal cells overlying the sclerenchyma are
small and those lying over parenchyma are larger amongst the larger
cells some may be motorcells the stomata occur in regular rows between
the vascular bundles and they are quite characteristic of grasses they
are more or less similar in structure in all grasses in the leaves of
many grasses stomata are found in both the upper and the lower epidermis
and they are confined to the lower epidermis in a few grasses only
the motorcells vary very much both as regards their shape and position
in some leaves as in the leaves of the grass panicum flavidum the
motorcells are confined to the midrib on the upper surface
the epidermal cells of this leaf are large and uniformly round see
figs 66 and 67

in the case of most grasses the motorcells are found in groups of
three four or five between the vascular bundles the central motorcell
is usually the largest and it is somewhat obovate in shape in a
transverse section of the leaf in the leaves of panicum javanicum and
eriochloa polystachya there are three or four motor cells in the group
and the group consists of four five or rarely six motor cells in the
leaves of eragrostis willdenoviana when there are distinct furrows
between ridges these cells lie in the furrows and they are many in
number in the leaves of panicum repens there are five to seven
motorcells in the furrows and the single row of cells stretched between
the motorcells and the lower epidermis in the furrow consists of more
or less clear cells with sparsely scattered small chlorophyll grains
see fig 52 the motorcells occupying the furrows in the leaves of
aristida setacea are more in number than in panicum repens and are
of a different shape all the cells lying in the furrow between the
motorcells and the sclerenchyma are clear cells free from chlorophyll
grains
although the motorcells differ in shape from the ordinary epidermal
cells in most grasses there are however a few grasses in which the
motorcells do not differ very much from the epidermal cells except in
size for example in the leaves of panicum colonum the motorcells
are just like the ordinary epidermal cells in shape but are larger see
fig 64
motorcells are usually confined to the upper epidermis but they may
also be found in the lower epidermis in the leaves of pennisetum
cenchroides motorcells are found in both the upper and the lower
epidermis the group in the upper epidermis alternating with that in the
lower

classification
the family gramine is usually divided into two series taking into
consideration the presence or absence of a joint in the pedicel or
rachis the number of flowers in the spikelet and the position of the
fertile flower all the species in which there is a joint just below the
spikelet in the pedicel in the rachis or at the base of a cluster of
spikelets come under one series panicace the spikelets of the
grasses coming under this series when mature fall away singly by
themselves or with their pedicels or in groups with portions of the
rachis the spikelets are all similar and consist of usually four
glumes each spikelet contains a single perfect flower and sometimes in
addition a staminate flower just below the perfect flower in this
series the tendency for imperfection is always confined to the lower
flowers the terminal flower alone being perfect for inclusion under
this series the grass plant should have both the characters
articulation and position of the flower as mentioned above
the second series poace includes those grasses in which the spikelets
are one to manyflowered and continuous with their pedicels but the
rachilla of the spikelet may be jointed just above the empty glumes or
between the flowering glumes the complete flower is the lowest and the
tendency for imperfection is in the upper flowers
of the two series the panicace appears to be more highly developed than
the poace

tribe ipanice
this is a fairly large and important tribe flourishing mostly in the
warm regions and the tropics it is very well represented in south india
and fifteen genera are met with
the inflorescence varies very much within this tribe and consists of
spikes racemes and panicles the spikelets are usually fourglumed and
contain one terminal perfect flower and a staminate or neutral flower
below but in the genus isachne both the flowers are perfect in some
grasses the spikelets contain only staminate or pistillate flowers in
coix and polytoca the plant bears both male and female spikelets in the
same inflorescence but in zea on the same plant they occur as distinct
inflorescences the littoral grass spinifex is dioecious
the first glume of the spikelet is the smallest in panicum it is nearly
twothirds or less than the third glume it is very small in digitaria
and entirely suppressed in paspalum in eriochloa it is reduced to a
minute ridge lying just close to the swollen ringlike joint of the
rachilla the second and the third glumes are more or less equal and
similar in texture the fourth glume becomes firm and rigid along with
its palea and usually encloses the grain
the pedicel is jointed in some genera and in others it is continuous
with the spikelet and not jointed when mature the spikelets fall away
either by themselves singly with their pedicels or in groups with
portions of rachis according to the position of the joint bristles
branchlets are often found on the pedicels in setaria a few are borne
by the pedicels the bristles form a regular involucre at the base of a
group of spikelets in pennisetum and in cenchrus these become united at
the base into a mass forming a kind of burr around the spikelets

tribes ii and iiioryze and zoysie
oryze is a very small tribe with a few genera which usually flourish
in marshes the spikelets are in panicles 1flowered and the flower is
usually perfect in oryza there are three glumes the first two being
very minute and there is only a single glume in leersia and hygrorhiza
there are usually six stamens the palea becomes firm in texture like
the glume instead of remaining hyaline and so it is often mistaken for
a glume the spikelets are jointed on their pedicels and fall away from
them

this grass grows usually gregariously in somewhat sheltered situations
all over the presidency on the plains and low hills this is an
excellent fodder grass it forms fairly large tufts with plenty of green
leaves on rich moist soils when the leaves are young cattle eat this
grass very eagerly but do not seem to care for it when the leaves
become old however by frequent grazing it can be made to produce young
leaves in succession this grass is also an excellent soil binder as
its roots form a perfect matting in any kind of moist soil soon after
planting this is very difficult to eradicate when once established

branches are tufted and are usually decumbent at base leaves quite
green and somewhat broad in s coromandelianus and in s
commutatus branches are usually not decumbent at base generally erect
from the base and leaves are green glaucous and somewhat narrow the
most striking difference however is in the panicle the branches of
the panicle are always stiff and horizontal in s coromandelianus and
the spikelets are appressed to the branches and never spreading or
drooping whereas in s commutatus the branches are never stiff and
horizontal always obliquely ascending and the spikelets are spreading
and drooping judging from living plants these two are undoubtedly
distinct and so this plant is treated as a distinct species retaining

this species is a tall robust one resembling chloris barbata in its
inflorescence but with larger spikeletsas large as those of chloris
tenella no doubt it is closely allied to chloris barbata but
differs from it by having larger spikelets that are 3 to 5awned and 1
to 3flowered and the nerves being bearded throughout their length with
long hairs
specimens of this grass were sent to kew and calcutta herbariums for
identification and they were named c montana with which i could not
agree
so again i sent these specimens along with specimens of what i
considered c montana to dr stapf at kew through mr gamble and dr
stapf wrote about these thuswe have not been able to match it with
any of the described species of chloris and mr ranga acharya will be
fully justified in describing it as a new species we have had it apart

this grass is a very variable plant and has a few varieties the one
described above is var koenigii stapf and this is the one that
occurs very widely the other two varieties which occur very rarely are
1 diarrhena stapf and 2 tenuissima stapf the former is a tall
plant with very narrow panicle and spikelets and the latter either tall
or short and with a panicle bearing very slender divaricate branches
