translators preface
nietzsche wrote the rough draft of the case of wagner in turin during
the month of may 1888 he completed it in sils maria towards the end of
june of the same year and it was published in the following autumn
nietzsche contra wagner was written about the middle of december 1888
but although it was printed and corrected before the new year it was not
published until long afterwards owing to nietzsches complete breakdown in
the first days of 1889
in reading these two essays we are apt to be deceived by their virulent
and forcible tone into believing that the whole matter is a mere cover
for hidden firea mere blind of sthetic discussion concealing a deep and
implacable personal feud which demands and will have vengeance in spite
of all that has been said to the contrary many people still hold this
view of the two little works before us and as the actual facts are not
accessible to every one and rumours are more easily believed than
verified the error of supposing that these pamphlets were dictated by
personal animosity and even by nietzsches envy of wagner in his glory
seems to be a pretty common one another very general error is to suppose
that the point at issue here is not one concerning music at all but
concerning religion it is taken for granted that the aspirations the
particular quality the influence and the method of an art like music
are matters quite distinct from the values and the conditions prevailing
in the culture with which it is in harmony and that however many
christian elements may be discovered in wagnerian texts nietzsche had no
right to raise sthetic objections because he happened to entertain the
extraordinary view that these christian elements had also found their way
into wagnerian music
to both of these views there is but one replythey are absolutely false
in the ecce homo nietzsches autobiographya book which from cover to
cover and line for line is sincerity itselfwe learn what wagner actually
meant to nietzsche on pages 41 44 84 122 129 c we cannot doubt
that nietzsche is speaking from his heartand what does he sayin
impassioned tones he admits his profound indebtedness to the great
musician his love for him his gratitude to himhow wagner was the only
german who had ever been anything to himhow his friendship with wagner
constituted the happiest and most valuable experience of his lifehow his
breach with wagner almost killed him and when we remember too that
wagner on his part also declared that he was alone after he had lost
that man nietzsche we begin to perceive that personal bitterness and
animosity are out of the question here we feel we are on a higher plane
and that we must not judge these two men as if they were a couple of
little business people who had had a suburban squabble
nietzsche declares ecce homo p 24 that he never attacked persons as
persons if he used a name at all it was merely as a means to an end
just as one might use a magnifying glass in order to make a general but
elusive and intricate fact more clear and more apparent and if he used
the name of david strauss without bitterness or spite for he did not
even know the man when he wished to personify culturephilistinism so
in the same spirit did he use the name of wagner when he wished to
personify the general decadence of modern ideas values aspirations and
art
nietzsches ambition throughout his life was to regenerate european
culture in the first period of his relationship with wagner he thought
that he had found the man who was prepared to lead in this direction for
a long while he regarded his master as the saviour of germany as the
innovator and renovator who was going to arrest the decadent current of
his time and lead men to a greatness which had died with antiquity and so
thoroughly did he understand his duties as a disciple so wholly was he
devoted to this cause that in spite of all his unquestioned gifts and
the excellence of his original achievements he was for a long while
regarded as a mere literary lackey in wagners service in all those
circles where the rising musician was most disliked
gradually however as the young nietzsche developed and began to gain an
independent view of life and humanity it seemed to him extremely doubtful
whether wagner actually was pulling the same way with him whereas
theretofore he had identified wagners ideals with his own it now dawned
upon him slowly that the regeneration of german culture of european
culture and the transvaluation of values which would be necessary for
this regeneration really lay off the track of wagnerism he saw that he
had endowed wagner with a good deal that was more his own than wagners
in his love he had transfigured the friend and the composer of parsifal
and the man of his imagination were not one the fact was realised step by
step disappointment upon disappointment revelation after revelation
ultimately brought it home to him and though his best instincts at first
opposed it the revulsion of feeling at last became too strong to be
scouted and nietzsche was plunged into the blackest despair had he
followed his own human inclinations he would probably have remained
wagners friend until the end as it was however he remained loyal to
his cause and this meant denouncing his former idol
joyful wisdom thus spake zarathustra beyond good and evil the
genealogy of morals the twilight of the idols the antichristall
these books were but so many exhortations to mankind to step aside from
the general track now trodden by europeans and what happened wagner
began to write some hard things about nietzsche the world assumed that
nietzsche and wagner had engaged in a paltry personal quarrel in the
press and the whole importance of the real issue was buried beneath the
human alltoohuman interpretations which were heaped upon it
nietzsche was a musician of no mean attainments for a long while in his
youth his superiors had been doubtful whether he should not be educated
for a musical career so great were his gifts in this art and if his
mother had not been offered a sixyears scholarship for her son at the
famous school of pforta nietzsche the scholar and philologist would
probably have been an able composer when he speaks about music
therefore he knows what he is talking about and when he refers to
wagners music in particular the simple fact of his long intimacy with
wagner during the years at tribschen is a sufficient guarantee of his
deep knowledge of the subject now nietzsche was one of the first to
recognise that the principles of art are inextricably bound up with the
laws of life that an sthetic dogma may therefore promote or depress all
vital force and that a picture a symphony a poem or a statue is just
as capable of being pessimistic anarchic christian or revolutionary as
a philosophy or a science is to speak of a certain class of music as
being compatible with the decline of culture therefore was to nietzsche
a perfectly warrantable association of ideas and that is why throughout
his philosophy so much stress is laid upon sthetic considerations
but if in england and america nietzsches attack on wagners art may still
seem a little incomprehensible let it be remembered that the continent
has long known that nietzsche was actually in the right every year
thousands are now added to the large party abroad who have ceased from
believing in the great musical revolutionary of the seventies that he was
one with the french romanticists and rebels has long since been
acknowledged a fact in select circles both in france and germany and if
we still have wagner with us in england if we still consider nietzsche as
a heretic when he declares that wagner was a musician for unmusical
people it is only because we are more removed than we imagine from all
the great movements intellectual and otherwise which take place on the
continent
in wagners music in his doctrine in his whole concept of art nietzsche
saw the confirmation the promotionaye even the encouragement of that
decadence and degeneration which is now rampant in europe and it is for
this reason although to the end of his life he still loved wagner the
man and the friend that we find him on the very eve of his spiritual
death exhorting us to abjure wagner the musician and the artist

preface to the third edition1
in spite of the adverse criticism with which the above preface has met at
the hands of many reviewers since the summer of last year i cannot say
that i should feel justified even after mature consideration in altering
a single word or sentence it contains if i felt inclined to make any
changes at all these would take the form of extensive additions tending
to confirm rather than to modify the general argument it advances but
any omissions of which i may have been guilty in the first place have
been so fully rectified since thanks to the publication of the english
translations of daniel halvys and henri lichtenbergers works the life
of friedrich nietzsche2 and the gospel of superman3 respectively
that were it not for the fact that the truth about this matter cannot be
repeated too often i should have refrained altogether from including any
fresh remarks of my own in this third edition
in the works just referred to pp 129 et seq in halvys book and pp
78 et seq in lichtenbergers book the statement i made in my preface
to thoughts out of season vol i and which i did not think it
necessary to repeat in my first preface to these pamphlets will be found
to receive the fullest confirmation
the statement in question was to the effect that many long years before
these pamphlets were even projected nietzsches apparent volteface in
regard to his hero wagner had been not only foreshadowed but actually
stated in plain words in two works written during his friendship with
wagnerthe works referred to being the birth of tragedy 1872 and
wagner in bayreuth 1875 of which houston stuart chamberlain declares
not only that it possesses undying classical worth but that a perusal
of it is indispensable to all who wish to follow the question of wagner
to its roots4
the idea that runs through the present work like a leitmotifthe idea that
wagner was at bottom more of a mime than a musicianwas so far an ever
present thought with nietzsche that it is ever impossible to ascertain the
period when it was first formulated
in nietzsches wonderful autobiography ecce homo p 88 in the
section dealing with the early works just mentioned we find the following
passagein the second of the two essays wagner in bayreuth with a
profound certainty of instinct i already characterised the elementary
factor in wagners nature as a theatrical talent which in all his means
and aspirations draws its final conclusions and as early as 1874
nietzsche wrote in his diarywagner is a born actor just as goethe was
an abortive painter and schiller an abortive orator so wagner was an
abortive theatrical genius his attitude to music is that of the actor
for he knows how to sing and speak as it were out of different souls and
from absolutely different worlds tristan and the meistersinger
there is however no need to multiply examples seeing as i have said
that in the translations of halvys and lichtenbergers books the reader
will find all the independent evidence he could possibly desire
disproving the popular and even the learned belief that in the two
pamphlets before us we have a complete apparently unaccountable and
therefore demented volteface on nietzsches part nevertheless for
fear lest some doubt should still linger in certain minds concerning this
point and with the view of adding interest to these essays the editor
considered it advisable in the second edition to add a number of
extracts from nietzsches diary of the year 1878 ten years before the
case of wagner and nietzsche contra wagner were written in order to
show to what extent those learned critics who complain of nietzsches
morbid and uncontrollable recantations and revulsions of feeling have
overlooked even the plain facts of the case when forming their
alltoohasty conclusions these extracts will be found at the end of
nietzsche contra wagner while reading them however it should not be
forgotten that they were never intended for publication by nietzsche
himselfa fact which accounts for their unpolished and sketchy formand
that they were first published in vol xi of the first german library
edition pp 99129 only when he was a helpless invalid in 1897 since
then in 1901 and 1906 respectively they have been reprinted once in the
large german library edition vol xi pp 181202 and once in the
german pocket edition as an appendix to humanalltoohuman part ii
an altogether special interest now attaches to these pamphlets for in
the first place we are at last in possession of wagners own account of
his development his art his aspirations and his struggles in the
amazing selfrevelation entitled my life5 and secondly we now have
ecce homo nietzsches autobiography in which we learn for the first
time from nietzsches own pen to what extent his history was that of a
double devotionto wagner on the one hand and to his own life task the
transvaluation of all values on the other
readers interested in the nietzschewagner controversy will naturally look
to these books for a final solution of all the difficulties which the
problem presents but let them not be too sanguine from first to last
this problem is not to be settled by facts a good deal of instinctive
choice instinctive aversion and instinctive suspicion are necessary
here a little more suspicion for instance ought to be applied to
wagners my life especially in england where critics are not half
suspicious enough about a continental artists selfrevelations and are
too prone if they have suspicions at all to apply them in the wrong
place
an example of this want of finesse in judging foreign writers is to be
found in lord morleys work on rousseaua book which ingenuously takes
for granted everything that a writer like rousseau cares to say about
himself without considering for an instant the possibility that rousseau
might have practised some hypocrisy in regard to wagners life we might
easily fall into the same errorthat is to say we might take seriously
all he says concerning himself and his family affairs
we should beware of this and should not even believe wagner when he
speaks badly about himself no one speaks badly about himself without a
reason and the question in this case is to find out the reason did
wagnerin the belief that genius was always immoralwish to pose as an
immoral egotist in order to make us believe in his genius of which he
himself was none too sure in his innermost heart did wagner wish to
appear sincere in his biography in order to awaken in us a belief in
the sincerity of his music which he likewise doubted but wished to
impress upon the world as true or did he wish to be thought badly of in
connection with things that were not true and that consequently did not
affect him in order to lead us off the scent of true things things he
was ashamed of and which he wished the world to ignorejust like rousseau
the similarity between the two is more than a superficial one who
barbarously pretended to have sent his children to the foundling hospital
in order not to be thought incapable of having had any children at all in
short where is the bluff in wagners biography let us therefore be
careful about it and all the more so because wagner himself guarantees
the truth of it in the prefatory note if we were to be credulous here we
should moreover be acting in direct opposition to nietzsches own counsel
as given in the following aphorisms nos 19 and 20 p 89
it is very difficult to trace the course of wagners developmentno
trust must be placed in his own description of his souls experiences he
writes partypamphlets for his followers
it is extremely doubtful whether wagner is able to bear witness about
himself
while on p 37 the note we readhe wagner was not proud enough to
be able to suffer the truth about himself nobody had less pride than he
like victor hugo he remained true to himself even in his biographyhe
remained an actor
however as a famous english judge has saidtruth will come out even in
the witness box and as we may add in this case even in an
autobiography there is one statement in wagners my life which sounds
true to my ears at leasta statement which in my opinion has some
importance and to which wagner himself seems to grant a mysterious
significance i refer to the passage on p 93 of vol i in which wagner
saysowing to the exceptional vivacity and innate susceptibility of my
nature  i gradually became conscious of a certain power of transporting
or bewildering my more indolent companions
this seems innocent enough when however it is read in conjunction with
nietzsches trenchant criticism particularly on pp 14 15 16 17 and 18
of this work and also with a knowledge of wagners music it becomes one
of the most striking passages in wagners autobiography for it records
how soon he became conscious of his dominant instinct and faculty
i know perfectly well that the wagnerites will not be influenced by these
remarks their gratitude to wagner is too great for this he has supplied
the precious varnish wherewith to hide the dull ugliness of our
civilisation he has given to souls despairing over the materialism of
this world to souls despairing of themselves and longing to be rid of
themselves the indispensable hashish and morphia wherewith to deaden
their inner discords these discords are everywhere apparent nowadays
wagner is therefore a common need a common benefactor as such he is
bound to be worshipped and adored in spite of all egotistical and
theatrical autobiographies
albeit signs are not wantingat least among his anglosaxon worshippers
who stand even more in need of romanticism than their continental
brethrenwhich show that in order to uphold wagner people are now
beginning to draw distinctions between the man and the artist they
dismiss the man as humanalltoohuman but they still maintain that
there are divine qualities in his music however distasteful the task of
disillusioning these psychological tyros may be they should be informed
that no such division of a man into two parts is permissible save in
christianity the body and the soul but that outside purely religious
spheres it is utterly unwarrantable there can be no such strange divorce
between a bloom and the plant on which it blows and has a black woman
ever been known to give birth to a white child
wagner as nietzsche tells us on p 19 was something complete he was a
typical decadent in whom every sign of free will was lacking in whom
every feature was necessary wagner allow me to add was a typical
representative of the nineteenth century which was the century of
contradictory values of opposed instincts and of every kind of inner
disharmony the genuine the classical artists of that period such men as
heine goethe stendhal and gobineau overcame their inner strife and
each succeeded in making a harmonious whole out of himselfnot indeed
without a severe struggle for everyone of them suffered from being the
child of his age ie a decadent the only difference between them and
the romanticists lies in the fact that they the former were conscious of
what was wrong with them and possessed the will and the strength to
overcome their illness whereas the romanticists chose the easier
alternativenamely that of shutting their eyes on themselves
i am just as much a child of my age as wagnerie i am a decadent
says nietzsche the only difference is that i recognised the fact that i
struggled against it6
what wagner did was characteristic of all romanticists and contemporary
artists he drowned and overshouted his inner discord by means of
exuberant pathos and wild exaltation far be it from me to value wagners
music in extenso herethis is scarcely a fitting opportunity to do
sobut i think it might well be possible to show on purely psychological
grounds how impossible it was for a man like wagner to produce real art
for how can harmony order symmetry mastery proceed from uncontrolled
discord disorder disintegration and chaos the fact that an art which
springs from such a marshy soil may like certain paludal plants be
wonderful gorgeous and overwhelming cannot be denied but true
art it is not it is so just as little as gothic architecture isthat
style which in its efforts to escape beyond the tragic contradiction in
its medival heart yelled its hysterical cry heavenwards and even melted
the stones of its structures into a quivering and fluid jet in order to
give adequate expression to the painful and wretched conflict then raging
between the body and the soul
that wagner too was a great sufferer there can be no doubt not
however a sufferer from strength like a true artist but from
weaknessthe weakness of his age which he never overcame it is for this
reason that he should be rather pitied than judged as he is now being
judged by his german and english critics who with thoroughly neurotic
suddenness have acknowledged their revulsion of feeling a little too
harshly
i have carefully endeavoured not to deride or deplore or detest says
spinoza but to understand and these words ought to be our guide not
only in the case of wagner but in all things
inner discord is a terrible affliction and nothing is so certain to
produce that nervous irritability which is so trying to the patient as
well as to the outer world as this socalled spiritual disease nietzsche
was probably quite right when he said the only real and true music that
wagner ever composed did not consist of his elaborate arias and overtures
but of ten or fifteen bars which dispersed here and there gave
expression to the composers profound and genuine melancholy but this
melancholy had to be overcome and wagner with the blood of a cabotin in
his veins resorted to the remedy that was nearest to handthat is to say
the art of bewildering others and himself thus he remained ignorant about
himself all his life for there was as nietzsche rightly points out p
37 note not sufficient pride in the man for him to desire to know or
to suffer gladly the truth concerning his real nature as an actor his
ruling passion was vanity but in his case it was correlated with a
semiconscious knowledge of the fact that all was not right with him and
his art it was this that caused him to suffer his egomaniacal behaviour
and his almost rousseauesque fear and suspicion of others were only the
external manifestations of his inner discrepancies but to repeat what i
have already said these abnormal symptoms are not in the least
incompatible with wagners music they are rather its very cause the root
from which it springs
in reality therefore wagner the man and wagner the artist were
undoubtedly one and constituted a splendid romanticist his music as well
as his autobiography are proofs of his wonderful gifts in this direction
his success in his time as in ours is due to the craving of the modern
world for actors sorcerers bewilderers and idealists who are able to
conceal the illhealth and the weakness that prevail and who please by
intoxicating and exalting but this being so the world must not be
disappointed to find the hero of a preceding age explode in the next it
must not be astonished to find a disparity between the heros private life
and his elevating art or romantic and idealistic gospel as long as
people will admire heroic attitudes more than heroism such
disillusionment is bound to be the price of their error in a truly great
man lifetheory and lifepractice if seen from a sufficiently lofty
point of view must and do always agree in an actor in a romanticist in
an idealist and in a christian there is always a yawning chasm between
the two which whatever wellmeaning critics may do cannot be bridged
posthumously by acrobatic feats in psychologicis
let anyone apply this point of view to nietzsches life and theory let
anyone turn his life inside out not only as he gives it to us in his
ecce homo but as we find it related by all his biographers friends and
foes alike and what will be the result even if we ignore his worksthe
blooms which blowed from time to time from his lifewe absolutely cannot
deny the greatness of the mans private practice and if we fully
understand and appreciate the latter we must be singularly deficient in
instinct and in flair if we do not suspect that some of this greatness
is reflected in his lifetask

the case of wagner a musicians problem
a letter from turin may 1888
ridendo dicere severum
preface
i am writing this to relieve my mind it is not malice alone which makes
me praise bizet at the expense of wagner in this essay amid a good deal
of jesting i wish to make one point clear which does not admit of levity
to turn my back on wagner was for me a piece of fate to get to like
anything else whatever afterwards was for me a triumph nobody perhaps
had ever been more dangerously involved in wagnerism nobody had defended
himself more obstinately against it nobody had ever been so overjoyed at
ridding himself of it a long historyshall i give it a nameif i were a
moralist who knows what i might not call it perhaps a piece of
selfmasterybut the philosopher does not like the moralist neither
does he like highfalutin words
what is the first and last thing that a philosopher demands of himself to
overcome his age in himself to become timeless with what then does the
philosopher have the greatest fight with all that in him which makes him
the child of his time very well then i am just as much a child of my age
as wagnerie i am a decadent the only difference is that i
recognised the fact that i struggled against it the philosopher in me
struggled against it
my greatest preoccupation hitherto has been the problem of decadence
and i had reasons for this good and evil form only a playful
subdivision of this problem if one has trained ones eye to detect the
symptoms of decline one also understands moralityone understands what
lies concealed beneath its holiest names and tables of values eg
impoverished life the will to nonentity great exhaustion morality
denies life in order to undertake such a mission i was obliged to
exercise selfdisciplinei had to side against all that was morbid in
myself including wagner including schopenhauer including the whole of
modern humanitya profound estrangement coldness and soberness towards
all that belongs to my age all that was contemporary and as the highest
wish zarathustras eye an eye which surveys the whole
phenomenonmankindfrom an enormous distancewhich looks down upon
itfor such a goalwhat sacrifice would not have been worth while what
selfmastery what selfdenial
the greatest event of my life took the form of a recovery wagner
belongs only to my diseases
not that i wish to appear ungrateful to this disease if in this essay i
support the proposition that wagner is harmful i none the less wish to
point out unto whom in spite of all he is indispensableto the
philosopher anyone else may perhaps be able to get on without wagner but
the philosopher is not free to pass him by the philosopher must be the
evil conscience of his agebut to this end he must be possessed of its
best knowledge and what better guide or more thoroughly efficient
revealer of the soul could be found for the labyrinth of the modern
spirit than wagner through wagner modernity speaks her most intimate
language it conceals neither its good nor its evil it has thrown off all
shame and conversely one has almost calculated the whole of the value
of modernity once one is clear concerning what is good and evil in wagner
i can perfectly well understand a musician of today who says i hate
wagner but i can endure no other music but i should also understand a
philosopher who said wagner is modernity in concentrated form there is
no help for it we must first be wagnerites
1
yesterdaywould you believe iti heard bizets masterpiece for the
twentieth time once more i attended with the same gentle reverence once
again i did not run away this triumph over my impatience surprises me
how such a work completes one through it one almost becomes a
masterpiece oneselfand as a matter of fact each time i heard carmen
it seemed to me that i was more of a philosopher a better philosopher
than at other times i became so forbearing so happy so indian so
settled to sit for five hours the first step to holinessmay i be
allowed to say that bizets orchestration is the only one that i can
endure now that other orchestration which is all the rage at presentthe
wagnerianis brutal artificial and unsophisticated withal hence its
appeal to all the three senses of the modern soul at once how terribly
wagnerian orchestration affects me i call it the sirocco a
disagreeable sweat breaks out all over me all my fine weather vanishes
bizets music seems to me perfect it comes forward lightly gracefully
stylishly it is lovable it does not sweat all that is good is easy
everything divine runs with light feet this is the first principle of my
sthetics this music is wicked refined fatalistic and withal remains
popularit possesses the refinement of a race not of an individual it
is rich it is definite it builds organises completes and in this
sense it stands as a contrast to the polypus in music to endless
melody have more painful more tragic accents ever been heard on the
stage before and how are they obtained without grimaces without
counterfeiting of any kind free from the lie of the grand stylein
short this music assumes that the listener is intelligent even as a
musicianthereby it is the opposite of wagner who apart from everything
else was in any case the most illmannered genius on earth wagner
takes us as if   he repeats a thing so often that we become
desperatethat we ultimately believe it
and once more i become a better man when bizet speaks to me also a
better musician a better listener is it in any way possible to listen
betteri even burrow behind this music with my ears i hear its very
cause i seem to assist at its birth i tremble before the dangers which
this daring music runs i am enraptured over those happy accidents for
which even bizet himself may not be responsibleand strange to say at
bottom i do not give it a thought or am not aware how much thought i
really do give it for quite other ideas are running through my head the
while has any one ever observed that music emancipates the spirit
gives wings to thought and that the more one becomes a musician the more
one is also a philosopher the grey sky of abstraction seems thrilled by
flashes of lightning the light is strong enough to reveal all the details
of things to enable one to grapple with problems and the world is
surveyed as if from a mountain topwith this i have defined philosophical
pathosand unexpectedly answers drop into my lap a small hailstorm of
ice and wisdom of problems solved where am i bizet makes me
productive everything that is good makes me productive i have gratitude
for nothing else nor have i any other touchstone for testing what is
good
2
bizets work also saves wagner is not the only saviour with it one
bids farewell to the damp north and to all the fog of the wagnerian
ideal even the action in itself delivers us from these things from
merime it has this logic even in passion from him it has the direct
line inexorable necessity but what it has above all else is that which
belongs to subtropical zonesthat dryness of atmosphere that
limpidezza of the air here in every respect the climate is altered
here another kind of sensuality another kind of sensitiveness and another
kind of cheerfulness make their appeal this music is gay but not in a
french or german way its gaiety is african fate hangs over it its
happiness is short sudden without reprieve i envy bizet for having had
the courage of this sensitiveness which hitherto in the cultured music of
europe has found no means of expressionof this southern tawny sunburnt
sensitiveness what a joy the golden afternoon of its happiness is to us
when we look out with this music in our minds we wonder whether we have
ever seen the sea so calm and how soothing is this moorish dancing
how for once even our insatiability gets sated by its lascivious
melancholyand finally love love translated back into nature not the
love of a cultured girlno sentasentimentality7 but love as fate
as a fatality cynical innocent crueland precisely in this way
nature the love whose means is war whose very essence is the mortal
hatred between the sexesi know no case in which the tragic irony which
constitutes the kernel of love is expressed with such severity or in so
terrible a formula as in the last cry of don jos with which the work
ends
yes it is i who have killed her
imy adored carmen
such a conception of love the only one worthy of a philosopher is rare
it distinguishes one work of art from among a thousand others for as a
rule artists are no better than the rest of the world they are even
worsethey misunderstand love even wagner misunderstood it they
imagine that they are selfless in it because they appear to be seeking the
advantage of another creature often to their own disadvantage but in
return they want to possess the other creature even god is no
exception to this rule he is very far from thinking what does it matter
to thee whether i love thee or nothe becomes terrible if he is not
loved in return lamourand with this principle one carries ones point
against gods and menest de tous les sentiments le plus goiste et par
consquent lorsquil est bless le moins gnreux b constant

perhaps you are beginning to perceive how very much this music improves
meil faut mditerraniser la musique and i have my reasons for this
principle beyond good and evil pp 216 et seq the return to
nature health good spirits youth virtueand yet i was one of the
most corrupted wagnerites i was able to take wagner seriously oh this
old magician what tricks has he not played upon us the first thing his
art places in our hands is a magnifying glass we look through it and we
no longer trust our own eyeseverything grows bigger even wagner grows
bigger what a clever rattlesnake throughout his life he rattled
resignation loyalty and purity about our ears and he retired from
the corrupt world with a song of praise to chastityand we believed it
all
but you will not listen to me you prefer even the problem of wagner
to that of bizet but neither do i underrate it it has its charm the
problem of salvation is even a venerable problem wagner pondered over
nothing so deeply as over salvation his opera is the opera of salvation
someone always wants to be saved in his operasnow it is a youth anon it
is a maidthis is his problemand how lavishly he varies his
leitmotif what rare and melancholy modulations if it were not for
wagner who would teach us that innocence has a preference for saving
interesting sinners the case in tannhauser or that even the eternal
jew gets saved and settled down when he marries the case in the
flying dutchman or that corrupted old females prefer to be saved by
chaste young men the case of kundry or that young hysterics like to be
saved by their doctor the case in lohengrin or that beautiful girls
most love to be saved by a knight who also happens to be a wagnerite the
case in the mastersingers or that even married women also like to be
saved by a knight the case of isolde or that the venerable almighty
after having compromised himself morally in all manner of ways is at last
delivered by a free spirit and an immoralist the case in the ring
admire more especially this last piece of wisdom do you understand it
itake good care not to understand it that it is possible to draw yet
other lessons from the works above mentionedi am much more ready to
prove than to dispute that one may be driven by a wagnerian ballet to
desperationand to virtue once again the case in tannhauser that
not going to bed at the right time may be followed by the worst
consequences once again the case of lohengrinthat one can never be
too sure of the spouse one actually marries for the third time the case
of lohengrin tristan and isolde glorifies the perfect husband who
in a certain case can ask only one question but why have ye not told me
this before nothing could be simpler than that reply
that i cannot tell thee
and what thou askest
that wilt thou never learn
lohengrin contains a solemn ban upon all investigation and questioning
in this way wagner stood for the christian concept thou must and shalt
believe it is a crime against the highest and the holiest to be
scientific the flying dutchman preaches the sublime doctrine that
woman can moor the most erratic soul or to put it into wagnerian terms
save him here we venture to ask a question supposing that this were
actually true would it therefore be desirablewhat becomes of the
eternal jew whom a woman adores and enchains he simply ceases from
being eternal he marriesthat is to say he concerns us no
longertransferred into the realm of reality the danger for the artist
and for the geniusand these are of course the eternal jewsresides in
woman adoring women are their ruin scarcely any one has sufficient
character not to be corruptedsaved when he finds himself treated as a
godhe then immediately condescends to womanman is a coward in the face
of all that is eternally feminine and this the girls knowin many cases
of womans love and perhaps precisely in the most famous ones the love
is no more than a refined form of parasitism a making ones nest in
anothers soul and sometimes even in anothers fleshah and how
constantly at the cost of the host
we know the fate of goethe in oldmaidish moralincorroded germany he was
always offensive to germans he found honest admirers only among jewesses
schiller noble schiller who cried flowery words into their earshe
was a man after their own heart what did they reproach goethe withwith
the mount of venus and with having composed certain venetian epigrams
even klopstock preached him a moral sermon there was a time when herder
was fond of using the word priapus when he spoke of goethe even
wilhelm meister seemed to be only a symptom of decline of a moral
going to the dogs the menagerie of tame cattle the worthlessness of
the hero in this book revolted niebuhr who finally bursts out in a
plaint which biterolf8 might well have sung nothing so easily makes
a painful impression as when a great mind despoils itself of its wings
and strives for virtuosity in something greatly inferior while it
renounces more lofty aims but the most indignant of all was the
cultured womanall smaller courts in germany every kind of puritanism
made the sign of the cross at the sight of goethe at the thought of the
unclean spirit in goethethis history was what wagner set to music he
saves goethe that goes without saying but he does so in such a clever
way that he also takes the side of the cultured woman goethe gets saved
a prayer saves him a cultured woman draws him out of the mire
as to what goethe would have thought of wagnergoethe once set himself
the question what danger hangs over all romanticiststhe fate of
romanticistshis answer was to choke over the rumination of moral and
religious absurdities in short parsifal the philosopher writes
thereto an epilogue holinessthe only remaining higher value still seen
by the mob or by woman the horizon of the ideal for all those who are
naturally shortsighted to philosophers however this horizon like
every other is a mere misunderstanding a sort of slamming of the door in
the face of the real beginning of their worldtheir danger their ideal
their desideratum in more polite language la philosophie ne suffit pas
au grand nombre il lui faut la saintet

i shall once more relate the history of the ring this is its proper
place it is also the history of a salvation except that in this case it
is wagner himself who is savedhalf his lifetime wagner believed in the
revolution as only a frenchman could have believed in it he sought it
in the runic inscriptions of myths he thought he had found a typical
revolutionary in siegfriedwhence arises all the evil in this world
wagner asked himself from old contracts he replied as all
revolutionary ideologists have done in plain english from customs laws
morals institutions from all those things upon which the ancient world
and ancient society rests how can one get rid of the evil in this world
how can one get rid of ancient society only by declaring war against
contracts traditions morality this siegfried does he starts early
at the game very earlyhis origin itself is already a declaration of war
against moralityhe is the result of adultery of incest not the saga
but wagner himself is the inventor of this radical feature in this matter
he corrected the saga siegfried continues as he began he follows only
his first impulse he flings all tradition all respect all fear to the
winds whatever displeases him he strikes down he tilts irreverently at
old godheads his principal undertaking however is to emancipate
womanto deliver brunnhilda siegfried and brunnhilda the sacrament
of free love the dawn of the golden age the twilight of the gods of old
moralityevil is got rid of for a long while wagners ship sailed
happily along this course there can be no doubt that along it wagner
sought his highest goalwhat happened a misfortune the ship dashed on
to a reef wagner had run aground the reef was schopenhauers philosophy
wagner had stuck fast on a contrary view of the world what had he set
to music optimism wagner was ashamed it was moreover an optimism for
which schopenhauer had devised an evil expressionunscrupulous
optimism he was more than ever ashamed he reflected for some time his
position seemed desperate at last a path of escape seemed gradually to
open before himwhat if the reef on which he had been wrecked could be
interpreted as a goal as the ulterior motive as the actual purpose of
his journey to be wrecked here this was also a goalbene navigavi cum
naufragium feci  and he translated the ring into schopenhauerian
language everything goes wrong everything goes to wrack and ruin the
new world is just as bad as the old onenonentity the indian circe
beckons  brunnhilda who according to the old plan had to retire with a
song in honour of free love consoling the world with the hope of a
socialistic utopia in which all will be well now gets something else to
do she must first study schopenhauer she must first versify the fourth
book of the world as will and idea wagner was saved joking apart
this was a salvation the service which wagner owes to schopenhauer is
incalculable it was the philosopher of decadence who allowed the
artist of decadence to find himself
5
the artist of decadence that is the word and here i begin to be
serious i could not think of looking on approvingly while this dcadent
spoils our healthand music into the bargain is wagner a man at all is
he not rather a disease everything he touches he contaminates he has
made music sick
a typical dcadent who thinks himself necessary with his corrupted
taste who arrogates to himself a higher taste who tries to establish his
depravity as a law as progress as a fulfilment
and no one guards against it his powers of seduction attain monstrous
proportions holy incense hangs around him the misunderstanding
concerning him is called the gospeland he has certainly not converted
only the poor in spirit to his cause
i should like to open the window a littleair more air
the fact that people in germany deceive themselves concerning wagner does
not surprise me the reverse would surprise me the germans have modelled
a wagner for themselves whom they can honour never yet have they been
psychologists they are thankful that they misunderstand but that people
should also deceive themselves concerning wagner in paris where people
are scarcely anything else than psychologists and in saint petersburg
where things are divined which even paris has no idea of how intimately
related must wagner be to the entire decadence of europe for her not to
have felt that he was decadent he belongs to it he is its protagonist
its greatest name we bring honour on ourselves by elevating him to the
cloudsfor the mere fact that no one guards against him is in itself
already a sign of decadence instinct is weakened what ought to be
eschewed now attracts people actually kiss that which plunges them more
quickly into the abyssis there any need for an example one has only to
think of the rgime which anmic or gouty or diabetic people prescribe
for themselves the definition of a vegetarian a creature who has need of
a corroborating diet to recognise what is harmful as harmful to be able
to deny oneself what is harmful is a sign of youth of vitality that
which is harmful lures the exhausted cabbage lures the vegetarian
illness itself can be a stimulus to life but one must be healthy enough
for such a stimuluswagner increases exhaustiontherefore he attracts
the weak and exhausted to him oh the rattlesnake joy of the old master
precisely because he always saw the little children coming unto him
i place this point of view first and foremost wagners art is diseased
the problems he sets on the stage are all concerned with hysteria the
convulsiveness of his emotions his overexcited sensitiveness his taste
which demands ever sharper condimentation his erraticness which he togged
out to look like principles and last but not least his choice of heroes
and heroines considered as physiological types a hospital ward the
whole represents a morbid picture of this there can be no doubt wagner
est une nvrose maybe that nothing is better known today or in any
case the subject of greater study than the protean character of
degeneration which has disguised itself here both as an art and as an
artist in wagner our medical men and physiologists have a most
interesting case or at least a very complete one owing to the very fact
that nothing is more modern than this thorough morbidness this
dilatoriness and excessive irritability of the nervous machinery wagner
is the modern artist par excellence the cagliostro of modernity all
that the world most needs today is combined in the most seductive manner
in his artthe three great stimulants of exhausted people brutality
artificiality and innocence idiocy
wagner is a great corrupter of music with it he found the means of
stimulating tired nervesand in this way he made music ill in the art of
spurring exhausted creatures back into activity and of recalling
halfcorpses to life the inventiveness he shows is of no mean order he
is the master of hypnotic trickery and he fells the strongest like
bullocks wagners successhis success with nerves and therefore with
womenconverted the whole world of ambitious musicians into disciples of
his secret art and not only the ambitious but also the shrewd only
with morbid music can money be made today our big theatres live on
wagner

once more i will venture to indulge in a little levity let us suppose
that wagners success could become flesh and blood and assume a human
form that dressed up as a goodnatured musical savant it could move
among budding artists how do you think it would then be likely to express
itself
my friends it would say let us exchange a word or two in private it is
easier to compose bad music than good music but what if apart from this
it were also more profitable more effective more convincing more
exalting more secure more wagnerian pulchrum est paucorum hominum
bad enough in all conscience we understand latin and perhaps we also
understand which side our bread is buttered beauty has its drawbacks we
know that wherefore beauty then why not rather aim at size at the
sublime the gigantic that which moves the massesand to repeat it is
easier to be titanic than to be beautiful we know that
we know the masses we know the theatre the best of those who assemble
theregerman youths horned siegfrieds and other wagnerites require the
sublime the profound and the overwhelming this much still lies within
our power and as for the others who assemble therethe cultured
crtins the blas pigmies the eternally feminine the gastrically
happy in short the peoplethey also require the sublime the profound
the overwhelming all these people argue in the same way he who
overthrows us is strong he who elevates us is godly he who makes us
wonder vaguely is profoundlet us make up our mind then my friends in
music we do want to overthrow them we do want to elevate them we do
want to make them wonder vaguely this much still lies within our powers
in regard to the process of making them wonder it is here that our notion
of style finds its startingpoint above all no thoughts nothing is
more compromising than a thought but the state of mind which precedes
thought the labour of the thought still unborn the promise of future
thought the world as it was before god created ita recrudescence of
chaos chaos makes people wonder
in the words of the master infinity but without melody
in the second place with regard to the overthrowingthis belongs at
least in part to physiology let us in the first place examine the
instruments a few of them would convince even our intestines they
throw open doors as handel would say others becharm our very marrow
the colour of the melody is allimportant here the melody itself is
of no importance let us be precise about this point to what other
purpose should we spend our strength let us be characteristic in tone
even to the point of foolishness if by means of tones we allow plenty of
scope for guessing this will be put to the credit of our intellects let
us irritate nerves let us strike them dead let us handle thunder and
lightningthat is what overthrows
but what overthrows best is passionwe must try and be clear
concerning this question of passion nothing is cheaper than passion all
the virtues of counterpoint may be dispensed with there is no need to
have learnt anythingbut passion is always within our reach beauty is
difficult let us beware of beauty and also of melody however much in
earnest we may otherwise be about the ideal let us slander my friends
let us slanderlet us slander melody nothing is more dangerous than a
beautiful melody nothing is more certain to ruin taste my friends if
people again set about loving beautiful melodies we are lost
first principle melody is immoral proof palestrina
application parsifal the absence of melody is in itself
sanctifying
and this is the definition of passion passionor the acrobatic feats of
ugliness on the tightrope of enharmonicmy friends let us dare to be
ugly wagner dared it let us heave the mud of the most repulsive
harmonies undauntedly before us we must not even spare our hands only
thus shall we become natural
and now a last word of advice perhaps it covers everythinglet us be
idealistsif not the cleverest it is at least the wisest thing we can
do in order to elevate men we ourselves must be exalted let us wander in
the clouds let us harangue eternity let us be careful to group great
symbols all around us sursum bumbumthere is no better advice the
heaving breast shall be our argument beautiful feelings our
advocates virtue still carries its point against counterpoint how could
he who improves us help being better than we man has ever thought thus
let us therefore improve mankindin this way we shall become good in
this way we shall even become classicsschiller became a classic the
straining after the base excitement of the senses after socalled beauty
shattered the nerves of the italians let us remain german even mozarts
relation to musicwagner spoke this word of comfort to uswas at bottom
frivolous
never let us acknowledge that music may be a recreation that it may
enliven that it may give pleasure never let us give pleasurewe
shall be lost if people once again think of music hedonistically that
belongs to the bad eighteenth century on the other hand nothing would
be more advisable between ourselves than a dose ofcant sit venia
verbo this imparts dignityand let us take care to select the precise
moment when it would be fitting to have black looks to sigh openly to
sigh devoutly to flaunt grand christian sympathy before their eyes man
is corrupt who will save him what will save him do not let us reply
we must be on our guard we must control our ambition which would bid us
found new religions but no one must doubt that it is we who save him
that in our music alone salvation is to be found see wagners essay
religion and art

enough enough i fear that beneath all my merry jests you are beginning
to recognise the sinister truth only too clearlythe picture of the
decline of art of the decline of the artist the latter which is a
decline of character might perhaps be defined provisionally in the
following manner the musician is now becoming an actor his art is
developing ever more and more into a talent for telling lies in a
certain chapter of my principal work which bears the title concerning the
physiology of art9 i shall have an opportunity of showing more
thoroughly how this transformation of art as a whole into histrionics is
just as much a sign of physiological degeneration or more precisely a
form of hysteria as any other individual corruption and infirmity
peculiar to the art which wagner inaugurated for instance the
restlessness of its optics which makes it necessary to change ones
attitude to it every second they understand nothing of wagner who see in
him but a sport of nature an arbitrary mood a chapter of accidents he
was not the defective illfated contradictory genius that people
have declared him to be wagner was something complete he was a typical
dcadent in whom every sign of free will was lacking in whom every
feature was necessary if there is anything at all of interest in wagner
it is the consistency with which a critical physiological condition may
convert itself step by step conclusion after conclusion into a method
a form of procedure a reform of all principles a crisis in taste
at this point i shall only stop to consider the question of style how
is decadence in literature characterised by the fact that in it life
no longer animates the whole words become predominant and leap right out
of the sentence to which they belong the sentences themselves trespass
beyond their bounds and obscure the sense of the whole page and the page
in its turn gains in vigour at the cost of the wholethe whole is no
longer a whole but this is the formula for every decadent style there is
always anarchy among the atoms disaggregation of the willin moral
terms freedom of the individualextended into a political theory
equal rights for all life equal vitality all the vibration and
exuberance of life driven back into the smallest structure and the
remainder left almost lifeless everywhere paralysis distress and
numbness or hostility and chaos both striking one with ever increasing
force the higher the forms of organisation are into which one ascends the
whole no longer lives at all it is composed reckoned up artificial a
fictitious thing
in wagners case the first thing we notice is an hallucination not of
tones but of attitudes only after he has the latter does he begin to
seek the semiotics of tone for them if we wish to admire him we should
observe him at work here how he separates and distinguishes how he
arrives at small unities and how he galvanises them accentuates them
and brings them into preeminence but in this way he exhausts his
strength the rest is worthless how paltry awkward and amateurish is his
manner of developing his attempt at combining incompatible parts his
manner in this respect reminds one of two people who even in other ways
are not unlike him in stylethe brothers goncourt one almost feels
compassion for so much impotence that wagner disguised his inability to
create organic forms under the cloak of a principle that he should have
constructed a dramatic style out of what we should call the total
inability to create any style whatsoever is quite in keeping with that
daring habit which stuck to him throughout his life of setting up a
principle wherever capacity failed him in this respect he was very
different from old kant who rejoiced in another form of daring ie
whenever a principle failed him he endowed man with a capacity which
took its place once more let it be said that wagner is really only
worthy of admiration and love by virtue of his inventiveness in small
things in his elaboration of detailshere one is quite justified in
proclaiming him a master of the first rank as our greatest musical
miniaturist who compresses an infinity of meaning and sweetness into the
smallest space his wealth of colour of chiaroscuro of the mystery of a
dying light so pampers our senses that afterwards almost every other
musician strikes us as being too robust if people would believe me they
would not form the highest idea of wagner from that which pleases them in
him today all that was only devised for convincing the masses and
people like ourselves recoil from it just as one would recoil from too
garish a fresco what concern have we with the irritating brutality of the
overture to the tannhauser or with the walkyrie circus whatever has
become popular in wagners art including that which has become so outside
the theatre is in bad taste and spoils taste the tannhauser march
seems to me to savour of the philistine the overture to the flying
dutchman is much ado about nothing the prelude to lohengrin was the
first only too insidious only too successful example of how one can
hypnotise with music i dislike all music which aspires to nothing higher
than to convince the nerves but apart from the wagner who paints
frescoes and practises magnetism there is yet another wagner who hoards
small treasures our greatest melancholic in music full of side glances
loving speeches and words of comfort in which no one ever forestalled
himthe tonemaster of melancholy and drowsy happiness a lexicon of
wagners most intimate phrasesa host of short fragments of from five to
fifteen bars each of music which nobody knows wagner had the virtue
of dcadentspity
8
very good but how can this dcadent spoil ones taste if perchance
one is not a musician if perchance one is not oneself a
dcadentconversely how can one help it just you try ityou
know not what wagner is quite a great actor does a more profound a more
ponderous influence exist on the stage just look at these
youthletsall benumbed pale breathless they are wagnerites they know
nothing about musicand yet wagner gets the mastery of them wagners art
presses with the weight of a hundred atmospheres do but submit there is
nothing else to do wagner the actor is a tyrant his pathos flings all
taste all resistance to the winds
who else has this persuasive power in his attitudes who else sees
attitudes so clearly before anything else this holdingofitsbreath in
wagnerian pathos this disinclination to have done with an intense
feeling this terrifying habit of dwelling on a situation in which every
instant almost chokes one
was wagner a musician at all in any case he was something else to a much
greater degreethat is to say an incomparable histrio the greatest
mime the most astounding theatrical genius that the germans have ever
had our scenic artist par excellence he belongs to some other sphere
than the history of music with whose really great and genuine figure he
must not be confounded wagner and beethoventhis is blasphemyand above
all it does not do justice even to wagner as a musician he was no more
than what he was as a man he became a musician he became a poet
because the tyrant in him his actors genius drove him to be both
nothing is known concerning wagner so long as his dominating instinct has
not been divined
wagner was not instinctively a musician and this he proved by the way
in which he abandoned all laws and rules or in more precise terms all
style in music in order to make what he wanted with it ie a
rhetorical medium for the stage a medium of expression a means of
accentuating an attitude a vehicle of suggestion and of the
psychologically picturesque in this department wagner may well stand as
an inventor and an innovator of the first orderhe increased the powers
of speech  of music to an incalculable degreehe is the victor hugo of
music as language provided always we allow that under certain
circumstances music may be something which is not music but
speechinstrumentancilla dramaturgica wagners music not in the
tender care of theatrical taste which is very tolerant is simply bad
music perhaps the worst that has ever been composed when a musician can
no longer count up to three he becomes dramatic he becomes
wagnerian
wagner almost discovered the magic which can be wrought even now by means
of music which is both incoherent and elementary his consciousness of
this attains to huge proportions as does also his instinct to dispense
entirely with higher law and style the elementary factorssound
movement colour in short the whole sensuousness of musicsuffice
wagner never calculates as a musician with a musicians conscience all he
strains after is effect nothing more than effect and he knows what he
has to make an effect uponin this he is as unhesitating as schiller was
as any theatrical man must be he has also the latters contempt for the
world which he brings to its knees before him a man is an actor when he
is ahead of mankind in his possession of this one view that everything
which has to strike people as true must not be true this rule was
formulated by talma it contains the whole psychology of the actor it
also containsand this we need not doubtall his morality wagners music
is never true
but it is supposed to be so and thus everything is as it should be as
long as we are young and wagnerites into the bargain we regard wagner as
rich even as the model of a prodigal giver even as a great landlord in
the realm of sound we admire him in very much the same way as young
frenchmen admire victor hugothat is to say for his royal liberality
later on we admire the one as well as the other for the opposite reason
as masters and paragons in economy as prudent amphitryons nobody can
equal them in the art of providing a princely board with such a modest
outlaythe wagnerite with his credulous stomach is even sated with the
fare which his master conjures up before him but we others who in books
as in music desire above all to find substance and who are scarcely
satisfied with the mere representation of a banquet are much worse off
in plain english wagner does not give us enough to masticate his
recitativevery little meat more bones and plenty of brothi christened
alla genovese i had no intention of flattering the genoese with this
remark but rather the older recitativo the recitativo secco and as
to wagnerian leitmotif i fear i lack the necessary culinary
understanding for it if hard pressed i might say that i regard it
perhaps as an ideal toothpick as an opportunity of ridding ones self of
what remains of ones meal wagners arias are still left over but now
i shall hold my tongue
9
even in his general sketch of the action wagner is above all an actor
the first thing that occurs to him is a scene which is certain to produce
a strong effect a real actio10 with a bassorelievo of attitudes an
overwhelming scene this he now proceeds to elaborate more deeply and
out of it he draws his characters the whole of what remains to be done
follows of itself fully in keeping with a technical economy which has no
reason to be subtle it is not corneilles public that wagner has to
consider it is merely the nineteenth century concerning the actual
requirements of the stage wagner would have about the same opinion as any
other actor of today a series of powerful scenes each stronger than the
one that preceded itand in between all kinds of clever nonsense his
first concern is to guarantee the effect of his work he begins with the
third act he approves his work according to the quality of its final
effect guided by this sort of understanding of the stage there is not
much danger of ones creating a drama unawares drama demands inexorable
logic but what did wagner care about logic again i say it was not
corneilles public that he had to consider but merely germans everybody
knows the technical difficulties before which the dramatist often has to
summon all his strength and frequently to sweat his blood the difficulty
of making the plot seem necessary and the unravelment as well so that
both are conceivable only in a certain way and so that each may give the
impression of freedom the principle of the smallest expenditure of
energy now the very last thing that wagner does is to sweat blood over
the plot and on this and the unravelment he certainly spends the smallest
possible amount of energy let anybody put one of wagners plots under
the microscope and i wager that he will be forced to laugh nothing is
more enlivening than the dilemma in tristan unless it be that in the
mastersingers wagner is no dramatist let nobody be deceived on this
point all he did was to love the word dramahe always loved fine words
nevertheless in his writings the word drama is merely a
misunderstanding and a piece of shrewdness wagner always affected
superiority in regard to the word opera just as the word spirit is
a misunderstanding in the new testamenthe was not enough of a
psychologist for drama he instinctively avoided a psychological plotbut
howby always putting idiosyncrasy in its place very moderneh very
parisian very decadent incidentally the plots that wagner knows how
to unravel with the help of dramatic inventions are of quite another
kind for example let us suppose that wagner requires a female voice a
whole act without a womans voice would be impossible but in this
particular instance not one of the heroines happens to be free what does
wagner do he emancipates the oldest woman on earth erda step up aged
grandmamma you have got to sing and erda sings wagners end has been
achieved thereupon he immediately dismisses the old lady why on earth
did you come off with you kindly go to sleep again in short a scene
full of mythological awe before which the wagnerite wonders all kinds
of things
but the substance of wagners texts their mythical substance their
eternal substancequestion how is this substance this eternal substance
tested the chemical analyst replies translate wagner into the real into
the modernlet us be even more cruel and say into the bourgeois and
what will then become of himbetween ourselves i have tried the
experiment nothing is more entertaining nothing more worthy of being
recommended to a picnicparty than to discuss wagner dressed in a more
modern garb for instance parsifal as a candidate in divinity with a
publicschool education the latter quite indispensable for pure
foolishness what surprises await one would you believe it that
wagners heroines one and all once they have been divested of the heroic
husks are almost indistinguishable from mdme bovaryjust as one can
conceive conversely of flauberts being well able to transform all his
heroines into scandinavian or carthaginian women and then to offer them
to wagner in this mythologised form as a libretto indeed generally
speaking wagner does not seem to have become interested in any other
problems than those which engross the little parisian decadents of today
always five paces away from the hospital all very modern problems all
problems which are at home in big cities do not doubt it have you
noticed it is in keeping with this association of ideas that wagners
heroines never have any childrenthey cannot have them the despair
with which wagner tackled the problem of arranging in some way for
siegfrieds birth betrays how modern his feelings on this point actually
weresiegfried emancipated womanbut not with any hope of
offspringand now here is a fact which leaves us speechless parsifal is
lohengrins father how ever did he do itought one at this juncture to
remember that chastity works miracles
wagnerus dixit princeps in castitate auctoritas
10
and now just a word en passant concerning wagners writings they are
among other things a school of shrewdness the system of procedures of
which wagner disposes might be applied to a hundred other caseshe that
hath ears to hear let him hear perhaps i may lay claim to some public
acknowledgment if i put three of the most valuable of these procedures
into a precise form
everything that wagner cannot do is bad
wagner could do much more than he does but his strong principles prevent
him
everything that wagner can do no one will ever be able to do after him
no one has ever done before him and no one must ever do after him wagner
is godly
these three propositions are the quintessence of wagners writingsthe
rest is merelyliterature
not every kind of music hitherto has been in need of literature and it
were well to try and discover the actual reason of this is it perhaps
that wagners music is too difficult to understand or did he fear
precisely the reversethat it was too easythat people might not
understand it with sufficient difficultyas a matter of fact his whole
life long he did nothing but repeat one proposition that his music did
not mean music alone but something more something immeasurably more
not music aloneno musician would speak in this way i repeat
wagner could not create things as a whole he had no choice he was
obliged to create things in bits with motives attitudes formul
duplications and hundreds of repetitions he remained a rhetorician in
musicand that is why he was at bottom forced to press this means
into the foreground music can never be anything else than a means this
was his theory but above all it was the only practice that lay open to
him no musician however thinks in this waywagner was in need of
literature in order to persuade the whole world to take his music
seriously profoundly because it meant an infinity of things all his
life he was the commentator of the ideawhat does elsa stand for but
without a doubt elsa is the unconscious mind of the people when i
realised this i naturally became a thorough revolutionist
do not let us forget that when hegel and schelling were misleading the
minds of germany wagner was still young that he guessed or rather fully
grasped that the only thing which germans take seriously isthe
ideathat is to say something obscure uncertain wonderful that among
germans lucidity is an objection logic a refutation schopenhauer
rigorously pointed out the dishonesty of hegels and schellings
agerigorously but also unjustly for he himself the pessimistic old
counterfeiter was in no way more honest than his more famous
contemporaries but let us leave morality out of the question hegel is a
matter of taste and not only of german but of european taste a taste
which wagner understoodwhich he felt equal to which he has
immortalisedall he did was to apply it to musiche invented a style for
himself which might mean an infinity of thingshe was hegels heir
music as idea
and how well wagner was understoodthe same kind of man who used to gush
over hegel now gushes over wagner in his school they even write
hegelian11 but he who understood wagner best was the german youthlet
the two words infinity and meaning were sufficient for this at their
sound the youthlet immediately began to feel exceptionally happy wagner
did not conquer these boys with music but with the ideait is the
enigmatical vagueness of his art its game of hideandseek amid a hundred
symbols its polychromy in ideals which leads and lures the lads it is
wagners genius for forming clouds his sweeps and swoops through the air
his ubiquity and nullibietyprecisely the same qualities with which hegel
led and lured in his timemoreover in the presence of wagners
multifariousness plenitude and arbitrariness they seem to themselves
justifiedsaved tremulously they listen while the great symbols in
his art seem to make themselves heard from out the misty distance with a
gentle roll of thunder and they are not at all displeased if at times it
gets a little grey gruesome and cold are they not one and all like
wagner himself on quite intimate terms with bad weather with german
weather wotan is their god but wotan is the god of bad weather they
are right how could these german youthsin their present conditionmiss
what we others we halcyonians miss in wagner ie la gaya
scienza light feet wit fire grave grand logic stellar dancing
wanton intellectuality the vibrating light of the south the calm

i have mentioned the sphere to which wagner belongscertainly not to the
history of music what however does he mean historicallythe rise of
the actor in music a momentous event which not only leads me to think
but also to fear
in a word wagner and liszt never yet have the uprightness and
genuineness of musicians been put to such a dangerous test it is
glaringly obvious great success mob success is no longer the achievement
of the genuinein order to get it a man must be an actorvictor hugo and
richard wagnerthey both prove one and the same thing that in declining
civilisations wherever the mob is allowed to decide genuineness becomes
superfluous prejudicial unfavourable the actor alone can still kindle
great enthusiasmand thus it is his golden age which is now
dawninghis and that of all those who are in any way related to him with
drums and fifes wagner marches at the head of all artists in declamation
in display and virtuosity he began by convincing the conductors of
orchestras the sceneshifters and stagesingers not to forget the
orchestrahe delivered them from monotony the movement that wagner
created has spread even to the land of knowledge whole sciences
pertaining to music are rising slowly out of centuries of scholasticism
as an example of what i mean let me point more particularly to
riemanns services to rhythmics he was the first who called attention
to the leading idea in punctuationeven for music unfortunately he did so
with a bad word he called it phrasingall these people and i say it
with gratitude are the best the most respectable among wagners
admirersthey have a perfect right to honour wagner the same instinct
unites them with one another in him they recognise their highest type
and since he has inflamed them with his own ardour they feel themselves
transformed into power even into great power in this quarter if
anywhere wagners influence has really been beneficent never before
has there been so much thinking willing and industry in this sphere
wagner endowed all these artists with a new conscience what they now
exact and obtain from themselves they had never exacted before wagners
timebefore then they had been too modest another spirit prevails on the
stage since wagner rules there the most difficult things are expected
blame is severe praise very scarcethe good and the excellent have
become the rule taste is no longer necessary nor even is a good voice
wagner is sung only with ruined voices this has a more dramatic effect
even talent is out of the question expressiveness at all costs which is
what the wagnerian idealthe ideal of decadencedemands is hardly
compatible with talent all that is required for this is virtuethat is to
say training automatism selfdenial neither taste voices nor
gifts wagners stage requires but one thing germans the definition
of a german an obedient man with long legs there is a deep significance
in the fact that the rise of wagner should have coincided with the rise of
the empire both phenomena are a proof of one and the same
thingobedience and long legsnever have people been more obedient never
have they been so well ordered about the conductors of wagnerian
orchestras more particularly are worthy of an age which posterity will
one day call with timid awe the classical age of war
wagner understood how to command in this respect too he was a great
teacher he commanded as a man who had exercised an inexorable will over
himselfas one who had practised lifelong discipline wagner was perhaps
the greatest example of selfviolence in the whole of the history of art
even alfieri who in other respects is his nextofkin is outdone by
him the note of a torinese
12
this view that our actors have become more worthy of respect than
heretofore does not imply that i believe them to have become less
dangerous but who is in any doubt as to what i wantas to what the
three requisitions are concerning which my wrath and my care and love of
art have made me open my mouth on this occasion
that the stage should not become master of the arts
that the actor should not become the corrupter of the genuine
that music should not become an art of lying
friedrich nietzsche
postscript
the gravity of these last words allows me at this point to introduce a few
sentences out of an unprinted essay which will at least leave no doubt as
to my earnestness in regard to this question the title of this essay is
what wagner has cost us
one pays dearly for having been a follower of wagner even today a vague
feeling that this is so still prevails even wagners success his
triumph did not uproot this feeling thoroughly but formerly it was
strong it was terrible it was a gloomy hate throughout almost
threequarters of wagners life the resistance which he met with among us
germans cannot be too highly valued or too highly honoured people guarded
themselves against him as against an illnessnot with argumentsit is
impossible to refute an illnessbut with obstruction with mistrust with
repugnance with loathing with sombre earnestness as though he were a
great rampant danger the sthetes gave themselves away when out of three
schools of german philosophy they waged an absurd war against wagners
principles with ifs and forswhat did he care about principles even
his ownthe germans themselves had enough instinctive good sense to
dispense with every if and for in this matter an instinct is weakened
when it becomes conscious for by becoming conscious it makes itself
feeble if there were any signs that in spite of the universal character
of european decadence there was still a modicum of health still an
instinctive premonition of what is harmful and dangerous residing in the
german soul then it would be precisely this blunt resistance to wagner
which i should least like to see underrated it does us honour it gives
us some reason to hope france no longer has such an amount of health at
her disposal the germans these loiterers par excellence as history
shows are today the most backward among the civilised nations of europe
this has its advantagesfor they are thus relatively the youngest
one pays dearly for having been a follower of wagner it is only quite
recently that the germans have overcome a sort of dread of himthe desire
to be rid of him occurred to them again and again12 does anybody
remember a very curious occurrence in which quite unexpectedly towards
the end this old feeling once more manifested itself it happened at
wagners funeral the first wagner society the one in munich laid a
wreath on his grave with this inscription which immediately became
famous salvation to the saviour everybody admired the lofty
inspiration which had dictated this inscription as also the taste which
seemed to be the privilege of the followers of wagner many also however
it was singular enough made this slight alteration in it salvation
from the saviourpeople began to breathe again
one pays dearly for having been a follower of wagner let us try to
estimate the influence of this worship upon culture whom did this
movement press to the front what did it make ever more and more
preeminentin the first place the laymans arrogance the arrogance of
the artmaniac now these people are organising societies they wish to
make their taste prevail they even wish to pose as judges in rebus
musicis et musicantibus secondly an ever increasing indifference
towards severe noble and conscientious schooling in the service of art
and in its place the belief in genius or in plain english cheeky
dilettantism the formula for this is to be found in the
mastersingers thirdly and this is the worst of all theatrocracy
the craziness of a belief in the preeminence of the theatre in the right
of the theatre to rule supreme over the arts over art in general but
this should be shouted into the face of wagnerites a hundred times over
that the theatre is something lower than art something secondary
something coarsened above all something suitably distorted and falsified
for the mob in this respect wagner altered nothing bayreuth is grand
operaand not even good opera the stage is a form of demolatry in the
realm of taste the stage is an insurrection of the mob a plbiscite
against good taste the case of wagner proves this fact he captivated
the masseshe depraved taste he even perverted our taste for opera
one pays dearly for having been a follower of wagner what has
wagnerworship made out of spirit does wagner liberate the spirit to him
belong that ambiguity and equivocation and all other qualities which can
convince the uncertain without making them conscious of why they have been
convinced in this sense wagner is a seducer on a grand scale there is
nothing exhausted nothing effete nothing dangerous to life nothing that
slanders the world in the realm of spirit which has not secretly found
shelter in his art he conceals the blackest obscurantism in the luminous
orbs of the ideal he flatters every nihilistic buddhistic instinct and
togs it out in music he flatters every form of christianity every
religious expression of decadence he that hath ears to hear let him hear
everything that has ever grown out of the soil of impoverished life the
whole counterfeit coinage of the transcendental and of a beyond found its
most sublime advocate in wagners art not in formul wagner is too
clever to use formul but in the persuasion of the senses which in their
turn makes the spirit weary and morbid music in the form of circe  in
this respect his last work is his greatest masterpiece in the art of
seduction parsifal will for ever maintain its rank as a stroke of
genius i admire this work i would fain have composed it myself wagner
was never better inspired than towards the end the subtlety with which
beauty and disease are united here reaches such a height that it casts
so to speak a shadow upon all wagners earlier achievements it seems too
bright too healthy do ye understand this health and brightness acting
like a shadow almost like an objection to this extent are we already
pure fools never was there a greater master in heavy hieratic
perfumesnever on earth has there been such a connoisseur of paltry
infinities of all that thrills of extravagant excesses of all the
feminism from out the vocabulary of happiness my friends do but drink
the philtres of this art nowhere will ye find a more pleasant method of
enervating your spirit of forgetting your manliness in the shade of a
rosebush ah this old magician mightiest of klingsors how he wages war
against us with his art against us free spirits how he appeals to every
form of cowardice of the modern soul with his charming girlish notes
there never was such a mortal hatred of knowledge one must be a very
cynic in order to resist seduction here one must be able to bite in order
to resist worshipping at this shrine very well old seducer the cynic
cautions youcave canem
one pays dearly for having been a follower of wagner i contemplate the
youthlets who have long been exposed to his infection the first
relatively innocuous effect of it is the corruption of their taste wagner
acts like chronic recourse to the bottle he stultifies he befouls the
stomach his specific effect degeneration of the feeling for rhythm what
the wagnerite calls rhythmical is what i call to use a greek metaphor
stirring a swamp much more dangerous than all this however is the
corruption of ideas the youthlet becomes a mooncalf an idealist he
stands above science and in this respect he has reached the masters
heights on the other hand he assumes the airs of a philosopher he
writes for the bayreuth journal he solves all problems in the name of
the father the son and the holy master but the most ghastly thing of
all is the deterioration of the nerves let any one wander through a large
city at night in all directions he will hear people doing violence to
instruments with solemn rage and fury a wild uproar breaks out at
intervals what is happening it is the disciples of wagner in the act of
worshipping him bayreuth is another word for a hydro a typical telegram
from bayreuth would read bereits bereut i already repent wagner is
bad for young men he is fatal for women what medically speaking is a
female wagnerite it seems to me that a doctor could not be too serious in
putting this alternative of conscience to young women either one thing or
the other but they have already made their choice you cannot serve two
masters when one of these is wagner wagner redeemed woman and in return
woman built bayreuth for him every sacrifice every surrender there was
nothing that they were not prepared to give him woman impoverishes
herself in favour of the master she becomes quite touching she stands
naked before him the female wagnerite the most attractive equivocality
that exists today she is the incarnation of wagners cause his cause
triumphs with her as its symbol ah this old robber he robs our young
men he even robs our women as well and drags them to his cell ah this
old minotaur what has he not already cost us every year processions of
the finest young men and maidens are led into his labyrinth that he may
swallow them up every year the whole of europe cries out away to crete
away to crete
second postscript
it seems to me that my letter is open to some misunderstanding on certain
faces i see the expression of gratitude i even hear modest but merry
laughter i prefer to be understood here as in other things but since a
certain animal the worm of empire the famous rhinoxera has become
lodged in the vineyards of the german spirit nobody any longer
understands a word i say the kreuszeitung has brought this home to me
not to speak of the litterarisches centralblatt i have given the
germans the deepest books that they have ever possesseda sufficient
reason for their not having understood a word of them if in this essay i
declare war against wagnerand incidentally against a certain form of
german taste if i seem to use strong language about the cretinism of
bayreuth it must not be supposed that i am in the least anxious to
glorify any other musician other musicians are not to be considered by
the side of wagner things are generally bad decay is universal disease
lies at the very root of things if wagners name represents the ruin of
music just as berninis stands for the ruin of sculpture he is not on
that account its cause all he did was to accelerate the fallthough we
are quite prepared to admit that he did it in a way which makes one recoil
with horror from this almost instantaneous decline and fall to the depths
he possessed the ingenuousness of decadence this constituted his
superiority he believed in it he did not halt before any of its logical
consequences the others hesitatedthat is their distinction they have no
other what is common to both wagner and the others consists in this
the decline of all organising power the abuse of traditional means
without the capacity or the aim that would justify this the counterfeit
imitation of grand forms for which nobody nowadays is strong proud
selfreliant and healthy enough excessive vitality in small details
passion at all costs refinement as an expression of impoverished life
ever more nerves in the place of muscle i know only one musician who
today would be able to compose an overture as an organic whole and
nobody else knows him13 he who is famous now does not write better
music than wagner but only less characteristic less definite musicless
definite because half measures even in decadence cannot stand by the
side of completeness but wagner was complete wagner represented thorough
corruption wagner has had the courage the will and the conviction for
corruption what does johannes brahms matter it was his good fortune to
be misunderstood by germany he was taken to be an antagonist of
wagnerpeople required an antagonistbut he did not write necessary
music above all he wrote too much musicwhen one is not rich one should
at least have enough pride to be poor the sympathy which here and there
was meted out to brahms apart from party interests and party
misunderstandings was for a long time a riddle to me until one day
through an accident almost i discovered that he affected a particular
type of man he has the melancholy of impotence his creations are not the
result of plenitude he thirsts after abundance apart from what he
plagiarises from what he borrows from ancient or exotically modern
styleshe is a master in the art of copyingthere remains as his most
individual quality a longing and this is what the dissatisfied of all
kinds and all those who yearn divine in him he is much too little of a
personality too little of a central figure the impersonal those who
are not selfcentred love him for this he is especially the musician of
a species of dissatisfied women fifty steps further on and we find the
female wagneritejust as we find wagner himself fifty paces ahead of
brahmsthe female wagnerite is a more definite a more interesting and
above all a more attractive type brahms is touching so long as he dreams
or mourns over himself in privatein this respect he is modernhe becomes
cold we no longer feel at one with him when he poses as the child of the
classics people like to call brahms beethovens heir i know of no more
cautious euphemismall that which today makes a claim to being the grand
style in music is on precisely that account either false to us or false to
itself this alternative is suspicious enough in itself it contains a
casuistic question concerning the value of the two cases the instinct of
the majority protests against the alternative false to usthey do not
wish to be cheatedand i myself would certainly always prefer this type
to the other false to itself this is my tasteexpressed more
clearly for the sake of the poor in spirit it amounts to this brahms
or wagner brahms is not an actora very great part of other
musicians may be summed up in the concept brahmsi do not wish to say
anything about the clever apes of wagner as for instance goldmark when
one has the queen of sheba to ones name one belongs to a
menagerieone ought to put oneself on shownowadays all things that can
be done well and even with a master hand are small in this department
alone is honesty still possible nothing however can cure music as a
whole of its chief fault of its fate which is to be the expression of
general physiological contradictionwhich is in fact to be modern
the best instruction the most conscientious schooling the most thorough
familiarity yea and even isolation with the old mastersall this only
acts as a palliative or more strictly speaking has but an illusory
effect because the first condition of the right thing is no longer in our
bodies whether this first condition be the strong race of a handel or the
overflowing animal spirits of a rossini not everyone has the right to
every teacher and this holds good of whole epochsin itself it is not
impossible that there are still remains of stronger natures typical
unadapted men somewhere in europe from this quarter the advent of a
somewhat belated form of beauty and perfection even in music might still
be hoped for but the most that we can expect to see are exceptional
cases from the rule that corruption is paramount that corruption is a
fatalitynot even a god can save music
epilogue
and now let us take breath and withdraw a moment from this narrow world
which necessarily must be narrow because we have to make enquiries
relative to the value of persons a philosopher feels that he wants to
wash his hands after he has concerned himself so long with the case of
wagner i shall now give my notion of what is modern according to the
measure of energy of every age there is also a standard that determines
which virtues shall be allowed and which forbidden the age either has the
virtues of ascending life in which case it resists the virtues of
degeneration with all its deepest instincts or it is in itself an age of
degeneration in which case it requires the virtues of declining lifein
which case it hates everything that justifies itself solely as being the
outcome of a plenitude or a superabundance of strength sthetic is
inextricably bound up with these biological principles there is decadent
sthetic and classical stheticbeauty in itself is just as much a
chimera as any other kind of idealismwithin the narrow sphere of the
socalled moral values no greater antithesis could be found than that of
mastermorality and the morality of christian valuations the latter
having grown out of a thoroughly morbid soil the gospels present us
with the same physiological types as do the novels of dostoiewsky the
mastermorality roman pagan classical renaissance on the
other hand being the symbolic speech of wellconstitutedness of
ascending life and of the will to power as a vital principle
mastermorality affirms just as instinctively as christian morality
denies god beyond selfdenialall of them negations the
first reflects its plenitude upon thingsit transfigures it embellishes
it rationalises the worldthe latter impoverishes bleaches mars the
value of things it suppresses the world world is a christian term of
abuse these antithetical forms in the optics of values are both
necessary they are different points of view which cannot be circumvented
either with arguments or counterarguments one cannot refute
christianity it is impossible to refute a diseased eyesight that people
should have combated pessimism as if it had been a philosophy was the
very acme of learned stupidity the concepts true and untrue do not
seem to me to have any sense in opticsthat alone which has to be
guarded against is the falsity the instinctive duplicity which would
fain regard this antithesis as no antithesis at all just as wagner
didand his mastery in this kind of falseness was of no mean order to
cast sidelong glances at mastermorality at noble morality icelandic
saga is perhaps the greatest documentary evidence of these values and at
the same time to have the opposite teaching the gospel of the lowly
the doctrine of the need of salvation on ones lips incidentally i
admire the modesty of christians who go to bayreuth as for myself i
could not endure to hear the sound of certain words on wagners lips
there are some concepts which are too good for bayreuth  what
christianity adjusted for female wagnerites perhaps by female
wagneritesfor in his latter days wagner was thoroughly feminini
generis again i say the christians of today are too modest for me
if wagner were a christian then liszt was perhaps a father of the
churchthe need of salvation the quintessence of all christian needs
has nothing in common with such clowns it is the most straightforward
expression of decadence it is the most convincing and most painful
affirmation of decadence in sublime symbols and practices the christian
wishes to be rid of himself le moi est toujours haissable noble
morality mastermorality on the other hand is rooted in a triumphant
saying of yea to ones selfit is the selfaffirmation and
selfglorification of life it also requires sublime symbols and
practices but only because its heart is too full the whole of
beautiful art and of great art belongs here their common essence is
gratitude but we must allow it a certain instinctive repugnance to
dcadents and a scorn and horror of the latters symbolism such things
almost prove it the noble romans considered christianity as a fda
superstitio let me call to your minds the feelings which the last german
of noble tastegoethehad in regard to the cross it is idle to look for
more valuable more necessary contrasts14
but the kind of falsity which is characteristic of the bayreuthians is not
exceptional today we all know the hybrid concept of the christian
gentleman this innocence in contradiction this clean conscience in
falsehood is rather modern par excellence with it modernity is almost
defined biologically modern man represents a contradiction of values
he sits between two stools he says yea and nay in one breath no wonder
that it is precisely in our age that falseness itself became flesh and
blood and even genius no wonder wagner dwelt amongst us it was not
without reason that i called wagner the cagliostro of modernity but all
of us though we do not know it involuntarily have values words
formul and morals in our bodies which are quite antagonistic in their
originregarded from a physiological standpoint we are false how
would a diagnosis of the modern soul begin with a determined incision
into this agglomeration of contradictory instincts with the total
suppression of its antagonistic values with vivisection applied to its
most instructive case to philosophers the case of wagner is a
windfallthis essay as you observe was inspired by gratitude
nietzsche contra wagner
the brief of a psychologist
preface
the following chapters have been selected from past works of mine and not
without care some of them date back as far as 1877 here and there of
course they will be found to have been made a little more intelligible
but above all more brief read consecutively they can leave no one in
any doubt either concerning myself or concerning wagner we are
antipodes the reader will come to other conclusions too in his perusal
of these pages for instance that this is an essay for psychologists and
not for germans i have my readers everywhere in vienna st
petersburg copenhagen stockholm paris and new yorkbut i have none
in europes flatlandgermany and i might even have something to say to
italians whom i love just as much as i  quousque tandem crispi 
triple alliance a people can only conclude a msalliance with the
empire

wherein i admire wagner
i believe that artists very often do not know what they are best able to
do they are much too vain their minds are directed to something prouder
than merely to appear like little plants which with freshness rareness
and beauty know how to sprout from their soil with real perfection the
ultimate goodness of their own garden and vineyard is superciliously
underestimated by them and their love and their insight are not of the
same quality here is a musician who is a greater master than anyone else
in the discovering of tones peculiar to suffering oppressed and
tormented souls who can endow even dumb misery with speech nobody can
approach him in the colours of late autumn in the indescribably touching
joy of a last a very last and all too short gladness he knows of a
chord which expresses those secret and weird midnight hours of the soul
when cause and effect seem to have fallen asunder and at every moment
something may spring out of nonentity he is happiest of all when creating
from out the nethermost depths of human happiness and so to speak from
out mans empty bumper in which the bitterest and most repulsive drops
have mingled with the sweetest for good or evil at last he knows that
weary shuffling along of the soul which is no longer able either to spring
or to fly nay which is no longer able to walk he has the modest glance
of concealed suffering of understanding without comfort of leavetaking
without word or sign verily as the orpheus of all secret misery he is
greater than anyone and many a thing was introduced into art for the
first time by him which hitherto had not been given expression had not
even been thought worthy of artthe cynical revolts for instance of
which only the greatest sufferer is capable also many a small and quite
microscopical feature of the soul as it were the scales of its amphibious
natureyes indeed he is the master of everything very small but this he
refuses to be his tastes are much more in love with vast walls and with
daring frescoes he does not see that his spirit has another desire and
benta totally different outlookthat it prefers to squat peacefully in
the corners of brokendown houses concealed in this way and hidden even
from himself he paints his really great masterpieces all of which are
very short often only one bar in lengththere only does he become quite
good great and perfect perhaps there alonewagner is one who has
suffered muchand this elevates him above other musiciansi admire wagner
wherever he sets himself to music
wherein i raise objections
with all this i do not wish to imply that i regard this music as healthy
and least of all in those places where it speaks of wagner himself my
objections to wagners music are physiological objections why should i
therefore begin by clothing them in sthetic formul sthetic is indeed
nothing more than applied physiologythe fact i bring forward my petit
fait vrai is that i can no longer breathe with ease when this music
begins to have its effect upon me that my foot immediately begins to feel
indignant at it and rebels for what it needs is time dance march even
the young german kaiser could not march to wagners imperial marchwhat
my foot demands in the first place from music is that ecstasy which lies
in good walking stepping and dancing but do not my stomach my heart my
circulation also protest are not my intestines also troubled and do i
not become hoarse unawares  in order to listen to wagner i require
graudels pastilles and then i ask myself what is it that my whole
body must have from music in general for there is no such thing as a
soul i believe it must have relief as if all animal functions were
accelerated by means of light bold unfettered selfreliant rhythms as
if brazen and leaden life could lose its weight by means of delicate and
smooth melodies my melancholy would fain rest its head in the haunts and
abysses of perfection for this reason i need music but wagner makes one
illwhat do i care about the theatre what do i care about the spasms of
its moral ecstasies in which the moband who is not the mob
todayrejoices what do i care about the whole pantomimic hocuspocus of
the actor you are beginning to see that i am essentially antitheatrical
at heart for the stage this mob art par excellence my soul has that
deepest scorn felt by every artist today with a stage success a man
sinks to such an extent in my esteem as to drop out of sight failure in
this quarter makes me prick my ears makes me begin to pay attention but
this was not so with wagner next to the wagner who created the most
unique music that has ever existed there was the wagner who was
essentially a man of the stage an actor the most enthusiastic mimomaniac
that has perhaps existed on earth even as a musician and let it be said
en passant that if wagners theory was drama is the object music is
only a meanshis practice was from beginning to end the attitude is the
end drama and even music can never be anything else than means music as
the manner of accentuating of strengthening and deepening dramatic poses
and all things which please the senses of the actor and wagnerian drama
only an opportunity for a host of interesting attitudesalongside of all
other instincts he had the dictatorial instinct of a great actor in
everything and as i have already said as a musician alsoon one
occasion and not without trouble i made this clear to a wagnerite pur
sangclearness and a wagnerite i wont say another word there were
reasons for adding for heavens sake be a little more true unto
yourself we are not in bayreuth now in bayreuth people are only upright
in the mass the individual lies he even lies to himself one leaves
oneself at home when one goes to bayreuth one gives up all right to ones
own tongue and choice to ones own taste and even to ones own courage
one knows these things no longer as one is wont to have them and practise
them before god and the world and between ones own four walls in the
theatre no one brings the finest senses of his art with him and least of
all the artist who works for the theatrefor here loneliness is lacking
everything perfect does not suffer a witness in the theatre one becomes
mob herd woman pharisee electing cattle patron idiotwagnerite
there the most personal conscience is bound to submit to the levelling
charm of the great multitude there the neighbour rules there one
becomes a neighbour
wagner as a danger
1
the aim after which more modern music is striving which is now given the
strong but obscure name of unending melody can be clearly understood by
comparing it to ones feelings on entering the sea gradually one loses
ones footing and one ultimately abandons oneself to the mercy or fury of
the elements one has to swim in the solemn or fiery swinging movement
first slow and then quick of old musicone had to do something quite
different one had to dance the measure which was required for this and
the control of certain balanced degrees of time and energy forced the
soul of the listener to continual sobriety of thoughtupon the
counterplay of the cooler currents of air which came from this sobriety
and from the warmer breath of enthusiasm the charm of all good music
restedrichard wagner wanted another kind of movementhe overthrew the
physiological first principle of all music before his time it was no
longer a matter of walking or dancingwe must swim we must hover this
perhaps decides the whole matter unending melody really wants to break
all the symmetry of time and strength it actually scorns these thingsits
wealth of invention resides precisely in what to an older ear sounds like
rhythmic paradox and abuse from the imitation or the prevalence of such a
taste there would arise a danger for musicso great that we can imagine
none greaterthe complete degeneration of the feeling for rhythm chaos
in the place of rhythm the danger reaches its climax when such music
cleaves ever more closely to naturalistic playacting and pantomime which
governed by no laws of form aim at effect and nothing more
expressiveness at all costs and music a servant a slave to attitudesthis
is the end

what would it really be the first virtue of a performance as performing
musical artists now seem to believe under all circumstances to attain to
a hautrelief which cannot be surpassed if this were applied to mozart
for instance would it not be a real sin against mozarts spiritmozarts
cheerful enthusiastic delightful and loving spirit he who fortunately
was no german and whose seriousness is a charming and golden seriousness
and not by any means that of a german clodhopper not to speak of the
earnestness of the marble statue but you seem to think that all music
is the music of the marble statuethat all music should so to speak
spring out of the wall and shake the listener to his very bowels only
thus could music have any effect but on whom would the effect be made
upon something on which a noble artist ought never to deign to actupon
the mob upon the immature upon the blass upon the diseased upon
idiots upon wagnerites
a music without a future
of all the arts which succeed in growing on the soil of a particular
culture music is the last plant to appear maybe because it is the one
most dependent upon our innermost feelings and therefore the last to come
to the surfaceat a time when the culture to which it belongs is in its
autumn season and beginning to fade it was only in the art of the dutch
masters that the spirit of medival christianity found its expression
its architecture of sound is the youngest but genuine and legitimate
sister of the gothic it was only in handels music that the best in
luther and in those like him found its voice the judeoheroic trait which
gave the reformation a touch of greatnessthe old testament not the
new become music it was left to mozart to pour out the epoch of louis
xiv and of the art of racine and claude lorrain in ringing gold only
in beethovens and rossinis music did the eighteenth century sing itself
outthe century of enthusiasm broken ideals and fleeting joy all real
and original music is a swan songeven our last form of music despite its
prevalence and its will to prevail has perhaps only a short time to live
for it sprouted from a soil which was in the throes of a rapid
subsidenceof a culture which will soon be submerged a certain
catholicism of feeling and a predilection for some ancient indigenous
socalled national ideals and eccentricities was its first condition
wagners appropriation of old sagas and songs in which scholarly
prejudice taught us to see something german par excellencenow we laugh
at it all the resurrection of these scandinavian monsters with a thirst
for ecstatic sensuality and spiritualisationthe whole of this taking and
giving on wagners part in the matter of subjects characters passions
and nerves would also give unmistakable expression to the spirit of his
music provided that this music like any other did not know how to speak
about itself save ambiguously for musica is a woman we must not let
ourselves be misled concerning this state of things by the fact that at
this very moment we are living in a reaction in the heart itself of a
reaction the age of international wars of ultramontane martyrdom in
fact the whole interludecharacter which typifies the present condition
of europe may indeed help an art like wagners to sudden glory without
however in the least ensuring its future prosperity the germans
themselves have no future
we antipodes
perhaps a few people or at least my friends will remember that i made my
first plunge into life armed with some errors and some exaggerations but
that in any case i began with hope in my heart in the philosophical
pessimism of the nineteenth century i recognisedwho knows by what
bypaths of personal experiencethe symptom of a higher power of thought
a more triumphant plenitude of life than had manifested itself hitherto
in the philosophies of hume kant and hegeli regarded tragic knowledge
as the most beautiful luxury of our culture as its most precious most
noble most dangerous kind of prodigality but nevertheless in view of
its overflowing wealth as a justifiable luxury in the same way i
began by interpreting wagners music as the expression of a dionysian
powerfulness of soul in it i thought i heard the earthquake by means of
which a primeval lifeforce which had been constrained for ages was
seeking at last to burst its bonds quite indifferent to how much of that
which nowadays calls itself culture would thereby be shaken to ruins you
see how i misinterpreted you see also what i bestowed upon wagner and
schopenhauermyself every art and every philosophy may be regarded
either as a cure or as a stimulant to ascending or declining life they
always presuppose suffering and sufferers but there are two kinds of
sufferersthose that suffer from overflowing vitality who need
dionysian art and require a tragic insight into and a tragic outlook
upon the phenomenon lifeand there are those who suffer from reduced
vitality and who crave for repose quietness calm seas or else the
intoxication the spasm the bewilderment which art and philosophy
provide revenge upon life itselfthis is the most voluptuous form of
intoxication for such indigent souls now wagner responds quite as well
as schopenhauer to the twofold cravings of these peoplethey both deny
life they both slander it but precisely on this account they are my
antipodesthe richest creature brimming over with vitalitythe
dionysian god and man may not only allow himself to gaze upon the
horrible and the questionable but he can also lend his hand to the
terrible deed and can indulge in all the luxury of destruction
disaggregation and negationin him evil purposelessness and ugliness
seem just as allowable as they are in naturebecause of his bursting
plenitude of creative and rejuvenating powers which are able to convert
every desert into a luxurious land of plenty conversely it is the
greatest sufferer and pauper in vitality who is most in need of mildness
peace and goodnessthat which today is called humanenessin thought as
well as in action and possibly of a god whose speciality is to be a god
of the sick a saviour and also of logic or the abstract intelligibility
of existence even for idiots the typical freespirits like the
idealists and beautiful souls are dcadents in short of a warm
dangertight and narrow confinement between optimistic horizons which
would allow of stultification and thus very gradually i began to
understand epicurus the opposite of a dionysian greek and also the
christian who in fact is only a kind of epicurean and who with his
belief that faith saves carries the principle of hedonism as far as
possiblefar beyond all intellectual honesty if i am ahead of all other
psychologists in anything it is in this fact that my eyes are more keen
for tracing those most difficult and most captious of all deductions in
which the largest number of mistakes have been madethe deduction which
makes one infer something concerning the author from his work something
concerning the doer from his deed something concerning the idealist from
the need which produced this ideal and something concerning the imperious
craving which stands at the back of all thinking and valuingin regard
to all artists of what kind soever i shall now avail myself of this
radical distinction does the creative power in this case arise from a
loathing of life or from an excessive plenitude of life in goethe for
instance an overflow of vitality was creative in flauberthate
flaubert a new edition of pascal but as an artist with this instinctive
belief at heart flaubert est toujours haissable lhomme nest rien
luvre est tout he tortured himself when he wrote just as pascal
tortured himself when he thoughtthe feelings of both were inclined to be
nonegoistic  disinterestednessprinciple of decadence the will to
nonentity in art as well as in morality
where wagner is at home
even at the present day france is still the refuge of the most
intellectual and refined culture in europe it remains the high school of
taste but one must know where to find this france of taste the
northgerman gazette for instance or whoever expresses his sentiments
in that paper thinks that the french are barbariansas for me if i
had to find the blackest spot on earth where slaves still required to
be liberated i should turn in the direction of northern germany but
those who form part of that select france take very good care to
conceal themselves they are a small body of men and there may be some
among them who do not stand on very firm legsa few may be fatalists
hypochondriacs invalids others may be enervated and artificialsuch
are those who would fain be artisticbut all the loftiness and delicacy
which still remains to this world is in their possession in this france
of intellect which is also the france of pessimism schopenhauer is
already much more at home than he ever was in germany his principal work
has already been translated twice and the second time so excellently that
now i prefer to read schopenhauer in french he was an accident among
germans just as i amthe germans have no fingers wherewith to grasp us
they havent any fingers at allbut only claws and i do not mention
heineladorable heine as they say in pariswho long since has passed
into the flesh and blood of the more profound and more soulful of french
lyricists how could the horned cattle of germany know how to deal with
the dlicatesses of such a natureand as to richard wagner it is
obvious it is even glaringly obvious that paris is the very soil for
him the more french music adapts itself to the needs of lme moderne
the more wagnerian it will becomeit is far enough advanced in this
direction alreadyin this respect one should not allow ones self to be
misled by wagner himselfit was simply disgraceful on wagners part to
scoff at paris as he did in its agony in 1871 in spite of it all in
germany wagner is only a misapprehensionwho could be more incapable of
understanding anything about wagner than the kaiser for instanceto
everybody familiar with the movement of european culture this fact
however is certain that french romanticism and richard wagner are most
intimately related all dominated by literature up to their very eyes and
earsthe first european artists with a universal literary culturemost
of them writers poets mediators and minglers of the senses and the arts
all fanatics in expression great discoverers in the realm of the
sublime as also of the ugly and the gruesome and still greater
discoverers in passion in working for effect in the art of dressing
their windowsall possessing talent far above their geniusvirtuosos to
their backbone knowing of secret passages to all that seduces lures
constrains or overthrows born enemies of logic and of straight lines
thirsting after the exotic the strange and the monstrous and all opiates
for the senses and the understanding on the whole a daring daredevil
magnificently violent soaring and highspringing crew of artists who
first had to teach their own centuryit is the century of the mobwhat the
concept artist meant but they were ill
wagner as the apostle of chastity
1
is this the german way
comes this low bleating forth from german hearts
should teutons sin repenting lash themselves
or spread their palms with priestly unctuousness
exalt their feelings with the censers fumes
and cower and quake and bend the trembling knee
and with a sickly sweetness plead a prayer
then ogle nuns and ring the avebell
and thus with morbid fervour outdo heaven
is this the german way
beware yet are you free yet your own lords
what yonder lures is rome romes faith sung without words
2
there is no necessary contrast between sensuality and chastity every good
marriage every genuine love affair is above this contrast but in those
cases where the contrast exists it is very far from being necessarily a
tragic one this at least ought to hold good of all wellconstituted and
goodspirited mortals who are not in the least inclined to reckon their
unstable equilibrium between angel and petite bte without further ado
among the objections to existence the more refined and more intelligent
like hafis and goethe even regarded it as an additional attraction it is
precisely contradictions of this kind which lure us to life on the other
hand it must be obvious that when circes unfortunate animals are
induced to worship chastity all they see and worship therein is their
oppositeoh and with what tragic groaning and fervour may well be
imaginedthat same painful and thoroughly superfluous opposition which
towards the end of his life richard wagner undoubtedly wished to set to
music and to put on the stage and to what purpose we may reasonably
ask
3
and yet this other question can certainly not be circumvented what
business had he actually with that manly alas so unmanly bucolic
simplicity that poor devil and son of natureparsifal whom he
ultimately makes a catholic by such insidious meanswhatwas wagner in
earnest with parsifal for that he was laughed at i cannot deny any
more than gottfried keller can we should like to believe that parsifal
was meant as a piece of idle gaiety as the closing act and satyric drama
with which wagner the tragedian wished to take leave of us of himself
and above all of tragedy in a way which befitted him and his dignity
that is to say with an extravagant lofty and most malicious parody of
tragedy itself of all the past and terrible earnestness and sorrow of
this world of the most ridiculous form of the unnaturalness of the
ascetic ideal at last overcome for parsifal is the subject par
excellence for a comic opera is wagners parsifal his secret laugh of
superiority at himself the triumph of his last and most exalted state of
artistic freedom of artistic transcendenceis it wagner able to laugh
at himself once again we only wish it were so for what could parsifal be
if he were meant seriously is it necessary in his case to say as i
have heard people say that parsifal is the product of the mad hatred
of knowledge intellect and sensuality a curse upon the senses and the
mind in one breath and in one fit of hatred an act of apostasy and a
return to christianly sick and obscurantist ideals and finally even a
denial of self a deletion of self on the part of an artist who
theretofore had worked with all the power of his will in favour of the
opposite cause the spiritualisation and sensualisation of his art and
not only of his art but also of his life let us remember how
enthusiastically wagner at one time walked in the footsteps of the
philosopher feuerbach feuerbachs words healthy sensuality struck
wagner in the thirties and forties very much as they struck many other
germansthey called themselves the young germansthat is to say as words
of salvation did he ultimately change his mind on this point it would
seem that he had at least had the desire of changing his doctrine
towards the end had the hatred of life become dominant in him as in
flaubert for parsifal is a work of rancour of revenge of the most
secret concoction of poisons with which to make an end of the first
conditions of life it is a bad work the preaching of chastity remains
an incitement to unnaturalness i despise anybody who does not regard
parsifal as an outrage upon morality
how i got rid of wagner
1
already in the summer of 1876 when the first festival at bayreuth was at
its height i took leave of wagner in my soul i cannot endure anything
doublefaced since wagner had returned to germany he had condescended
step by step to everything that i despiseeven to antisemitism as a
matter of fact it was then high time to bid him farewell but the proof
of this came only too soon richard wagner ostensibly the most triumphant
creature alive as a matter of fact though a cranky and desperate
dcadent suddenly fell helpless and broken on his knees before the
christian cross was there no german at that time who had the eyes to
see and the sympathy in his soul to feel the ghastly nature of this
spectacle was i the only one who suffered from itenough the
unexpected event like a flash of lightning made me see only too clearly
what kind of a place it was that i had just leftand it also made me
shudder as a man shudders who unawares has just escaped a great danger as
i continued my journey alone i trembled not long after this i was ill
more than illi was tiredtired of the continual disappointments over
everything which remained for us modern men to be enthusiastic about of
the energy industry hope youth and love that are squandered
everywhere tired out of loathing for the whole world of idealistic lying
and consciencesoftening which once again in the case of wagner had
scored a victory over a man who was of the bravest and last but not
least tired by the sadness of a ruthless suspicionthat i was now
condemned to be ever more and more suspicious ever more and more
contemptuous ever more and more deeply alone than i had been
theretofore for i had no one save richard wagner i was always condemned
to the society of germans
2
henceforward alone and cruelly distrustful of myself i then took up
sidesnot without angeragainst myself and for all that which hurt me
and fell hard upon me and thus i found the road to that courageous
pessimism which is the opposite of all idealistic falsehood and which as
it seems to me is also the road to meto my mission that hidden and
dominating thing for which for long ages we have had no name until
ultimately it comes forth as our missionthis tyrant in us wreaks a
terrible revenge upon us for every attempt we make either to evade him or
to escape him for every one of our experiments in the way of befriending
people to whom we do not belong for every active occupation however
estimable which may make us diverge from our principal objectaye and
even for every virtue which would fain protect us from the rigour of our
most intimate sense of responsibility illness is always the answer
whenever we venture to doubt our right to our mission whenever we begin
to make things too easy for ourselves curious and terrible at the same
time it is for our relaxation that we have to pay most dearly and should
we wish after all to return to health we then have no choice we are
compelled to burden ourselves more heavily than we had been burdened
before
the psychologist speaks
1
the oftener a psychologista born an unavoidable psychologist and
souldivinerturns his attention to the more select cases and individuals
the greater becomes his danger of being suffocated by sympathy he needs
greater hardness and cheerfulness than any other man for the corruption
the ruination of higher men is in fact the rule it is terrible to have
such a rule always before our eyes the manifold torments of the
psychologist who has discovered this ruination who discovers once and
then discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history this universal
inner hopelessness of higher men this eternal too late in every
sensemay perhaps one day be the cause of his going to the dogs himself
in almost every psychologist we may see a telltale predilection in favour
of intercourse with commonplace and wellordered men and this betrays how
constantly he requires healing that he needs a sort of flight and
forgetfulness away from what his insight and incisivenessfrom what his
businesshas laid upon his conscience a horror of his memory is typical
of him he is easily silenced by the judgment of others he hears with
unmoved countenance how people honour admire love and glorify where he
has opened his eyes and seenor he even conceals his silence by
expressly agreeing with some obvious opinion perhaps the paradox of his
situation becomes so dreadful that precisely where he has learnt great
sympathy together with great contempt the educated have on their part
learnt great reverence and who knows but in all great instances just
this alone happened that the multitude worshipped a god and that the
god was only a poor sacrificial animal success has always been the
greatest liarand the work itself the deed is a success too the
great statesman the conqueror the discoverer are disguised in their
creations until they can no longer be recognised the work of the
artist of the philosopher only invents him who has created it who is
reputed to have created it the great men as they are reverenced are
poor little fictions composed afterwards in the world of historical
values counterfeit coinage prevails
2
those great poets for example such as byron musset poe leopardi
kleist gogol i do not dare to mention much greater names but i imply
them as they now appear and were perhaps obliged to be men of the
moment sensuous absurd versatile lightminded and quick to trust and
to distrust with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed
often taking revenge with their works for an internal blemish often
seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too accurate memory
idealists out of proximity to the mudwhat a torment these great
artists are and the socalled higher men in general to him who has once
found them out we are all special pleaders in the cause of mediocrity it
is conceivable that it is just from womanwho is clairvoyant in the world
of suffering and alas also unfortunately eager to help and save to an
extent far beyond her powersthat they have learnt so readily those
outbreaks of boundless sympathy which the multitude above all the
reverent multitude overwhelms with prying and selfgratifying
interpretations this sympathising invariably deceives itself as to its
power woman would like to believe that love can do everythingit is the
superstition peculiar to her alas he who knows the heart finds out how
poor helpless pretentious and blundering even the best and deepest love
ishow much more readily it destroys than saves
3
the intellectual loathing and haughtiness of every man who has suffered
deeplythe extent to which a man can suffer almost determines the order
of rankthe chilling uncertainty with which he is thoroughly imbued and
coloured that by virtue of his suffering he knows more than the
shrewdest and wisest can ever know that he has been familiar with and
at home in many distant terrible worlds of which you know
nothingthis silent intellectual haughtiness this pride of the elect of
knowledge of the initiated of the almost sacrificed finds all forms
of disguise necessary to protect itself from contact with gushing and
sympathising hands and in general from all that is not its equal in
suffering profound suffering makes noble it separatesone of the most
refined forms of disguise is epicurism along with a certain ostentatious
boldness of taste which takes suffering lightly and puts itself on the
defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound there are cheerful
men who make use of good spirits because they are misunderstood on
account of themthey wish to be misunderstood there are scientific
minds who make use of science because it gives a cheerful appearance
and because love of science leads people to conclude that a person is
shallowthey wish to mislead to a false conclusion there are free
insolent spirits which would fain conceal and deny that they are at bottom
broken incurable heartsthis is hamlets case and then folly itself can
be the mask of an unfortunate and alas all too deadcertain knowledge
epilogue
1
i have often asked myself whether i am not much more deeply indebted to
the hardest years of my life than to any others according to the voice of
my innermost nature everything necessary seen from above and in the
light of a superior economy is also useful in itselfnot only should
one bear it one should love it amor fati this is the very core of
my beingand as to my prolonged illness do i not owe much more to it than
i owe to my health to it i owe a higher kind of health a sort of
health which grows stronger under everything that does not actually kill
itto it i owe even my philosophy only great suffering is the
ultimate emancipator of spirit for it teaches one that vast
suspiciousness which makes an x out of every u a genuine and proper x
ie the antepenultimate letter only great suffering that great
suffering under which we seem to be over a fire of greenwood the
suffering that takes its timeforces us philosophers to descend into our
nethermost depths and to let go of all trustfulness all goodnature all
whittlingdown all mildness all mediocrityon which things we had
formerly staked our humanity i doubt whether such suffering improves a
man but i know that it makes him deeper supposing we learn to set our
pride our scorn our strength of will against it and thus resemble the
indian who however cruelly he may be tortured considers himself revenged
on his tormentor by the bitterness of his own tongue supposing we
withdraw from pain into nonentity into the deaf dumb and rigid sphere
of selfsurrender selfforgetfulness selfeffacement one is another
person when one leaves these protracted and dangerous exercises in the art
of selfmastery one has one note of interrogation the more and above all
one has the will henceforward to ask more deeper sterner harder more
wicked and more silent questions than anyone has ever asked on earth
before trust in life has vanished life itself has become a
problembut let no one think that one has therefore become a spirit of
gloom or a blind owl even love of life is still possiblebut it is a
different kind of love it is the love for a woman whom we doubt
2
the rarest of all things is this to have after all another tastea
second taste out of such abysses out of the abyss of great suspicion
as well a man returns as though born again he has a new skin he is more
susceptible more full of wickedness he has a finer taste for joyfulness
he has a more sensitive tongue for all good things his senses are more
cheerful he has acquired a second more dangerous innocence in gladness
he is more childish too and a hundred times more cunning than ever he had
been before
oh how much more repulsive pleasure now is to him that coarse heavy
buffcoloured pleasure which is understood by our pleasureseekers our
cultured people our wealthy folk and our rulers with how much more
irony we now listen to the hubbub as of a country fair with which the
cultured man and the man about town allow themselves to be forced
through art literature music and with the help of intoxicating liquor
to intellectual enjoyments how the stagecry of passion now stings our
ears how strange to our taste the whole romantic riot and sensuous
bustle which the cultured mob are so fond of together with its
aspirations to the sublime to the exalted and the distorted have become
no if we convalescents require an art at all it is another arta
mocking nimble volatile divinely undisturbed divinely artificial art
which blazes up like pure flame into a cloudless sky but above all an
art for artists only for artists we are after all more conversant
with that which is in the highest degree necessarycheerfulness every
kind of cheerfulness my friends we men of knowledge now know
something only too well oh how well we have learnt by this time to
forget not to know as artists as to our future we shall scarcely be
found on the track of those egyptian youths who break into temples at
night who embrace statues and would fain unveil strip and set in broad
daylight everything which there are excellent reasons to keep
concealed15 no we are disgusted with this bad taste this will to
truth this search after truth at all costs this madness of
adolescence the love of truth we are now too experienced too serious
too joyful too scorched too profound for that we no longer believe
that truth remains truth when it is unveiledwe have lived enough to
understand this today it seems to us good form not to strip everything
naked not to be present at all things not to desire to know all
tout comprendre cest tout mpriser is it true a little girl once
asked her mother that the beloved father is everywherei think it quite
impropera hint to philosophers the shame with which nature has
concealed herself behind riddles and enigmas should be held in higher
esteem perhaps truth is a woman who has reasons for not revealing her
reasons perhaps her name to use a greek word is baubooh these
greeks they understood the art of living for this it is needful to
halt bravely at the surface at the fold at the skin to worship
appearance and to believe in forms tones words and the whole olympus
of appearance these greeks were superficialfrom profundity and are
we not returning to precisely the same thing we daredevils of intellect
who have scaled the highest and most dangerous pinnacles of present
thought in order to look around us from that height in order to look
down from that height are we not precisely in this respectgreeks
worshippers of form of tones of words precisely on that
accountartists
selected aphorisms from nietzsches retrospect of his years of friendship
with wagner
summer 1878
1
my blunder was this i travelled to bayreuth with an ideal in my breast
and was thus doomed to experience the bitterest disappointment the
preponderance of ugliness grotesqueness and strong pepper thoroughly
repelled me
2
i utterly disagree with those who were dissatisfied with the decorations
the scenery and the mechanical contrivances at bayreuth far too much
industry and ingenuity was applied to the task of chaining the imagination
to matters which did not belie their epic origin but as to the
naturalism of the attitudes of the singing compared with the orchestra
what affected artificial and depraved tones what a distortion of nature
were we made to hear
3
we are witnessing the death agony of the last art bayreuth has
convinced me of this
4
my picture of wagner completely surpassed him i had depicted an ideal
monsterone however which is perhaps quite capable of kindling the
enthusiasm of artists the real wagner bayreuth as it actually is was
only like a bad final proof pulled on inferior paper from the engraving
which was my creation my longing to see real men and their motives
received an extraordinary impetus from this humiliating experience
5
this to my sorrow is what i realised a good deal even struck me with
sudden fear at last i felt however that if only i could be strong
enough to take sides against myself and what i most loved i would find the
road to truth and get solace and encouragement from itand in this way i
became filled with a sensation of joy far greater than that upon which i
was now voluntarily turning my back
6
i was in love with art passionately in love and in the whole of
existence saw nothing else than artand this at an age when reasonably
enough quite different passions usually possess the soul
7
goethe said the yearning spirit within me which in earlier years i
may perhaps have fostered too earnestly and which as i grew older i tried
my utmost to combat did not seem becoming in the man and i therefore had
to strive to attain to more complete freedom conclusioni have had to
do the same
8
he who wakes us always wounds us
9
i do not possess the talent of being loyal and what is still worse i
have not even the vanity to try to appear as if i did
10
he who accomplishes anything that lies beyond the vision and the
experience of his acquaintancesprovokes envy and hatred masked as
pityprejudice regards the work as decadence disease seduction long
faces
11
i frankly confess that i had hoped that by means of art the germans would
become thoroughly disgusted with decaying christianityi regarded german
mythology as a solvent as a means of accustoming people to polytheism
what a fright i had over the catholic revival
12
it is possible neither to suffer sufficiently acutely from life nor to be
so lifeless and emotionally weak as to have need of wagners art as to
require it as a medium this is the principal reason of ones opposition
to it and not baser motives something to which we are not driven by any
personal need and which we do not require we cannot esteem so highly
13
it is a question either of no longer requiring wagners art or of still
requiring it
gigantic forces lie concealed in it it drives one beyond its own
domain
14
goethe said are not byrons audacity sprightliness and grandeur all
creative we must beware of always looking for this quality in that which
is perfectly pure and moral all greatness is creative the moment we
realise it this should be applied to wagners art
15
we shall always have to credit wagner with the fact that in the second
half of the nineteenth century he impressed art upon our memory as an
important and magnificent thing true he did this in his own fashion and
this was not the fashion of upright and farseeing men
16
wagner versus the cautious the cold and the contented of the worldin
this lies his greatnesshe is a stranger to his agehe combats the
frivolous and the supersmartbut he also fights the just the moderate
those who delight in the world like goethe and the mild the people of
charm the scientific among menthis is the reverse of the medal
17
our youth was up in arms against the soberness of the age it plunged
into the cult of excess of passion of ecstasy and of the blackest and
most austere conception of the world
18
wagner pursues one form of madness the age another form both carry on
their chase at the same speed each is as blind and as unjust as the
other
19
it is very difficult to trace the course of wagners inner developmentno
trust must be placed in his own description of his souls experiences he
writes partypamphlets for his followers
20
it is extremely doubtful whether wagner is able to bear witness about
himself
21
there are men who try in vain to make a principle out of themselves
this was the case with wagner
22
wagners obscurity concerning final aims his nonantique fogginess
23
all wagners ideas straightway become manias he is tyrannised over by
them how can such a man allow himself to be tyrannised over in this 
way for instance by his hatred of jews he kills his themes like his
ideas by means of his violent love of repeating them the problem of
excessive length and breadth he bores us with his raptures
24
cest la rage de voulour penser et sentir au del de sa force
doudan the wagnerites
25
wagner whose ambition far exceeds his natural gifts has tried an
incalculable number of times to achieve what lay beyond his powersbut it
almost makes one shudder to see some one assail with such persistence that
which defies conquestthe fate of his constitution
26
he is always thinking of the most extreme expressionin every word but
in the end superlatives begin to pall
27
there is something which is in the highest degree suspicious in wagner
and that is wagners suspicion it is such a strong trait in him that on
two occasions i doubted whether he were a musician at all
28
the proposition in the face of perfection there is no salvation save
love16 is thoroughly wagnerian profound jealousy of everything great
from which he can draw fresh ideas hatred of all that which he cannot
approach the renaissance french and greek art in style
29
wagner is jealous of all periods that have shown restraint he despises
beauty and grace and finds only his own virtues in the germans and
even attributes all his failings to them
30
wagner has not the power to unlock and liberate the soul of those he
frequents wagner is not sure of himself but distrustful and arrogant
his art has this effect upon artists it is envious of all rivals
31
platos envy he would fain monopolise socrates he saturates the latter
with himself pretends to adorn him   and tries to
separate all socratists from him in order himself to appear as the only
true apostle but his historical presentation of him is false even to a
parlous degree just as wagners presentation of beethoven and shakespeare
is false
32
when a dramatist speaks about himself he plays a part this is inevitable
when wagner speaks about bach and beethoven he speaks like one for whom he
would fain be taken but he impresses only those who are already
convinced for his dissimulation and his genuine nature are far too
violently at variance
33
wagner struggles against the frivolity in his nature which to him the
ignoble as opposed to goethe constituted the joy of life
34
wagner has the mind of the ordinary man who prefers to trace things to
one cause the jews do the same one aim therefore one saviour in
this way he simplifies german and culture wrongly but strongly
35
wagner admitted all this to himself often enough when in private communion
with his soul i only wish he had also admitted it publicly for what
constitutes the greatness of a character if it is not this that he who
possesses it is able to take sides even against himself in favour of
truth
wagners teutonism
36
that which is ungerman in wagner he lacks the german charm and grace of
a beethoven a mozart a weber he also lacks the flowing cheerful fire
allegro con brio of beethoven and weber he cannot be free and easy
without being grotesque he lacks modesty indulges in big drums and
always tends to surcharge his effect he is not the good official that
bach was neither has he that goethean calm in regard to his rivals
37
wagner always reaches the highwater mark of his vanity when he speaks of
the german nature incidentally it is also the height of his imprudence
for if frederick the greats justice goethes nobility and freedom from
envy beethovens sublime resignation bachs delicately transfigured
spiritual lifeif steady work performed without any thought of glory and
success and without envy constitute the true german qualities would
it not seem as if wagner almost wished to prove he is no german
38
terrible wildness abject sorrow emptiness the shudder of joy
unexpectednessin short all the qualities peculiar to the semitic race i
believe that the jews approach wagners art with more understanding than
the aryans do
39
a passage concerning the jews taken from taineas it happens i have
misled the reader the passage does not concern wagner at allbut can it
be possible that wagner is a jew in that case we could readily understand
his dislike of jews17
40
wagners art is absolutely the art of the age an sthetic age would
have rejected it the more subtle people amongst us actually do reject it
even now the coarsifying of everything stheticcompared with goethes
ideal it is very far behind the moral contrast of these selfindulgent
burningly loyal creatures of wagner acts like a spur like an irritant
and even this sensation is turned to account in obtaining an effect
41
what is it in our age that wagners art expresses that brutality and most
delicate weakness which exist side by side that running wild of natural
instincts and nervous hypersensitiveness that thirst for emotion which
arises from fatigue and the love of fatigueall this is understood by the
wagnerites
42
stupefaction or intoxication constitute all wagnerian art on the other
hand i could mention instances in which wagner stands higher in which
real joy flows from him
43
the reason why the figures in wagners art behave so madly is because he
greatly feared lest people would doubt that they were alive
44
wagners art is an appeal to inartistic people all means are welcomed
which help towards obtaining an effect it is calculated not to produce an
artistic effect but an effect upon the nerves in general
45
apparently in wagner we have an art for everybody because coarse and
subtle means seem to be united in it albeit its prerequisite may be
musicosthetic education and particularly with moral indifference
46
in wagner we find the most ambitious combination of all means with the
view of obtaining the strongest effect whereas genuine musicians quietly
develop individual genres
47
dramatists are borrowerstheir principal source of wealthartistic
thoughts drawn from the epos wagner borrowed from classical music
besides dramatists are constructive geniuses they are not inventive and
original as the epic poets are drama takes a lower rank than the epos it
presupposes a coarser and more democratic public
48
wagner does not altogether trust music he weaves kindred sensations
into it in order to lend it the character of greatness he measures
himself on others he first of all gives his listeners intoxicating drinks
in order to lead them into believing that it was the music that
intoxicated them
49
the same amount of talent and industry which makes the classic when it
appears some time too late also makes the baroque artist like wagner
50
wagners art is calculated to appeal to shortsighted peopleone has to
get much too close up to it miniature it also appeals to longsighted
people but not to those with normal sight
contradictions in the idea of musical drama
51
just listen to the second act of the gtterdmmerung without the drama
it is chaotic music as wild as a bad dream and it is as frightfully
distinct as if it desired to make itself clear even to deaf people this
volubility with nothing to say is alarming compared with it the drama
is a genuine reliefis the fact that this music when heard alone is as
a whole intolerable apart from a few intentionally isolated parts in its
favour suffice it to say that this music without its accompanying
drama is a perpetual contradiction of all the highest laws of style
belonging to older music he who thoroughly accustoms himself to it loses
all feeling for these laws but has the drama been improved thanks to
this addition a symbolic interpretation has been affixed to it a sort
of philological commentary which sets fetters upon the inner and free
understanding of the imaginationit is tyrannical music is the language
of the commentator who talks the whole of the time and gives us no
breathing space moreover his is a difficult language which also requires
to be explained he who step by step has mastered first the libretto
language then converted it into action in his minds eye then sought
out and understood and became familiar with the musical symbolism
thereto aye and has fallen in love with all three things such a man
then experiences a great joy but how exacting it is quite impossible
to do this save for a few short momentssuch tenfold attention on the
part of ones eyes ears understanding and feeling such acute activity
in apprehending without any productive reaction is far too
exhaustingonly the very fewest behave in this way how is it then that
so many are affected because most people are only intermittingly
attentive and are inattentive for sometimes whole passages at a stretch
because they bestow their undivided attention now upon the music later
upon the drama and anon upon the scenerythat is to say they take the
work to piecesbut in this way the kind of work we are discussing is
condemned not the drama but a moment of it is the result an arbitrary
selection the creator of a new genre should consider this the arts
should not always be dished up togetherbut we should imitate the
moderation of the ancients which is truer to human nature
52
wagner reminds one of lava which blocks its own course by congealing and
suddenly finds itself checked by dams which it has itself built there is
no allegro con fuoco for him
53
i compare wagners music which would fain have the same effect as speech
with that kind of sculptural relief which would have the same effect as
painting the highest laws of style are violated and that which is most
sublime can no longer be achieved
54
the general heaving undulating and rolling of wagners art
55
in regard to wagners rejection of form we are reminded of goethes
remark in conversation with eckermann there is no great art in being
brilliant if one respects nothing
56
once one theme is over wagner is always embarrassed as to how to
continue hence the long preparation the suspense his peculiar
craftiness consisted in transvaluing his weakness into virtues
57
the lack of melody and the poverty of melody in wagner melody is a
whole consisting of many beautiful proportions it is the reflection of a
wellordered soul he strives after melody but if he finds one he almost
suffocates it in his embrace
58
the natural nobility of a bach and a beethoven the beautiful soul even
of a mendelssohn are wanting in wagner he is one degree lower
59
wagner imitates himself again and againmannerisms that is why he was the
quickest among musicians to be imitated it is so easy
60
mendelssohn who lacked the power of radically staggering one incidentally
this was the talent of the jews in the old testament makes up for this
by the things which were his own that is to say freedom within the law
and noble emotions kept within the limits of beauty
61
liszt the first representative of all musicians but no musician
he was the prince not the statesman the conglomerate of a hundred
musicians souls but not enough of a personality to cast his own shadow
upon them
62
the most wholesome phenomenon is brahms in whose music there is more
german blood than in that of wagners with these words i would say
something complimentary but by no means wholly so
63
in wagners writings there is no greatness or peace but presumption why
64
wagners stylethe habit he acquired from his earliest days of having
his say in the most important matters without a sufficient knowledge of
them has rendered him the obscure and incomprehensible writer that he is
in addition to this he aspired to imitating the witty newspaper article
and finally acquired that presumption which readily joins hands with
carelessness and behold it was very good
65
i am alarmed at the thought of how much pleasure i could find in wagners
style which is so careless as to be unworthy of such an artist
66
in wagner as in brahms there is a blind denial of the healthy in his
followers this denial is deliberate and conscious
67
wagners art is for those who are conscious of an essential blunder in the
conduct of their lives they feel either that they have checked a great
nature by a base occupation or squandered it through idle pursuits a
conventional marriage c c
in this quarter the condemnation of the world is the outcome of the
condemnation of the ego
68
wagnerites do not wish to alter themselves in any way they live
discontentedly in insipid conventional and brutal circumstancesonly at
intervals does art have to raise them as by magic above these things
weakness of will
69
wagners art is for scholars who do not dare to become philosophers they
feel discontented with themselves and are generally in a state of obtuse
stupefactionfrom time to time they take a bath in the opposite
conditions
70
i feel as if i had recovered from an illness with a feeling of
unutterable joy i think of mozarts requiem i can once more enjoy
simple fare
71
i understand sophocles development through and throughit was the
repugnance to pomp and pageantry
72
i gained an insight into the injustice of idealism by noticing that i
avenged myself on wagner for the disappointed hopes i had cherished of
him
73
i leave my loftiest duty to the end and that is to thank wagner and
schopenhauer publicly and to make them as it were take sides against
themselves
74
i counsel everybody not to fight shy of such paths wagner and
schopenhauer the wholly unphilosophic feeling of remorse has become
quite strange to me
wagners effects
75
we must strive to oppose the false aftereffects of wagners art if he
in order to create parsifal is forced to pump fresh strength from
religious sources this is not an example but a danger
76
i entertain the fear that the effects of wagners art will ultimately pour
into that torrent which takes its rise on the other side of the mountains
and which knows how to flow even over mountains18

   10 noteit was a real disaster for sthetics when the word drama got
      to be translated by action wagner is not the only culprit here
      the whole world does the sameeven the philologists who ought to
      know better what ancient drama had in view was grand pathetic
      scenesit even excluded action or placed it before the piece or
      behind the scenes the word drama is of doric origin and
      according to the usage of the dorian language it meant event
      historyboth words in a hieratic sense the oldest drama
      represented local legends sacred history upon which the
      foundation of the cult rested thus it was not action but
      fatality  in doric has nothing to do with action
   11 hegel and his school wrote notoriously obscure germantr
   12 was wagner a german at all there are reasons enough for putting
      this question it is difficult to find a single german trait in his
      character great learner that he was he naturally imitated a great
      deal that was germanbut that is all his very soul contradicts
      everything which hitherto has been regarded as german not to
      mention german musicianshis father was an actor of the name of
      geyer that which has been popularised hitherto as wagners life
      is fable convenue if not something worse i confess my doubts on
      any point which is vouched for by wagner alone he was not proud
      enough to be able to suffer the truth about himself nobody had less
      pride than he like victor hugo he remained true to himself even in
      his biographyhe remained an actor

      can discover who are my peers rejoices in being accessible only to

   18 it should be noted that the german catholic party is called the
