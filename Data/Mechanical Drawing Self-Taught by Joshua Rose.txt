preface
the object of this book is to enable the beginner to learn to make
simple mechanical drawings without the aid of an instructor and to
create an interest in the subject by giving examples such as the
machinist meets with in his everyday workshop practice the plan of
representing in many examples the pencil lines and numbering the order
in which they are marked the author believes to possess great
advantages for the learner since it is the producing of the pencil
lines that really proves the study the inking in being merely a
curtailed repetition of the pencilling similarly when the drawing of a
piece such for example as a fully developed screw thread is shown
fully developed from end to end even though the pencil lines were all
shown yet the process of construction will be less clear than if the
process of development be shown gradually along the drawing thus
beginning at an end of the example the first pencil lines only may be
shown and as the pencilling progresses to the righthand the
development may progress so that at the other or lefthand end the
finished inked in and shaded thread may be shown and between these two
ends will be found a part showing each stage of development of the
thread all the lines being numbered in the order in which they were
marked this prevents a confusion of lines and makes it more easy to
follow or to copy the drawing
it is the numerous inquiries from working machinists for a book of this
kind that have led the author to its production which he hopes and
believes will meet the want thus indicated giving to the learner a
sufficiently practical knowledge of mechanical drawing to enable him to
proceed further by copying such drawings as he may be able to obtain or
by the aid of some of the more expensive and elaborate books already
published on the subject
he believes that in learning mechanical drawing without the aid of an
instructor the chief difficulty is overcome when the learner has become
sufficiently familiar with the instruments to be enabled to use them
without hesitation or difficulty and it is to attain this end that the
chapter on plotting mechanical motions and the succeeding examples have
been introduced these forming studies that are easily followed by the
beginner while sufficiently interesting to afford to the student
pleasure as well as profit

the drawing board
a drawing board should be of soft pine and free from knots so that it
will easily receive the pins or tacks used to fasten down the paper its
surface should be flat and level or a little rounding so that the
paper shall lie close to its surface which is one of the first
requisites in making a good drawing its edges should be straight and at
a right angle one to the other and the ends of the battens b b in
figure 1 should fall a little short of the edge a of the board so that
if the latter shrinks they will not protrude the size of the board of
course depends upon the size of the paper hence it is best to obtain a
board as small as will answer for the size of paper it is intended to
use the student will find it most convenient as well as cheapest to
learn on small drawings rather than large ones since they take less
time to make and cost less for paper and although they require more
skill to make yet are preferable for the beginner because he does not
require to reach so far over the board and furthermore they teach him
more quickly and effectively he who can make a fair drawing having
short lines and small curves can make a better one if it has large
curves etc because it is easier to draw a large than a very small
circle or curve it is unnecessary to enter into a description of the
various kinds of drawing boards in use because if the student purchases
one he will be duly informed of the kinds and their special features
while if he intends to make one the sketch in figure 1 will give him all
the information he requires save that as before noted the wood must
be soft pine well seasoned and free from knots while the battens b
should be dovetailed in and the face of the board trued after they are
glued and driven in to true the edges square it is best to make the
two longest edges parallel and straight and then the ends may be
squared from those long edges
illustration fig 1
the t square
drawing squares or t squares as they are termed are made of wood of
hard rubber and of steel
there are several kinds of t squares in one the blade is solid as it
is shown in figure 5 on page 20 in another the back of the square is
pivoted so that the blade can be set to draw lines at an angle as well
as across the board which is often very convenient although this
double back prevents the triangles when used in some positions from
coming close enough to the left hand side of the board in an improved
form of steel square with pivoted blade shown in figure 2 the back is
provided with a half circle divided into the degrees of a circle so
that the blade can be set to any required degree of angle at once
illustration fig 2
illustration fig 3
illustration fig 4
the triangles
illustration fig 5
two triangles are all that are absolutely necessary for a beginner the
first is that shown in figure 3 which is called a triangle of 45
degrees because its edge a is at that angle to edges b and c that in
figure 4 is called a triangle of 60 degrees its edge a being at 60
degrees to b and at 30 degrees to c the edges p and c are at a right
angle or an angle of 90 degrees in both figures hence they are in this
respect alike by means of these triangles alone a great many straight
line drawings may be made with ease without the use of a drawing square
but it is better for the beginner to use the square at first the manner
of using these triangles with the square is shown in figure 5 in which
the triangle figure 3 is shown in three positions marked d e f and
that shown in figure 4 is shown in three positions marked respectively
g h and i it is obvious however that by turning i over end for end
another position is attained the usefulness in these particular
triangles is because in the various positions shown they are capable of
use for drawing a very large proportion of the lines that occur in
mechanical drawing the principal requirement in their use is to hold
them firmly to the squareblade without moving it and without
permitting them to move upon it the learner will find that this is best
attained by so regulating the height of the squareblade that the line
to be drawn does not come down too near the bottom of the triangle or
edge of the squareblade nor too high on the triangle that is to say
too near its uppermost point it is the lefthand edge of the triangle
that is used whenever it can be done to produce the required line
illustration fig 6
curves
to draw curves that are not formed of arcs or parts of circles
templates called curves are provided examples of these forms being
given in figure 6 they are made in wood and in hard rubber the latter
being most durable their uses are so obvious as to require no
explanation it may be remarked however that the use of curves gives
excellent practice because they must be adjusted very accurately to
produce good results and the drawing pen must be held in the same
vertical plane or the curve drawn will not be true in its outline
drawing instruments
it is not intended or necessary to enter into an elaborate discussion of
the various kinds of drawing instruments since the purchaser can obtain
a good set of drawing instruments from a reputable dealer by paying a
proportionate price and must per force learn to use such as his means
enable him to purchase it is recommended that the beginner purchase as
good a set of instruments as his means will permit and that if his
means are limited he purchase less than a full set of instruments
having the same of good quality
all the instruments that need be used in the examples of this book are
as follows
a small spring bowpen for circles a lining pen or pen for straight
lines a small spring bowpencil for circles a large bowpen with a
removable leg to replace by a divider leg or a pencil leg and having an
extension piece to increase its capacity
the spring bowpen should have a stiff spring and should be opened out
to its full capacity to see that the spring acts well when so opened
out keeping the legs stiff when opened for the larger diameters the
purchaser should see that the joint for opening and closing the legs is
an easy but not a loose fit on the screw and that the legs will not
move sideways to test this latter which is of great importance in the
spring bowpencil as well as in the pen it is well to close the legs
nearly together and taking one leg in one hand and the other leg in the
other hand between the forefinger and thumb pushing and pulling them
sideways any motion in that direction being sufficient to condemn the
instrument it is safest and best to have the two legs of the bowpen
and pencil made from one piece of metal and not of two separate pieces
screwed together at the top as the screw will rarely hold them firmly
together the points should be long and fine and as round as possible
in very small instruments separate points that are fastened with a screw
are objectionable because in very small circles they hide the point
and make it difficult to apply the instrument to the exact proper point
or spot on the drawing
the joints of the large bow or circlepen should also be somewhat stiff
and quite free from side motion and the extension piece should be
rigidly secured when held by the screw it is a good plan in purchasing
to put in the extension piece open the joint and the pen to their
fullest and draw a circle moving the pen in one direction and then
redraw it moving it in the other direction and if one line only
appears and that not thickened by the second drawing the pen is a good
one
the lead pencil should be of hard lead and it is recommended that they
be of the h h h h h h in the english grades which corresponds to
the v v h of the dixon grade the pencil lines should be made as
lightly as possible first because the presence of the lead on the
paper tends to prevent the ink from passing to the paper and secondly
because in rubbing out the pencil lines the ink lines are reduced in
blackness and the surface of the paper becomes roughened so that it
will soil easier and be harder to clean in order to produce fine pencil
lines without requiring a very frequent sharpening of the pencil it is
best to sharpen the pencil as in figures 7 and 8 so that the edge shall
be long in the direction in which it is moved which is denoted by the
arrow in figure 7 but when very fine work is to be done as in the case
of patent office drawings a long round point is preferable because
the eye can see plainer just where the pencil will begin to mark and
leave off hence the pencil lines will not be so liable to overrun
illustration fig 7
illustration fig 8
in place of the ordinary woodcovered lead pencils there may be obtained
at the drawing material stores pencil holders for holding the fine
round sticks of lead and these are by far the best for a learner they
are easier to sharpen and will slip in the holder giving warning when
the draftsman is pressing them too hard on the paper as he is apt to
do the best method of trimming these leads as also lead pencils after
they have been roughly shaped is with a small fine file holding the
file still and moving the pencil or a good piece of emery paper or sand
paper is good moving the pencil as before
all lines in pencilling as in inking in should begin at the left hand
and be drawn towards the right or when triangles are used the lines are
begun at the bottom and drawn towards the top or away from the
operator the rubber used should not be of a harsh grade since that
will roughen the face of the paper and probably cause the ink to run
the less rubbing out the better the learner will progress and the more
satisfaction he will receive from the results if it becomes necessary
to scratch out it is best done with a penknife well sharpened and not
applied too forcibly to the paper but somewhat lightly and moved in
different and not all in one direction after the penknife the rubber
may sometimes be used to advantage since it will if of a smooth grade
leave the paper smoother than the knife finally before inking in the
surface that has been scraped should be condensed again by rubbing some
clean hard substance over it which will prevent the ink from spreading
the end of a papercutter or the end of a rounded ivory handled drawing
instrument is excellent for this purpose
illustration fig 9
illustration fig 10
it is well to use the rubber for general purposes in such a way as to
fit it for special purposes thus in cleaning the sheet of paper the
rubber may be applied first as in figure 9 as at a and then as at b
and if it be moved sideways at the same time it will wear to the form
shown in figure 10 which will enable it to be applied along a line that
may require to be rubbed out without removing other and neighboring
lines if the rubber is in the form of a square stick one end may be
bevelled as in figure 11 which is an excellent form or it may be made
to have a point as in figure 12 the object is in each case to enable
the rubber action to be confined to the desired location on the paper
so as to destroy its smooth surface as little as possible
illustration fig 11
illustration fig 12
for simple cleaning purposes or to efface the pencil lines when they
are drawn very lightly squares of spongerubber answer admirably these
being furnished by the dealers in drawing materials
a piece of bread will answer a similar purpose but it is less
convenient
for glazed surface paper as bristolboard the smoothest rubber must be
used the grade termed velvet rubber answering well
the drawing paper
whatever kind of drawing paper be used it should be kept dry or the
ink however good it may be will be apt to run and make a thick line
that will not have the sharp clean edges necessary to make lines look
well
drawing paper is made in various qualities kinds and forms as
follows the sizes and names of paper made in sheets are
cap                13  16 inches

the thickness of the sheets increasing with their size some sheets of
paper are hot pressed to give a smoother surface and thus enable
cleaneredged lines to be drawn
illustration fig 13
for large drawings paper is made in rolls of various widths but as
rolled paper is troublesome to lay flat upon the drawing board it is
recommended to the learner to obtain the sheets which may be laid
sufficiently flat by means of broad headed pins such as shown in figure
13 which are called thumb tacks these are forced through the paper
into the board at each corner as in figure 14 at f on account of the
large diameter of the stems of these thumb tacks which unduly pierce
and damage the board and on account also of their heads by reason of
their thickness coming in the way of the square blade it will be
found preferable to use the smallest sizes of ordinary iron tacks with
flat heads whose stems are much finer and heads much thinner than thumb
tacks the objection to ordinary tacks is that they are more difficult
to remove but they are as stated more desirable for use
illustration fig 14
illustration fig 15
if the paper is nearly the full size of the board it does not much
matter as to its precise location on the board but otherwise it is best
to place it as near the lefthand edge of the board as convenient as is
shown in figure 14
the lower edge d figure 15 of the paper however should not be
placed too near the edge a of the board because if the end p of the
square back comes down below the edge of the board it is more difficult
to keep the square back true against the end of the board
the paper must lie flat upon and close to the surface of the board and
a sufficient number of tacks must be used to effect this purpose
drawings that are to be intricate or to contain a great many lines as
a drawing of an engine or of a machine are best pasted or glued all
around the edges of the paper which should first be dampened but as
the learner will scarcely require to make such drawings until he is
somewhat familiar with and well practised in the use of the instruments
this part of the subject need not be treated here
tracing paper
for taking tracings from drawings tracing paper or tracing cloth is
used they require to be stretched tightly and without wrinkles upon the
drawing to effect this object the mucilage should be thick and the
tracing paper should be dampened with a sponge after it is pasted it
must be thoroughly dry before use or the ink will run
tracing cloth must be fastened by pins or thumb tacks and not dampened
the drawing should be made on the polished side of the cloth and any
coloring to be done should be on the other side and done after the
tracing is removed from the drawing
the ink
india ink should always be used for mechanical drawing first because
it lies upon and does not sink into the paper and is therefore easily
erased and secondly because it does not corrode or injure the drawing
instruments
india ink is prepared in two formsin the stick and in a liquid form
the stick ink is mixed in what are termed saucers or cabinet saucers
one being placed above the other so as to exclude the dust from
settling in it and also to prevent the rapid evaporation to which it is
subject
the surface of the saucer should be smooth as any roughness grinds the
ink too coarsely whereas the finer it is ground or mixed the easier it
will flow the less liability to clog the instruments and the smoother
and more flat it will lie upon the paper in mixing the ink only a small
quantity of water should be used the stick of ink being pressed
lightly upon the saucer and moved quickly the grinding being
continued until the ink is mixed quite thickly this will grind the ink
fine as it is mixed and more water may be added to thin it it is best
however to let the ink be somewhat thick for use and to keep it
covered when not in use and though water may be added if it gets too
thick yet ink that has once dried should not be mixed up again as it
will not work so well after having once dried
of liquid inks the higgins ink is by far the best being quite equal to
and much more convenient for use than the best stick ink
the difference between a good and an inferior india ink lies chiefly in
the extent to which the lampblack which is the coloring matter forms
with the water a chemical solution rather than a mechanical mixture in
inferior ink the lampblack is more or less held in suspension and by
prolonged exposure to the air will separate so that on being spread the
solid particles will aggregate by themselves and the water by itself
this explains why draughtsmen will after the ink has been exposed to
the air for an hour or two add a drop of mucilage to it the mucilage
thickening the solution adding weight to the water and deferring the
separation of the lampblack
a good india ink is jet black flows easily lies close to does not
stand upon or sink into the paper and has an even lustre the latter
being an indication of fineness the more perfect the incorporation of
the lampblack with the water the easier the ink will flow the less
liable it is to clog the instruments the more even and sharp the edges
of the lines and the finer the lines that may be drawn
usually india ink can only be tested by actual trial but since it is
desirable to test before purchasing it it may be mentioned that one
method is to mix a little on the finger nail and if it has a bronzy
gloss it is a good indication it should also spread out and dry without
any tendency to separate
the best method of testing is to mix a very little and drop a single
drop in a tumbler of clear water the best ink will diffuse itself over
the surface and if the water is disturbed will diffuse itself through
the water leaving it translucent and black with a slight tinge of
bronze color a coarser ink will act in a similar manner but make the
water somewhat opaque with a blueblack or dull ashy color a still
coarser ink will when diffused over the surface of the water show fine
specks like black dust on the surface this is readily apparent
showing that the mixture of the ink is not homogeneous
when it is an object to have the lines of a drawing show as black as
possible as for drawings that are to be photoengraved the ink should
be mixed so thickly as to have a tendency to lift when a body such as a
lead pencil is lifted out of it for patent office drawings some will
mix it so thickly that under the above test it appears a little stringy
the thicker the ink can be used the better because the tendency of the
carbon to separate is less and it is for this reason that the test
mentioned with a tumbler of water is so accurate when ink is to be used
on parchment or glossy tracingpaper it will flow perfectly if a few
drops of oxgall be mixed with it but on soft paper or on bristol
board this will cause the ink to spread
for purposes of measurement there are special rules or scales of steel
and of paper manufactured the steel rules are finely and accurately
divided and some are of triangular form so that when laid upon the
paper the lines divided will lie close to the paper and the light will
fall directly on the ruled surface triangular rules or scales are
therefore much superior to flat ones the object of having a paper rule
or scale is that the paper will expand and contract under varying
degrees of atmospheric moisture the same as the drawing paper does
figure 16 represents a triangular scale having upon it six different
divisions of the inch these are made in different patterns having
either decimal divisions or the vulgar fractions being made of steel
and nickelplated they are proof against the moisture of the fingers
and are not subject to the variation of the wooden scale
illustration fig 16
chapter ii
the preparation and use of the instruments
the points of drawing instruments require to be very accurately prepared
and shaped to enable them to make clean clear lines the object is to
have the points as sharp as they can be made without cutting the paper
and the curves as even and regular as possible
illustration fig 17
illustration fig 18
the lining pen should be formed as in figure 17 which presents an edge
and a front view of the points the inside faces should be flat across
and slightly curved in their lengths as shown if this curve is too
great as shown exaggerated in figure 18 the body of the ink lies too
near the point and is apt to flow too freely running over the penpoint
and making a thick ragged line on the other hand if the inside faces
between which the ink lies are too parallel and narrow near the points
the ink dries in the pen and renders a too frequent cleaning necessary
looking at the face of the pen as at a in figure 17 its point should
have an even curve as shown the edge being as sharp as it can be made
without cutting the drawing paper upon this quality depends the
fineness and cleanness of the lines it will make this thin edge should
extend around the curve as far as the dotted line so that it will be
practicable to slant the pen in either of the directions shown in figure
19 and it is obvious that its thickness must be equal around the arc
so that the same thickness of line will be drawn whether the pen be held
vertical or slanted in either direction
illustration fig 19
illustration fig 20
the outside faces of the pen should be slightly curved so that when
held vertically as in figure 20 the dotted line representing the
centre of the length of the instrument and against the square blade s
the point will meet the paper a short distance from the lower edge of s
as shown by this means it is not necessary to adjust the square edge
exactly coincident with the line but a little way from it this is an
advantage for two reasons first the trouble of setting the squareedge
exactly coincident is avoided and secondly the liability of the ink
to adhere to the edge of the squareblade and flow on to the paper and
make a thick ragged line is prevented
the square being set as near to the line as desired the handle may be
held at such an angle that the penpoint will just meet the line when
sloped either as in figure 21 or 22 if however the slope be too much
in the direction shown in figure 21 practice is necessary to enable the
drawing of straight lines if they be long ones because any variation in
the angle of the instrument to the paper obviously vitiates the
straightness of the line if on the other hand the square be too close
to the line and the pen therefore requires to be sloped as in figure
22 the ink flowing from the penpoint is apt to adhere to the
squareedge and the result will be a ragged thick line as shown in
figure 23

illustration fig 26
each of the legs should be of equal thickness at the penpoint edge so
that when closed together the point will be in the middle of the edge
the width and curve of each individual point should be quite equal and
the easiest method of attaining this end is as follows
take a small slip of arkansas oilstone and with the penpoints closed
firmly by the screw trim the penedges to the required curve as shown at
a figure 17 making the curve as even as possible then stone the faces
until this curve is brought up to a sharp edge at the point between the
two penlegs forming the point
next take a piece of 000 french emery paper lay it upon some flat body
like the blade of a square and smooth the curve of the edge enough to
take off the fine sharp edge left by the oilstone then apply the
outside flat faces of the pen to the emery paper again bringing the
penedge up sharp
the emery paper will simply have smoothed and polished the surfaces
still leaving them too sharp so sharp as to cut the paper and to take
off this sharp edge which must first be done on the inside faces open
the penpoints as wide as the screw will permit then wrap one thickness
of the emery paper upon a thin blade as upon a drawingtriangle and
pass the open penpoints over it and move the instrument endwise
taking care to keep the inside face level with the surface of the emery
paper so that the penpoints shall not cut through next close the
penpoints with the screw until they nearly but not quite touch and
sweep the edge of the penpoint along the emery paper under a slight
pressure so moving the handle that at each stroke the whole length
around the curved end of the pen will meet the emery surface during
this motion the inside faces of the penpoint must be held as nearly
vertical as possible so as to keep the two halves of the penpoint
equal
the pen is now ready for use and will draw a fine and clean line
it is not usual to employ emery paper for the purpose indicated but it
will be found very desirable since it leaves a smoother surface and
edge than the oilstone alone
circlepens are more difficult to put in order than the straightline
pen especially those for drawing the smallest circles which cannot be
well drawn unless the pen is of the precise right shape and in the best
condition
a circlepen is shown in figure 24 in which a represents the pointleg
and b the penleg the pointleg must be the longest because it requires
to enter the drawing paper before the pen meets the surface the point
should be sharp and round for any edges or angles on it will cause it
to widen the hole in the paper when it is rotated to shape the points
to prevent the enlargement of the centre in the paper is one of the most
important considerations in the use of this instrument especially when
several circles require to be drawn from the same centre to accomplish
this end the inside of the pointleg should be as near as possible
parallel to the length of the instrument which is denoted in figure 24
by the dotted line when the legs are closed as in the figure if the
point is at an angle as shown in figure 25 it is obvious that rotating
it will enlarge the top of the centre in the drawing paper the point
should be sharp and smooth on its circumferential surface and so much
longer than the penpoint that it will have sufficient hold in the paper
when the instrument stands vertical and the penpoint meets the surface
of it which amount is about 164th of an inch
we may now consider the shape of the penpoint its inside surfaces
should be flat across and to the curve shown in figure 24 not as shown
exaggerated in figure 25 because in the latter the body of the ink will
be too near the penpoint and but little can be placed in it without
causing it sometimes to flow over the edges and down the outside of the
pen
a form of penpoint recently introduced is shaped as in figure 26 the
object being to have a thin stream of ink near the marking penpoint and
the main body of the ink near at hand instead of extending up the pen
as would be the case with figure 24 the advantage thus gained is that
the ink lies in a more solid body and having less area of surface
exposed to the air will not dry so quickly in the pen but this is more
than offset by the liability of the ink to flow over the crook at a and
cause the pen to draw a thick ragged line the penpoint must be
slightly inclined toward the needlepoint to the end that they may
approach each other close enough for drawing very small circles but it
should also stand as nearly vertical as will permit that end to be
attained as this pen is for drawing small circles only it does not
require much ink and hence may be somewhat close together as in figure
24 this has the advantage that the point is not hidden from
observation
in forming the penpoint the greatest refinement is necessary to enable
the drawing of very small true circles say 116th of an inch or less
in diameter the requirements are that the penpoint shall meet the
surface of the paper when the needlepoint has entered it sufficiently
to give the necessary support and that the instrument shall stand
vertical as shown by the dotted line in figure 24 also that the pen
shall then touch the paper at a point only this point being the apex of
a fine curve that this curve be equal on each side of the point of
contact with the paper that both halves forming the pen be of equal
thickness and width at the pointed curve and that the point be as sharp
as possible without cutting the paper
the best method of attaining these ends is as follows on each side of
the pen make with an oilstone a flat place as c d figure 27 where
the penpoint is shown magnified thus bringing both halves to an edge
of exactly equal length and leaving the point flat at d these flat
places must be parallel to one another and to the joint between the two
halves of the pen as the oilstone may leave a slightly ragged edge it
is a good plan to take a piece of 00 french emery paper lay it on a
flat surface and holding the instrument vertically remove the fine edge
d until it will not cut then with the oilstone shape the curved edge
as in figure 28 taking care that the curve no more than brings the flat
place d up to a true curve and leaves the edge sharp with only the very
point touching the paper which is represented in the cut by the
horizontal line
illustration figures 27 28 29 30 31 32
the point must have a sharp edge all around the curve and the two
halves must be exactly equal in width for if one half is wider than the
other as in figure 29 at a or as in figure 30 at b it will be
impossible to draw a very small circle true so likewise the two
halves of the pen must be of exactly equal length and not one half
longer than the other as in figures 31 or 32 which would tend to cut
the paper and also render the drawing of true small circles
impracticable
when the pen is closed to draw a very small circle the two halves of the
penleg should have an equal degree of contact with the surface of the
paper and then as the legs are opened out to draw larger circles the
contact of the outside half of the pen will have less contact with the
paper the smaller the circle the more difficult it is to keep the
pointleg from slipping out of the centre and the more difficult it is
to draw a clear line and true circle hence the points should be shaped
to the best advantage for drawing these small circles by oilstoning
the pen as already described and then finishing it as follows
after the oilstoning open the two valves of the penleg wide enough to
admit a piece of 000 french emery paper wrapped once around a very thin
blade and move the pen endwise as described for the straightline pen
this will smooth the inner surfaces and remove any fine wireedge that
the oilstone may leave close the two halves of the pen again and
lightly emerypaper the outside faces which will leave the edge sharp
enough to cut the paper the removal of the sharp edge still left to
the exact degree requires great care it may best be done by closing
the pen until its two halves very nearly but not quite touch then
adjust it to mark a circle of about 316 inch diameter and strike a
number of circles in different locations upon the surface of a piece of
0000 french emery paper
in marking these circles however let the instrument stand out of the
perpendicular and do very little while standing vertically indeed it
is well to strike a number of halfcircles first from right to left and
then from left to right and finally draw a full circle sloping the pen
on one side gradually raising it vertically and finally sloping it to
the other side this will insure that the pen has contact at its extreme
point and leave that point fine and keen but not enough so to cut the
paper to test the pen draw small circles with the pen rotated first in
one direction and then in the other closing its points so as to mark a
fine line which if the pen is properly shaped will be clear and fine
while if improperly formed the circle drawn with the pen rotated in one
direction will not coincide with that drawn while rotating it in the
other the same circle may be drawn over several times to make a
thorough test if a drawing instrument will draw a fine line correctly
it will be found to answer for thick lines which are more easily made
in thus preparing the instruments the operator will find that if he
occasionally holds the points in the right position with regard to the
light he will be able to see plainly if the work is proceeding evenly
and equally for if onehalf of the pen is thicker at the point or edge
than the other it will show a brighter line this is especially the
case with instruments that have become dull by use for in that case the
edges will be found quite bright and any inequality of thickness shows
plainly
illustration fig 33
illustration fig 34
it follows from what has been said that the needlepoint and penpoint
should stand vertical when in use and to effect this the instruments
except in the smallest sizes are provided with joints such as shown at
a and b in the bowpencil or circlepencil in figure 33 these joints
should be sufficiently stiff that they will not move too easily and yet
will move rather than that the legs should sensibly spring without
moving at the joint the needlepoint leg should be adjusted by means of
the joint to stand vertical and the same remarks apply equally to the
penleg but in the case of the pencilleg it is the pencil itself and
not the leg that requires attention the joint b being so adjusted that
the pencil either stands vertical or what is perhaps preferable so
that it stands inclined slightly towards the needlepoint in
sharpening the pencil the inner face c may be made concave or at least
vertical and flat and the outer convex or else bevelled and flat
producing a fine and long edge rounded in its length of edge in using
the circlepencil and circlepen it will be found more convenient to
rotate it in the direction of the arrow in figure 34 it should be held
lightly to the paper and the learner will find that he has a natural
tendency to hold it too firmly and press it too heavily which is
especially to be avoided
if in drawing a small circle the needlepoint slips out of the paper it
is because the pencilpoint is too long or what is the same thing the
needlepoint does not protrude far enough out from the leg or if the
instrument requires to be leaned over too much to make the pencil or pen
mark it is because the pen or pencil is not far enough out and this
again may cause the needlepoint to slip out of the paper
illustration fig 35
illustration fig 36
in figure 35 is shown a german instrument especially designed to avoid
this slipping the peculiarity of this instrument consists in the
arrangement of the centre point which remains stationary whilst the pen
or pencil resting by its own weight on the paper is guided round by
gently turning without pressure the small knob at the upper end of the
tube by this means the misplacing or sliding of the centrepoint and
the cutting of the paper by the pen are avoided by means of this fixed
centrepoint any number of concentric circles may be drawn without
making a hole of very distinguishable size on the paper
illustration fig 37
in applying the ink to the bowpen as to all other instruments care
must be taken that the ink lies between the points only and not on the
outside for in the latter case the ink will flow down too freely and
make a broad ragged line perhaps getting on the edge of the square
blade or triangle and causing a blot of ink on the drawing
in using a straight line or lining pen with a t square it may be used as
in figure 36 being nearly vertical as shown and moved from left to
right as denoted by the arrow s representing the square blade but in
using it or a pencil with a straight edge or a triangle unsupported by
the square blade the latter should be steadied by letting the fingers
rest upon it while using the instrument the operation being shown in
figure 37 the position figure 36 is suitable for long lines and that
in figure 37 for small drawings where the pen requires close adjustment
to the lines

lines and curves
although the beginner will find that a study of geometry is not
essential to the production of such elementary examples of mechanical
drawing as are given in this book yet as more difficult examples are
essayed he will find such a study to be of great advantage and
assistance meantime the following explanation of simple geometrical
terms is all that is necessary to an understanding of the examples
given
the shortest distance between two points is termed the radius and in
the case of a circle means the distance from the centre to the
perimeter measured in a straight line
illustration fig 38
illustration fig 39
illustration fig 40
dotted lines thus  mean the direction and the points at which a
dimension is taken or marked dotted lines thus simply connect
the same parts or lines in different views of the object thus in
figure 38 are a side and an end view of a rivet and the dotted lines
show that the circles on the end view correspond to the circle of the
diameters of the head and of the stem and therefore represent their
diameters while showing that both are round a straight line is in
geometry termed a right line
a line at a right angle to another is said to be perpendicular to it
thus in figures 39 40 and 41 lines a are in each case perpendicular
to line b or line b is in each case perpendicular to line a
a point is a position or location supposed to have no size and in cases
where necessary is indicated by a dot
illustration fig 41
illustration fig 42
illustration fig 43
parallel lines are those equidistant one from the other throughout their
length as in figure 42 lines maybe parallel though not straight thus
in figure 43 the lines are parallel
illustration fig 44
illustration fig 45
illustration fig 46
a line is said to be produced when it is extended beyond its natural
limits thus in figure 44 lines a and b are produced in the point c
a line is bisected when the centre of its length is marked thus line a
in figure 45 is bisected at or in as it is termed e
the line bounding a circle is termed its circumference or periphery and
sometimes the perimeter
a part of this circumference is termed an arc of a circle or an arc
thus figure 46 represents an arc when this arc has breadth it is termed
a segment thus figures 47 and 48 are segments of a circle a straight
line cutting off an arc is termed the chord of the arc thus in figure
48 line a is the chord of the arc

a quadrant of a circle is one quarter of the same being bounded on two
of its sides by two radial lines as in figure 49
when the area of a circle that is enclosed within two radial lines is
either less or more than one quarter of the whole area of the circle the
figure is termed a sector thus in figure 50 a and b are both sectors
of a circle
a straight line touching the perimeter of a circle is said to be tangent
to that circle and the point at which it touches is that to which it is
tangent thus in figure 51 line a is tangent to the circle at point b
the half of a circle is termed a semicircle thus in figure 52 a b and
c are each a semicircle
illustration fig 52
illustration fig 53
the point from which a circle or arc of a circle is drawn is termed its
centre the line representing the centre of a cylinder is termed its
axis thus in figure 53 dot d represents the centre of the circle
and line b b the axial line of the cylinder
to draw a circle that shall pass through any three given points let a b
and c in figure 54 be the points through which the circumference of a
circle is to pass draw line d connecting a to c and line e connecting
b to c bisect d in f and e in g from f as a centre draw the semicircle
o and from g as a centre draw the semicircle p these two semicircles
meeting the two ends of the respective lines d e from b as a centre
draw arc h and from c the arc i bisecting p in j from a as a centre
draw arc k and from c the arc l bisecting the semicircle o in m draw
a line passing through m and f and a line passing through j and q and
where these two lines intersect as at q is the centre of a circle r
that will pass through all three of the points a b and c
illustration fig 54
illustration fig 55
to find the centre from which an arc of a circle has been struck let a
a in figure 55 be the arc whose centre is to be found from the extreme
ends of the arc bisect it in b from end a draw the arc c and from b
the arc d then from the end a draw arc g and from b the arc f draw
line h passing through the two points of intersections of arcs c d and
line i passing through the two points of intersection of f g and where
h and i meet as at j is the centre from which the arc was drawn
a degree of a circle is the 1360 part of its circumference the whole
circumference is supposed to be divided into 360 equal divisions which
are called the degrees of a circle but as onehalf of the circle is
simply a repetition of the other half it is not necessary for
mechanical purposes to deal with more than onehalf as is done in
figure 56 as the whole circle contains 360 degrees half of it will
contain onehalf of that number or 180 a quarter will contain 90 and
an eighth will contain 45 degrees in the protractors as the
instruments having the degrees of a circle marked on them are termed
made for sale the edges of the halfcircle are marked off into degrees
and halfdegrees but it is sufficient for the purpose of this
explanation to divide off one quarter by lines 10 degrees apart and the
other by lines 5 degrees apart the diameter of the circle obviously
makes no difference in the number of decrees contained in any portion of
it thus in the quarter from 0 to 90 there are 90 degrees as marked
but suppose the diameter of the circle were that of inner circle d
and onequarter of it would still contain 90 degrees
illustration fig 56
so likewise the degrees of one line to another are not always taken
from one point as from the point o but from any one line to another
thus the line marked 120 is 60 degrees from line 180 or line 90 is 60
degrees from line 150 similarly in the other quarter of the circle 60
degrees are marked this may be explained further by stating that the
point o or zero may be situated at the point from which the degrees of
angle are to be taken here it may be remarked that to save writing the
word degrees it is usual to place on the right and above the figures
a small  as is done in figure 56 the 60 meaning sixty degrees the
 of course standing for degrees
illustration fig 57
suppose then we are given two lines as a and b in figure 57 and
are required to find their angle one to the other then if we have a
protractor we may apply it to the lines and see how many degrees of
angle they contain this word contain means how many degrees of angle
there are between the lines which in the absence of a protractor we
may find by prolonging the lines until they meet in a point as at c
from this point as a centre we draw a circle d passing through both
lines a b all we now have to do is to find what part or how much
of the circumference of the circle is enclosed within the two lines in
the example we find it is the onetwelfth part hence the lines are 30
degrees apart for as the whole circle contains 360 then onetwelfth
must contain 30 because 36012  30
illustration fig 58
if we have three lines as lines a b and c in figure 58 we may find
their angles one to the other by projecting or prolonging the lines
until they meet as at points d e and f and use these points as the
centres wherefrom to mark circles as g h and i then from circle h
we may by dividing it obtain the angle of a to b or of b to a by
dividing circle i we may obtain the angle of a to c or of c to a and by
dividing circle g we may obtain the angle of b to c or of c to b
illustration fig 59
it may happen and indeed generally will do so that the first attempt
will not succeed because the distance between the lines measured or
the arc of the circle will not divide the circle without having the
last division either too long or too short in which case the circle may
be divided as follows the compasses set to its radius or half its
diameter will divide the circle into 6 equal divisions and each of
these divisions will contain 60 degrees of angle because 360 the
number of degrees in the whole circle 6 the number of divisions 
60 the number of degrees in each division we may therefore subdivide
as many of the divisions as are necessary for the two lines whose
degrees of angle are to be found thus in figure 59 are two lines c
d and it is required to find their angle one to the other the circle
is divided into six divisions marked respectively from 1 to 6 the
division being made from the intersection of line c with the circle as
both lines fall within less than a division we subdivide that division
as by arcs a b which divide it into three equal divisions of
which the lines occupy one division hence it is clear that they are at
an angle of 20 degrees because twenty is onethird of sixty when the
number of degrees of angle between two lines is less than 90 the lines
are said to form an acute angle one to the other but when they are at
more than 90 degrees of angle they are said to form an obtuse angle
thus in figure 60 a and c are at an acute angle while b and c are at
an obtuse angle f and g form an acute angle one to the other as also
do g and b while h and a are at an obtuse angle between i and j there
are 90 degrees of angle hence they form neither an acute nor an obtuse
angle but what is termed a rightangle or an angle of 90 degrees e
and b are at an obtuse angle thus it will be perceived that it is the
amount of inclination of one line to another that determines its angle
irrespective of the positions of the lines with respect to the circle

triangles
a rightangled triangle is one in which two of the sides are at a right
angle one to the other figure 61 represents a rightangled triangle a
and b forming a right angle the side opposite as c is called the
hypothenuse the other sides a and b are called respectively the base
and the perpendicular

an acuteangled triangle has all its angles acute as in figure 63
an obtuseangled triangle has one obtuse angle as a figure 62
when all the sides of a triangle are equal in length and the angles are
all equal as in figure 63 it is termed an equilateral triangle and
either of its sides may be called the base when two only of the sides
and two only of the angles are equal as in figure 64 it is termed an
isosceles triangle and the side that is unequal as a in the figure is
termed the base
illustration fig 65
illustration fig 66
when all the sides and angles are unequal as in figure 65 it is termed
a scalene triangle and either of its sides may be called the base
the angle opposite the base of a triangle is called the vertex

a figure that is bounded by four straight lines is termed a quadrangle
quadrilateral or tetragon when opposite sides of the figure are
parallel to each other it is termed a parallelogram no matter what the
angle of the adjoining lines in the figure may be when all the angles
are right angles as in figure 66 the figure is called a rectangle if
the sides of a rectangle are of equal length as in figure 67 the
figure is called a square if two of the parallel sides of a rectangle
are longer than the other two sides as in figure 66 it is called an
oblong if the length of the sides of a parallelogram are all equal and
the angles are not right angles as in figure 68 it is called a rhomb
rhombus or diamond if two of the parallel sides of a parallelogram are
longer than the other two and the angles are not right angles as in
figure 69 it is called a rhomboid if two of the parallel sides of a
quadrilateral are of unequal lengths and the angles of the other two
sides are not equal as in figure 70 it is termed a trapezoid

if none of the sides of a quadrangle are parallel as in figure 71 it

the construction of polygons
illustration fig 71a
illustration fig 72
the term polygon is applied to figures having flat sides equidistant
from a common centre from this centre a circle may be struck that will
touch all the corners of the sides of the polygon or the point of each
side that is central in the length of the side in drawing a polygon
one of these circles is used upon which to divide the figure into the
requisite number of divisions for the sides when the dimension of the
polygon across its corners is given the circle drawn to that dimension
circumscribes the polygon because the circle is without or outside of
the polygon and touches it at its corners only when the dimension
across the flats of the polygon is given or when the dimension given is
that of a circle that can be inscribed or marked within the polygon
touching its sides but not passing through them then the polygon
circumscribes or envelops the circle and the circle is inscribed or
marked within the polygon thus in figure 71 a the circle is
inscribed within the polygon while in figure 72 the polygon is
circumscribed by the circle the first is therefore a circumscribed and
the second an inscribed polygon a regular polygon is one the sides of
which are all of an equal length

a figure of 3 sides is called a trigon

           9                 enneagon or nonagon

illustration fig 74
the angles of regular polygons are designated by their degrees of angle
at the centre and at the circumference by the angle at the centre
is meant the angle of a side to a radial line thus in figure 73 is a
hexagon and at c is a radial line thus the angle of the side d to c is
60 degrees or if at the two ends of a side as a two radial lines be
drawn as b c then the angles of these two lines one to the other
will be the angle at the centre the angle at the circumference is the
angle of one side to its next neighbor thus the angle at the
circumference in a hexagon is 120 degrees as shown in the figure for
the sides e f it is obvious that as all the sides are of equal length
they are all at the same angle both to the centre and to one another in
figure 74 is a trigon the angles at its centre being 120 and the angle
at the circumference being 60 as marked

the ellipse
an ellipse is a figure bounded by a continuous curve whose nature will
be shown presently
the dimensions of an ellipse are taken at its extreme length and
narrowest width and they are designated in three ways as by the length
and breadth by the major and minor axis the major axis meaning the
length and the minor the breadth of the figure and the conjugate and
transverse diameters the transverse meaning the shortest and the
conjugate the longest diameter of the figure
in this book the terms major and minor axis will be used to designate
the dimensions
the minor and major axes are at a right angle one to the other and
their point of intersection is termed the axis of the ellipse
in an ellipse there are two points situated upon the line representing
the major axis and which are termed the foci when both are spoken of
and a focus when one only is referred to foci simply being the plural
of focus these foci are equidistant from the centre of the ellipse
which is formed as follows two pins are driven in on the major axis to
represent the foci a and b figure 75 and around these pins a loop of
fine twine is passed a pencil point c is then placed in the loop and
pulled outwards to take up the slack of the twine the pencil is held
vertical and moved around tracing an ellipse as shown
illustration fig 75
now it is obvious from this method of construction that there will be
at every point in the pencils path a length of twine from the final
point to each of the foci and a length from one foci to the other and
the length of twine in the loop remaining constant it is demonstrated
that if in a true ellipse we take any number of points in its curve and
for each point add together its distance to each focus and to this add
the distance apart of the foci the total sum obtained will be the same
for each point taken
illustration fig 76
illustration fig 77
in figures 76 and 77 are a series of ellipses marked with pins and a
piece of twine as already described the corresponding ellipses as a
in both figures were marked with the same loop the difference in the
two forms being due to the difference in distance apart of the foci
again the same loop was used for ellipses b in both figures as also
for c and d from these figures we perceive that
1st with a given width or distance apart of foci the larger the
dimensions are the nearer the form of the figure will approach to that
of a circle
2d the nearer the foci are together in an ellipse having any given
dimensions the nearer the form of the figure will approach that of a
circle
3d that the proportion of length to width in an ellipse is determined
by the distance apart of the foci
4th that the area enclosed within an ellipse of a given circumference
is greater in proportion as the distance apart of the foci is
diminished and
5th that an ellipse may be given any required proportion of width to
length by locating the foci at the requisite distance apart
the form of a true ellipse may be very nearly approached by means of the
arcs of circles if the centres from which those arcs are struck are
located in the most desirable positions for the form of ellipse to be
drawn
illustration fig 78
thus in figure 78 are three ellipses whose forms were pencilled in by
means of pins and a loop of twine as already described but which were
inked in by finding four arcs of circles of a radius that would most
closely approach the pencilled line a b are the foci of all three
ellipses a b and c the centre for the end curves of a are at c
and d and those for its side arcs are at e and f for b the end
centres are at g and h and the side centres at i and j for c
the end centres are at k l and the side centres at m and n
it will be noted that first all the centres for the end curves fall on
the line of the length or major axis while all those for the sides fall
on the line of width or the minor axis and second that as the
dimensions of the ellipses increase the centres for the arcs fall
nearer to the axis of the ellipse now in proportion as a greater number
of arcs of circles are employed to form the figure the nearer it will
approach the form of a true ellipse but in practice it is not usual to
employ more than eight while it is obvious that not less than four can
be used when four are used they will always fall somewhere on the lines
on the major and minor axis but if eight are used two will fall on the
line of the major axis two on the line of the minor axis and the
remaining four elsewhere
illustration fig 79
in figure 79 is a construction wherein four arcs are used draw the line
a b the major axis and at a right angle to it the line c d the
minor axis of the figure now find the difference between the length of
half the two axes as shown below the figure the length of line f
from g to i representing half the length of the figure as from
a to e and the length or radius from g to h equalling that
from e to d hence from h to i is the difference between half
the major and half the minor axis with the radius h i mark from
e as a centre the arcs j k and join j k by line l take half
the length of line l and from j as a centre mark a line on a to
the arc m now the radius of m from e will be the radius of all
the centres from which to draw the figure hence we may draw in the
circle m and draw line s cutting the circle then draw line o
passing through m and giving the centre p from p we draw the
line q cutting the intersection of the circle with line a and
giving the centre r from r we draw line s meeting the circle and
the line c d giving us the centre t from t we draw line u
passing through the centre m these four lines o q s u are
prolonged past the centres because they define what part of the curve
is to be drawn from each centre thus from centre m the curve from v
to w is drawn from centre t the curve from w to x is drawn
from centre r the curve from x to y is drawn and from centre p
the curve from y to v is drawn it is to be noted however that
after the point m is found the remaining lines may be drawn very
quickly because the line o from m to p may be drawn with the
triangle of 45 degrees resting on the square blade the triangle may be
turned over set to point p and line q drawn and by turning the
triangle again the line s may be drawn from point r finally the
triangle may be again turned over and line u drawn which renders the
drawing of the circle m unnecessary
to draw an elliptical figure whose proportion of width to breadth shall
remain the same whatever the length of the major axis may be take any
square figure and bisect it by the line a in figure 80 draw in each
half of the square the diagonals e f g h from p as a centre with the
radius p r draw the arc s e r with the same radius draw from o as a
centre the arc t d v with radius l c draw arc r c v and from k as a
centre draw arc s b t

a very near approach to the true form of a true ellipse may be drawn by
the construction given in figure 81 in which a a and b b are centre
lines passing through the major and minor axis of the ellipse of which
a is the axis or centre b c is the major axis and a e half the
minor axis draw the rectangle b f g c and then the diagonal line b
e at a right angle to b e draw line f h cutting b b at i with
radius a e and from a as a centre draw the dotted arc e j giving
the point j on line b b from centre k which is on the line b b and
central between b and j draw the semicircle b m j cutting a a at
l draw the radius of the semicircle b m j cutting it at m and
cutting f g at n with the radius m n mark on a a at and from a
as a centre the point o with radius h o and from centre h draw
the arc p o q with radius a l and from b and c as centres draw
arcs cutting p o q at the points p q draw the lines h p r and h
q s and also the lines p i t and q v w from h as a centre draw
that part of the ellipse lying between r and s with radius p r
from p as a centre draw that part of the ellipse lying between r and
t with radius q s and from q as a centre draw the ellipse from
s to w with radius i t and from i as a centre draw the ellipse
from t to b and with radius v w and from v as a centre draw the
ellipse from w to c and onehalf of the ellipse will be drawn it
will be seen that the whole construction has been performed to find the
centres h p q i and v and that while v and i may be
used to carry the curve around on the other side of the ellipse new
centres must be provided for h p and q these new centres
corresponding in position to h p q divesting the drawing of all
the lines except those determining its dimensions and the centres from
which the ellipse is struck we have in figure 82 the same ellipse drawn
half as large the centres v p q h correspond to the same
centres in figure 81 while v p q h are in corresponding
positions to draw in the other half of the ellipse the length of curve
drawn from each centre is denoted by the dotted lines radiating from
that centre thus from h the part from r to s is drawn from h
that part from r to s at the ends the respective centres v are
used for the parts from w to w and from t to t respectively

the most correct method of drawing an ellipse is by means of an
instrument termed a trammel which is shown in figure 83 it consists of
a cross frame in which are two grooves represented by the broad black
lines one of which is at a right angle to the other in these grooves
are closely fitted two sliding blocks carrying pivots e f which may be
fastened to the sliding blocks while leaving them free to slide in the
grooves at any adjusted distance apart these blocks carry an arm or rod
having a tracing point as pen or pencil at g when this arm is swept
around by the operator the blocks slide in the grooves and the
penpoint describes an ellipse whose proportion of width to length is
determined by the distance apart of the sliding blocks and whose
dimensions are determined by the distance of the penpoint from the
sliding block to set the instrument draw lines representing the major
and minor axes of the required ellipse and set off on these lines
equidistant from their intersection to mark the required length and
width of ellipse place the trammel so that the centre of its slots is
directly over the point or centre from which the axes are marked which
may be done by setting the centres of the slots true to the lines
passing through the axis and set the pivots as follows place the
pencilpoint g so that it coincides with one of the points as c and
place the pivot e so that it comes directly at the point of intersection
of the two slots and fasten it there then turn the arm so that the
pencilpoint g coincides with one of the points of the minor axis as d
the arm lying parallel to b d and place the pivot f over the centre of
the trammel and fasten it there and the setting is complete
illustration fig 84
to draw a parabola mechanically in figure 84 c d is the width and h j
the height of the curve bisect h d in k draw the diagonal line j k
and draw k e cutting k at a right angle to j k and produce it in e
with the radius h e and from j as a centre mark point f which will be
the focus of the curve at any convenient distance above j fasten a
straightedge a b setting it parallel to the base c d of the parabola
place a square s with its back against the straightedge setting the
edge o n coincident with the line j h place a pin in the focus f and
tie to it one end of a piece of twine place a tracingpoint at j pass
the twine around the tracingpoint bringing down along the squareblade
and fasten it at n with the tracingpoint kept against the edge of the
square and the twine kept taut slide the square along the
straightedge and the tracingpoint will mark the half j c of the
parabola turn the square over and repeat the operation to trace the
other half j d this method corresponds to the method of drawing an
ellipse by the twine and pins as already described
illustration fig 85
to draw a parabola by lines bisect the width a b in figure 85 and
divide each half into any convenient number of equal divisions and
through these points of division draw vertical lines as 1 2 3 etc
in each half divide the height a d at one end and b e at the other
into as many equal divisions as the half of a b is divided into from
the points of divisions 1 2 3 etc on lines a d and b e draw lines
pointing to c and where these lines intersect the corresponding
vertical lines are points through which the curve may be drawn thus on
the side a d of the curve the intersection of the two lines marked 1 is
a point in the curve the intersection of the two lines marked 2 is
another point in the curve and so on
to draw a heart cam
illustration fig 86
draw the line a b figure 86 equal to the length of stroke required
divide it into any number of equal parts and from c as a centre draw
circles through the points of division draw the outer circle and divide
its circumference into twice as many equal divisions as the line a b was
divided into draw radial lines from each point of division on the
circle and the points of intersection of the radial lines with the
circles are points for the outline of the cam and through these points
a curved line may be drawn giving the shape of the cam it is obvious
that the greater the number of divisions on a b the more points and the
more perfect the curve may be drawn

shadow lines and line shading
section lining or crosshatching
when the interior of a piece is to be shown as a piece cut in half or
when a piece is broken away as is done to make more of the parts show
or show more clearly the surface so broken away or cut off is
sectionlined or crosshatched that is to say diagonal lines are drawn
across it and to distinguish one piece from another these lines are
drawn at varying angles and of varying widths apart in figure 87 is
given a view of three cylindrical pieces it may be known to be a
sectional view by the crosshatching or section lines it would be a
difficult matter to represent the three pieces put together without
showing them in section because in an outline view the collars and
recesses would not appear each piece could of course be drawn
separately but this would not show how they were placed when put
together they could be shown in one view if they were shaded by lines
and a piece shown broken out where the collars and recesses are but
line shading is too tedious for detail drawings beside involving too
much labor in their production
illustration fig 87
figure 88 represents a case in which there are three cylindrical pieces
one within the other the two inner ones being fastened together by a
screw which is shown dotted in in the end view and whose position along
the pieces is shown in the side view the edges of the fracture in the
outer piece are in this case crosshatched to show the line of
fracture
illustration fig 88
illustration fig 89
in crosshatching it is better that the diagonal lines do not quite meet
the edges of the piece than that they should in the least overrun as
is shown in figure 89 where in the top half the diagonals slightly
overrun while in the lower half they do not quite meet the outlines of
the piece
in figure 90 are shown in section a number of pieces one within the
other the central bore being filled with short plugs all the
crosshatching was done with the triangle of 60 degrees and that of 90
degrees it is here shown that with these two triangles only and a
judicious arrangement of the diagonals an almost infinite number of
pieces may be shown in cross section without any liability of mistaking
one for the other or any doubt as to the form and arrangement of the
pieces for beside the difference in spacing in the crosshatching
there are no two adjoining pieces with the diagonals running in the same
direction it will be seen that the narrow pieces are most clearly
defined by a close spacing of the crosshatching
illustration fig 90
in figure 91 are shown three pieces put together and having slots or
keyways through them the outer shell is shown to be in one piece from
end to end because the crosshatching is not only equally spaced but
the diagonals are in the same direction hence it would be known that d
f h and e were slots or recesses through the piece the same remarks
apply to piece b wherein g j k are recesses or slots piece c is
shown to have in its bore a recess at l in the case of b as of a
there would be no question as to the piece being all one from end to
end notwithstanding that the two ends are completely severed where the
slots g i come because the spacing and direction of the
crosshatching are equal on each side of the slots which they would not
be if they were separate pieces
illustration fig 91
illustration fig 92
section shading or crosshatching may sometimes cause the lines of the
drawing to appear crooked to the eye thus in figure 92 the key edge
on the right appears curved inwards while on the left the key edge
appears curved outwards although such is not actually the case the
same effect is produced in figure 93 on the righthand edge of the key
but not on the lefthand edge
illustration fig 93
illustration fig 94
a remarkable instance of this kind is shown in figure 94 when the
vertical lines appear to the eye to be at a considerable angle one to
the other although they are parallel
the lines in sectional shading or crosshatching may be made to denote
the material of which the piece is to be composed thus professor unwin
has proposed the system shown in the figures 95 and 96 this may be of
service in some cases but it would involve very much more labor than it
is worth in ordinary machine shop drawings except in the case of cast
iron and wood these two being shown in the simplest and the usual
manner it is much better to write the name of the material beneath the
piece in a detail drawing
illustration fig 95
illustration fig 96
line shading
mechanical drawings are made to look better and to show more distinctly
by being line shaded or shaded by lines the simplest form of line
shading is by the use of the shade or shadow line
in a mechanical drawing the light is supposed for the purposes of line
shading or of coloring to come in from the upper lefthand corner of
the drawing paper hence it falls directly upon the upper and lefthand
lines of each piece which are therefore represented by fine lines
while the right hand and lower edges of the piece being on the shadow
side may therefore with propriety be represented by broader lines
which are called shadow or shade lines these lines will often serve to
indicate the shape of some part of the piece represented as will be
seen from the following examples in figure 97 is a piece that contains
a hole the fact being shown by the circle being thickened at a if the
circle were thickened on the other side as at b in figure 98 it would
show that it represented a cylindrical stem instead of a hole
illustration fig 97
illustration fig 98
illustration fig 99
in figure 99 is represented a washer the surfaces that are in the
shadow side being shown in a shade line or shadow line as it is often
called
in figure 100 is a key drawn with a shade line while in figure 101 the
shade line is shown applied to a nut the shade line may be produced in
straight lines by drawing the line twice over and slightly inclining
the pen or by opening the pen points a little for circles however it
may be produced either by slightly moving the centre from which the
circle is drawn or by going over the shade part twice and slightly
pressing the instrument as it moves so as to gradually spring the legs
farther apart the latter plan being generally preferable
illustration fig 100
illustration fig 101
illustration fig 102
figure 102 shows a german pen that can be regulated to draw lines of
various breadths the head of the adjusting screw is made rather larger
than usual and is divided at the under side into twenty divisional
notches each alternate notch being marked by a figure on the face by
this arrangement a uniform thickness of line may be maintained after
filling or clearing the pen and any desired thickness may be repeated
without any loss of time in trial of thickness on the paper a small
spring automatically holds the divided screwhead in any place with
very little practice the click of the spring in the notches becomes a
sufficient guide for adjustment without reference to the figures on the
screwhead another meritorious feature of this pen is that it is armed
with sapphire points which retain their sharpness very long and thus
save the time and labor required to keep ordinary instruments in order
for the performance of fine work
an example of line shading in perspective drawing is shown in the
drawing of a pipe threading stock and die in figure 103
illustration fig 103
shading by means of lines may be used with excellent effect in
mechanical drawing not only to distinguish round from flat surfaces
but also to denote to the eye the relative distances of surfaces figure
104 represents a cylindrical pin line shaded as the light is supposed
to come in from the upper lefthand corner it will evidently fall more
upon the lefthand half of the stem and of the collar or bead hence
those parts are shaded with lighter or finer lines than the righthand
sides are
illustration fig 104
illustration fig 105
two cylindrical pieces that join each other may be line shaded at
whatever angle they may join figure 105 represents two such pieces one
at a right angle to the other both being of equal diameter
illustration fig 106
figure 106 represents a drawing of a lathe centre shaded by lines the
lines on the taper parts meeting those on the parallel part a and
becoming more nearly parallel to the axis of the piece as the centre of
the piece is approached the same is the case where a piece having a
curved outline is drawn which is shown in figure 107 where the set of
the bowpen is gradually increased for drawing the shade lines of the
curves the centres of the shade curves fall in each case upon a line at
a right angle to the axis of the piece as upon the lines a b c the
dotted lines showing the radius for each curve
illustration fig 107
the lines are made finer by closing the pen points by means of the screw
provided for that purpose the pen requires for this purpose to be
cleaned of the ink that is apt to dry in it
in figure 108 line shading is shown applied to a ball or sphere while
in figure 109 it is shown applied to a pin in a socket which is shown in
section by showing the hollow in connection with the round piece the
difference between the two is quite clearly seen the light falling
most upon the upper half of the pin and the lower half of the hole this
perhaps is more clearly shown in the piece of tube in figure 110 where
the thickness of the tube showing is a great aid to the eye so
likewise the hollow or hole is more clearly seen where the piece is
shown in section as in figure 111 which is the case even though the
piece be taper as in the figure if the body be bellmouthed as in
figure 112 the hollow curve is readily shown by the shading but to
line shade a hollow curve without any of these aids to the eye as say
to show a half of a tin tube is a very difficult matter if the piece
is to look natural and all that can be done is to shade the top darkly
and let the light fall mostly at and near the bottom an example of line
shading to denote the relative distances from the eye of various
surfaces is given in figure 113 where the surfaces most distant are the
most shaded the flat surfaces are lined with lines of equal breadth
the degrees of shading being governed by the width apart of the lines

line shading is often used to denote that the piece represented is to be
of wood the shade lines being in some cases regular in combination with
regular ones or entirely irregular as in figure 114
illustration fig 114
chapter v
marking dimensions
the dimensions of mechanical drawings are best marked in red ink so that
they will show plainly and that the lines denoting the points at which
the dimension is given shall not be confounded with the lines of the
drawing
the dimension figures should be as large as the drawing will
conveniently admit and should be marked at every point at which a
shoulder or change of form or dimension occurs except in the case of
straight tapers which have their dimensions marked at each end of the
taper
in the case of a single piece standing by itself the dimension figures
may be marked all standing one way so as to be read without changing
the position of the operator or requiring to turn the drawing around
this is done in figure 115 which represents the drawing of a key the
figures are here placed outside the drawing in all cases where it can be
done which in the case of a small drawing leaves the same clearer
illustration fig 115
in figure 116 the dimensions are marked running parallel to the
dimension for which they are given so that all measures of length stand
lengthwise and those of breadth across the drawing
illustration fig 116
figure 117 represents a key with a sharpcornered step in it here the
two dimensions forming the steps cannot both be coincident with it
hence they are marked as near to it as convenient it being understood
that they apply to the step and not to one side of it when the step
has a round instead of a sharp corner the radius of the arc of the
corner may be marked as shown in figure 118
illustration fig 117
figure 119 represents a key drawn in perspective so that all the
dimensions may be marked on one view perspective sketches may be used
for single pieces as they denote the shape of the piece more clearly to
the eye on account of the skill required in their production they are
not however used in mechanical drawing except as in the case of
patentoffice or similar drawings where the form and construction
rather than the dimension is the information sought to be conveyed
illustration fig 118
illustration fig 119
chapter vi
the arrangement of different views
the different views of a mechanical drawing
the word elevation as applied to mechanical drawing means simply a
view hence a side elevation is a side view or an end elevation is an
end view
the word plan is employed in place of the word top hence a plan view
is a top view or a view looking down upon the top of the piece
a general view means a view showing the machine put together or
assembled while a detail drawing is one containing a detail as a part
of the machine or a single piece disconnected from the other parts of
the whole machine
it is obviously desirable in a mechanical drawing to present the piece
of work in as few views as possible but in all cases there must be a
sufficient number to permit of the dimensions in every necessary
direction to be marked on the drawing suppose then that in figure 120
we have to represent a solid cylinder whose length equals its diameter
and it is obvious that both the diameter and length may be marked in the
one view given hence a second view such as shown by the circle in
figure 121 is unnecessary except it be to distinguish the body from a
cube in which the one view would also be sufficient whereon to mark
all the dimensions necessary to enable the piece to be made it happens
however that a cube and a cylinder are the only two figures upon which
all the dimensions can be marked on one view of the piece and as
cylindrical pieces are much more common in machine work than cubes are
it is taken for granted that where the pieces are cylindrical but one
view shall be used and that where they are cubes either two views shall
be given or where they are square a cross shall be marked upon the
parts that are square thus in figure 122 is shown a cross formed by
the lines a b across the face of the drawing which saves making a
second view
illustration fig 120
illustration fig 121
illustration fig 122
illustration fig 123
it would appear that under some conditions this might lead to error as
for example take the piece in figure 123 and there is nothing to
denote which is the length and which is the diameter of the piece but
there is a certain amount of custom in such cases than will usually
determine this point thus the piece will be given a name as pin or
disk the one denoting that its diameter is less than its length and
the other that its diameter is greater than its length in the absence
of any such name it would be in practice assumed that it was a pin and
not a disk because if it were a disk it would either be named or
shaded or a second view given to show its unusual form the disk being
a more unusual form than the pinform in mechanical structures as an
example of the use of the cross to denote a square we have figure 124
which represents a piece having a hexagon head section a a that
is rectangular a collar b a square part c and a round stem d
here it will be noted that it is the rectangular part a a that
renders necessary two views and that in the absence of the cross yet
another view would be necessary to show that part c is square
illustration fig 124
illustration fig 125
a rectangular piece always requires two views and sometimes three in
figure 125 for example is a piece that would require a side view to
show the length and breadth and an edge view to show the thickness
suppose the piece to be wedgeshaped in any direction then another view
will be necessary as is shown in figs 126 and 127 in the former the
wedge or taper is in the direction of its length while in the latter it
is in the direction of its thickness outline views however will not
in some cases show the form of the figure however many views be
presented an example of this is given in figure 128 which represents a
ring having a hexagon cross section a sectional edge view is here
necessary in order to show the hexagonal form another example of this
kind which occurs more frequently in practice is a cupped ring such as
shown in figure 129

examples
let it be required to draw a rectangular piece such as is shown in two
views in figure 130 and the process for the pencil lines is as follows
illustration fig 130
with the bowpencil set to half the required length and breadth of the
square the arcs 1 2 3 and 4 in figure 131 are marked and then the
lines 5 and 6 letting them run past the width of the arcs 3 and 4
there is no need to pencil in lines 7 and 8 since they can be inked in
without pencilling because it is known that they must meet the arcs 3
and 4 and terminate at the lines 5 and 6 the top and bottom lines of
the edge view are merely prolongations of lines 5 and 6 hence the lines
9 and 10 are drawn the requisite distance apart for the thickness and to
meet the top and bottom lines the lines are then inked in the pencil
lines rubbed out and the drawing will appear as in figure 130
illustration fig 131
illustration fig 132
suppose however that the piece has a step in it as in figure 132 and
the pencilling will be as in figure 133 from the centre the arcs 1 2
3 and 4 for the outer and arcs 5 6 7 and 8 for the inner square are
marked lines 9 and 10 and their prolongations 11 and 12 for the
edge view are then pencilled lines 13 and 14 and their prolongations
15 and 16 are then pencilled and dots to show the locations for lines
21 and 22 maybe marked and the pencilling is complete lines 17 18 19
20 21 22 and 23 may then be inked in in the order named and then
lines 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 when the inking in will be
complete
illustration fig 133
in inking in horizontal lines begin at the top and mark in each line as
the square comes to it and in inking the vertical ones begin always at
the left hand line and mark the lines as they are come to moving the
square or the triangle to the right and great care should be taken not
to let the lines cross where they meet as at the corners since this
would greatly impair the appearance of the drawing
these figures have been drawn without the aid of a centre line because
from their shapes it was easy to dispense with it but in most cases a
centre line is necessary thus in figure 134 we have a body having a
number of steps the diameters of these steps are marked by arcs as in
the previous examples and their lengths may be marked by applying the
measuring rule direct to the drawing paper and making the necessary
pencil mark
but it would be tedious to mark the successive steps true one with the
other by measuring each step because one step would require to be
pencilled in before the next could be marked to avoid this the centre
line 1 figure 134 is first marked and the arcs for the steps are then
marked as shown centre lines are also necessary to show the alignment
of one part to another thus in figure 135 is a cube with a hole passing
through it the dotted lines in the side view show that the hole passes
clear through the piece and is a parallel one while the centre line
being central to the outline throughout the piece shows that the hole
is equidistant all through from the walls of the piece
illustration fig 134
illustration fig 135
the pencil lines for this piece would be marked as in figure 136 line 1
representing the centre line from which all the arcs are marked it will
be noted that the length of the piece is marked by arcs which occur
because being a cube the set of the compasses for arcs 2 3 4 and 5
will answer without altering to mark arcs 6 and 7
illustration fig 136
if the hole in the piece were a taper or conical one it would be
denoted by the dotted lines as in figure 137 and that the taper is
central to the body is shown by these dotted lines being equidistant
from the centre line
illustration fig 137
suppose one of the sides to be tapered as is the side a in figure 138
and that the hole is not central and both facts will be shown by the
centre lines 1 and 2 in the figure the measurement of face a would be
marked from a to line b at each end but the distance the hole was out
of the centre would be marked by the distance between the centre line 2
and the edge c of the piece
illustration fig 138
if the hole did not pass entirely through the piece the dotted lines
would show it as in figure 139
illustration fig 139
illustration fig 140
the designations of the views of a piece of work depend upon the
position in which the piece stands when in place upon the machine of
which it forms a part thus in figure 140 is a lever and if its shaft
stood horizontal when the piece is in place in the machine the view
given is an end one but suppose that the shaft stood vertical and the
same view becomes a plan or top view
illustration fig 141
illustration fig 142
in figure 142 is a view of a lever which is a side view if the lever
stands horizontal and lever b hangs down or a plan view if the shaft
stands horizontal but lever b stands also horizontal we may take the
same drawing and turn it around on the paper as in figure 143 and it
becomes a side view if the shaft stands vertical and a plan view if the
shaft stands horizontal and arm d vertical above it
in a side or an end view the piece that projects highest in the drawing
is highest when upon the machine also in a side elevation the piece
that is at the highest point in the drawing extends farthest upward when
the piece is on the machine but in a plan or top view the height of
vertical pieces is not shown as appears in the case of arm d in figure
143
illustration fig 143
in either of the levers figures 142 or 143 all the dimensions could be
marked if an additional view were given but this will not be the case
if an eye have a slot in it as at e in figure 144 or a jaw have a
tongue in it as at f hence end views of the eye and the jaw must be
given which may be most conveniently done by showing them projected
from the ends of those parts as in the figure
this naturally brings us to a consideration as to the best method of
projecting one view from another as a general rule the side elevation
or side view is the most important because it shows more of the parts
and details of the work hence it should be drawn first because it
affords more assistance in drawing the other views
illustration fig 144
there are two systems of placing the different views of a piece in the
first the views are presented as the piece would present itself if it
were laid upon the paper for the side view and then turned or rolled
upon the paper for the other views as shown in figure 145 in which the
piece consists of five sections or members marked respectively a b c
d and e now if the piece were turned or rolled so that the end face of
b were uppermost and the member e was beneath it will by the
operation of turning it have assumed the position in the lower view
marked position 2 while if it were turned over upon the paper in the
opposite direction it would assume the position marked 3 this gives to
the mind a clear idea of the various views and positions but it
possesses some disadvantages thus if position 1 is a side elevation or
view of the piece as it stands when in place of the machine then e is
naturally the bottom member but it is shown in the top view of the
drawing hence what is actually the bottom view of the piece position
3 becomes the top view in the drawing a second disadvantage is that if
we desire to put in dotted lines to show how one view is derived from
the other and denote corresponding parts then these dotted lines must
be drawn across the face of the drawing making it less distinct thus
the dotted lines connecting stem e in position 1 to e in position 3
pass across the faces of both a and b of position 1
illustration fig 145
illustration fig 146
in a large drawing or one composed of many members or parts it would
therefore be out of the question to mark in the dotted lines a
further disadvantage in a large drawing is that it is necessary to go
from one side of the drawing to the other to see the construction of the
same part
illustration fig 147
to obviate these difficulties a modern method is to suppose the piece
instead of rolling upon the paper to be lifted from it turned around
to present the required view and then moved upwards on the paper for a
top view sideways for a side view and below for a bottom view thus
the three views of the piece in figure 145 would be as in figure 146
where position 2 is obtained by supposing the piece to be lifted from
position 1 the bottom face turned uppermost and the piece moved down
the paper to position 2 which is a bottom view of the piece and the
bottom view in the drawing similarly if the piece be lifted from
position 1 and the top face in that figure is turned uppermost and the
piece is then slid upwards on the paper view 3 is obtained being a top
view of the piece as it lies in position 1 and the top view in the
drawing now suppose we require to find the shape of member b then in
figure 145 we require to look at the top of position 1 and then down

but in figure 146 we have the side view and end view both together
while the dotted lines do not require to cross the face of the side
view now suppose we take a similar piece and suppose its end faces
as f g to have holes in them which require to be shown in both views
and under the one system the drawing would if the dotted lines were
drawn across appear as in figure 147 whereas under the other system
the drawing would appear as in figure 148 and it follows that in cases
where it is necessary to draw dotted lines from one view to the other
it is best to adopt the new system

let it be required to draw a machine screw and it is not necessary and
therefore not usual in small screws to draw the full outline of the
thread but to represent it by thick and thin lines running diagonally
across the bolt as in figure 149 the thick ones representing the
bottom and the thin ones the top of the thread the pencil lines would
be drawn in the order shown in figure 150 line 1 is the centre line
and line 2 a line to represent the lower side of the head from the
intersection of these two lines as a centre as at a short arcs 3 and
6 showing the diameter of the thread are marked and the arcs 5 and 6
representing the depth of the thread are marked the arc 7
representing the head is then marked the vertical lines 8 9 10 and
11 are then marked and the outline of the screw is complete the thick
lines representing the bottom of the thread are next marked in as in
figure 151 extending from line 9 to line 10 midway between these lines
fine ones are made for the tops of the thread all the lines being
pencilled in they may be inked in with the drawing instruments taking
care that they do not overrun one another when the pencil lines are
rubbed out the sketch will appear as in figure 149
illustration fig 152
for a bolt with a hexagon head the lines would be drawn in the order
shown in figure 152 at a rightangle to centre line 1 line two is
drawn the pencilcompasses are then set to half the diameter of the
bolt and from point a arcs 3 and 6 are pencilled thus showing the
width of the front flat of the head as well as the diameter of the
stem from the point where these arcs meet line 2 and with the same
radius arcs 5 and 6 are marked showing the widths of the other two
flats of the head the thickness of the head and the length of the bolt
head may then be marked either by placing a rule on line 1 and marking
the short lines such as line 7 a cross line 1 or the pencilcompasses
may be set to the rule and the lengths marked from point a in the
united states standard for bolt heads and nuts the thickness of the head
is made equal to the diameter of the bolt with the compasses set for
the arcs 3 and 4 we may in two steps from a along the centre line
mark off the thickness of the head without using the rule but as the
rule has to be applied along line 1 to mark line 7 for the length of the
bolt it is just as easy to mark the head thickness at the same time
the line 8 showing the length of the thread may be marked at the same
time as the other lengths are marked and the outlines 9 10 11 12 13
may be drawn in the order named we have now to mark the arcs at the top
of the flats of the head to show the chamfer and to explain how these
arcs are obtained we have in figure 153 an enlarged view of the head it
is evident that the smallest diameter of the chamfer is represented by
the circle a and therefore the length of the line b must equal a it is
also evident that the outer edge of the chamfer will meet the corners at
an equal depth from the face of the nut as represented by the line c
c and it is obvious that the curves that represent the outline of the
chamfer on each side of the head or nut will approach the face of the
head or nut at an equal distance as denoted by the line d d it follows
that the curve must in each case be such as will at each of its ends
meet the line c and at its centre meet the line d d the centres of the
respective curves being marked in the figure by x
illustration fig 153
it is sufficiently accurate therefore for all practical purposes to
set the pencil on the centreline at the point a in figure 152 and mark
the curve 14 and to then set the compasses by trial to mark the other
two curves of the chamfer so that they shall be an equal distance with
arc 14 from line 9 and join lines 10 and 13 at the same distance from
line 9 that 14 joins lines 3 and 4 so that as in figure 153 all three
of the arcs would touch a line as c and another line as d

 diameter at the root of the thread
the basis of the franklin institute or united states standard for the
heads of bolts and for nuts is as follows
the short diameter or width across the flats is equal to one and
onehalf times the diameter plus 18 inch for rough or unfinished bolts
and nuts and one and onehalf times the bolt diameter plus 116 inch
for finished heads and nuts the thickness is for rough heads and nuts
equal to the diameter of the bolt and for finished heads and nuts 116
inch less
illustration fig 155
illustration fig 156
the hexagonal or hexagon as they are termed in the shop heads of bolts
may be presented in two ways as is shown in figures 155 and 156
the latter is preferable inasmuch as it shows the width across the
flats which is the dimension that is worked to because it is where the
wrench fits and therefore of most importance whereas the latter gives
the length of a flat which is not worked to except incidentally as it
were there is the objection to the view of the head given in figure
156 however that unless it is accompanied by an end view it somewhat
resembles a similar view of a square head for a bolt it may be
distinguished therefrom however in the following points
if the amount of chamfer is such as to leave the chamfer circle as
circle a in figure 153 of smaller diameter than the width across the
flats of the bolthead the outline of the sides of the head will pass
above the arcs at the top of the flats and there will be two small flat
places as a and b in figure 156 representing the angle of the
chamfer which will not meet the arcs at the top of the flats but will
join the sides above those arcs as in the figure which is also the
case in a similar view of a squareheaded bolt it may be distinguished
therefrom however in the following points
if the amount of chamfer is such as to leave the chamfer circle a
figure 153 of smaller diameter than the width across the flats of the
bolthead the outline of the sides will pass above the arc on the
flats as is shown in figure 157 in which the chamfer a meets the side
of the head at b and does not therefore meet the arc c the length of
side lying between b and d in the side view corresponds with the part
lying between e and f in the end view
illustration fig 157
if we compare this head with similar views of a square head g both
being of equal widths and having their chamfer circles at an equal
distance from the sides of the flats and at the same angle we perceive
at once that the amount of chamfer necessary to give the same distance
between the chamfer circle and the side of the bolt that is the
distance from j to k being equal to that from l to m the length of
the chamfer n for the square head so greatly exceeds the length a for
the hexagon head that the eye detects the difference at once and is
instinctively informed that g must be square independently of the fact
that in the case of the square head n meets the arc o while in the
hexagon head a which corresponds to n does not meet the arc c which
corresponds to o
when however the chamfer is drawn but just sufficient to meet the
flats as in the case of the hexagon h and the square i in figure 157
the chamfer line passes from the chamfer circle to the side of the head
and the distinction is greater as will be seen by comparing head h with
head i both being of equal width having the same angle of chamfer and
an amount just sufficient to meet the sides of the flats here it will
be seen that in the hexagon h each side of the head as p meets the
chamfer circle a whereas in the square head these two lines are joined
by the chamfer line q the figures being quite dissimilar
illustration fig 158
it is obvious that whatever the degree or angle of the chamfer may be
the diameter of the chamfer circle will be the same in any view in
which the head may be presented thus in figure 158 the line g in the
side view is in length equal to the diameter of circle g in the end
view and so long as the angle of the chamfer is fortyfive degrees as
in all the views hitherto given the width of the chamfer will be equal
at corresponding points in the different views thus in the figure the
widths a and b in the two views are equal
illustration fig 159
if the other view showing a corner of the head in front of the head be
given the same fact holds good as is shown in figure 159 that the two
outside flats should appear in the drawing to be half the width of the
middle flat is also shown in figure 158 where d and e are each half the
width of c let us now suppose that the chamfer be given some other
angle than that of 45 degrees and we shall find that the effect is to
alter the curves of the chamfer arcs on the flats as is shown in figure
160 where these arcs e c d are shown less curved because the chamfer
b has more angle to the flats as a result the width or distance
between the arcs and line g is different in the two views on this
account it is better to draw the chamfer at 45 degrees as correct
results may be obtained with the least trouble
if no chamfer at all is to be given a hexagon head may still be
distinguished from a square one providing that the view giving three
sides of the head as in figure 158 is shown because the two sides d
and e being half the width of the middle one c imparts the information
that it is a hexagon head if however the view showing but two of the
sides and a corner in front is given and no chamfer is used it could
not be known whether the head was to be hexagon or square unless an end
view be given as in figure 161
illustration fig 160
if the view showing a full side of the head of a squareheaded bolt is
given then either an end view must be given as in figure 162 or else
a single view with a cross on its head as in figure 163 may be given
it is the better plan both in square and hexagon heads to give the
view in which the full face of a flat is presented that is as in
figures 155 and 163 because in the case of the square the length of a
side and the width across the head are both given in that view whereas
if two sides are shown as in figure 161 the width across flats is not
given and this is the dimension that is wanted to work to and not the
width across corners in the case of a hexagon the middle of the three
flats is equal in width to the diameter of the bolt and the other two
are onehalf its width all three therefore being marked with the same
set of compasses as gives the diameter of the body of the bolt were as
shown in figure 152 for the width across flats there is an accepted
standard hence there is no need to mark it upon the drawing unless in
cases where the standard is to be departed from in which event an end
view may be added or the view showing two sides may be given

to draw a squareheaded bolt the pencil lines are marked in the order
shown by figures in figure 164 the inking in is done in the order of
the letters a b c etc it will be observed that pencil lines 2
9 and 10 are not drawn to cross but only to meet the lines at their
ends a point that as before stated should always be carefully
attended to
illustration fig 165
to draw the end view of a hexagon head first draw a circle of the
diameter across the flats and then rest the triangle of 60 degrees on
the blade s of the square as at t 1 in figure 165 and mark the
lines a and b reverse the triangle as at t 2 and draw lines c
and d then place the triangle as in figure 166 and draw the lines
e and f
illustration fig 166
if the other view of the head is to be drawn then first draw the lines
a and b in figure 167 with the square then with the 60 degree
triangle placed on the square s as at t 1 draw the lines c d
and turning the square over as at t 2 mark lines e and f
illustration fig 167
if the diameter across corners of a square head is given and it be
required to draw the head the process is as follows for a view showing
one corner in front as in figure 168 a circle of the given diameter
across corners is pencilled and the horizontal centreline a is
marked and the triangle of 45 degrees is rested against the square
blade s as in position t 1 and lines b and c marked b being
marked first and the triangle is then slid along the square blade to
position t 1 when line c is marked these two lines just meeting the
horizontal line a where it meets the circle the triangle is then
moved to the left and line d joining the ends of b and c is
marked and by moving it still farther to the left to position t 2 line
e is marked lines b c d and e are of course the only
ones inked in
illustration fig 168
illustration fig 169
if the flats are to lie in the other direction the pencilling will be
done as in figure 169 the circle is marked as before and with the
triangle placed as shown at t 1 line a passing through the centre of
the circle is drawn by moving the triangle to the right its edge b
will be brought into position to mark line b also passing through
the centre of the circle all that remains is to join the ends of these
two lines using the square blade for lines c d and the triangle
for e and f its position on the square blade being denoted at t 3
lines c d e f are the ones inked in
illustration fig 170
for a hexagon head we have the processes figures 170 and 171 the
circle is struck and across it line a figure 170 passing through
its centre the triangle of sixty degrees will mark the sides b c
and d e as shown and the square blade is used for f g
illustration fig 171
the chamfer circles are left out of these figures to reduce the number
of lines and so keep the engraving clear figure 171 shows the method of
drawing a hexagon head when the diameter across corners is given the
lines being drawn in the alphabetical order marked and the triangle
used as will now be understood
illustration fig 172
illustration fig 173
it may now be pointed out that the triangle may be used to divide
circles much more quickly than they could be divided by stepping around
them with compasses suppose for example that we require to divide a
circle into eight equal parts and we may do so as in figure 172 line
a being marked from the square and lines b c and d from the
triangle of fortyfive degrees the lines to be inked in to form an
octagon need not be pencilled as their location is clearly defined
being lines joining the ends of the lines crossing the circle as for
example lines e f
let it be required to draw a polygon having twelve equal sides and the
triangle of sixty is used marking all the lines within the circle in
figure 173 except a for which the square blade is used the only
lines to be inked in are such as b c in this example there is a
corner at the top and bottom but suppose it were required that a flat
should fall there instead of a corner then all we have to do is to set
the square blade s at the required angle as in figure 174 and then
proceed as before bearing in mind that the point of the circle nearest
to the square blade straightedge or whatever the triangle is rested
on is always a corner of a polygon having twelve sides
illustration fig 174
illustration fig 175
in both of these examples we have assumed that the diameter across
corners of the polygon was given but suppose the diameter across the
flats were given and the construction is a little more complicated
circle a a in figure 175 is drawn of the required diameter across
the flats and the lines of division are drawn across with the triangle
of 60 as before the triangle of 45 is then used to draw the four lines
b c d e joining the ends of lines i j k l and
touching the inner circle a a the outer circle is then pencilled
in touching the lines of division where they meet the lines b c
d e and the rest of the lines for the sides of the polygon may
then be drawn within the outer circle as at g h
illustration fig 176
it is obvious also that the triangle may be used to draw slots
radiating from a centre as in figure 176 where it is desired to draw a
chuckplate having 6 slots the triangle of 60 is used to draw the
centre lines a b c etc for the slots from the centre the
arcs e f g h etc are marked showing where the centres
will fall for describing the half circles forming the ends of the slots
then half circles i j k l etc being drawn the sides of
the slots may be drawn in with the triangle and the outer circle and
the slots inked in
if the slots are not to radiate from the centre of the circle the
process is as follows
the outer circle a figure 177 being drawn an inner one b is
drawn its radius equalling the amount the centres of the slots are to
point to one side of the centre of circle a the triangle is then used
to divide the circle into the requisite number of divisions c for the
slots and arcs i j are then drawn for the lengths of the slots the
centre lines e are then drawn passing through the lines c and the
arcs i j etc and touching the perimeter of the inner circle b
arcs f g are then marked in and their sides joined with the
triangle adjusted by hand all that would be inked in black are the
outer circle and the slots but the inner circle b and a centre line
of one of the slots should be marked in red ink to show how the
inclination of the slot was obtained and therefore its amount
illustration fig 177
for a fivesided figure it is best to step around the circumference of
the circle with the compasses but for a threesided one or trigon the
construction is as follows it will be found that the compasses set to
the radius of a circle will accurately divide it into six equal
divisions as is shown in figure 178 hence every other one of these
divisions will be the location for a corner of a trigon
the circle being drawn a line a 179 is drawn through its centre and
from its intersection with the circle as at b here a step on each
side is marked as c d then lines c to d and c and d to
e where a meets the circle will describe a trigon if the figure is
to stand vertical all that is necessary is to draw the line a
vertical as in figure 180 a ready method of getting the dimension
across corners across the flats or the length of a side of a given
polygon is by means of diagrams such as shown in the following
figures which form excellent examples for practice
illustration fig 178
illustration fig 179
illustration fig 180
draw the line o p figure 181 and at a right angle to it the line o b
divide these two lines into parts of one inch as shown in the cut
which is divided into inches and quarter inches and from these points
of division draw lines crossing each other as shown
illustration fig 181
from the point o draw diagonal lines at suitable angles to the line o
p as shown in the cut these diagonal lines are marked
40   degrees for 5 sided figures

but still others could be added for figures having a greater number of
sides
1 now it will be found as follows half the diameter or the radius of
a piece of cylindrical work being given and the number of sides it is
to have being stated the length of one side will be the distance
measured horizontally from the line o b to the diagonal line for that
particular number of sides
examplea piece of work is 212 inches in diameter and is required
to have 9 sides what will be the length of the sides or flats
now the half diameter or radius of 212 inches is 114 inches then
look along the line o b for 114 which is denoted in the cut by
figures and the arrow a set one point of the compasses at a and the
other at the point of crossing of the diagonal line with the 114
horizontal line as shown in the figure at a and from a to a is the
length of one side
again a piece of work 4 inches in diameter is to have 9 sides how
long will each side be
now half of 4 is 2 hence from b to b is the length of each side
but suppose that from the length of each side and the number of sides
it is required to find the diameter to which to turn the piece that is
its diameter across corners and we simply reverse the process thus a
body has 9 sides each side measures 2732 what is its diameter across
corners
take a rule apply it horizontally on the figure and pass it along till
the distance from the line o b to the diagonal line marked 9 sides
measures 2732 which is from 114 on o b to a and the 114 is the
radius which multiplied by 2 gives 212 inches which is the
required diameter across corners
for any other number of sides the process is just the same thus a
body is 312 inches in diameter and is to have 5 sides what will be
the length of each side now half of 312 is 134 hence from 134 on
the line o b to the point c where the diagonal line crosses the 134
line is the length of each of the sides
2 it will be found that the length of a side of a square being given
the size of the square measured across corners will be the length of
the diagonal line marked 45 degrees from the point o to the figures
indicating on the line o b or on the line o p the length of one side
examplea square body measures 1 inch on each side what does it
measure across the corners answer from the point o along diagonal
line marked 45 degrees to the point where it crosses the lines 1 as
denoted in the figure by a dot
again a cylindrical piece of wood requires to be squared and each side
of the square must measure an inch what diameter must the piece be
turned to
now the diagonal line marked 45 degrees passes through the 1inch line
on o b and the inch line on o p at the point where these lines meet
hence all we have to do is to run the eye along either of the lines
marked inch and from its point of meeting the 45 degrees line to the
point o is the diameter to turn the piece to
there is another way however of getting this same measurement which
is to set a pair of compasses from the line 1 on o b to line 1 on o p
as shown by the line d which is the full diameter across corners this
is apparent because from point o along line o b to 1 thence to the
dot thence down to line 1 on o p and along that to o encloses a
square of which either from o to the dot or the length of the line d
is the measurement across corners while the length of each side or
diameter across the flats is from point o to either of the points 1 or
from either of the points 1 to the dot
illustration fig 182
after graphically demonstrating the correctness of the scale we may
simplify it considerably in figure 182 therefore we have applications
shown a is a hexagon and if one of its sides be measured it will be
found that it measures the same as along line 1 from o b to the diagonal
line 45 degrees which distance is shown by a thickened line
at 112 is shown a sevensided figure whose diameter is 3 inches and
radius 112 inches and if from the point at 112 along the thickened
horizontal line to the diagonal marked 49 degrees be measured it
will be found exactly equal to the length of a side on the polygon
at c is shown part of a ninesided polygon of 2inch radius and the
length of one of its sides will be found to equal the distance from the
diagonal line marked 5212 degrees and the line o b at 2
let it now be noted that if from the point o as a centre we describe
arcs of circles from the points of division on o b to o p one end of
each arc will meet the same figure on o p as it started from at o b as
is shown in figure 181 and it becomes apparent that in the length of
diagonal line between o and the required arc we have the radius of the
polygon
examplewhat is the radius across corners of a hexagon or sixsided
figure the length of a side being an inch
turning to our scale we find that the place where there is a horizontal
distance of an inch between the diagonal 45 degrees answering to
sixsided figures is along line 1 figure 182 and the radius of the
circle enclosing the sixsided body is therefore an inch as will be
seen on referring to circle a but it will be noted that the length of
diagonal line 45 degrees enclosed between the point o and the arc of
circle from 1 on o b to one on o p measures also an inch hence we may
measure the radius along the diagonal lines if we choose this however
simply serves to demonstrate the correctness of the scale which being
understood we may dispense with most of the lines arriving at a scale
such as shown in figure 183 in which the length of the side of the
polygon is the distance from the line o b measured horizontally to the
diagonal corresponding to the number of sides of the polygon the
radius across corners of the polygon is that of the distance from o
along o b to the horizontal line giving the length of the side of the
polygon and the width across corners for a given length of one side of
the square is measured by the length of the lines a b c etc thus
dotted line 2 shows the length of the side of a ninesided figure of
2inch radius the radius across corners of the figure being 2 inches
illustration fig 183
the dotted line 212 shows the length of the side of a ninesided
polygon having a radius across corners of 212 inches the dotted line
1 shows the diameter across corners of a square whose sides measure an
inch and so on
illustration fig 184
this scale lacks however one element in that the diameter across the
flats of a regular polygon being given it will not give the diameter
across the corners this however we may obtain by a somewhat similar
construction thus in figure 184 draw the line o b and divide it into
inches and parts of an inch from these points of division draw
horizontal lines from the point o draw the following lines and at the
following angles from the horizontal line o p
illustration fig 185
a line at 75 for polygons having 12 sides

         60                    6   
from the point o to the numerals denoting the radius of the polygon is
the radius across the flats while from point o to the horizontal line
drawn from those numerals is the radius across corners of the polygon
illustration fig 186
a hexagon measures two inches across the flats what is its diameter
measured across the corners now from point o to the horizontal line
marked 1 inch measured along the line of 60 degrees is 1 532nds
inches hence the hexagon measures twice that or 2 516ths inches
across corners the proof of the construction is shown in the figure
the hexagon and other polygons being marked simply for clearness of
illustration

illustration fig 188
let it be required to draw the stud shown in figure 185 and the
construction would be for the pencil lines as shown in figure 186 line
1 is the centre line arcs 2 and 3 give the large and arcs 4 and 5
the small diameter to touch which lines 6 7 8 and 9 may be drawn
lines 10 11 and 12 are then drawn for the lengths and it remains to
draw the curves in in drawing these curves great exactitude is required
to properly find their centres nothing looks worse in a drawing than an
unfair or uneven junction between curves and straight lines to find the
location for these centres set the compasses to the required radius for
the curve and from the point or corner a draw the arcs b and c
from c mark the arc e and from b the arc d and where d and
e cross is the centre for the curve f
illustration fig 189
similarly for the curve h set the compasses on i and mark the arc
g and from the point where it crosses line 6 draw the curve h in
inking in it is best to draw in all curves or arcs of circles first and
the straight lines that join them afterward because if the straight
lines are drawn first it is a difficult matter to alter the centres of
the curves to make them fall true whereas after the curves are drawn
it is an easy matter if it should be necessary to vary the line a
trifle so as to make it join the curves correctly and fair in inking
in these curves also care must be taken not to draw them too short or
too long as this would impair the appearance very much as is shown in
figure 187
illustration fig 190
illustration fig 191
to draw the piece shown in figure 188 the lines are drawn in the order
indicated by the letters in figure 189 the example being given for
practice it is well for the beginner to draw examples of common
objects such as the hand hammer in figure 190 or the chuck plate in
figure 191 which afford good examples in the drawing of arcs and
circles
in figure 191 a is a cap nut and the order in which the same would be
pencilled in is indicated by the respective numerals the circles 3 and
4 represent the thread
illustration fig 191 a
in figure 192 is shown the pencilling for a link having the hubs on one
side only so that a centre line is unnecessary on the edge view as
all the lengths are derived from the top view while the thickness of
the stem and height of the hubs may be measured from the line a in
figure 193 there are hubs on both sides of the link of unequal height
hence a centre line is necessary in both views and from this line all
measurements should be marked
illustration fig 192
illustration fig 193
in figure 194 are represented the pencil lines for a double eye or
knuckle joint as it is sometimes termed an example that it is
desirable for the student to draw in various sizes as it is
representative of a large class of work
these eyes often have an offset and an example of this is given in
figure 195 in which a is the centre line for the stem distant from the
centre line b of the eyes to the amount of offset required
illustration fig 194
illustration fig 195
illustration fig 196
illustration fig 197
in figure 196 is an example of a connecting rod end from a point as a
we draw arcs as b c for the width and e d for the length of the block
and through a we draw the centre line it is obvious however that we
may draw the centre line first and apply the measuring rule direct to
the paper and mark lines in place of the arcs b c d e and f g
which are for the stem as the block joins the stem in a straight line
the latter is evidently rectangular as will be seen by referring to
figure 197 which represents a rod end with a round stem the fact that
the stem is round being clearly shown by the curves a b the radius of
these curves is obtained as follows it is obvious that they will join
the rod stem at the same point as the shoulder curves do as denoted by
the dotted vertical line so likewise they join the curves e f at the
same point in the rod length as the shoulder curves both curves in fact
being formed by the same round corner or shoulder the centre of the
radius of a or b must therefore be the same distance from the centre of
the rod as is the centre from which the shoulder curve is struck and at
the same time at such a distance from the corner as e or f that the
curve will meet the centre line of the rod at the same point in its
length as the shoulder curves do
illustration fig 198
figure 198 gives an example in which the similar curved lines show that
a part is square the figure represents a bolt with a square under the
head as but one view is given that fact alone tells us that it must be
round or square now we might mark a cross on the square part to denote
that it is square but this is unnecessary because the curves f g show
such to be the case these curves are marked as follows with the
compasses set to the radius e one point is rested at a and arc b is
drawn then one point of the compass is rested at c and arc d is drawn
giving the centre for the curve f by a similar process on the other
side of the figure curve g is drawn point c is obtained by drawing the
dotted line across where the outline curve meets the stem suppose that
the corner where the round stem meets the square under the head was a
sharp one instead of a curve then the traditional cross would require
to be put on the square as in figure 199 or the cross will be
necessary if the corner be a round one if the stem is reduced in
diameter as in figure 200
illustration fig 199
illustration fig 200
illustration fig 201
figure 201 represents a centre punch giving an example in which the
flat sides gradually run out upon a circle the edges forming curves as
at a b etc the length of these curves is determined as follows they
must begin where the taper of the punch joins the parallel or at c c
and they must end on that part of the taper stem where the diameter is
equal to the diameter across the flats of the octagon all that is to be
done then is to find the diameter across the flats on the end view and
mark it on the taper stem as at d d which will show where the flats
terminate on the taper stem and the curved lines as a b may be drawn
in by a curve that must meet at the line c and also in a rounded point
at line d

screw threads and spirals
illustration fig 202
illustration fig 203
the screw thread for small bolts is represented by thick and thin lines
such as was shown in figure 152 but in larger sizes the angles of the
thread also are drawn in as in figure 202 and the method of doing this
is shown in figure 203 the centre line 1 and lines 2 and 3 for the full
diameter of the thread being drawn set the compasses to the required
pitch of the thread and stepping along line 2 mark the arcs 4 5 6
etc for the full length the thread is to be marked with the triangle
resting against the tsquare the lines 7 8 9 etc for the full
length of the thread are drawn from the points 4 5 6 on line 2
these give one side of the thread reversing the drawing triangle
angles 10 11 etc are then drawn which will complete the outline of
the thread at the top of the bolt we may now mark the depth of the
thread by drawing line 12 and with the compasses set on the centre line
transfer this depth to the other side of the bolt as denoted by the
arcs 13 and 14 touching arc 14 we mark line 15 for the thread depth on
that side we have now to get the slant of the thread across the bolt
it is obvious that in passing once around the bolt the thread advances
to the amount of the pitch as from a to b hence in passing half
way around it will advance from a to c we therefore draw line 16
at a rightangle to the centre line and a line that touches the top of
the threads at a where it meets line 2 and also meets line 16 where
it touches line 3 is the angle or slope for the tops of the threads
which may be drawn across by lines as 18 19 20 etc from these lines
the sides of the thread may be drawn at the bottom of the bolt marking
first the angle on one side as by lines 21 22 23 etc and then the
angles on the other as by lines 24 25 etc
illustration fig 204
there now remain the bottoms of the thread to draw and this is done by
drawing lines from the bottom of the thread on one side of the bolt to
the bottom on the other as shown in the cut by a dotted line hence we
may set a square blade to that angle and mark in these lines as 26
27 28 etc and the thread is pencilled in complete
if the student will follow out this example upon paper it will appear
to him that after the thread had been marked out on one side of the
bolt the angle of the thread might be obtained as shown by lines 16
and 17 and that the bottoms of the thread as well as the tops might be
carried across the bolt to the other side figure 204 represents a case
in which this has been done and it will be observed that the lines
denoting the bottom of the thread do not meet the bottoms of the thread
which occurs for the reason that the angle for the bottom is not the
same as that for the top of the thread
illustration fig 205
illustration fig 206
in inking in the thread it enhances the appearance to give the bottom
of the thread and the righthand side of the same heavy shade lines
as in figure 202 a plan that is usually adopted for threads of large
diameter and coarse pitch
a double thread such as in figure 205 is drawn in the same way except
that the slant of the thread is doubled and the square is to be set for
the threadpitch a a both for the tops and bottoms of the thread
illustration fig 207
a round top and bottom thread as the whitworth thread is drawn by
single lines as in figure 206 a lefthand thread figure 207 is
obviously drawn by the same process as a righthand one except that the
slant of the thread is given in the opposite direction
for screw threads of a large diameter it is not uncommon to draw in the
thread curves as they appear to the eye and the method of doing this is
shown in figure 208 the thread is first marked on both sides of the
bolt as explained and instead of drawing straight across the bolt
lines to represent the tops and bottoms of the thread a template to
draw the curves by is required to get these curves two halfcircles
one equal in diameter to the top and one equal to the bottom of the
thread are drawn as in figure 208
illustration fig 208
these halfcircles are divided into any convenient number of equal
divisions thus in figure 208 each has eight divisions as a b
c etc for the outer and i j k etc for the inner one
the pitch of the thread is then divided off by vertical lines into as
many equal divisions as the halfcircles are divided into as by the
lines a b c etc to o of these the seven from a to h
correspond to the seven from a to g and are for the top of the
thread and the seven from i to o correspond to the seven on the
inner halfcircle as i j k etc horizontal lines are then
drawn from the points of the division to meet the vertical lines of
division thus the horizontal dotted line from a meets the vertical
line a and where they meet as at a a dot is made where the dotted
line from b meets vertical line b another dot is made as at b
and so on until the point g is found a curve drawn to pass from the top
of the thread on one side of the bolt to the top of the other side and
passing through these points as from a to g will be the curve for the
top of the thread and from this curve a template may be made to mark
all the other threadtops from because manifestly all the tops of the
thread on the bolt will be alike
for the bottoms of the thread lines are similarly drawn as from i
to meet i where dot i is marked j is got from j and j while k
is got from the intersection of k with k and so on the dots from
i to o being those through which a curve is drawn for the bottom of the
thread and from this curve a template also may be made to mark all the
thread bottoms we have in our example used eight points of division in
each halfcircle but either more or less points maybe used the only
requisite being that the pitch of the thread must be divided into as
many divisions as the two halfcircles are but it is not absolutely
necessary that both halfcircles be divided into the same number of
equal divisions thus suppose the large halfcircle were divided into
ten divisions then instead of the first half of the pitch being divided
into eight as from a to h it would require to have ten lines but
the inner halfcircle may have eight only as in our example it is more
convenient however to use the same number of divisions for both
circles so that they may both be divided together by lines radiating
from the centre the more the points of division the greater number of
points to draw the curves through hence it is desirable to have as many
as possible which is governed by the pitch of the thread it being
obvious that the finer the pitch the less the number of distinct and
clear divisions it is practicable to divide it into in our example the
angles of the thread are spread out to cause these lines to be thrown
further apart than they would be in a bolt of that diameter hence it
will be seen that in threads of but two or three inches in diameter the
lines would fall very close together and would require to be drawn
finely and with care to keep them distinct
illustration fig 208 a
illustration fig 209
the curves for a united states standard form of thread are obtained in
the same manner as from the v thread in figure 208 but the thread
itself is more difficult to draw the construction of this thread is
shown in figure 208 it having a flat place at the top and at the bottom
of the thread a common v thread has its sides at an angle of 60
degrees one to the other the top and bottom meeting in a point the
united states standard is obtained from drawing a common v thread and
dividing its depth into eight equal divisions as at x in figure 208
a and cutting off one of these divisions at the top and filling in
one at the bottom to form flat places as shown in the figure but the
thread cannot be sketched on a bolt by this means unless temporary lines
are used to get the thread from these temporary lines being drawn to
represent a bolt onefourth the depth of the thread too large in
diameter thus in figure 208 a it is seen that cutting off
oneeighth the depth of the thread reduces the diameter of the thread
it is necessary then to draw the flat place on top of the thread
first the order of procedure being shown in figure 209 the lines for
the full diameter of the thread being drawn the pitch is stepped off by
arcs as 1 2 3 etc and from these arcs as 4 5 6 etc are
marked for the width of the flat places at the tops of the threads
then one side of the thread is marked off by lines as 7 which meet the
arcs 1 2 3 etc as at a c etc similar lines as 8 and 9 are
marked for the other side of the thread these lines 7 8 and 9
projecting until they cross each other line 10 is then drawn making a
flat place at the bottom of the thread equal in width to that at the
top line 12 is then drawn square across the bolt starting from the
bottom of the thread and line 13 is drawn starting from the corner f
on one side of the thread and meeting line 12 on the other side of the
thread which gives the angle for the tops of the thread the depth of
the thread may then be marked on the other side of the bolt by the arcs
d and e and the line 14 the tops of all the threads may then be
drawn in as by lines 15 16 17 and 18 and by lines as 19 etc the
thread sides may be drawn on the other side of the bolt all that
remains is to join the bottoms of the threads by lines across the bolt
and the pencil lines will be complete ready to ink in if the thread is
to be shown curved instead of drawn straight across the curve may be
obtained by the construction in figure 208 which is similar to that in
figure 207 except that while the pitch is divided off into 16
divisions the whole of these 16 divisions are not used to get the
curves some of them being used twice over thus for the bottom the
eight divisions from b to i are used while for the tops the eight
from g to o are used hence g h and i are used for getting
both curves the divisions from a to b and from o to p being
taken up by the flat top and bottom of the thread it will be noted that
in figure 207 the top of the thread is drawn first while in figure
208 the bottom is drawn first and that in the latter for the us
standard the pitch is marked from centre to centre of the flats of the
thread
illustration fig 210
to draw a square thread the pencil lines are marked in the order shown
in figure 210 in which 1 represents the centre line and 2 3 4 and 5
the diameter and depth of the thread the pitch of the thread is marked
off by arcs as 6 7 etc or by laying a rule directly on the centre
line and marking with a lead pencil to obtain the slant of the thread
lines 8 and 9 are drawn and from these line 10 touching 8 and 9 where
they meet lines 2 and 5 the threads may then be drawn in from the arcs
as 6 7 etc the side of the thread will show at the top and the bottom
as at a b because of the coarse pitch and the thread on the other or
unseen side of the bolt slants as denoted by the lines 12 13 and
hence to draw the sides a b the triangle must be set from one thread to
the next on the opposite side of the bolt as denoted by the dotted
lines 12 and 13
illustration fig 211
if the curves of the thread are to be drawn in they may be obtained as
in figure 211 which is substantially the same as described for a v
thread the curves f representing the sides of the thread terminate
at the centre line g and the curves e are equidistant with the
curves c from the vertical lines d as the curves f above the
line are the same as f below the line the template for f need not
be made to extend the whole distance across but onehalf only as is
shown by the dotted curve g in the construction for finding the curve
for squarethreaded nuts in figure 212
illustration fig 212
illustration fig 213
a specimen of the form of template for drawing these curves is shown in
figure 213 g g is the centre line parallel to the edges r s
lines m n represent the diameter of the thread at the top and
o p that at the bottom or root edge a is formed to the points
found by the constructions in the figures as already explained for the
tops of the thread and edge f is so formed for the curve at the
thread bottoms the edge as s or r is laid against the squareblade to
steady it while drawing in the curves it may be noted however that
since the curve is the same below the centre line as it is above the
template may be made to serve for onehalf the thread diameter as at
f where it is made from o to g only being turned upside down to
draw the other half of the curve the notches cut out at x x are
merely to let the pencillines in the drawing show plainly when setting
the template
when the thread of a nut is shown in section it slants in the opposite
direction to that which appears on the boltthread because it shows the
thread that fits to the opposite side of the bolt which therefore
slants in the opposite direction as shown by the lines 12 and 13 in
figure 210
in a top or end view of a nut the thread depth is usually shown by a
simple circle as in figure 214
illustration fig 214
to draw a spiral spring draw the centre line a and lines b c figure
215 distant apart the diameter the spring is to be less the diameter of
the wire of which it is to be made on the centre line a mark two lines
a b c d representing the pitch of the spring divide the distance
between a and b into four equal divisions as by lines 1 2 3
letting line 3 meet line b line e meeting the centre line at line
a and the line b at its intersection with line 3 is the angle of the
coil on one side of the spring hence it may be marked in at all the
locations as at e f etc these lines give at their intersections
with the lines c and b the centres for the half circles g which being
drawn the sides h i j k etc of the spring may all be
marked in by the lines m n o p the other sides of the
spring may be marked in
illustration fig 215
the end of the spring is usually marked straight across as at l if it
is required to draw the coils curved instead of straight across a
template must be made the curve being obtained as already described for
threads it may be pointed out however that to obtain as accurate a
division as possible of the lines that divide the pitch the pitch may
be divided upon a diagonal line as f figure 216 which will greatly
facilitate the operation
illustration fig 216
before going into projections it may be as well to give some examples
for practice

examples for practice
figure 217 represents a simple example for practice which the student
may draw the size of the engraving or he may draw it twice the size it
is a locomotive spring composed of leaves or plates held together by a
central band
illustration fig 217
figure 218 is an example of a stuffing box and gland supposed to stand
vertical hence the gland has an oil cup or receptacle
in figure 219 are working drawings of a coupling rod with the
dimensions and directions marked in
it may be remarked however that the drawings of a workshop are where
large quantities of the same kind of work is done varied in character
to suit some special departmentsthat is to say special extra drawings
are made for these departments in figures 220 and 221 is a drawing of a
connecting rod drawn put together as it would be for the lathe vise or
erecting shop
illustration fig 218
illustration fig 219
illustration fig 220
illustration fig 221
to the two views shown there would be necessary detail sketches of the
set screws gibbs and keys all the rest being shown the necessary
dimensions being of course marked on the general drawing and on the
details
in so simple a thing as a connecting rod however there would be no
question as to how the parts go together hence detail drawings of each
separate piece would answer for the lathe or vise bands
but in many cases this would not be the case and the drawing would
require to show the parts put together and be accompanied with such
detail sketches as might be necessary to show parts that could not be
clearly defined in the general views
the blacksmith for example is only concerned with the making of the
separate pieces and has no concern as to how the parts go together
furthermore there are parts and dimensions in the general drawing with
which the blacksmith has nothing to do
thus the location and dimensions of the keyways the dimensions of the
brasses and the location of the bolt holes are matters that have no
reference to the blacksmiths work because the keyways bolt holes and
setscrew holes would be cut out of the solid in the machine shop it is
customary therefore to send to the blacksmith shop drawings containing
separate views of each piece drawn to the shape it is to be forged and
drawn full size or else on a scale sufficiently large to make each part
show clearly without close inspection marking thereon the full sizes
and stating beneath the number of pieces of each detail as in figure
222 which represents the iron work of the connecting rod in figure
220 in some cases the finished sizes are marked and it is left to the
blacksmiths judgment how much to leave for the finishing this is
undesirable because either the blacksmith is left to judge what parts
are to be finished or else there must be on the drawing instructions on
this point or else signs or symbols that are understood to convey the
information it is better therefore to make for the blacksmith a
special sketch and mark thereon the fullforged sizes stating on the
drawing that such is the case
illustration fig 222
as to the material of which the pieces are to be made the greater part
of blacksmith work is made of wrought iron and it is therefore
unnecessary to write wrought iron beneath each piece when the pieces
are to be of steel however it should be marked on the drawing and
beneath the piece in special cases as where the greater part of the
work of the shop is of steel the rule may of course be reversed and
the parts made of iron may be the ones marked whereas when parts are
sometimes of iron and at others of steel each piece should be marked
as a general rule the blacksmith knows from the custom of the shop or
the nature of the work what the quality or kind of iron is to be and
it is therefore only in exceptional cases that they need to be
mentioned on the drawing thus in a carriage manufactory norway or
swede iron will be found as well as the better grades of refined iron
but the blacksmith will know what iron to use for certain parts or the
shop may be so regulated that the selection of the iron is not left to
him in marking the number of pieces required it is better to use the
word thus than the words of this or off this because it is
shorter and more correct for the forging is not taken off the drawing
nor is it of the same the drawing gives the shape and the size and the
word thus conveys that idea better than of off or like this
in shops where there are many of the same pieces forged the blacksmith
is furnished with sheetiron templates that he can lay directly upon the
forging and test its dimensions at once which is an excellent plan in
large work such templates are of course made from the drawings and
it becomes a question as to whether their dimensions should be the
forged or the finished ones if they are the forged they may cause
trouble because a forging may have a scant place that it is difficult
for the blacksmith to bring up to the size of the template and he is in
doubt whether there is enough metal in the scant place to allow the job
to clean up it is better therefore to make them to finished sizes so
that he can see at once if the work will clean up notwithstanding the
scant place this will lead to no errors in large work because such
work is marked out by lines and the scant part will therefore be
discovered by the machinist who will line out the piece accordingly
figure 223 is a drawing of a locomotive frame which the student may as
well draw three or four times as large as the engraving which brings us
to the subject of enlarging or reducing scales
reducing scales
illustration fig 223
illustration fig 224
illustration fig 225
it is sometimes necessary to reduce a drawing to a smaller scale or to
find a minute fraction of a given dimension such fraction not being
marked on the lineal measuring rules at hand figure 224 represents a
scale for finding minute fractions draw seven lines parallel to each
other and equidistant draw vertical lines dividing the scale into
halfinches as at a b c etc divide the first space e d into
equal halves draw diagonal lines and number them as in the figure the
distance of point 1 which is at the intersection of diagonal with the
second horizontal line will be 124 inch from vertical line e point
2 will be 224 inch from line e and so on for tenths of inches there
would require to be but six horizontal lines the diagonals being drawn
as before a similar scale is shown in figure 225 draw the lines a b b
d d c c a enclosing a square inch divide each of these lines into
ten equal divisions and number and letter them as shown draw also the
diagonal lines a 1 a 2 b 3 and so on then the distances from the
line a c to the points of intersection of the diagonals with the
horizontal lines represent hundredths of an inch
suppose for example we trace one diagonal line in its path across the
figure taking that which starts from a and ends at 1 on the top
horizontal line then where the diagonal intersects horizontal line 1
is 99100 from the line b d and 1100 from the line a c while where it
intersects horizontal line 2 is 98100 from line b d and 2100 from
line a c and so on if we require to set the compasses to 67100 inch
we set them to the radius of n and the figure 3 on line b d because
from that 3 to the vertical line d 4 is 610 or 60100 inch and from
that vertical line to the diagonal at n is seven divisions from the
line c d of the figure
in making a drawing to scale however it is an excellent plan to draw a
line and divide it off to suit the required scale suppose for example
that the given scale is onequarter size or three inches per foot then
a line three inches long may be divided into twelve equal divisions
representing twelve inches and these may be subdivided into half or
quarter inches and so on it is recommended to the beginner however to
spend all his time making simple drawings without making them to scale
in order to become so familiar with the use of the instruments as to
feel at home with them avoiding the complication of early studies that
would accompany drawing to scale

projections
in projecting the lines in one view are used to mark those in other
views and to find their shapes or curvature as they will appear in
other views thus in figure 225a we have a spiral wound around a
cylinder whose end is cut off at an angle the pitch of the spiral is
the distance a b and we may delineate the curve of the spiral looking
at the cylinder from two positions one at a rightangle to the other
as is shown in the figure by means of a circle having a circumference
equal to that of the cylinder
the circumference of this circle we divide into any number of
equidistant divisions as from 1 to 24 the pitch a b of the spiral or
thread is then divided off also into 24 equidistant divisions as marked
on the left hand of the figure vertical lines are then drawn from the
points of division on the circle to the points correspondingly numbered
on the lines dividing the pitch and where line 1 on the circle
intersects line 1 on the pitch is one point in the curve similarly
where point 2 on the circle intersects line 2 on the pitch is another
point in the curve and so on for the whole 24 divisions on the circle
and on the pitch in this view however the path of the spiral from
line 7 to line 19 lies on the other side of the cylinder and is marked
in dotted lines because it is hidden by the cylinder in the
righthand view however a different portion of the spiral or thread is
hidden namely from lines 1 to 13 inclusive being an equal proportion
to that hidden in the lefthand view
illustration fig 225 a
the top of the cylinder is shown in the lefthand view to be cut off at
an angle to the axis and will therefore appear elliptical in the
righthand view to delineate this oval the same vertical lines from
the circle may be carried up as shown on the right hand and horizontal
lines may be drawn from the inclined face in one view across the end of
the other view as at p the divisions on the circle may be carried up
on the righthand view by means of straight lines as q and arcs of
circle as at r and vertical lines drawn from these arcs as line s
and where these vertical lines s intersect the horizontal lines as p
are points in the ellipse
let it be required to draw a cylindrical body joining another at a
rightangle as for example a tee such as in figure 226 and the
outline can all be shown in one view but it is required to find the
line of junction of one piece a with the other b that is find or
mark the lines of junction c now when the diameters of a and b are
equal the line of junction c is a straight line but it becomes a
curved one when the diameter of a is less than that of b or vice
versa hence it may be as well to project it in both cases for this
purpose the three views are necessary onequarter of the circle of b
in the end view is divided off into any number of equal divisions thus
we have chosen the divisions marked a b c d e etc a
quarter of the top view is similarly divided off as at f g h
i j from these points of division lines are projected on to the
side view as shown by the dotted lines k l m n o p
etc and where these lines meet as denoted by the dots is in each
case a point in the line of junction of the two cylinders a b
illustration fig 226
illustration fig 227
figure 227 represents a tee in which b is less in diameter than a
hence the two join in a curve which is found in a similar manner as is
shown in figure 227 suppose that the end and top views are drawn and
that the side view is drawn in outline but that the curve of junction
or intersection is to be found now it is evident that since the centre
line 1 passes through the side and end views that the face a in the
end view will be even with the face a in the side view both being
the same face and as the full length of the side of b in the end view
is marked by line b therefore line c projected down from b will
at its junction with line b which corresponds to line b give the
extreme depth to which b extends into the body a and therefore the
apex of the curve of intersection of b with a to obtain other points
we divide onequarter of the circumference of the circle b in the top
view into four equal divisions as by lines d e f and from the
points of division we draw lines j i g to the centre line
marked 2 these lines being thickened in the cut for clearness of
illustration the compasses are then set to the length of thickened line
g and from point h in the end view as a centre the arc g is
marked with the compasses set to the length of thickened line i and
from h as a centre arc i is marked and with the length of
thickened line j as a radius and from h as a centre arc j is
marked from these arcs lines k l m are drawn and from the
intersection of k l m with the circle of a lines n o p
are let fall from the lines of division d e f the lines q
r s are drawn and where lines n o p join lines q r
s are points in the curve as shown by the dots and by drawing a
line to intersect these dots the curve is obtained on onehalf of b
since the axis of b is in the same plane as that of a the lower half of
the curve is of the same curvature as the upper as is shown by the
dotted curve
illustration fig 228
in figure 228 the axis of piece b is not in the same plane as that of d
but to one side of it to the distance between the centre lines c d
which is most clearly seen in the top view in this case the process is
the same except in the following points in the side view the line w
corresponding to the line w in the end view passes within the line
x before the curve of intersection begins and in transferring the
lengths of the full lines b c d e f to the end view and
marking the arcs b c d e f they are marked from the
point w the point where the centre line of b intersects the outline
of a instead of from the point x in all other respects the
construction is the same as that in figure 227
illustration fig 229
in these examples the axis of b stands at a rightangle to that of a
but in figure 229 is shown the construction where the axis of b is not
at a rightangle to a in this case there is projected from b in the
side view an end view of b as at b and across this end at a
rightangle to the centre line of b is marked a centre line c c of b
which is divided as before by lines d e f g h their
respective lengths being transferred from w as a centre and marked by
the arcs d e f which are marked on a vertical line and
carried by horizontal lines to the arc of a as at i j k from
these points i j k the perpendicular lines l m n o
are dropped and where these lines meet lines p q r s t
are points in the curve of intersection of b with a it will be observed
that each of the lines m n o serves for two of the points in
the curve thus m meets q and s while n meets p and t and
o meets the outline on each side of b in the side view and as i
j k are obtained from d and e the lines g and h might have
been omitted being inserted merely for the sake of illustration
in figure 230 is an example in which a cylinder intersects a cone the
axes being parallel to obtain the curve of intersection in this case
the side view is divided by any convenient number of lines as a b
c etc drawn at a rightangle to its axis a a and from one end of
these lines are let fall the perpendiculars f g h i j
from the ends of these where they meet the centre line of a in the top
view halfcircles k l m n o are drawn to meet the
circle of b in the top view and from their points of intersection with
b lines p q r s t are drawn and where these meet lines
a b c d and e which is at u v w x y are
points in the curve
illustration fig 230
illustration fig 231
it will be observed on referring again to figure 229 that the branch
or cylinder b appears to be of elliptical section on its end face
which occurs because it is seen at an angle to its end surface now the
method of finding the ellipse for any given degree of angle is as in
figure 231 in which b represents a cylindrical body whose top face
would if viewed from point i appear as a straight line while if
viewed from point j it would appear in outline a circle now if viewed
from point e its apparent dimension in one direction will obviously be
defined by the lines s z so that if on a line g g at a right angle to
the line of vision e we mark points touching lines s z we get points
1 and 2 representing the apparent dimension in that direction which is
the width of the ellipse the length of the ellipse will obviously be
the full diameter of the cylinder b hence from e as a centre we mark
points 3 and 4 and of the remaining points we will speak presently
suppose now the angle the top face of b is viewed from is denoted by the
line l and lines s z parallel to l will be the width for the
ellipse whose length is marked by dots equidistant on each side of
centre line g g which equal in their widths one from the other the
full diameter of b in this construction the ellipse will be drawn away
from the cylinder b and the ellipse after being found would have to
be transferred to the end of b but since centre line g g is obviously
at the same angle to a a that a a is to g g we may start from the
centre line of the body whose elliptical appearance is to be drawn and
draw a centre line a a at the same angle to g g as the end of b is
supposed to be viewed from this is done in figure 231 a in which the
end face of b is to be drawn viewed from a point on the line g g but at
an angle of 45 degrees hence line a a is drawn at an angle of 45
degrees to centre line g g and centre line e is drawn from the centre
of the end of b at a right angle to g g and from where it cuts a a as
at f a side view of b is drawn or a single line of a length equal to
the diameter of b may be drawn at a right angle to a a and equidistant
on each side of f a line d d at a right angle to a a and at any
convenient distance above f is then drawn and from its intersection
with a a as a centre a circle c equal to the diameter of b is drawn
onehalf of the circumference of c is divided off into any number of
equal divisions as by arcs a b c d e f from these
points of division lines g h i j k l are drawn and
also lines m n o p q r from the intersection of these
last lines with the face in the side view lines s t u t
w x y z are drawn and from point f line e is drawn now it
is clear that the width of the end face of the cylinder will appear the
same from any point of view it may be looked at hence the sides h h are
made to equal the diameter of the cylinder b and marked up to centre
line e
illustration fig 231 a
illustration fig 232
it is obvious also that the lines s z drawn from the extremes of
the face to be projected will define the width of the ellipse hence we
have four of the points marked respectively 1 2 3 4 in the ellipse
to obtain the remaining points lines t u v w x y
which start from the point on the face f where the lines m n o
p q r respectively meet it are drawn across the face of b as
shown the compasses are then set to the radius g that is from
centre line d to division a on the circle and this radius is
transferred to the face to be projected the compasspoint being rested
at the intersection of centre line g and line t and two arcs as 5 and
6 drawn giving two more points in the curve of the ellipse the
compasses are then set to the length of line h that is from centre
line d to point of division b and this distance is transferred
setting the compasses on centre line g where it is intersected by line
u and arcs 7 8 are marked giving two more points in the ellipse in
like manner points 9 and 10 are obtained from the length of line i 11
and 12 from that of j points 13 and 14 from the length of k and 15
and 16 from l and the ellipse may be drawn in from these points
it may be pointed out however that since points 5 and 6 are the same
distance from g that points 15 and 16 are and since points 7 and 8 are
the same distance from g that points 13 and 14 are while points 9 and
10 are the same distance from g that 11 and 12 are the lines j k
l are unnecessary since l and g are of equal length as are also
h and k and i and j in figure 232 the cylinders are line shaded
to make them show plainer to the eye and but three lines a b
c are used to get the radius wherefrom to mark the arcs where the
points in the ellipse shall fall thus radius a gives points 1 2 3
and 4 radius b gives points 5 6 7 and 8 and radius c gives 9
10 11 and 12 the extreme diameter being obtained from lines s z and
h h
chapter xi
drawing gear wheels
the names given to the various lines of a tooth on a gearwheel are as
follows
in figure 233 a is the face and b the flank of a tooth while c is the
point and d the root of the tooth e is the height or depth and f the
breadth p p is the pitch circle and the space between the two teeth
as h is termed a space
illustration fig 233
illustration fig 234
it is obvious that the points of the teeth and the bottoms of the
spaces as well as the pitch circle are concentric to the axis of the
wheel bore and to pencil in the teeth these circles must be fully
drawn as in figure 234 in which p p is the pitch circle this circle
is divided into as many equal divisions as the wheel is to have teeth
these divisions being denoted by the radial lines a b c etc where
these divisions intersect the pitch circle are the centres from which
all the teeth curves may be drawn the compasses are set to a radius
equal to the pitch less onehalf the thickness of the tooth and from a
centre as r two face curves as f g may be marked from the next
centre as at s the curves d e may be marked and so on for all the
faces that is the tooth curves lying between the outer circle x and
the pitch circle p for the flank curves that is the curve from p to
y the compasses are set to a radius equal to the pitch and from the
sides of the teeth the flank curves are drawn thus from j as a centre
flank k is drawn from v as a centre flank h is drawn and so on
the proportions of the teeth for cast gears generally accepted in this
country are those given by professor willis as average practice and
are as follows
depth to pitch line 310 of the pitch
working depth       610         
whole depth         710         
thickness of tooth  511         
breadth of space    611         
instead however of calculating the dimensions these proportions give
for any particular pitch a diagram or scale may be made from which they
may be taken for any pitch by a direct application of the compasses a
scale of this kind is given in figure 235 in which the line a b is
divided into inches and parts to represent the pitches its total length
representing the coarsest pitch within the capacity of the scale and
the line b c at a rightangle to a b the whole depth of the tooth for
the coarsest pitch being 710 of the length of a b
illustration fig 235
the other diagonal lines are for the proportion of the dimensions marked
on the figure thus the depth of face or distance from the pitch line
to the extremity or tooth point for a 4 inch pitch would be measured
along the line b c from the vertical line b to the first diagonal the
thickness of the tooth would be for a 4 inch pitch along line b c from b
to the second diagonal and so on for a 3 inch pitch the measurement
would be taken along the horizontal line starting from the 3 on the
line a b and so on on the left of the diagram or scale is marked the
lbs strain each pitch will safely transmit per inch width of wheel
face according to professor marks
illustration fig 236
the application of the scale as follows the pitch circles p p and p
p figure 236 for the respective wheels are drawn and the height of
the teeth is obtained from the scale and marked beyond the pitch
circles when circles q and q may be drawn similarly the depths of
the teeth within the pitch circles are obtained from the scale or
diagram and marked within the respective pitch circles and circles r
and r are marked in the pitch circles are divided off into as many
points of equal division as at a b c d e etc as the
respective wheels are to have teeth and the thickness of tooth having
been obtained from the scale this thickness is marked from the points
of division on the pitch circles as at f in the figure and the tooth
curves may then be drawn in it may be observed however that the tooth
thicknesses will not be strictly correct because the scale gives the
same chord pitch for the teeth on both wheels which will give different
arc pitches to the teeth on the two wheels whereas it is the arc
pitches and not the chord pitches that should be correct this error
obviously increases as there is a greater amount of difference between
the two wheels
the curves given to the teeth in figure 234 are not the proper ones to
transmit uniform motion but are curves merely used by draughtsmen to
save the trouble of finding the true curves which if it be required
may be drawn with a very near approach to accuracy as follows which is
a construction given by rankine
draw the rolling circle d figure 237 and draw a d the line of
centres from the point of contact at c mark on d a point distant from
c onehalf the amount of the pitch as at p and draw the line p c of
indefinite length beyond c draw the line p e passing through the line
of centres at e which is equidistant between c and a then increase the
length of line p f to the right of c by an amount equal to the radius a
c and then diminish it to an amount equal to the radius e d thus
obtaining the point f and the latter will be the location of centre for
compasses to strike the face curve
illustration fig 237
illustration fig 238
another method of finding the face curve with compasses is as follows
in figure 238 let p p represent the pitch circle of the wheel to be
marked and b c the path of the centre of the generating or describing
circle as it rolls outside of p p let the point b represent the centre
of the generating circle when it is in contact with the pitch circle at
a then from b mark off on b c any number of equidistant points as
d e f g h and from a mark on the pitch circle with the same
radius an equal number of points of division as 1 2 3 4 5 with
the compasses set to the radius of the generating circle that is a b
from b as a centre mark the arc i from d the arc j from e the arc
k from f and so on marking as many arcs as there are points of
division on b c with the compasses set to the radius of divisions 1 2
etc step off on arc m the five divisions n o s t v and at v will
be a point on the epicycloidal curve from point of division 4 step off
on l four points of division as a b c d and d will be
another point on the epicycloidal curve from point 3 set off three
divisions and so on and through the points so obtained draw by hand
or with a scroll the curve
illustration fig 239
hypocycloids for the flanks of the teeth maybe traced in a similar
manner thus in figure 239 p p is the pitch circle and b c the line of
motion of the centre of the generating circle to be rolled within p p
from 1 to 6 are points of equal division on the pitch circle and d to i
are arc locations for the centre of the generating circle starting
from a which represents the location for the centre of the generating
circle the point of contact between the generating and base circles
will be at b then from 1 to 6 are points of equal division on the pitch
circle and from d to i are the corresponding locations for the centres
of the generating circle from these centres the arcs j k l m n o
are struck the six divisions on o from a to f give at f a point
in the curve five divisions on n four on m and so on give
respectively points in the curve
there is this however to be noted concerning the construction of the
last two figures since the circle described by the centre of the
generating circle is of a different arc or curve to that of the pitch
circle the length of an arc having an equal radius on each will be
different the amount is so small as to be practically correct the
direction of the error is to give to the curves a less curvature as
though they had been produced by a generating circle of larger diameter
suppose for example that the difference between the arc a b and
its chord is 1 and that the difference between the arc 4 5 and its
chord is 01 then the error in one step is 09 and as the point f
is formed in five steps it will contain this error multiplied five
times point d would contain it multiplied three times because it has
three steps and so on
the error will increase in proportion as the diameter of the generating
is less than that of the pitch circle and though in large wheels
working with large wheels so that the difference between the radius of
the generating circle and that of the smallest wheel is not excessive
it is so small as to be practically inappreciable yet in small wheels
working with large ones it may form a sensible error
illustration fig 240
for showing the dimensions through the arms and hub a sectional view of
a section of the wheel may be given as in figure 240 which represents
a section of a wheel and a pinion and on these two views all the
necessary dimensions may be marked
illustration fig 240 a page 203
if it is desired to draw an edge view of a wheel which the student will
find excellent practice the lines for the teeth may be projected from
the teeth in the side view as in figure 240 a thus tooth e is
projected by drawing lines from the corners a b c in the side view
across the face in the edge view as at a b c in the latter view and
similar lines may be obtained in the same way for all the teeth
when the teeth of wheels are to be cut to form in a gearcutting
machine the thickness of the teeth is nearly equal to the thickness of
the spaces there being just sufficient difference to prevent the teeth
of one wheel from becoming locked in the spaces of the other but when
the teeth are to be cast upon the wheel the tooth thickness is made
less than the width of the space to an amount that is usually a certain
proportion of the pitch and is termed the side clearance in all
wheels whether with cut or cast teeth there is given a certain amount
of top and bottom clearance that is to say the points of the teeth of
one wheel do not reach to the bottom of the spaces in the other thus in
the pratt and whitney system the top and bottom clearance is oneeighth
of the pitch while in the brown and sharpe system for involute teeth
the clearance is equal to onetenth the thickness of the tooth
in drawing bevil gear wheels the pitch line of each tooth on each
wheel and the surfaces of the points as well as those at the bottom of
the spaces must all point to a centre as e in figure 241 which centre
is where the axes of the shafts would meet it is unnecessary to mark in
the correct curves for the teeth for reasons already stated with
reference to the curves for a spur wheel but if it is required to do
so the construction to find the curves is as shown in figure 242 in
which let a a represent the axis of one shaft and b that of the other
of the pair of bevil wheels that are to work together their axes
meeting at w draw the line e at a right angle to a a and representing
the pitch circle diameter of one wheel and draw f at a right angle to
b and representing the pitch circle of the other wheel draw the line g
g passing through the point w and the point t where the pitch circles
or lines e f meet and g g will be the line of contact of the tooth of
one wheel upon the tooth of the other wheel or in other words the
pitch line of the tooth
illustration fig 241
illustration fig 242
draw lines as h and i representing the tooth breadth from w as a
centre draw on each side of g g dotted lines as p representing the
height of the tooth above and below the pitch line g g at a right angle
to g g draw the line j k and from where this line meets b as at q
mark the arc a which will represent the pitch circle for the large
diameter of the pinion d the smallest wheel of a pair of gears is
termed the pinion draw the arc b for the height and circle c for
the depth of the teeth thus defining the height of the tooth at that
end similarly from p as a centre mark for the large diameter of wheel
c arcs g h and i arc g representing the pitch circle i
the height and h the depth of the tooth on these arcs draw the
proper tooth curves in the same manner as for spur wheels that is
obtain the curves by the construction shown in figures 237 or by those
in figures 238 and 239
to obtain the arcs for the other end of the tooth draw line m m
parallel to line j k set the compasses to the radius r l and from p
as a centre draw the pitch circle k for the depth of the tooth draw
the dotted line p meeting the circle h and the point w a similar
line from i to w will give the height of the tooth at its inner end
then the tooth curves may be drawn on these three arcs k l m
in the same as if they were for a spur wheel
similarly for the pitch circle of the inner and small end of the pinion
teeth set the compasses to radius s l and from q as a centre mark the
pitch circle d outside of d mark e for the height above pitch
lines of the tooth and inside of d mark the arc f for the depth
below pitch line of the tooth at that end the distance between the
dotted lines as p represents the full height of the tooth hence h
meets p which is the root of the tooth on the large wheel to give
clearance and prevent the tops of the teeth on one wheel from bearing
against the bottoms of the spaces in the other wheel the point of the
pinion teeth is marked below thus arc b does not meet h or p but
is short to the amount of clearance having obtained the arcs d e
f the curves may be marked thereon as for a spur wheel a tooth thus
marked is shown at x and from its curves between b and c a
template may be made for the large diameter or outer end of the pinion
teeth similarly for the wheel c the outer end curves are marked on the
arcs g h i and those for the other end of the tooth are marked
between the arcs l m

illustration fig 244
figure 243 represents a drawing of onehalf of a bevil gear and an edge
view projected from the same the point e corresponds to point e in
figure 241 or w in 242 the line f shows that the top surface of the
teeth points to e line g shows that the pitch line of each tooth points
to e and lines h show that the bottom of the surface of a space also
points to e line 1 shows that the sides of each tooth point to e and
it follows that the outer end of a tooth is both higher or deeper and
also thicker than its inner end thus j is thicker and deeper than end k
of the tooth lines f g representing the top and bottom of a tooth in
figure 243 obviously correspond to dotted lines p in figure 242 the
outer and inner ends of the teeth in the edge view are projected from
the outer and inner ends in the face view as is shown by the dotted
lines carried from tooth l in the face view to tooth l in the edge
view and it is obvious from what has been said that in drawing the
lines for the tooth in the edge view they will point to the centre e
illustration fig 245
to save work in drawing bevil gear wheels they are sometimes drawn in
section or in outline only thus in figure 244 is shown a pair of bevil
wheels shown in section and in figure 245 is a drawing of a part of an
ames lathe feed motion b c d and e are spur gears while g h and i are
bevil gears the cone surface on which the teeth lie being left blank
save at the edges where a tooth is in each case drawn in wheel d is
shown in section so as to show the means by which it may be moved out of
gear with c and e small bevil gears may also be represented by simple
line shading thus in figure 247 the two bodies a and c would readily be
understood to be a bevil gear and pinion similarly small spur wheels
may be represented by simple circles in a side view and by line shading
in an edge view thus it would answer every practical purpose if such
small wheels as in figures 246 and 247 at d f g k p h i and j
were drawn as shown the pitch circles however are usually drawn in
red ink to distinguish them

the construction of oval gearing is shown in figures 252 253 254 255
and 256 the pitchcircle is drawn by the construction for drawing an
ellipse that was given with reference to figure 81 but as that
construction is by means of arcs of circles and therefore not strictly
correct professor mccord in an article on elliptical gearing says
concerning it and the construction of oval gearing generally as
follows

but these circular arcs may be rectified and subdivided with great
facility and accuracy by a very simple process which we take from prof
rankines machinery and mill work and is illustrated in figure 252
let o b be tangent at o to the arc o d of which c is the centre draw
the chord d o bisect it in e and produce it to a making o ao e with
centre a and radius a d describe an arc cutting the tangent in b then o
b will be very nearly equal in length to the arc o d which however
should not exceed about 60 degrees if it be 60 degrees the error is
theoretically about 1900 of the length of the arc o b being so much
too short but this error varies with the fourth power of the angle
subtended by the arc so that for 30 degrees it is reduced to 116 of
that amount that is to 114400 conversely let o b be a tangent of
given length make o f14 o b then with centre f and radius f b
describe an arc cutting the circle o d g tangent to o b at o in the
point d then o d will be approximately equal to o b the error being
the same as in the other construction and following the same law
illustration fig 253
the extreme simplicity of these two constructions and the facility with
which they may be made with ordinary drawing instruments make them
exceedingly convenient and they should be more widely known than they
are their application to the present problem is shown in figure 253
which represents a quadrant of an ellipse the approximate arcs c d e
e f f a having been determined by trial and error in order to space
this off for the positions of the teeth a tangent is drawn at d upon
which is constructed the rectification of d c which is d g and also
that of d e in the opposite direction that is d h by the process just
explained then drawing the tangent at f we set off in the same manner
f i  f e and f k  f a and then measuring h l  i k we have finally
g l equal to the whole quadrant of the ellipse
illustration fig 254
let it now be required to lay out twentyfour teeth upon this ellipse
that is six in each quadrant and for symmetrys sake we will suppose
that the centre of one tooth is to be at a and that of another at c
figure 253 we therefore divide l g into six equal parts at the points
1 2 3 etc which will be the centres of the teeth upon the rectified
ellipse it is practically necessary to make the spaces a little greater
than the teeth but if the greatest attainable exactness in the
operation of the wheels is aimed at it is important to observe that
backlash in elliptical gearing has an effect quite different from that
resulting in the case of circular wheels when the pitchcurves are
circles they are always in contact and we may if we choose make the
tooth only half the breadth of the space so long as its outline is
correct when the motion of the driver is reversed the follower will
stand still until the backlash is taken up when the motion will go on
with a perfectly constant velocity ratio as before but in the case of
two elliptical wheels if the follower stand still while the driver
moves which must happen when the motion is reversed if backlash exists
the pitchcurves are thrown out of contact and although the continuity
of the motion will not be interrupted the velocity ratio will be
affected if the motion is never to be reversed the perfect law of the
velocity ratio due to the elliptical pitchcurve may be preserved by
reducing the thickness of the tooth not equally on each side as is
done in circular wheels but wholly on the side not in action but if
the machine must be capable of acting indifferently in both directions
the reduction must be made on both sides of the tooth evidently the
action will be slightly impaired for which reason the backlash should
be reduced to a minimum precisely what is the minimum is not so easy
to say as it evidently depends much upon the excellence of the tools
and the skill of the workman in many treatises on constructive
mechanism it is variously stated that the backlash should be from
onefifteenth to oneeleventh of the pitch which would seem to be an
ample allowance in reasonably good castings not intended to be finished
and quite excessive if the teeth are to be cut nor is it very obvious
that its amount should depend upon the pitch any more than upon the
precession of the equinoxes on paper at any rate we may reduce it to
zero and make the teeth and spaces equal in breadth as shown in the
figure the teeth being indicated by the double lines those upon the
portion l h are then laid off upon k i after which these divisions are
transferred to the ellipse by the second of prof rankines
constructions and we are then ready to draw the teeth
the outlines of these as of any other teeth upon pitchcurves which
roll together in the same plane depend upon the general law that they
must be such as can be marked out upon the planes of the curves as they
roll by a tracingpoint which is rigidly connected with and carried by
a third line moving in rolling contact with both the pitchcurves and
since under that condition the motion of this third line relatively to
each of the others is the same as though it rolled along each of them
separately while they remained fixed the process of constructing the
generated curves becomes comparatively simple for the describing line
we naturally select a circle which in order to fulfil the condition
must be small enough to roll within the pitch ellipse its diameter is
determined by the consideration that if it be equal to a p the radius
of the arc a f the flanks of the teeth in that region will be radial
we have therefore chosen a circle whose diameter a b is
threefourths of a p as shown so that the teeth even at the ends of
the wheels will be broader at the base than on the pitch line this
circle ought strictly to roll upon the true elliptical curve and
assuming as usual the tracingpoint upon the circumference the
generated curves would vary slightly from true epicycloids and no two
of those used in the same quadrant of the ellipse would be exactly
alike were it possible to divide the ellipse accurately there would be
no difficulty in laying out these curves but having substituted the
circular arcs we must now roll the generating circle upon these as
bases thus forming true epicycloidal teeth of which those lying upon
the same approximating arc will be exactly alike should the junction of
two of these arcs fall within the breadth of a tooth as at d evidently
both the face and the flank on one side of that tooth will be different
from those on the other side should the junction coincide with the edge
of a tooth which is very nearly the case at f then the face on that
side will be the epicycloid belonging to one of the arcs its flank a
hypocycloid belonging to the other and it is possible that either the
face or the flank on one side should be generated by the rolling of the
describing circle partly on one arc partly on the one adjacent which
upon a large scale and where the best results are aimed at may make a
sensible change in the form of the curve
the convenience of the constructions given in figure 252 is nowhere
more apparent than in the drawing of the epicycloids when as in the
case in hand the base and generating circles may be of incommensurable
diameters for which reason we have in figure 254 shown its
application in connection with the most rapid and accurate mode yet
known of describing those curves let c be the centre of the base
circle b that of the rolling one a the point of contact divide the
semicircumference of b into six equal parts at 1 2 3 etc draw the
common tangent at a upon which rectify the arc a 2 by process no 1
then by process no 2 set out an equal arc a 2 on the base circle and
stepping it off three times to the right and left bisect these spaces
thus making subdivisions on the base circle equal in length to those on
the rolling one take in succession as radii the chords a 1 a 2 a 3
etc of the describing circle and with centres 1 2 3 etc on the
base circle strike arcs either externally or internally as shown
respectively on the right and left the curve tangent to the external
arcs is the epicycloid that tangent to the internal ones the
hypocycloid forming the face and flank of a tooth for the base circle
illustration fig 255
in the diagram figure 253 we have shown a part of an ellipse whose
length is ten inches and breadth six the figure being half size in
order to give an idea of the actual appearance of the combination when
complete we show in figure 255 the pair in gear on a scale of three
inches to the foot the excessive eccentricity was selected merely for
the purpose of illustration figure 255 will serve also to call
attention to another serious circumstance which is that although the
ellipses are alike the wheels are not nor can they be made so if there
be an even number of teeth for the obvious reason that a tooth upon one
wheel must fit into a space on the other and since in the first wheel
figure 255 we chose to place a tooth at the extremity of each axis we
must in the second one place there a space instead because at one time
the major axes must coincide at another the minor axes as in figure
255 if then we use even numbers the distribution and even the forms
of the teeth are not the same in the two wheels of the pair but this
complication may be avoided by using an odd number of teeth since
placing a tooth at one extremity of the major axes a space will come at
the other
it is not however always necessary to cut teeth all round these
wheels as will be seen by an examination of figure 256 c and d being
the fixed centres of the two ellipses in contact at p now p must be on
the line c d whence considering the free foci we see that p b is
equal to p c and p a to p d and the common tangent at p makes equal
angles with c p and p a as is also with p b and p d therefore c d
being a straight line a b is also a straight line and equal to c d if
then the wheels be overhung that is fixed on the ends of the shafts
outside the bearings leaving the outer faces free the moving foci may
be connected by a rigid link a b as shown
illustration fig 256
this link will then communicate the same motion that would result from
the use of the complete elliptical wheels and we may therefore
dispense with the most of the teeth retaining only those near the
extremities of the major axes which are necessary in order to assist
and control the motion of the link at and near the deadpoints the arc
of the pitchcurves through which the teeth must extend will vary with
their eccentricity but in many cases it would not be greater than that
which in the approximation may be struck about one centre so that in
fact it would not be necessary to go through the process of rectifying
and subdividing the quarter of the ellipse at all as in this case it
can make no possible difference whether the spacing adopted for the
teeth to be cut would come out even or not if carried around the
curve by this expedient then we may save not only the trouble of
drawing but a great deal of labor in making the teeth round the whole
ellipse we might even omit the intermediate portions of the pitch
ellipses themselves but as they move in rolling contact their retention
can do no harm and in one part of the movement will be beneficial as
they will do part of the work for if when turning as shown by the
arrows we consider the wheel whose axis is d as the driver it will be
noted that its radius of contact c p is on the increase and so long
as this is the case the other wheel will be compelled to move by contact
of the pitch lines although the link be omitted and even if teeth be
cut all round the wheels this link is a comparatively inexpensive and a
useful addition to the combination especially if the eccentricity be
considerable of course the wheels shown in figure 255 might also have
been made alike by placing a tooth at one end of the major axis and a
space at the other as above suggested in regard to the variation in
the velocity ratio it will be seen by reference to figure 256 that if
d be the axis of the driver the follower will in the position there
shown move faster the ratio of the angular velocities being p  dp 
b if the driver turn uniformly the velocity of the follower will
diminish until at the end of half a revolution the velocity ratio will
be p  bp  d in the other half of the revolution these changes will
occur in a reverse order but p d  l b if then the centres b d are
given in position we know l p the major axis and in order to produce
any assumed maximum or minimum velocity ratio we have only to divide l
p into segments whose ratio is equal to that assumed value which will
give the foci of the ellipse whence the minor axis may be found and the
curve described for instance in figure 255 the velocity ratio being
nine to one at the maximum the major axis is divided into two parts of
which one is nine times as long as the other in figure 256 the ratio is
as one to three so that the major axis being divided into four parts
the distance a c between the foci is equal to two of them and the
distance of either focus from the nearest extremity of the major axis is
equal to one and from the more remote extremity is equal to three of
these parts

plotting mechanical motions
illustration fig 257
let it be required to find how much motion an eccentric will give to its
rod the distance from the centre of its bore to the centre of the
circumference which is called the throw being the distance from a to b
in figure 257 now as the eccentric is moved around by the shaft it is
evident that the axis of its motion will be the axis a of the shaft
then from a as a centre and with radius from a to c we draw the dotted
circle d and from e to f will be the amount of motion of the rod in the
direction of the arrow
this becomes obvious if we suppose a lead pencil to be placed against
the eccentric at e and suppose the eccentric to make half a revolution
whereupon the pencil will be pushed out to f if now we measure the
distance from e to f we shall find it is just twice that from a to b
we may find the amount of motion however in another way as by
striking the dotted half circle g showing the path of motion of b the
diameter of this path of motion being the amount of lateral motion given
to the rod
illustration fig 258
in figure 258 is a two arm lever fast upon the same axis or shaft and
it is required to find how much a given amount of motion of the long arm
will move the short one suppose the distance the long arm moves is to
a then draw the line b from a to the axis of the shaft and the line c
the centre line of the long arm from the axis of the shaft as a centre
draw the circle d passing through the eye or centre e of the short arm
take the radius from f to g and from e as a centre mark it on d as at
h and h is where e will be when the long arm moves to a we have here
simply decreased the motion in the same proportion as one arm is shorter
than the other the principle involved is to take the motion of both
arms at an equal distance from their axis of motion which is the axis
of the shaft s
illustration fig 259
in figure 259 we have a case in which the end of a lever acts directly
upon a shoe now let it be required to find how much a given motion of
the lever will cause the shoe to slide along the line x the point h
is here found precisely as before and from it as a centre the dotted
circle equal in diameter to the small circle at e is drawn from the
perimeter of the dotted circle a dotted line is carried up and another
is carried up from the face of the shoe the distance k between these
dotted lines is the amount of motion of the shoe
in figure 260 we have the same conditions as in figure 259 but the
short arm has a roller acting against a larger roller r the point h is
found as before the amount of motion of r is the distance of k from j
hence we may transfer this distance from the centre of r producing the
point p from which the new position may be marked by a dotted circle as
shown
illustration fig 260
in figure 261 a link is introduced in place of the roller and it is
required to find the amount of motion of rod r the point h is found as
before and then the length from centre to centre of link l is found
and with this radius and from h as a centre the arc p is drawn and
where p intersects the centre line j of r is the new position for the
eye or centre q of r
illustration fig 261
in figure 262 we have a case of a similar lever actuating a plunger in a
vertical line it being required to find how much a given amount of
motion of the long arm will actuate the plunger suppose the long arm to
move to a then draw the lines b c and the circle d take the radius or
distance f g and from e mark on d the arc h mark the centre line j of
the rod now take the length from e to i of the link and from h as a
centre mark arc k and at the intersection of k with j is where the eye
i will be when the long arm has moved to a
illustration fig 262
in figure 263 are two levers upon their axles or shafts s and s arm a
is connected by a link to arm b and arm c is connected direct to a rod
r it is required to find the position of centre g of the rod eye when d
is in position e and when it is also in position f now the points e
and f are of course on an arc struck from the axis s and it is
obvious that in whatever position the centre h may be it will be
somewhere on the arc i i which is struck from the centre s now
suppose that d moves to e and if we take the radius d h and from e
mark it upon the arc i as at v then h will obviously be the new
position of h to find the new position of g we first strike the arc j
j because in every position of g it will be somewhere on the arc j j
to find where that will be when h is at v take the radius h g and
from v as a centre mark it on j j as at k which is the position of g
when d is at e and h is at v for the positions when d is at f we repeat
the process taking the radius d h and from f marking p and with the
radius h g and from p as a centre marking q then p is the new
position for h and q is that for g
illustration fig 263
in figure 264 a lever arm a and cam c are in one piece on a shaft s is
a shoe sliding on the line x and held against the cam face by the rod
r it is required to find the position of the face of the shoe against
the cam when the end of the arm is at d
draw line e from d to the axis of the shaft and line f from the shaft
axis as a centre draw circle w draw line j parallel to x take the
radius g h and from k as a centre mark point p on w draw line q from
the shaft axis through p and mark point t from the shaft axis as a
centre draw from t an arc cutting j at v and v is the point where the
face of the shoe and the face of the cam will touch when the arm stands
at d
illustration fig 264
let it be required to find the amount of motion imparted in a straight
line to a rod attached to an eccentric strap and the following
construction may be used in figure 265 let a represent the centre of
the shaft and therefore the axis about which the eccentric revolves
let b represent the centre of the eccentric and let it be required to
find in what position on the line of motion x the centre c of the rod
eye will be when the centre b of the eccentric has moved to e now since
a is the axis the centre b of the eccentric must rotate about it as
denoted by the circle d and all that is necessary to find the position
of c for any position of eccentric is to mark the position of b on
circle d as at e and from that position as from e as a centre and
with the length of the rod as a radius mark the new position of c on
the line x of its motion with the centre of the eccentric at b the
line q representing the faces of the straps will stand at a right
angle to the line of motion and the length of the rod is from b to c
when the eccentric centre moves to e the centre line of the rod will be
moved to position p the line q will have assumed position r and point
c will have moved from its position in the drawing to g on line x if
the eccentric centre be supposed to move on to f the point c will move
to h the radii b c e g and f h all being equal in length now when
the eccentric centre is at e it will have moved onequarter of a
revolution and yet the point c will only have moved to g which is not
central between c and h as is denoted by the dotted half circle i
illustration fig 265
on the other hand while the eccentric centre is moving from e to f
which is but onequarter of a revolution the rod end will move from g
to h this occurs because the rod not only moves endwise but the end
connected to the eccentric strap moves towards and away from the line
x this is shown in the figure the rod centre line being marked in
full line from b to x and when b has moved to e the rod centre line
is marked by dotted line e so that it has moved away from the line of
motion b x in figure 266 the eccentric centre is shown to stand at an
angle of 45 degrees from line q which is at a right angle to the line
of motion x x and the position of the rod end is shown at c j and h
representing the extremes of motion and g the centre of the motion
illustration fig 266
if now we suppose the eccentric centre to stand at t which is also an
angle of 45 degrees to q then the rod end will stand at k which is
further away from g than c is hence we find that on account of the
movement of the rod out of the straight end motion the motion of the
rod end becomes irregular in proportion to that of the eccentric whose
action in moving the eye c of the rod in a straight line is increased
by the rod while it is moving through the half rotation denoted by v
in figure and diminished during the other half rotation
in many cases as for example on the river steamboats in the western
and southern states cams are employed instead of eccentrics and the
principles involved in drawing or marking out such cams are given in the
following remarks which contain the substance of a paper read by lewis
johnson before the american society of mechanical engineers in figure
267 is a side view of a pair of cams one c being a full stroke cam
for operating the valve that admits steam to the engine cylinder and
the other d being a cam to cut off the steam supply at the required
point in the engine stroke the positions of these cams with relation to
the position of the crankpin need not be commented upon here more than
to remark that obviously the cam c must operate to open the steam inlet
valve in advance of cam d which operates to close it and cause the
steam to act expansively in the cylinder and that the angle of the
throw line of the cutoff valve d to the other cam or to the crankpin
varies according as it is required to cut off the steam either earlier
or later in the stroke
illustration fig 267
the cam yoke is composed of two halves y and y bolted together by
bolts b which have a collar at one end and two nuts at the other end
the inner nuts n n enabling the letting together of the two halves
of the yoke to take up the wear it is obvious that as the shaft
revolves and carries the cam with it it will by reason of its shape
move the yoke back and forth thus in the position of the parts shown
in figure 267 the direction of rotation being denoted by the arrow cam
c will as it rotates move the yoke to the left and this motion will
occur from the time corner a of the cam meets the face of y until
corner b has passed the centre line d now since that part of the
circumference lying between points a and b of the cam is an arc of a
circle of which the axis of the shaft is the centre the yoke will
remain at rest until such time as b has passed line d and corner a
meets the jaw y of the yoke hence the period of rest is determined by
the amount of circumference that is made concentric to the shaft or in
other words is determined by the distance between a and b
the object of using a cam instead of an eccentric is to enable the
opening of the valves abruptly at the beginning of the piston stroke
maintaining a uniform steamport opening during nearly the entire length
of stroke and as abruptly closing the valves at the termination of the
stroke
figure 268 is a top view of the mechanism in figure 267 and figure 269
shows an end view of the yoke at b in figure 268 is shown a guide
through which the yokestem passes so as to be guided to move in a
straight line there being a guide of this kind on each side of the
yoke
illustration fig 268
the two cams are bolted to a collar that is secured to the crankshaft
and are made in halves as shown in the figures and also in figures 270
and 271 which represent cams removed from the other mechanism to
enable a certain amount of adjustment of the cams upon the collar the
bolts which hold them to the collar fit closely in the holes in the
collar but the cams are provided with oblong bolt holes as shown so
that the position of either cam either with relation to the other cam
or with relation to the crankpin can be adjusted to the extent
permitted by the length of the oblong holes
illustration fig 269
the crank is assumed in the figures to be on its dead centre nearest to
the engine cylinder and to revolve in the direction of the arrows the
cams are so arranged that their plain unflanged surfaces bolt against
the collar
the method of drawing or marking out a full stroke cam such as c in
figure 267 is illustrated in figure 272 in which the dimensions are
assumed to be as follows
diameter of crank shaft 712 inches travel of cam 3 inches width of
yoke 18 inches
illustration fig 270
the circumference of the cam is composed of four curved lines p p k
1 and k 2 the position of the centre of the crank shaft in this
irregularly curved body is at x the arcs k 1 and k 2 differ in radius
but are drawn from the same point x and hence are concentric with the
crank shaft
the arcs p p are of like radius but are drawn from the opposite
points s s shown at the intersection of the arcs p p with the
arc k 1 thus arcs p p are eccentric to the crank shaft
illustration fig 271
illustration fig 272
illustration fig 273
to draw the cam place one point of the dividers at x which is the
centre of the crank shaft and draw the circle e equal to width of yoke
18 inches through this centre x draw the two right lines a and b on
the line b at the intersection of the curved line e draw the two
vertical lines a 1 a 1 with a radius of 1012 inches and with one
point of the dividers at x draw the arc k 1 with a radius of 712
inches and one point of the dividers at x draw the arc k 2 with a
radius of 18 inches and one point of the dividers at the intersection
of the arc e with the vertical line a 1 at s draw the arc p opposite
to s and let it merge or lose itself in the curved line k 2 draw the
other curved line p from the other point s and we have a full stroke
cam of the dimensions required and which is represented in figure 273
removed from the lines used in constructing it
illustration fig 274
the engravings from and including figure 274 illustrate the lines
embracing cutoff cams of varying limits of cutoff but all of like
travel and dimensions which are the same as those given for the full
stroke cam in figure 272
in drawing cutoff cams the stroke of the engine plays a part in
determining their conformation and in the examples shown this is
assumed to be 4 feet figure 274 illustrates the manner of finding
essential points in drawing or marking out cutoff cams with x as a
centre and a radius of 2 feet draw the circle e 1 showing the path of
the crankpin in making a revolution this circle has a diameter of 4
feet equal to the stroke of the engine draw the horizontal line b
passing through the centre of circle e 1 within the limits of circle e
1 subdivide line b into eight equal parts as at 1 2 3 4 etc draw
the vertical lines 1 2 3 4 etc until they each intersect the
circle e 1
illustration fig 275
with x as a centre draw the circle e having a diameter of 18 inches
equal to the space in the yoke embracing the cam
from the centre x draw the series of radial lines through the points of
intersection of the vertical lines 1 2 3 4 etc from the circle e
1 and terminating at x we will now proceed to utilize the scale
afforded by figure 274 in laying off the cutoff cam shown in figure
276 of half stroke limit
illustration fig 276
with x as a centre draw the circle e figure 275 having a diameter of
18 inches bisect this circle with the straight lines a and b which
bear the same relation to their enclosing circle that the lines a b
do to the circle e in figure 274
illustration fig 277
it will be observed in figure 274 that the vertical line a is at the
top half also no 4 representing 48 or half of the stroke with a
radius of 18 inches and one point of the dividers placed at v which is
at the intersection of the circle e with the horizontal line b in figure
275 draw the arc p with the same radius and with one compass point
rested at v draw the arc p then two arcs p and p intersecting at
the point s
with the same radius and one point of the compasses at s draw the arc h
h the arcs k 1 and k 2 are drawn from the centre x with a radius of
1012 for k 1 and 712 inches for k 2 and only serve in a half
stroke cam to intersect the curved lines already drawn as shown in
figure 275 in practice the sharp corner at s would be objectionable
owing to rapid wear at this point and hence a modification of the
dimensions for this half stroke cam would be required to obtain a larger
wearing surface at the point s but the cam of this limit 12 stroke
is correctly drawn by the process described with reference to figure
275 the outline of the cam so constructed being shown in figure 276
illustration fig 278
in figure 278 is shown a cam designed to cut off the steam at
fiveeighths of the piston stroke the construction lines being given
in figure 277 for which draw circle e and straight lines a and b as in
the preceding example by reference to figure 274 it will be observed
that the diagonal line drawn through circle e at 5 is drawn from the
straight line marked 5 which intersects circle e 1 and as this
straight line 5 represents fiveeighths of the stroke laid off on line
b it determines the limit of cutoff on the fiveeighths cam in figure
277
illustration fig 279
turning then to figure 274 take on circle e the radius from radial line
4 to radial line 5 and mark it in figure 277 from the vertical line
producing v
now with a radius of 18 inches and one point of the dividers fixed at
point v forming the intersection of the circle e with the horizontal
line b draw the arc p with the same radius and one point of the
dividers fixed at point v draw the opposite arc p with a radius of
1012 inches from the centre x draw the arc k 1 intersecting lines p
p at s s with a radius of 712 inches draw the curved line k 2
opposite to curved line k 1 now with a radius of 18 inches and one
point of the dividers fixed alternately at s s draw the arcs h h from
their intersection with the circle e until they merge into the curved
line k 2 these curved lines embrace a cutoff cam of fiveeighths
limit shown complete in figure 278
illustration fig 280
from the instructions already given it should be easy to understand that
the threefourths and seveneighths cams shown in figures 279 280 281
and 282 are drawn by taking the points of their cutoff from the same
scale shown in figure 274 at the diagonal points 6 and 7 intersecting
circle e in that figure and cutoff cams of intermediate limit of
cutoff can be drawn by further subdividing the stroke line b in figure
274 into the required limits
illustration fig 281
cutoff cams of any limit are necessarily imperfect in their operations
as to uniformity of cutoff from opposite ends of the slides not from
any defect in the rule for laying them off but from the wellknown fact
of the crank pin travelling a greater distance while driven by the
piston from the centre of the cylinder through its curved path from the
cylinder over its centre and back to the centre of the cylinder than
in accomplishing the remaining distance of its path in making a complete
revolution and although the subdivisions of eighths of the stroke
line b in figure 274 does not truly represent a like division of the
piston stroke owing to deviation caused by inclination of the
connecting rod in traversing from the centres to half stroke still it
will be found that laying off a cutoff cam by this rule is more nearly
correct than if the divisions on stroke line b were made to correspond
exactly with a subdivision of piston stroke into eighths
illustration fig 282
the cutoff in cams laid off by the rules herein described is greater in
travelling from one side of the slides than in travelling from the
opposite end one cutoff being more than the actual cutoff of piston
stroke and the other less and in practical use owing to play or lost
motion in the connections from cam to valve the actual cutoff is less
than the theoretical hence cutoff cams are usually laid off to
compensate for lost motion that is laid off with more limit for
instance a fiveeighths cam would be laid off to cutoff at
elevensixteenths instead of fiveeighths
illustration fig 283
figure 283 represents the motion a crank c imparts to a connecting
rod represented by the thick line r whose end b is supposed to be
guided to move in a straight line the circle h represents the path of
the crankpin and dots 1 2 3 etc are 24 different crankpin
positions equidistant on the circle of crankpin revolution suppose the
crankpin to have moved to position 1 and with the compasses set to the
length of the rod r we set one point on the centre of position 1 and
mark on the line of motion m the line a which will be the position
rod end b will have moved to suppose next that the crankpin has moved
into position 2 and with the compass point on the centre of 2 we mark
line 2 showing that while the crankpin moved from 1 to 2 the rod end
moved from a to b by continuing this process we are enabled to
discern the motion for the whole of the stroke the backward stroke will
be the same for corresponding crankpin positions for both strokes
thus when the rod end is at 7 the crankpin may be at 7 or at 17 this
fact enables us to find the positions for the positions later than 6 on
the other side of the circle as at 17 16 15 etc which keeps the
engraving clear

in figure 284 a pinion p drives a gearwheel d on which there is a
pin driving the sliding die a in the link l which is pivoted at c and
connected at its upper end to a rod r which is connected to a bolt b

the same parts as those in figure 284 we divide the circle h of pin
motion into 24 equidistant parts marked by dots and through these we
draw lines radiating from centre c and cutting arc h obtaining on the
arc h the various positions for end z of rod r these positions being
marked respectively 1 2 3 4 etc up to 24 with a pair of
compasses set to the length of rod r from 1 on h as a centre we mark
on the line of motion of the slide line a which shows where the

the compasses at 17 mark a line beneath the line m of motion pursuing
the same course for all the other pin motions as 18 19 etc until
the pin arrives again at position 24 and the link at o and has made a
full revolution and we shall have the motion of the forward stroke
above and that of the backward one below the line of motion of the
slide and may compare the two

employed in many machines f represents a frame supporting a fixed
journal b on which revolves a gearwheel g operated by a pinion p
at a is an arm having journal bearing in b at c this arm is driven by a
pin d fast in the gear g hence as the gear revolves pin d moves a

pin x on which is pivoted the rod r the motion of end n of the rod r
being in a straight line m it is required to find the positions of n
during twentyfour periods in one revolution of g in figure 288 let h
represent the path of motion of the driving pin d about the centre of

corresponding to the centres of b and c respectively in figure 287 let
the line m correspond to the line of motion m in figure 286 now since
it is the pin d figure 287 that drives and since its speed of
revolution is uniform we divide its circle of motion h into
twentyfour equal divisions and by drawing lines radiating from centre
c and passing through the lines of division on h we get on circle h
twentyfour positions for the pin x in figure 286 then setting the
compasses to the length of the rod r figure 286 we mark from
position 1 on circle h as a centre line a from position 2 on h we
mark line b and so on for the whole twentyfour positions on circle

the motion during the backward stroke suppose now that the mechanism
remaining precisely the same as before the line m of motion be in a
line with the centres c b instead of at a right angle to it as it is
in figure 286 and the motion under this new condition will be as in
figure 289 the process for finding the amount of motion along m from
the motion around h being precisely as before
illustration fig 290
in figure 290 is shown a cutterhead for a wood moulding machine and it
is required to find what shape the cutting edge of the cutter must be
to form a moulding such as is shown in the end view of the moulding in
the figure now the line a a being at a right angle to the line of
motion of the moulding as it is passed beneath the revolving cutter or
what is the same thing at a right angle to the face of the table on
which the moulding is moved it is obvious that the highest point c of
the moulding will be cut to shape by the point c of the cutter and that
since the line of motion of the end of the cutter is the arc d the
lowest part of the cutter action upon the moulding will be at point e
it will also be obvious that as the cutter edge passes at each point
its length across the line a a it forms the moulding to shape while
all the cutting action that occurs on either side of that line is
serving simply to remove material all that we have to consider
therefore is the action on line a a
it may be observed also that the highest point c of the cutter edge must
not be less than 14 inch from the corner of the cutter head which
gives room for the nut n that holds the cutter to the head to pass
over the top of the moulding in a 212 inch head in proportion as the
heads are made larger however less clearance is necessary for the nut
as is shown in figure 291 the cutter edge extending to c and therefore
nearly up to the corner of the head its path of motion at c is shown by
dotted arc b which it will be observed amply clears the nut n in
practice however point c is not in any size of cutterhead placed
nearer than 14 inch from corner x of the cutterhead
to find the length of the cutter edge necessary to produce a given depth
of moulding we may draw a circle i figure 292 equal in diameter to
the size of the cutter head to be used and line a a the highest point
of cutting edge being at e and the lowest at g then circles d and
f represent the line of motion of these two points and if we mark the
cutter in the necessary length of cutting edge on the cutter is
obviously from a to b
illustration fig 291
illustration fig 292
now the necessary depth of cutter edge being found for any given
moulding or part of a moulding the curves for the edge may be found as
follows suppose the moulding is to be half round as in the end view in
figure 290 the width of the cutter must of course equal the width of
the moulding and the length or depth of cutting edge required may be
found from the construction shown in figure 292 hence all that remains
is to find the curve for the cutting edge in figure 293 let a a
represent the centre of the cutter width its sides being f f and its
end b b from centre c draw circle d the upper half of which will serve
to represent the moulding mark on a the length or depth the cutting
edge requires to be ascertaining the same from the construction shown
in figure 292 and mark it as from c to k then draw line e e passing
through point k draw line g standing at the same angle to a a as the
face h b figure 292 of the cutter does to the line a a and draw
line h h parallel to g from any point on g as at i with radius j
draw a quarter of a circle as k mark off this quarter circle into
equal points of division as by 1 2 3 etc and from these points of
division draw lines as a b c etc and from these lines draw
horizontal lines d e f etc now divide the lower half of circle
d into twice as many equal divisions as quarter circle k is divided
into and from these points of division draw perpendiculars g h
i etc and where these perpendiculars cross the horizontal lines as
d will be points through which the curve may be drawn three of such
points being marked by dots at p q r if the student will after
having drawn the curve by this construction draw it by the construction
that was explained in connection with figure 79 he will find the two
methods give so nearly identical curves that the latter and more simple
method may be used without sensible error
illustration fig 293
illustration fig 294
when the curves of the moulding are not arcs of circles they may be
marked as follows
take the drawing of the moulding and divide each member or step of it by
equidistant lines as a b c d e f g in figure 294
above the moulding draw lines representing the cutter and having found
the depth of cutting edge for each member by the construction shown in
figure 292 finding a separate line a b for each member of the
moulding transfer the depths so found to the face of the cutter divide
the depth of each member of the cutter into as many equal divisions as
the corresponding member of the moulding is divided into as by lines
h i j k l m n then draw vertical lines as o
p q r etc and where these lines meet the respective lines
h i j etc are points in the curve such points being marked
on the cutter by dots

examples in lineshading and drawings for lineshaded engravings
although in workshop drawings lineshading is rarely employed yet
where a design rather than the particular details of construction is to
be shown lineshading is a valuable accessory figure 295 for example
is intended to show an arrangement of idle pulleys to guide belts from
one pulley to another the principle being that so long as the belt
passes to a pulley moving in line with the line of rotation of the
pulley the belt will run correctly although it may leave the pulley at
considerable angle when a belt envelops two pulleys that are at a right
angle to each other two guide pulleys are needed in order that the belt
may in passing to each pulley move in the same plane as the pulley
rotates in and the belt is in this case given what is termed a quarter
twist
it will be observed that by the lineshading even the twist of the belt
is much more clearly shown than it would be if left unshaded
an excellent example of shading is given in figure 296 which is
extracted from the american machinist and represents a cutting tool
for a planing machine the figure is from a wood engraving but the
effect may be produced by lines the black parts being considered as
simply broad black lines
illustration fig 295
the drawings from which engravings are made are drawn to conform to the
process by which the engraving is to be produced drawings that are
shaded by plain lines may be engraved by three methods first the
drawing may be photoengraved in which process the drawing is
photographed on the metal and every line appears in the engraving
precisely as it appears in the drawing
illustration fig 296
for this kind of engraving the drawing may be made of any convenient
size that is larger than the size of engraving to be produced the
reduction of size being produced in the photographing process drawings
for photoengraving require to have the lines jet black and it is to
be remembered that if red centrelines are marked on the drawing they
will be produced as ordinary black lines in the engraving
the shading on a drawing to be photoengraved must be produced by lines
and not by tints for tints whether of black or of colors will not
photoengrave properly
it is generally preferred to make the drawing for a photoengraving
larger than the engraving that is to be made from it a good proportion
being to make the drawing twice the length the engraving is to be this
serves to reduce the magnitude of any roughness in the lines of the
drawing and therefore to make the engraving better than the drawing
the thickness of the lines in the drawing should be made to suit the
amount of reduction to be made because the lines are reduced in
thickness in the same proportion as the engraving is reduced from the
drawing thus the lines on an engraving reduced to onehalf the
dimensions of the drawing would be onehalf as thick as the lines on the
drawing
drawings for photoengraving should be made on smoothfaced paper as
for example on bristol board and to make the lines clean and clear
the drawing instruments should be in the best of condition and the
paper or bristol board quite dry the india rubber should be used as
little as possible on drawings to be photoengraved because if used
before the lines are inked in it roughens the surface of the paper and
the inking lines will be less smooth and even at their edges and for
this reason it is better not to rub out any lines until all the lines
have been inked in if used to excess after the lines have been inked in
it serves to reduce the blackness of the lines and may so pale them
that they will not properly photoengrave
to make a drawing for an engraver in wood it would be drawn directly on
the face of the boxwood block on which it is to be engraved the
surface of the block is first whitened by a white water color as
chinese white if the drawing that is to be used as a copy is on
sufficiently thin paper its outline may be traced over by pencil lines
and the copy may then be laid face down on the wood block and its edges
held to the block by wax the pencilled lines being face to the block
the outline may then be again traced over with a pencil or pointed
instrument causing the imprint of the lead pencil lines to be left on
the whitened surface of the block if the copy is on paper too thick to
be thus employed a tracing may be made and used as above it being
borne in mind that the tracing must be laid with the pencilled lines on
the block because what is the right hand of the drawing on the block is
the left hand in the print it gives the shading on wood blocks is given
by tints of india ink aided by pencilled lines or of course pencilled
lines only may for less artistic work be used another method is to
photograph the drawing direct upon the surface of the wood block it is
unnecessary however to enter into this part of the subject
the third method of producing an engraving from a drawing is by means of
what is known as the wax process drawings for this process should be
made on thin paper for the following reasons the process consists
briefly stated in coating a copper plate with a layer of wax about 132
inch deep and in drawing upon the wax the lines to compose the
engraving which lines are produced by means of tools that remove the
wax down to the surface of the copper
the plate and wax are then placed in a battery and a deposit of copper
fills in the lines and surface of the wax thus forming the engraving
now if the drawing is made on thin paper the engraver coats the surface
of the drawing with a dry red pigment and with a pointed instrument
traces over the lines of the drawing which causes them to leave a red
imprint on the surface of the wax and after the drawing is removed the
engraver cuts these imprinted lines in the wax if the drawing is on
thick paper this method of transferring the drawing to the wax cannot
be used and the engraver may take a tracing from the drawing and
transfer from the tracing to the wax it is obvious also that for wax
engravings the drawing should be made of the same size that the
engraving is required to be or otherwise the tracing process described
cannot be used figure 297 represents an engraving made by the wax
process from a print from a wood engraving and it is obvious that since
all the lines drawn on the wax sink down to the surface of the copper
plate the shading is virtually composed of lines the black surfaces
being where the lines have been sufficiently close together and broad to
remove all the wax enclosed within those surfaces
illustration fig 297
illustration fig 298
the wax process is however more suitable for engravings in plain
outline only and is especially excellent when the parts are small and
the lines fall close together as for example in figures 298 and 299
which are engravings of a boiler drilling machine and were produced
for the american machinist by tracing over a wood engraving from
london engineering in the manner already described the fineness and
cleanness of the lines in the wax process is here well illustrated the
disposition of the parts being easily seen from the engraving and
easily followed in connection with the following description
the machine consists of two horizontal bedplates a 1 and a 2 made with
v slides on top and placed at right angles to each other upon each
of the bedplates is fitted a vertical arm b 1 and b 2 each of which
carries two saddles c 1 and c 2 these being each adjustable vertically
on its respective arm by means of rack and pinion and hand wheels d 1
and d 2 the saddles are balanced so that the least possible exertion is
sufficient to adjust them the vertical arms b 1 and b 2 are cast each
with a round foot by which the arms are attached to the square boxes e 1
and e 2 which are fitted to the v slides on the horizontal beds a 1
and a 2 and are adjustable thereon by means of screw and ratchet motion
f 1 and f 2 each of the square boxes has cast on it a small arm g 1 and
g 2 carrying studs upon which run pinions gearing into the circular
racks at the foot of the vertical arms the square boxes have each a
circular groove turned in the top to receive the bolts by which the
vertical arms are connected to them and thus the vertical arms and
with them the drill spindles n 1 and n 2 are adjustable radially with
the boilerthe adjustment being effected by means of the pinions and
circular racks the pinions are arranged so that they can be worked with
the same screw key that is used for the bolts in the circular grooves
the shell to be drilled is placed upon the circular table h which is
carried by suitable framework adjustable by means of screw on a v
slide i placed at an angle of 45 with the horizontal bedplates by
this arrangement when the table is moved along i it will approach to
or recede from all the drills equally j 1 and j 2 are girders forming
additional bearings for the framework of the table the bedplates and
slides for the table are bolted and braced together making the whole
machine very firm and rigid power is applied to the machine through the
cones k 1 and k 2 working the horizontal and vertical shafts l 1 and l
2 etc on the vertical shafts are fitted coarse pitch worms sliding on
feather keys and carried with the saddles c 1 and c 2 etc the worms
gearing with the worm wheels m 1 and m 2 are fitted on the sleeves of
the steel spindles n 1 and n 2 the spindles are fitted with selfacting
motions o 1 and o 2 which are easily thrown in and out of gear
the machine is also used for turning the edge of the flanges which some
makers prefer to have on the end plates of marine boilers the plates
are very readily fixed to the circular table h and the edge of the
flange trued up much quicker than by the ordinary means of chipping
when the machine is used for this purpose the cross beam p which is
removable is fastened to the two upright brackets r 1 and r 2 the
cross beam is cast with v slides at one side for a little more than
half its length from one end and on the opposite side for the same
length but from the opposite end the v slides are each fitted with a
tool box s 1 and s 2 having a screw adjustment for setting the tool to
the depth of cut and adjustable on the v slides of the cross beam to
the diameter of the plate to be turned this arrangement of the machine
is also used for cutting out the furnace mouths in the boiler ends the
plate is fastened to the circular table the centre of the hole to be
cut out being placed over the centre of table one or both of the tool
boxes may be used there is sufficient space between the upright
brackets r 1 and r 2 to allow that section of a boiler end which
contains the furnace mouths to revolve while the holes are being cut
out the plate belonging to the end of a boiler of the largest diameter
that the machine will take in for drilling the holes cut out will be
from 2 feet 3 inches in diameter and upwards power for using the
turntable is applied through the cone t the bevel wheels worms worm
wheels and pinions for driving the tables are of cast steel which is
necessary for the rough work of turning the flanges
illustration fig 299 page 275
as to the practical results of using the machine the drills are driven
at a speed of 340 feet per minute at the cutting edges a jet of
soapsuds plays on each drill from an orifice 132 in in diameter and
at a pressure of 60 lbs per square inch a joint composed of two 1inch
plates and having holes 1 and oneeighth in in diameter can be
drilled in about 212 minutes and allowing about half a minute for
adjusting the drill each drill will do about 20 holes per hour the
machine is designed to stand any amount of work that the drills will
bear the time required for putting on the end of a boiler and turning
the flange thereon say 14 feet diameter is about 212 hours
much however depends on the state of the flanges as sometimes
they are very rough while at others very little is necessary to true
them up the time required for putting on the plate containing the
furnace mouths and cutting out three holes 2 feet 6 in in diameter the
plate being 1 and oneeighth in thick is three hours of course if
several boilers of one size are being made at the same time the holes
in two or more of these plates can be cut out at once the machine is of
such design that it can be placed with one of the horizontal bedplates
say a 1 parallel and close up to a wall of the boiler shop and when
the turning apparatus is being used the vertical arm b 2 can be
swiveled half way round on its square box e 2 and used for drilling and
tapping the stay holes in marine boiler ends after they are put
together of course sufficient room must be left between bedplate a 2
and the wall of boiler shop parallel with it to allow for reception of
the boiler to be operated upon
it would obviously be quite difficult to draw such drawings as in
figures 298 and 299 on thin paper so as to enable the drawing to be
traced on the wax direct by the process before described unless indeed
the draftsman had considerable experience in fine work hence it is not
uncommon to make the drawing large and on ordinary drawing paper the
engraver then has the drawing photographed on the surface of the wax
and works to the photograph the letters of reference in wax engravings
are put in by impressing type in the wax and in this connection it may
be remarked that the letters i and o should not be used on drawings to
be engraved by the wax process unless they are situated outside the
outlines of the drawing because the i looks so much like part of a
dotted line that it is often indistinguishable therefrom while the o
looks like a circle or an ellipse
chapter xiv
shading and coloring drawings
the shading or coloring of drawings by tints is more employed in large
drawings than in small ones and in europe than in the united states
while on the other hand tinting by means of lineshading is more
employed in the united states than in europe and more on small drawings
than on large ones
many draftsmen adopt the plan of coloring the journals of shafts etc
with a light tint giving them the deepest tint at the circumference to
give them a cylindrical appearance this makes the drawing much clearer
and takes but little time to do and is especially advantageous where
the parts are small or on a small scale so that the lines are
comparatively close together
for simple shading purposes black tints of various degrees of darkness
may be employed but it is usual to tint brass work with yellow cast
iron with india ink wrought iron with prussian blue steel with as
light purple tint produced by mixing india ink prussian blue and a
tinge of crimson lake copper is tinted red on plane surfaces an even
tint of color is laid but if the surfaces are cylindrical they are
usually colored deeper at and near the circumference and are tinted
over the colors with light tints of india ink to show their cylindrical
form
if a drawing is to be colored or shaded with india ink the paper should
be glued all around its edges to the drawing board and then dampened
evenly all over with a sponge which will cause the paper to shrink and
lay close to the surface of the drawing board if in applying a color
or a tint the color dries before the whole surface is colored the
color will not be of an equal shade hence it is necessary before
applying the color to dampen the surface if it is a large one so that
the color at one part shall not get dry before there has been time to go
over the whole surface a more even depth of color is attained by the
application of several coats of a light tint than with one coat giving
the full depth of color but if the paper is not allowed to dry
sufficiently between the coats or if it has been made too wet previous
to the application of the colors it will run in places leaving other
hollows into which the color will flow making darkercolored spots to
avoid this the paper may be dried somewhat by the application of clean
blotting paper
to maintain an even shade of color it is necessary to slightly stir up
the color each time the brush is dipped into the color saucer or
palette especially when the coloring is composed of mixed colors
because the coloring matter is apt to separate from the water and sink
to the bottom
so also in mixing colors it is best to apply the end of the color to
the surface of the palette and not to apply the brush direct to the cake
of color because the color is more completely mixed by contact with
the palette than it can be by the brush which may retain a speck of
color that will unless washed out make a streak upon the drawing
to graduate the depth of tint for a cylindrical surface it is best to
mix several as say three depths or degrees of tint and to first use
the darkest applying it in the direction in which the piece is to be
shaded darkest the width this dark application should be is obviously
determined by the diameter of the piece the next operation is to
lighten or draw the part line or streak thus dark colored causing it
to get paler and paler as it approaches the axial line of the piece or
cylinder this lightening is accomplished as follows the dark streak is
applied along such a length of the piece that it will not dry before
there has been time to draw it out or lighten it on the side towards the
axis a separate brush may then be wetted and drawn along the edge of
the dark streak in short strokes causing the color to run outwards and
become lighter as it approaches the axis it will be found that during
this process the brush will occasionally require washing in water
because from continuous contact with the dark streak the tint it
contains will darken when the first coat has been laid and spread or
drawn out from end to end of the piece the process may be repeated two
or three times the most even results being obtained by making the first
dark streak not too dark and going over the drawing several times but
allowing the paper to get very nearly dry between each coat in small
cylindrical bodies as say 14 inch in diameter the darkest line of
shadow may be located at the lines representing the diameter of the
piece but in pieces of larger diameter the darkest line may be located
at a short distance from the line that denotes the diameter or perimeter
on the shadow or righthand side of the piece as is shown in many of
the engravings that follow it is obvious that if a drawing is to have
dimensions marked on it the coloring or tinting should not be deep
enough to make it difficult to see the dimension figures
the size of the brush to be used depends of course upon the size of
the piece to be shaded or colored and it is best to keep one brush for
the dark tint and to never let the brush dry with the tint in it as
this makes it harsh in a good brush the hairs are fine lie close
together when moistened are smooth and yet sufficiently stiff or
elastic to bend back slightly when the pressure is removed if when
under pressure and nearly dry the hairs will separate or the brush has
no elasticity in it good results cannot be obtained all brushes should
be well dried after use
the light in shading is supposed to come in at the lefthand corner of
the drawing as was explained with reference to the shade line
excellent examples to copy and shade with the brush are given as
follows
figure 300 represents a medart pulley constructed by the hartford steam
engineering company the arms and hub are cast in one piece and the rim
is a wrought iron band riveted to the arms whose ends are turned or
ground true with the hub bore the figure is obviously a wood engraving
but it presents the varying degrees of shade or shadow with sufficient
accuracy to form a good example to copy and brush shade with india ink
figure 301 represents a similar pulley with a double set of arms
forming an excellent example in perspective drawing as well as for
brushshading
illustration fig 300
in brushshading as with lineshading the difficulties increase with an
increase in the size of the piece and the learner will find that after
he has succeeded tolerably well in shading these small pulleys it will
be quite difficult but excellent practice to shade the large pulley in
figure 302
one of the principal considerations is to not let the color dry at the
edges in one part while continuing the shading in another part of the
same surface hence it is best to begin at the edge or outline of the
drawing and carry the work forward as quickly as possible occasionally
slightly wetting with water edges that require to be left while the
shading is proceeding in another direction
illustration fig 301
when it is required to show by the shading that the surfaces are highly
polished the lighter parts of the shading are made to contain what may
be termed splashes of lighter and darker shadow as in figure 303 which
represents an oil cup having a brass casing enclosing a glass cylinder
which appears through the openings in the brass shell
figure 304 represents an iron planing machine whose lineshading is so
evenly effected that it affords an excellent example of shading its
parts are similar to those shown in the iron planer in figure 297 save
that it carries two sliding heads so as to enable the use
simultaneously of two cutting tools
illustration fig 304 page 282
illustration fig 302
a superior example in shading is shown in figures 305 and 306 which
represent a plan and a sectional view of the steamcylinder of a blakes
patent directacting steampump the construction of the parts is as
follows a is the steampiston h 1 and h are the cylinder
steampassages m is the cylinder exhaust port
illustration fig 303
illustration fig 305
the main valve whose movement alternately opens the ports for the
admission of steam to and the escape of steam from the main cylinder
is divided into two parts one of which c slides upon a seat on the
main cylinder and at the same time affords a seat for the other part
d which slides upon the upper face of c as shown in the engravings d
is at the lefthand end of its stroke and c at the opposite or
righthand end of its stroke steam from the steamchest j is
therefore entering the righthand end of the main cylinder through the
ports e and h and the exhaust is escaping through the ports h 1 e 1 k
and m which causes the main piston a to move from right to left when
this piston has nearly reached the lefthand end of its cylinder the
tappet arm t attached to the pistonrod comes in contact with and
moves the valve rod collar o 1 and valve rod p and thus causes c
together with the supplemental valves r and s s 1 which form with c
one casting to be moved from right to left this movement causes
steam to be admitted to the lefthand end of the supplemental cylinder
whereby its piston b will be forced towards the right carrying d to the
opposite or righthand end of its stroke for the movement of s closes n
the steamport leading to the righthand end and the movement of s 1
opens n 1 the steamport leading to the opposite or lefthand end at
the same time the movement of v opens the righthand end of this
cylinder to the exhaust through the exhaust ports x and z the parts c
and d now have positions opposite to those shown in the engravings and
steam is therefore entering the main cylinder through the ports e 1 and
h 1 and escaping through the ports h e k and m which causes the main
piston a to move in the opposite direction or from left to right and
operations similar to those already described will follow when the
piston approaches the righthand end of its cylinder by this simple
arrangement the pump is rendered positive in its action that is it
will instantly start and continue working the moment steam is admitted
to the steamchest while at the same time the piston is enabled to move
as slowly as the nature of the duty may require it will be noted that
in figure 305 the ports of c are shown through d whose location is
marked by dark shading this obviously is not correct because d being
above c should be shaded lighter than c and again the ports e 1 and k
could not show dark through the port d they might of course be shown
by dotted outlines but they would not appear to such advantage and on
this account it is permissible where artistic effect is sought the
object being to subserve the shading to making the mechanism and its

chapter xv
examples in engine work
in the figures from 308 to 328 inclusive are given three examples in
engine work all these drawings being from the american machinist
figures 308 to 314 represent drawings of an automatic high speed engine
designed and made by professor john e and william a sweet of
syracuse new york figure 308 is a side and 309 an end view of the
engine upon a bedplate is bolted two straight frames between which
at their upper ends the cylinder is secured by bolts the guides for
the crosshead are bolted to the frame which enables them to be readily
removed to be replaned when necessary the hand wheel and rod to the
right are to operate the stopcock for turning on and off the steam to
the steamchest
the objects of the design are as follows figure 310 is a vertical
section of the cylinder through the valve face also showing the valve
in section and it will be seen that the lower steam passage enters the
cylinder its full depth below the inside bottom and that the whole
inside bottom surface of the cylinder slopes or inclines towards the
entrance of this passage the object of this is to overcome the
difficulty experienced from the accumulation of water in the cylinder
which in the vertical engine is usually a source of considerable
annoyance and frequently the cause of accident
any water that may be present in the bottom finds its way by gravity to
the port steam entrance and is forced out by and with the exhaust steam
at or before the commencement of the return stroke
to assist in the escape of water from the top of the cylinder the
piston is made quite crowning at that end the effect of which is to
collect the water in a narrow band instead of spreading it over a large
surface this materially assists in its escape and at the same time
presents a large surface for the distribution of any water that may not
find its way out in advance of the piston
the piston is a single casting unusually long and light and is packed
with four spring rings of 38 inch square brass wire
the valve is a simple rectangular plate working between the valve face
and a cover plate the cover plate being held in its proper position
relative to the back of the valve by steam pressure against its outer
surface and by resting against loose distance pieces between its inner
surface and the valve seat this construction admits of the valve
leaving the seat if necessary to relieve the cylinder from water as
in the instance of priming and also by the reduction of these pieces
admits of ready adjustment to contact should it become necessary
illustration fig 311valve motion
the cover plate is provided with recesses on its inner surface which
exactly correspond with the ports in the valve face and the
corresponding ports and recesses are kept in communication with each
other by means of relief passages in the valve from this it will be
seen that the valve is subjected to equal and balanced pressure on each
of its sides and hence is in equilibrium
the valve is operated through the valve motion shown in figure 311 the
eccentric rod of which hooks on a slightly tapered block that turns on
the pin of the rock arm like an ordinary journal box
the expansion or cutoff is automatically regulated by the operation
of the governor in swinging the slotted eccentric in a manner
substantially equivalent to moving it across the shaft but is however
favorably modified by the arrangement of the rock arm which in
combination with the other motions neutralizes the unfavorable
operation of the usual shifting eccentric and which in connection with
the large double port opening provides for a good use of steam from 0
to 34 stroke
the governor shown in figure 312 is of the disc and single ball type
the centrifugal force of the ball being counteracted by a powerful
spring friction is reduced to a minimum in the governor connection by
introducing steel rollers and hardened steel plates in such a manner as
to provide rolling instead of sliding motion
in order that a governor shall correctly perform its functions it is
unquestionably necessary that it have power largely in excess of the
work required of it and also that the friction shall represent a very
low percentage of that power in respect to this especial means have
been employed to reduce the friction the valve being balanced
requires but little power to move it while the governor ball being made
heavy for the purpose of counterbalancing the weight of the eccentric
and strap its centrifugal force when the engine is at full speed is
enormous the spring to counteract it having to sustain from two to
three thousand pounds under these circumstances as might be expected
the regulation is remarkably good this is a very important
consideration in an engine working under the conditions of a rolltrain
engine
illustration fig 312governor
illustration fig 313section of pillow block
figure 313 represents a section of the pillow block box crankpin and
wheel together with the main journal it will be seen that the end of
the box next the crank wheel has a circular groove around its outside
and that a corresponding groove in the crank wheel projects over this
groove from this latter groove an oil hole of liberal size extends as
shown to the surface of the crankpin any oil placed at the upper part
of the groove on the box finds its way by gravity into the groove in
the crank wheel and is carried by centrifugal force to the outside
surface of the crankpin so that whatever other means of lubrication
may be employed this one will always be positive in its action this
cut also shows the manner in which the box overlaps the main journal and
forms the oil reservoir
illustration fig 314connecting rod page 295
another feature in the construction of this box is the means by which it
is made to adjust itself in line with the shaft it will be observed
that it rests on the bottom of the jaws of the frame on two inclined
surfaces which form equal angles with the axis of the shaft when in its
normal position and that by moving longitudinally in either direction
as may be necessary the box will accommodate itself to a change in the
alignment of the shaft in order that it may be free to move for this
purpose it is not fitted with the usual fore and aft flanges by this
means any slight derangement as in either the outboard or inboard
bearing wearing down the fastest is taken care of the movement of the
box on the inclined surfaces being for this purpose equivalent to the
operation of a ball and socket bearing
figure 314 gives a side and an edge view of the connecting rod the rod
being in section in the edge view and the brasses in section lined in
both views
the crosshead pin it will be observed is tapered and is drawn home
in the crosshead by a bolt the sides of the pin are flattened somewhat
where the journal is so that the pin may not wear oval as it is apt to
do because of the pull and thrust strain of the rod brasses falling
mainly upon the top and bottom of the journal where the most wear
therefore takes place the brasses at the crossed end are set up by a
wedge adjustable by means of the screw bolts shown the crosshead wrist
pin being removable from the crosshead enables the upper end of the rod
to have a solid end since it can be passed into place in the crossed
and the wrist pin inserted through the two the lower ends of the
connectingrod and the crankpin possess a peculiar feature inasmuch as
by enlarging the diameter of the crankpin the ends of the brasses
overlap to a certain extent the ends of the journal thus holding the
oil and affording increased lubrication the segments that partly
envelop the crosshead pin and crankpin and are section lined in two
directions producing crossing section lines or small squares show
that the brasses are lined with babbitt metal which is represented by
this kind of crosshatching these drawings are sufficiently open and
clear to form very good examples to copy and to trace on tracing paper

figures 315 316 and 317 represent in place upon its setting a 200
horsepower horizontal steamboiler for a stationary engine and are the
design of william h hoffman the crosssectional view of the boiler
shell in figure 315 shows the arrangement of the tubes which having
clear or unobstructed passages between the vertical rows of tubes
permits the steam to rise freely and assists the circulation of the
water the dry pipe which is also shown in figure 316 is a perforated
pipe through which the steam passes to the engine cylinder its object
being to carry off the steam as dry as possible that is to say without
its carrying away with the steam any entrained water that may be
held in suspension figure 316 is a side elevation with the setting
shown in section and figure 317 is an end view of the boiler and
setting at the furnace end the boiler is supported on each side by
channel iron columns these being riveted to the boiler shell angle
pieces which rest upon the columns the heat and products of combustion
pass from the furnace along the bottom of the boiler and at the end
pass into and through the tubes and thence over the top of the boiler
to the chimney flue there is shown in the bridge wall an opening and
its service is to admit air to the gases after they have passed the
bridge wall and thus complete the combustion of such gases as
may have remained unconsumed in the furnace the cleansing
door at one end and that lined with asbestos at the other are to admit
the passage of the tube cleaners the asbestos at the top of the boiler
shell is to protect it from any undue rise in temperature steam being a
poorer conductor of heat than water and it being obvious that if one
side of the boiler is hotter than the other it expands more from the
heat and becomes longer causing the boiler to bend which strains and
weakens it the sides of the setting are composed of a double row of
brick walls with an air space of three inches between them the object
being to prevent as far as possible the radiation of heat from the
walls the brickstaves are simply stays to hold the brick work together
and prevent its cracking as it is apt in the absence of staying to
do

figures from 318 to 330 are working drawings of a 100horse engine
designed also by william h hoffman
figure 318 represents a plan and a side view of the bedplate with the
main bearing and the guide bars in place the cylinder is bolted at the
stuffing box end to the bedplate and is supported at the outer end by
an expansion link pivoted to the bedplate the main bearing is provided
with a screw for adjusting the height of the bottom piece of the
bearing and thus taking up the wear the guide bars are held to the bed
in the middle as well as at each end
figures 319 and 320 represent cross sections of the bedplate

a view of the steamchest side of the cylinder is given in figure 323
and a horizontal cross section of the cylinder the steamchest and the
valves is shown in figure 324 the main valves are connected by a right
and left hand screw to enable their adjustment as are also the cutoff
valves
figures 325 and 326 show the cam wrist plate and the cutoff mechanism
the cam wrist plate which is of course vibrated by the eccentric rod
has an inclined groove whose walls are protected from wear by steel
shoes in this groove is a steel roller upon a pin attached to the bell
crank operating the main valve stem the operation of the groove is to
accelerate the motion imparted from the eccentric to the valve at one
part of the latters travel and retard it at another the accelerated
portion being during the opening of the port for steam admission and
during its closure for cutting off which enables the employment of a
smaller steamport than would otherwise be the case
the shaft for the cam plate is carried in a bearing at one end and fits
in a socket at the other the socket and bearing being upon a base plate
that is bolted to the bedplate of the engine a side view of the
construction being shown in figure 327
figure 328 represents the crosshead whose wrist pin is let into the
crosshead cheeks so that it may be removed to be turned up true the
clip is to prevent the piston rod nut from loosening back of itself

the eccentric is let into the strap and is provided with an eye to
receive a circular nut by means of which the length of the eccentric rod
may be adjusted a hexagon nut being upon the other or outer end of the
eye
figure 330 shows the construction of the connecting rod the brasses of
which are adjustable to take up the wear and to maintain them to correct
