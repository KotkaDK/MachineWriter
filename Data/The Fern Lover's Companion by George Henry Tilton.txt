preface
a lover of nature feels the fascination of the ferns though he may know
little of their names and habits beholding them in their native haunts
adorning the rugged cliffs gracefully fringing the watercourses or
waving their stately fronds on the borders of woodlands he feels their
call to a closer acquaintance happy would he be to receive instruction
from a living teacher his next preference would be the companionship of a
good fern book such a help we aim to give him in this manual if he will
con it diligently consulting its glossary for the meaning of terms while
he quickens his powers of observation by studying real specimens he may
hope to learn the names and chief qualities of our most common ferns in a
single season
our most productive period in fern literature was between 1878 when
williamson published his ferns of kentucky and 1905 when clute
issued our ferns in their haunts between these flourished dc eaton
davenport waters dodge parsons eastman underwood aa eaton slosson
and others all their works are now out of print except clutes just
mentioned and mrs parsons how to know the ferns both of these
are valuable handbooks and amply illustrated clutes is larger more
scholarly and more inclusive of rare species with an illustrated key to
the genera while mrs parsons is more simple and popular with a naive
charm that creates for it a constant demand
we trust there is room also for this unpretentious but progressive
handbook designed to stimulate interest in the ferns and to aid the
average student in learning their names and meaning its geographical
limits include the northeastern states and canada its nomenclature follows
in the main the seventh edition of grays manual while the emendations
set forth in rhodora of october 1919 and also a few terms of later
adoption are embodied either as synonyms or substitutes for the more
familiar latin names of the manual and are indicated by a different type
in every case the student has before him both the older and the more recent
terms from which to choose however since the book is written primarily
for lovers of nature many of whom are unfamiliar with scientific terms
the common english names are everywhere given prominence and strange to
say are less subject to change and controversy than the latin there is
no doubt what species is meant when one speaks of the christmas fern the
ostrich fern the long beech fern the interrupted fern etc the use of
the common names will lead to the knowledge and enjoyment of the scientific
terms
a friend unfamiliar with latin has asked for pointers to aid in pronouncing
the scientific names of ferns following gray wood and others we have
marked each accented syllable with either the grave  or acute 
accent the former showing that the vowel over which it stands has its long
sound while the latter indicates the short or modified sound let it be
remembered that any syllable with either of these marks over it is the
accented syllable whose sound will be long or short according to the slant
of the mark
we have appropriated from many sources such material as suited our purpose
our interest in ferns dates back to our college days at amherst when we
collected our first specimens in a rough bushy swamp in hadley we found
here a fine colony of the climbing fern lygodium we recall the slender
fronds climbing over the low bushes unique twiners charming indeed in
their native habitat we have since collected and studied specimens of
nearly every new england fern and have carefully examined most of the
other species mentioned in this book by courtesy of the librarian mr
william p rich we have made large use of the famous davenport herbarium
in the massachusetts horticultural library and through the kindness of
the daughter miss mary e davenport we have freely consulted the larger
unmounted collection of ferns at the davenport homestead at medford1
finding here a very large and fine assortment of botrychiums including a
real b ternatum from japan
footnote 1 recently donated to the gray herbarium
for numerous facts and suggestions we are indebted to the twenty volumes of
the fern bulletin and also to its able editor mr willard n clute to
him we are greatly obligated for the use of photographs and plates and
especially for helpful counsel on many items we appreciate the helpfulness
of the american fern journal and its obliging editor mr ej winslow
to our friend mr ch knowlton our thanks are due for the revision of
the checklist and for much helpful advice and we are grateful to mr
snf sanford of the boston society of natural history for numerous
courtesies but more especially to mr ca weatherby for his expert and
helpful inspection of the entire manuscript
the illustrations have been carefully selected many of them from original
negatives bequeathed to the author by his friend henry lincoln clapp
pioneer and chief promoter of school gardens in america some have been
photographed from the authors herbarium and from living ferns a few
are from the choice herbarium of mr george e davenport and also a few
reprints have been made from fern books for which due credit is given the
scotts spleenwort on the dedication page is reprinted from clutes our
ferns in their haunts
introduction
thoreau tells us nature made a fern for pure leaves fern leaves are in
the highest order of cryptogams like those of flowering plants they are
reinforced by woody fibres running through their stems keeping them erect
while permitting graceful curves their exquisite symmetry of form their
frequent finely cut borders and their rich shades of green combine to make
them objects of rare beauty while their unique vernation and method of
fruiting along with their wonderful mystery of reproduction invest them
with marked scientific interest affording stimulus and culture to the
thoughtful mind by peculiar enchantments these charming plants allure the
ardent naturelover to observe their haunts and habits
  oh then most gracefully they wave
  in the forest like a sea
  and dear as they are beautiful
  are these fern leaves to me
as a rule the larger and coarser ferns grow in moist shady situations as
swamps ravines and damp woods while the smaller ones are more apt to be
found along mountain ranges in some dry and even exposed locality a tiny
crevice in some high cliff is not infrequently chosen by these fascinating
little plants which protect themselves from drought by assuming a mantle
of light wool or of hair and chaff with perhaps a covering of white
powder as in some cloak fernsthus keeping a layer of moist air next to
the surface of the leaf and checking transpiration
some of the rockloving ferns in dry places are known as resurrection
ferns reviving after their leaves have turned sere and brown a touch of
rain and lo they are green and flourishing
ferns vary in height from the diminutive filmy fern of less than an inch
to the vast tree ferns of the tropics reaching a height of sixty feet or
more
reproduction
ferns are propagated in various ways a frequent method is by perennial
rootstocks which often creep beneath the surface sending up it may be
single fronds as in the common bracken or graceful leafcrowns as in the
cinnamon fern the bladder fern is propagated in part from its bulblets
while the walking leaf bends over to the earth and roots at the tip
illustration male shield fern fern reproduction by the prothallium
ferns are also reproduced by spores a process mysterious and marvellous as
a fairy tale instead of seeds the fern produces spores which are little
onecelled bodies without an embryo and may be likened to buds a
spore falls upon damp soil and germinates producing a small green
shieldshaped patch much smaller than a dime which is called a prothllium
or prothallus on its under surface delicate root hairs grow to give it
stability and nutriment also two sorts of reproductive organs known as
antherdia and archegnia the male and female growths analogous to the
stamens and pistils in flowers from the former spring small active
spiral bodies called ntherozids which lash about in the moisture of
the prothllium until they find the archegnia the cells of which are so
arranged in each case as to form a tube around the central cell which is
called the sphere or eggcell the point to be fertilized when one
of the entering ntherozids reaches this point the desired change is
effected and the canal of the archegnium closes the empty sphere
becomes the quickened sphore whose newly begotten plant germ unfolds
normally by the multiplication of cells that become in turn root stem
first leaf etc while the prothllium no longer needed to sustain its
offspring withers away1
footnote 1 in the accompanying illustration it should be remembered that
the reproductive parts of a fern are microscopic and cannot be seen by the
naked eye
fern plants have been known to spring directly from the prothllus by a
budding process apart from the organs of fertilization showing that nature
fulfills herself in many ways2
footnote 2 the scientific term for this method of reproduction is apgamy
apart from marriage sometimes the prothallus itself buds directly from
the frond without spores for which process the term apspory is used
meaning literally without spores
vernation
all true ferns come out of the ground head foremost coiled up like a
watchspring and are designated as fiddleheads or crosiers a real
crosier is a bishops staff some of these odd young growths are covered
with fern wool which birds often use in lining their nests this wool
usually disappears later as the crosier unfolds into the broad green blade
the development of plant shoots from the bud is called vernation latin
ver meaning spring and this unique uncoiling of ferns circinnate
vernation
veins
the veins of a fern are free when branching from the midvein they do
not connect with each other and simple when they do not fork when
the veins intersect they are said to anastomose greek an opening or
network and their meshes are called arol or reoles latin areola a
little open space
explanation of terms
a frond is said to be pinnate latin pinna a feather when its primary
divisions extend to the rachis as in the christmas fern fig 1 a frond
is bipinnate latin bis twice when the lobes of the pinn extend to
the midvein as in the royal fern fig 2 these divisions of the pinn are
called pinnules when a frond is tripnnate the last complete divisions are
called ultimate pinnules or segments a frond is pinntifid when its lobes
extend halfway or more to the rachis or midvein as in the middle lobes
of the pinntifid spleenwort fig 3 the pinn of a frond are often
pinntifid when the frond itself is pinnate and a frond may be pinnate
in its lower part and become pinntifid higher up as in the pinntifid
spleenwort just mentioned fig 3
illustration fig 1
illustration fig 2
illustration fig 3
the divisions of a pinntifid leaf are called segments of a bipinntifid
or tripinntifid leaf ultimate segments
sporngia and fruit dots
fern spores are formed in little sacs known as sporecases or sporngia
fig 4 they are usually clustered in dots or lines on the back or margin
of a frond either on or at the end of a small vein or in spikelike
racemes on separate stalks sori singular sorus a heap or fruit dots
may be naked as in the polypody but are usually covered with a thin
delicate membrane known as the indusium greek a dress or mantle the
family or genus of a fern is often determined by the shape of its indusium
eg the indusium of the woodsias is starshaped of the dicksonias
cupshaped of the aspleniums linear of the wood ferns kidneyshaped
etc
illustration fig 4
in many ferns the sporangia are surrounded in whole or in part by a
vertical elastic ring annulus reminding one of a small brown worm
closely coiled fig 4 as the spores mature the ring contracts and
bursts with considerable force scattering the spores the spores of the
different genera mature at different times from may to september a good
time to collect ferns is just before the fruiting season for times of
fruiting see individual descriptions or chronological chart on page 220
helpful hints
the following hints may be helpful to the young collector
1 a good lens with needles for dissecting is very helpful in examining the
sori veins glands etc as an accurate knowledge of any one of these
items may aid in identifying a given specimen bausch and lomb make a
convenient twobladed pocket glass for about two dollars1
footnote 1 in the linen tester here figured cost 150 the lens is
mounted in a brass frame which holds it in position enabling the dissector
to use both hands a tripod lens will also be found cheap and serviceable
illustration
2 do not exterminate or weaken a fern colony by taking more plants than it
can spare in small colonies of rare ferns take a few and leave the rest to
grow it is decidedly illbred to rob a locality of its precious plants
pick your fern leaf down close to the rootstock including a portion of
that also if it can be spared place your fronds between newspaper sheets
and lay dryers over them blotting paper or other absorbent paper cover
with a board or slat frame and lay on this a weight of several pounds
leaving it for twentyfour hours if the specimens are not then cured
change the dryers mount the prepared specimens on white mounting sheets
the regulation size is 1612 by 1112 inches the labels are usually
334 by 134 inches a sample will suggest the proper inscription
  herbarium of john doe
  ophioglssum vulgatum l
  adders tongue
  willoughby lake vt
  august 19 1911 wet meadow
  coll xyz rather common
  but often overlooked
place the label at the lower righthand corner of the sheet which is now
ready to be laid in the genus cover usually of manila paper 1612 by 12
inches
it is well to jot down important memoranda at the time of collecting this
is the method in use at the gray herbarium in cambridge it can of course
be modified to suit ones own taste or convenience the young collector can
begin by simply pressing his specimens between the leaves of a book
the older and coarser the better and he can mount them in a blank book
designed for the purpose or if he has only a common blank book he can cut
out some of the leaves alternately with others left in place as is often
done with a scrap book that when the book is full it may not be crowded at
the back or he can use sheets of blank paper of any uniform size and mount
the specimens on these with gummed strips and then group them placing
those of the same genus together such an extemporized herbarium though
crude will serve for a beginning while stimulating his interest and
advancing his knowledge of the ferns let him collect press and mount
as many varieties as possible giving the name with date and place of
collecting etc such a first attempt may be kept as a reminder of pleasant
hours spent in learning the rudiments of a delightful study
we cannot insist too strongly upon the necessity of handling and studying
the living plant every student needs to observe for himself the haunts
habits and structure of real ferns we would say to the young student
while familiarizing yourself with the english names of the ferns do not
neglect the scientific names which often hold the key to their meaning
repeat over and over the name of each genus in soliloquy and in
conversation until your mind instantly associates each fern with its family
nameadiantum polystichum asplenium and all the rest fix
them in the memory for a permanent asset with hard study and growing
knowledge will come growing attachment how our great expert mr
davenport loved the ferns he would handle them with gentle touch fondly
stroke their leaves and devoutly study their structure as if inspired by
the allwise interpreter
  move along these shades
  in gentleness of heart with gentle hand
  touchfor there is a spirit in the woods
key to the genera
this key in illustrating each genus follows the method of clute in our
ferns in their haunts but substitutes other and larger specimens five of
these are from waters ferns by permission of henry holt  co
as the indusium which often determines the name of a fern is apt in some
species to wither early it is important to secure for study not only a
fertile frond but one in as good condition as possible for convenience
the ferns may be considered in two classes
i
those which have the fruiting portion in greenish berrylike structures
and not on the back of fronds

descriptive text of the ferns
in this manual our native ferns are grouped scientifically under five
distinct families by far the largest of these groups and the first to be
treated is that of the real ferns polypodice with sixty species and
several chief varieties then follow the flowering ferns osmundce
with three species the curly grass and climbing ferns schizce
with two species the adders tongue and grape ferns ophioglossce
with seven species and the filmy ferns hymenophyllce with one
species
corresponding with these five families the sporangia or spore cases of
ferns have five quite distinct forms on which the families are founded
illustration fig 1
illustration fig 2
illustration fig 3
illustration fig 4
1 the fern family proper polypodice has the spore cases stalked and
bound by a vertical elastic ring fig 1 the clusters of fruitdots
containing the spore cases may be open and naked as in polypody fig 2
or covered by an indusium as in the shield ferns fig 3
2 the royal fern family osmunda has the spore cases stalked with only
a rudimentary ring on one side which opens longitudinally fig 4
3 the climbing fern family lygodium schiza has the spore cases
sessile in rows they are small nutlike bodies with the elastic ring
around the upper portion fig 51
footnote 1 these figures are enlarged
4 the adders tongue family ophioglssum botrchium has simple spore
cases without a ring and discharges its spores through a transverse slit
fig 6
5 the filmy fern family trichmanes has the spore cases along
a bristlelike receptacle and surrounded by an urnshaped slightly
twolipped involucre ring transverse and opening vertically fig 7
illustration fig 5

the fern family proper or real ferns
polypodice
green leafy plants whose spores are borne in sporecases sporangia
which are collected in dots or clusters fruitdots or sori on the back
of the frond or form lines along the edge of its divisions sporangia
surrounded by vertical elastic rings bursting transversely and scattering
the spores fruitdots sori often covered at least when young by a
membrane called the indusium spores brown
the polypodies
1 polypody polypodium
from the greek meaning manyfooted alluding to the branching rootstocks
simple ferns with stipes articulated to the creeping rootstocks which are
covered with brown chaffy scales fruitdots round naked arranged on the
back of the frond in one or more rows each side of the midrib sporangia
pedicelled provided with a vertical ring which bursts transversely a
large genus with about 350 species widely distributed mostly in tropical
regions
1 common polypody polypodium vulgare
fronds somewhat leathery in texture evergreen four to ten inches tall
smooth oblong and nearly pinnate the large fruitdots nearly midway
between the midrib and the margin but nearer the margin
illustration common polypody polypodium vulgare
common everywhere on cliffs usually in half shade and may at times spring
out of decaying logs or the trunks of trees as the jointed stipes harking
back to some ancient mode of fern growth fall away from the rootstocks
after their year of greenness they leave behind a scar as in solomons
seal the polypody is a gregarious plant by intertwining its roots the
fronds cling together in cheerful community and a friendly eye discovers
their beauty a long way off august abounds in every clime including
europe and japan
in transplanting sections should be cut not pulled from the matted mass
var cambricum has segments broader and more or less strongly toothed
var cristatum has the segments forked at the ends
several other forms are also found

in appearance the gray polypody is much like the common species as the
greek ending oides like implies in florida and neighboring states it
often grows on trees farther north mostly on rocks reported as far north

the outlines of the young bracken resemble the little oak fern it
flourishes in thickets and open pastures often with poor soil and scant
shade it is found in all parts of the world and is said to be the most
common of all our north american ferns in a cross section of the mature

the word brake or bracken is one of the many plant names from which some of
our english surnames are derived as brack breck brackenridge etc
and fern meaning the bracken is seen in fern fearns fernham fernel
fernside farnsworth etc also in names of places as ferney ferndale
fernwood and others although the bracken is coarse and common it makes a
desirable background for rockeries or other fern masses the young ferns
should be transplanted in early spring with as much of the long running
rootstock as possible
var pseudocaudta has longer narrower and more distant pinnules and is
a common southern form

2 maidenhair adiantum
ferns with much divided leaves and short marginal sori borne at the ends
of freeforking veins on the under side of the reflexed and altered
portion of the pinnules which serves as an indusium stipes and branches
of the leaves very slender and polished
greek unwetted because drops of water roll off without wetting the
leaves
1 common maidenhair adiantum pedatum
a graceful fern of shady glen and rocky woodland nine to eighteen inches
high the black shining stalks forked at the top into two equal
recurved branches the pinn all springing from the upper side pinnules
triangularoblong bearing short sori on their inwardly reflexed margins
which form the indusium
illustration a spray of maidenhair
illustration fruiting pinn of maidenhair
the maidenhair has a superficial resemblance to the meadow rue which also
sheds water but it may be known at once by its black shining stalks with
their divisions all borne on one side it is indeed a most delicate fern
known and admired by every one the term maidenhair may have been suggested
by the black wiry roots growing from the slender rootstock or by the
dark polished stems or as clute explains it because the black roots
like hair were supposed according to the doctrine of signatures to be
good for falling hair and the plant was actually used in the syrup of
capillairea am botanist november 1921 while the maidenhair is
not very common it is widely distributed being found throughout our
section westward to california and northward to the british provinces
though the maidenhair has a wide range and grows abundantly in many
localities it possesses a quality of aloofness which adds to its charm
its chosen haunts are dim moist hollows in the woods or shaded hillsides
sloping to the river in such retreats you find the feathery fronds
tremulous on their glistening stalks and in their neighborhood you find
also the very spirit of the woods

indicated was highly esteemed as a pectoral for the relief of difficult
breathing

along with the ostrich fern it makes a most excellent combination in a fern
border
var aleuticum or alpine maidenhair a beautiful northern form especially
abundant on the high tableland of the gasp peninsula quebec where it is
said to cover hundreds of acres in the east it is often dwarfedsix
to ten inches high growing in tufts with stout rootstocks having the
pinnules finely toothed instead of rounded and the indusia often lunate
rarely twice as long as broad fernald in rhodora november 1905 also
found in northern vermont and to the northwestward
2 the venushair fern adiantum capllusveneris
fronds with a continuous main rachis ovatelanceolate twice pinnate
below pinnules fanshaped on slender black stalks long deeply and
irregularly incised veins extending from the base of the pinnules like the
ribs of a fan
illustration venus hair fern adiantum capillusveneris
while our common maidenhair is a northern fern the venushair fern is
confined to the southern states it is rarely found as far north as
virginia where it meets but scarcely overlaps its sister fern the
medicinal properties of adiantum pedatum were earlier ascribed to the
more southern species which is common in great britain but like many
another old remedy the syrup of capillaire is long since defunct
3 cliff brakes pellea
sporangia borne on the upper part of the free veins inside the margins in
dotlike masses but may run together as in the continuous fruiting line
of the bracken indusium formed of the reflexed margins of the fertile
segments which are more or less membranous pella from the greek
pellos meaning dusky in allusion to the dark stipes
1 purple cliff brake pella atropurprea
stipes dark purple or reddishbrown polished and decidedly hairy and
harsh to the touch at least on one side fronds coriaceous pale simply
pinnate or bipinnate below the divisions broadly linear or oblong or
the sterile sometimes oval chiefly entire somewhat heartshaped or
else truncate at the stalked base veins about twice forked basal scales
extending into long slender tips colorless or yellow
illustration purple cliff brake pella atropurpurea
another name is the winter brake as its fronds remain green throughout
the winter especially in its more southern ranges it grows on rocky
ledges with a preference for limestone and often in full sun in large and
mature fronds its pinn are apt to be extremely irregular while its stipes
are purplish its leaves are bluishgreen and its scales lightbrown or
yellow strange to say this brake of the cliffs thrives in cultivation
woolson says of it this fern is interesting and valuable it is not only
beautiful in design but unique in color a dark bluegreen emphasizing
all the varying tints about ita firstclass fern for indoor winter
cultivation it is a rapid grower flourishing but a few feet from coal
fire or radiator in a north or south window it quickly forgives neglect
and if allowed to dry up out of doors or indoors recovers in due time when
put in a moist atmosphere it makes but one imperative demand and that is
the privilege of standing still overzealous culturists usually like to
turn things around but revolving cliffs are not in the natural order of
things the slender black stipes are very susceptible to changes of light

3 dense cliff brake
cryptogrmma densa pellaa densa
modern botanists are inclined to place the dense cliff brake and the
slender cliff brake under the genus cryptogrmma which is so nearly like
pellaea that one hesitates to choose between them the word cryptogrmma
means in greek a hidden line alluding to the line of sporangia hidden
beneath the reflexed margin
the dense cliff brake may be described as follows
stipes three to nine inches tall blades one to three inches
triangularovate pinnate at the summit and tripinnate below segments
linear sharppointed mostly fertile having the margins entire and
recurved giving the sori the appearance of halfopen pods sterile
fronds sharply serrate stipes in dense tufts densa slender wiry
lightbrown
this rare little fern is a northern species and springs from tiny crevices
in rocks preferring limestone like many other rockloving species it
produces spores in abundance having no other effective means of spreading
and its fertile fronds are much more numerous than the sterile ones and
begin to fruit when very small gasp and mt albert in the province of

we have collected this dainty and attractive little fern on the limestone
cliffs of mt horr near willoughby lake vt it grew in a rocky grotto
whose sides were kept moist by dripping water how we liked to linger near
its charming abode high on the cliff and we liked also to speak of it by
its pleasing simple name pella gracilis now changed for scientific
reasons but we still like the old name better
5 the rock brake parsley fern
cryptogrmma acrostichides
sterile and fertile fronds very dissimilar segments of the fertile linear
and podlike of the sterile ovateoblong obtuse and toothed the plants
spring from crevices of rocks and are from six to eight inches high stipes
of the fertile fronds are about twice as long as the sterile making two
tiers of fronds
illustration parsley fern or rock brake cryptogramma acrostichoides

the parsley fern is the typical species of the genus cryptogrmma the
indusium is formed of the altered margin of the pinnule at first reflexed
to the midrib giving it a podlike appearance but at length opening out
flat and exposing the sporangia clute speaking of this fern as the rock

4 lip ferns cheilnthes
mostly small southern ferns growing on rocks pubescent or tomentose with
much divided leaves sori at the end of the veins at first small and
roundish but afterwards more or less confluent the indusium whitish and
sometimes herbaceous formed of the reflexed margin of the lobes or of the
whole pinnule veins free but often obscure most of the ferns of this
genus grow in dry exposed situations where rain is sometimes absent for
weeks and months for this reason they protect themselves by a covering
of hairs scales or wool which hinders the evaporation of water from the
plant by holding a layer of more or less saturated air near the surface of
the frond in greek the word means lip flower alluding to the liplike
indusia

fronds twice pinnate lanceolate with oblong pinntifid pinnules seven
to fifteen inches tall slender and rough with rusty jointed hairs pinn
triangularovate usually distant the ends of the rounded lobes reflexed
and forming separate involucres which are pushed back by the ripening
sporangia
this species like the other lip ferns is fond of rocks springing from
clefts and ledges while hairy it is much less tomentose than the two
following species unlike most of the rockloving ferns this species is not
partial to limestone but grows on other rocks as well it has been found
as far north as new haven conn also near new york and in new jersey

and pinnules ovateoblong densely woolly especially beneath with slender
whitish obscurely jointed hairs of the ultimate segments the terminal
one is twice as long as the others pinnules distant the reflexed narrow
margin forming a continuous membranous indusium stipe stout dark brown
densely woolly
by donning its thick coat of wool this species is prepared to grow in
the most exposed situations of the arid southwest it is said to be the
rarest tallest and handsomest of the lip ferns

5 cloak fern notholena
small ferns with fruitdots borne beneath the revolute margin of the
pinnules at first roundish but soon confluent into a narrow band without
indusium veins free fronds one to several times pinnate the lower
surface hairy or tomentose or powdery includes about forty species
mostly american but only one within our limits greek name means
spurious cloak alluding to the rudimentary or counterfeit indusium
1 powdery cloak fern notholena dealbta
fronds two to six inches long triangularovate acute broadest at the
base tripinnate stalks tufted wiry shining dark brown upper surface
of the very small segments green smooth the lower densely coated with
a pure white powder hence the specific name dealbata which means
whitened sori brown at length veins free
there are several species of cloak ferns but only one within our limits
the dry white powder which covers them doubtless is designed to protect
them from too rapid evaporation of moisture as they all inhabit dry and
sunny places this delicate rockloving fern is found in the clefts of dry
limestone rocks in missouri kansas colorado and southwestward
the chain ferns woodwardia
large and somewhat coarse ferns of swampy woods with pinnate or nearly
twopinnate fronds and oblong or linear fruitdots arranged in one or
more chainlike rows parallel to and near the midribs indusium fixed by
its outer margin to a veinlet and opening on the inner side in our
section there are two species named for thomas j woodward an english
botanist

1 the common chain fern woodwardia virgnica
sterile and fertile fronds similar in outline two to four feet high once
pinnate the pinn deeply incised with oblong segments fruitdots oblong
in chainlike rows along the midrib both of the pinn and the lobes
confluent when ripe veins forming narrow rows of netlike spaces areoles
beneath the fruitdots thence free to the margin the spores ripen in
july
the sterile fronds resemble those of the cinnamon fern but the latter grow
in crowns with a single frond in the center while the fronds of the
chain fern rise singly from the creeping rootstock which sends them up at
intervals all summer the sori are borne on the backs of fertile fronds
there are usually more sterile than fertile blades especially in dense
shade we have waded repeatedly through a miry swamp in melrose mass
where the wild calla flourishes along with the blueberry and other swamp
bushes and have found the chain fern in several shaded spots but every
frond was sterile it is said that when exposed to the sun it always faces
the south swamps maine to florida especially along the atlantic coast
and often in company with the narrowleaved species

lanceolate serrulate divisions united by a broad wing veins areolate
fertile fronds taller twelve to twenty inches high with narrowly linear
divisions the areoles and fruitdots in a single row each side of the
secondary midrib the latter sunk in the tissues
this species is less common than the virginia fern but they often grow
near each other we have collected both in the blue hill reservation near
boston and both have been found in hingham medford and reading and
doubtless in other towns along the coast mrs parsons speaks of finding
them in the flat sandy country near buzzards bay the netveined species
has some resemblance to the sensitive fern but in the latter the spore
cases are shut up in small pods formed by the contracting and rolling up of
the lobes whereas the chain fern bears its sori on the under side of long
narrow pinn besides the sterile fronds of the latter have serrulate
segments as in the sensitive fern there are many curious gradations
between the fertile and sterile fronds both in shape and fruitfulness

b the large spleenworts athrium
the following species which are often two to three feet high and grow in
rich soil are quite different in appearance and habits from the small rock
spleenworts just described some botanists have kept them in the genus
asplenium because their sori are usually rather straight or only slightly
curved but others are inclined to follow the practice of the british
botanists and put them into a separate group under athrium nearly all
agree that the lady fern with its variously curved sori should be placed
here and many others would place the silvery spleenwort in the same genus
partly because of its frequently doubled sori in regard to the last member
of the group the narrowleaved spleenwort there is more doubt the sori
taken separately would place it with the aspleniums but considering its
size structure habits of growth and all it seems more closely allied to
the two larger ferns than to the little rock species we shall group the
three together as the large spleenworts or for the sake of being more
definite adopt clutes felicitous phrase
the lady fern and its kin

tapering towards the apex bipinnate pinn lanceolate numerous pinnules
oblonglanceolate cuttoothed or incised fruitdots short variously
curved indusium delicate often reniform or shaped like a horseshoe in
some forms confluent at maturity

nomenclature separates the lady fern of our section into two distinct
species which should be carefully studieda
footnote a see monograph by fk butters in rhodora of september
1917
1 the upland lady fern athrium angstum
asplnium flixfemina
the rootstock or rhizome of the upland lady fern here pictured shows how
the thick fleshy bases of the old fronds conceal the rootstock itself in
the lowland lady fern the rootstock is but slightly concealed by old stipe
bases and so may be distinguished from its sister fern
one design of such rootstocks is to store up food mostly starch during
the summer to nourish the young plants as they shoot forth the next spring
the undecayed bases of the old stipes are also packed with starch for the
same purpose

often horseshoeshaped usually toothed or fringed with fine hairs but
without glands fronds bipinnate one to three feet high widest near the
middle
this is the common species of northern new england and the canadian
provinces the fronds differ very widely in form and a great many varieties
have been pointed out but the fern student having first learned to
identify the species will gradually master the few leading varieties as he
meets them
those growing in warm sunny places where the fruitdots when mature
incline to cover the whole back of the frond are called sun forms these
are varieties tpicum and eltius both with the pinn obliquely ascending
including variety angustum of dc eaton but the latter has broader
fronds with the pinnules of the sterile fronds oblonglanceolate somewhat
acute and strongly toothed or pinnatifid
illustration varieties of lady fern left to right1st and 2nd var
typicum 3d elatius 4th rubellum 5th uncertain perhaps confertum
var rubllum has the sori distinct even when mature its pinnules stand
at a wide angle from the rachis of the pinna and are strongly toothed
or pinnatifid with obtuse teeth this variety favors regions with cool
summers or dense shade in warmer regions the term rubllum alludes to
the reddish stems so often seen but this sign alone may not determine the
variety it occurs throughout the range of the species being a common
new england fern fernald remarks that this is also a common form of the
species in southern nova scotia
among other varieties named by butters are confrtum having the pinnules
irregularly lobed and toothed joined by a membranous wing the lobes of
the pinnules broad and overlapping giving the fern a compact appearance
lacinitum with pinnules very irregular in size and shape with many long
acute teeth which project in various directions an abnormal form which
looks as if it had been nibbled when young
these varieties are represented in the gray herbarium
2 the lowland lady fern
athrium aspleniides
rootstocks creeping not densely covered with the persistent bases of the
fronds stipes about as long as the blade scales of the stipe very few
seldom persistent rarely over 316 of an inch long fronds narrowly
deltoid lanceolate widest near the base the second pair of pinn
commonly longest indusia ciliate the cilia hairs ending in glands
spores dark netted or wrinkled
illustration lowland lady fern athyrium asplenioides from the gray

the following two forms are named by butters
f tpicum the usual form frequent in eastern massachusetts rhode island
connecticut new york pennsylvania north carolina ohio and missouri
f subtripinntum an unusually large and rare form with triangular
lanceolate and pinnatifid pinnules having blunt oblong segments wet
situations in half shade massachusetts west virginia and virginia
our lowland or southern lady fern flourishes in the southern states comes
up the atlantic coast until it meets the upland or northern species in
pennsylvania and southern new england and their identification can hardly
fail to awaken in the student a keen interest
our american botanists are inclined to think that the real athrium
flixfmina is not to be found in the northeastern united states but
is rather a western species with its habitat in california and the rocky
mountain region and identical with athrium cyclosrum
but whatever changes may occur in the scientific name of the old athrium
flixfmina the name lady fern will not change but everywhere within
our limits it will hold its own as a familiar term
underwood writing of the lady fern under the genus asplenium mentions
the form exle small starved specimens growing in very dry situations
and often fruiting when only a few inches high he also mentions eatons
angstum and alludes to the remaining sixtythree varieties equally
unimportant that have been described of this species
the lady fern is common in moist woods by walls and roadsides and at its
best is a truly handsome species although like mrs parsons we have
noticed that in the late summer it loses much of its delicacy many of
its forms become disfigured and present a rather blotched and coarse
appearance the lady fern has inspired several poems which have been
quoted more or less fully in the fern books the following lines are from
the pen of calder campbell
  but not by burne in wood or dale
  grows anything so fair
  as the palmy crest of emerald pale
  of the lady fern when the sunbeams turn
  to gold her delicate hair
referring perhaps to the fair colors of the unfolding crosiers revealing
stipes of a clear wine color in striking contrast with the delicate green
of the foliage
in identifying this fern the novice should bear in mind the tendency of the
curved sori of youth to become straightened and even confluent with age
although such changes are rather unreliable possibly the suggestion of the
poetic davenport may be helpful to some that there is an indefinable charm
about the various forms of the lady fern which soon enables one to know it
from its peculiarly graceful motion by merely gently swaying a frond in the
hand spores ripen in august
the lady fern is very easy to cultivate and when once established is apt to
crowd aside its neighbors

scolopendrium lake central new york and tennessee also locally in
ontario and new brunswick one of the rarest of our native ferns although
very common in great britain this plant is said to be easily cultivated
and to produce numerous varieties according to woolson no rockery is
complete without the harts tongue the long glossy undulating fronds
of which are sufficiently unique to distinguish any collection in
cultivation it needs light protection through the winter in northern new

either side of the reticulated veins of the simple frond the outer ones
sometimes confluent at their ends forming crooked lines hence the name
from the greek meaning crooked sori only one species within our limits
camptosrus rhizophyllus
fronds evergreen leathery four to eighteen inches long heartshaped at
the base but tapering towards the apex which often roots and forms a

the christmas and holly ferns
polstichum
these have been grouped with the wood ferns but are now usually placed
under the genus polstichum which has the sori round and covered with
a circular indusium fixed to the frond by its depressed center the wood
ferns on the other hand have a kidneyshaped indusium attached to the
fronds by the sinus polstichum is the greek for many rows the sori of
some species being in many ranks

southern limits nearly coincide with the northern limits of the christmas
fern
the marsh fern tribe
under this designation clute has grouped three of the shield ferns which
have a close family resemblance and has thus distinguished them from the
wood ferns which also belong to the shield fern family
1 the marsh fern
aspdium thelpteris thelpteris palstris
drypteris thelpteris nephrdium thelpteris
illustration the marsh fern
these are all good names and each one is worthy to be chosen aspdium
greek for shield in use for a century adopted in all the seven editions
of grays manual is still the most familiar and pleasing term to its
friends drypteris greek for oak fern has been chosen by underwood
and britton and brown and has grown in favor nephrdium meaning
kidneylike favored by davenport waters and of late clute is a most
fitting name thelpteris meaning lady fern is found to be the earliest
name in use and according to rule the correct one
illustration the marsh fern aspidium thelypteris
fronds pinnate lanceolate slightly or not at all narrowed at the base
pinn horizontal or slightly recurved linearlanceolate and deeply
pinnatifid lobes obtuse but appear acute when their margins are reflexed
over the sori veins once forked indusium minute stipes tall lifting the
blades ten to fifteen inches above the mud whence they spring
the fronds of the marsh fern are apt to be sterile in deep shade it may be
readily distinguished from the new york fern by its broad base instead of
tapering to very small pinn by its long stalk lifting the blade up into
the sunlight and by the revolute margins of the fertile fronds which have
suggested for it the name of snuffbox fern it is separated from
the massachusetts fern by its forked veins common in marshes and damp
woodlands canada to florida and westward while the marsh fern loves
moisture and shade it is sometimes found in dry open fields miss lilian
a cole of union me reports a colony as growing on land above the swale
in which twayblade and adders tongue are found around rock heaps in
open sunlight on clay soil but homely and twisted as if a former woodsy
environment had been long since cleared away while the deserted ferns
persisted
2 massachusetts fern
aspidium simultum thelpteris simulta
drypteris simulata nephrdium simultum
fronds pinnate one to three feet long oblonglanceolate somewhat
narrowed at the base pinn lanceolate deeply pinnatifid the lower most
often turned inward veins simple indusium glandular sori rather large
resembles the marsh fern of which it was once thought to be a variety
in some respects it is also like the new york fern and is in fact
intermediate between the two

bulletin
that it is a distinct species was first pointed out by raynal dodge in
1880 and it later was named simultum by geo e davenport because of
its similarity to a form of the lady fern it may be identified by its
thin texture and particularly by its simple veins on account of its close
resemblance to the marsh fern clute would call it the lanceleaved marsh
fern instead of the irrelevant name of massachusetts fern woodland
swamps usually in deep shade new england to maryland and westward often
found growing with the marsh fern
3 new york fern
aspidium noveboracnse thelpteris noveboracnsis
drypteris noveboracnsis nephrdium noveboracnse
fronds pinnate tapering both ways from the middle pinn lanceolate
pinnatifid the lowest pairs gradually shorter and deflexed veins simple
indusium minute and beset with glands
illustration new york fern aspidium noveboracense
very common in woodlands preferring a dryer soil than the marsh fern
august the fronds are pale green delicate and hairy beneath along the
midrib and veins

when bruised its resinous glands give out a pleasing ferny odor this
species can be distinguished from every other by the greatly reduced pinn
at its base throughout north america east of the mississippi
the beech ferns
the beech ferns are often classed with the polypodies because like them
they have no indusium but in other ways they are more akin to the wood
ferns their stipes are not jointed to the root stock nor are their sori
at the ends of the veins as in the polypodies we here place them with
the wood ferns retaining the familiar name phegpteris but giving
thelpteris as a synonym the fruitdots are small round and naked
borne on the back of the veins below the apex stipe continuous with the
rootstock veins free the name phegpteris in greek means oak or beech
fern

the divisions widely spreading each division pinnate at the base segments
oblong obtuse entire or toothed fruitdots near the margin rootstock
slender and creeping from which fronds are produced all summer in
appearance like the small ternate divisions of the bracken
this dainty fern has fronds of a delicate yellowgreen the greenest of
all green things growing its ternate character is shown even in the
uncoiling of the fronds the three round balls suggesting the sign of the
pawnbroker the parts of the oak fern develop with great regularity each
pinna pinnule and lobe having another exactly opposite to it nearly
always in rocky woods common northward also in virginia kansas and
colorado a fine species for cultivation at the base of the artificial
rockery

2 the northern oak fern
phegopteris robertiana phegopteris calcrea
thelpteris robertina
resembles the oak fern but with fronds rather larger especially the
terminal segment also more rigid and coarser in appearance stalks and
fronds minutely glandular beneath lower pinnules of the lateral divisions
scarcely longer than the others often called limestone polypody the
beech ferns having formerly been classed with the polypodies britton and
brown designate it as the scented oak fern canada and the northwestern
states rare

and often glandular beneath pinn fragrant lanceolate the lowest pair
usually much larger than those above having the segments elongated and cut
into lobes basal segments decurrent and forming a manyangled wing along
the main rachis fruitdots small near the margin
the broad beech fern is usually larger than its sister the long beech
fern and extends farther south ranging from new england to minnesota
and southward to florida it is sometimes called sixangled polypody
according to dodge it is most common in rhode island and connecticut it
prefers rather dry open woods it is said to have a pleasant ferny odor

phegopteris polypodiides thelpteris phegpteris
fronds triangular longer than broad four to six inches long twice
pinnatifid pinn lanceolate acuminate the lowest pair deflexed and
standing forward cut into oblong obtuse segments fruitdots near the
margin
compared with the broad beech fern this is the more northern species while
usually quite distinct in structure it sometimes approaches its sister
fern rather closely
it prefers deep woods and shaded banks newfoundland to alaska and
southward to the mountains of virginia july

chaffy
the fragrant fern grows on high cliffs among the mountains of northern new
england it is reported from scattered stations in northern maine from
north of the white mountains and from sunapee lake in new hampshire and
in the green mountains south to central vermont new brunswick and to
minnesota found also in alaska and greenland this muchcoveted fern has a
singularly sweet and lasting fragrance compared by some to strawberries
by others to newmown hay and sweet brier leaves we have seen herbarium

the wood ferns
the ferns of this group not counting the small fragrant fern prefer the
woods or at least shady places although the genus polstichum represents
the true shield ferns the wood ferns are also thus designated as their
indusia have nearly the shape of small roundish shields the old generic
name for them all was aspdium meaning shield first published in 1800
for a long time its chief rival was nephrdium kidneylike 1803 many
modern botanists have preferred the earlier name drypteris 1763
meaning oak fern alluding perhaps to its forestloving habits
thelpteris still earlier 1762 may supersede the others

graceful circle of large handsome bluishgreen blades the stipes are
short and densely chaffy no other wood fern endures the winter so well
the fronds burdened with snow lop over among the withered leaves and
continue green until the new ones shoot up in the spring it is the most
valuable of all the wood ferns for cultivation

mid vein than the margin mostly on the lower half of each fertile segment
the male fern resembles the marginal shield fern in outline but the fronds
are thinner are not evergreen and the sori are near the midvein its use
in medicine is of long standing its rootstock produces the wellknown
flixmas of the pharmacist this has tonic and astringent properties
but is mainly prescribed as a vermifuge which is one of the names given to
it in europe it is regarded as the typical fern being oftener mentioned

cuttoothed those nearest the rachis sometimes separate fruitdots large
round half way between the midvein and the margin indusium smooth naked

the short sterile fronds though spreading out gracefully are conspicuous
only in winter while the fertile fronds tall narrow and erect are found
only in summer
it is one of our handsomest evergreen ferns and even the large sori with
their dark spore cases and white indusia are very attractive the fertile
pinn have a way of turning their faces upward toward the apex of the frond

crested marginal fern
aspdium cristtum x marginle
both the crested fern and clintons fern appear to hybridize with the
marginal shield fern with the result that the upper part of the frond is
like marginale and the lower like cristtum including the veining and
texture
this form was discovered by raynal dodge verified by margaret slosson and
described by geo e davenport who had a small colony under cultivation in
his fern garden at medford mass and to him the writer and other friends
are indebted for specimens
found occasionally throughout new england and new jersey other supposed
hybrids have been found between the marginal shield and the spinulose fern
and its variety intermdium and with goldies fern also between the
crested fern including clintons variety and each of the others mentioned
and in fact between almost all pairs of species of the wood ferns
although we do not think they have been positively verified still other
species of ferns are known to hybridize more or less as we saw in the case
of scotts spleenwort

fronds one to three feet high oblonglanceolate bipinnate the upper
pinn lanceolate the lower triangular with spinulose teeth sori in rows
each side of the midvein one to each tooth and often scattering on the
lower pinules indusium large minutely glandular variable
this fern has been thought to be a hybrid between the crested and spinulose
ferns but is now regarded as distinct like the crested fern its fertile
fronds wither in autumn while its sterile blades remain green throughout
the winter it differs from it however by being twice pinnate below and
from the typical spinulose fern by its glandular indusium but from the
intermediate variety it is more difficult to separate it as that also has
indusiate glands the collector needs to study authentic specimens and
have in mind the type with its rather long narrow blade as an aid to the
verbal description and even then he will often find it an interesting
puzzle shaded swamps throughout our area

the rachis the lower ones broadly triangular the upper ones elongated
pinnules on the inferior side of the pinn often elongated especially the
lower pair the pinnule nearest the rachis being usually the longest at
least in the lowest pinn pinnules variously cut into spinulosetoothed
segments indusium smooth without marginal glands
the common european type but in this country far less common than its
varieties they all prefer rich damp woods and because of their
graceful outline and spinytoothed lobes are very attractive they can be
transplanted without great difficulty and the fern garden depends upon
them for its most effective lacework
var intermdium has the scales of the stipe brown with darker center
fronds ovateoblong often tripinnate pinn spreading oblonglanceolate
pinnules pinnately cleft the oblong lobes spinulosetoothed at the apex
margin of the indusium denticulate and beset with minute stalked glands
in woods nearly everywhereour most common form millions of fronds of
this variety are gathered in our northern woods placed in cold storage and
sent to florists to be used in decorationsa as long as the roots are not
disturbed the crop is renewed from year to year and no great harm seems to
result canada to kentucky and westward

by the yard says woolson with the most graceful and filmy of our common
ferns the bladder fern this fern and the maidenhair were introduced into
europe in 1628 by john tradescant the first from america
it delights in shaded ravines and dripping hillsides in limestone
districts while producing spores freely it seems to propagate its species
mainly by bulblets which falling into a moist soil at once send out a
pair of growing roots while a tiny frond starts to uncoil from the heart
of the bulb mt toby mass willoughby mountain vt calcareous regions
in maine and west of the connecticut river newfoundland to manitoba

2 the common bladder fern
cystopteris frgilis filix frgilis
stipe long and brittle fronds oblonglanceolate five to twelve
inches long twice pinnate the pinn often pinnatifid or cuttoothed
ovatelanceolate decurrent on the winged rachis indusium appearing acute
at the free end very variable in the cutting of the pinnules
the fragile bladder fern as it is often called and which the name
frgilis suggests is the earliest to appear in the spring and the
first to disappear as by the end of july it has discharged its spores and
withered away often however a new crop springs up by the last of august
as if nature were renewing her youth in outline the fragile bladder fern
suggests the bluntlobed woodsia but in the latter the pinn and pinnules
are usually broader and blunter and its indusium splits into jagged lobes
rather common in damp shady places where rocks abound in one form or
another found nearly throughout the world though only on mountains in the
tropics

while dennstadtia is the approved scientific name of this species the
name dicksnia has come to be used almost as commonly as hay scented fern
or boulder fern it is one of our most graceful and delicate species its
longtapering outline suggesting the bulblet bladder fern it delights to
cluster around rocks and boulders in upland fields and pastures and in the
margin of rocky woods it is sweetscented in drying a fine species for
the fernery and one of the most decorative of the entire fern family

the sensitive and ostrich ferns
onocla ptertis mattuccia struthipteris
last three names applied to ostrich fern only
it is a question whether the sensitive and ostrich fern should be included
in the same genus they are similar in many respects but not in all the
sensitive fern has a running rootstock scattered fronds and netted veins
while the ostrich fern has an upright rootstock fronds in crowns and
free veins
illustration sensitive fern gradations from leaf to fruit
obtusilobata form
1 sensitive fern onocla sensbilis
fronds one to three feet high scattered along a creeping rootstock
broadly triangular deeply pinnatifid with segments sinuately lobed or
nearly entire veins reticulated with fine meshes the fertile fronds
shorter closely bipinnate with the pinnules rolled up into berrylike
structures which contain the spore cases the name in greek means a closed
vessel in allusion to the berrylike fertile segments the sensitive
fern is so called from its being very sensitive to frost the sterile and
fertile fronds are totally unlike the latter not coming out of the ground
until about july when they appear like rows of small green grapes or
berries but soon turn dark and remain erect all winter and often do not
discharge their spores until the following spring the little berrylike
structures of the fertile frond represent pinnules bearing fruitdots
around which they are closely rolled as waters remarks most ferns hold
the sori in the open hand but the sensitive fern grasps them tightly in
the clenched fist
var obtusilobat is an abortive form with the fertile segments only
partially developed the illustration shows several intermediate forms

channeled stipe fertile fronds shorter pinnate with margins of the pinn
revolute into a necklace form containing the sori

the rootstocks send out slender underground stolons which bear fronds the
next year sterile fronds appear throughout the summer fertile ones in
july seen from a distance its graceful leafcrowns resemble those of the
cinnamon fern an intermediate form between the fertile and sterile fronds
is sometimes found as in the sensitive fern this handsome species
thrives under cultivation for grace and dignity it is unrivaled and for
aggressiveness it is perhaps equaled only by the lady fern for the
climax of beauty it should be combined with the maidenhair the ostrich
fern is fairly common in alluvial soil over the united states and canada

the flowering fern family
osmundceae
this family is represented in north america by three species all of which
belong to the single genus
osmnda
the osmundas are tall swamp ferns growing in large crowns from strong
thickened rootstocks the fruiting portion of the fertile frond much
contracted and quite unlike the sterile sporangia large globular
shortstalked borne on the margin of the divisions and opening into two
valves by a longitudinal slit ring obscure from osmunder a name of the
god thor
1 flowering fern royal fern
osmnda reglis osmunda reglis var spectbilis
fronds pale green one to six feet high sterile part bipinnate each pinna
having numerous pairs of lanceoblong serrulate pinnules alternate along
the midrib fruiting panicle of the frond six to twelve inches long brown
when mature and sometimes leafy
a magnificent fern universally admired well named by the great
linnus regalis royal indeed in its type of queenly beauty the
winecolored stipes of the uncoiling fronds shooting up in early spring
lifting gracefully their pink pinn and pretty panicles of bright green
spore cases throw an indescribable charm over the meadows and clothe even
the wet stagnant swamps with beauty nor is the attraction less when the
showy fronds expand in summer and the green sporangia are turned to brown
the stout rootstocks are often erect rising several inches to a foot
above the ground as if in imitation of a tree fern the poet wordworth
hints at somewhat different origin of the name from that given here
  fair ferns and flowers and chiefly that tall fern
   so stately of the queen osmanda named
illustration royal or flowering fern osmunda regalis
the royal fern may be transplanted with success if given good soil
sufficient shade and plenty of water common in swamps and damp places
newfoundland to virginia and northwestward

2 interrupted fern claytons fern
osmunda claytonina
fronds pinnate one to five feet high pinn cut into oblong obtuse lobes
fertile fronds taller than the sterile having from one to five pairs of
intermediate pinn contracted and bearing sporangia
illustration interrupted fern osmunda claytonina
the fronds have a bluishgreen tint they mature their spores about the
last of may the sterile fronds may be distinguished from those of the
cinnamon fern by not having retained like those a tuft of wool at the
base of each pinna besides in claytons fern the fronds are broader
blunter and thinner in texture and the segments more rounded the fronds
are also more inclined to curve outwards they turn yellow in the fall at
times flooding the woods with golden light but soon smitten by the early
frosts they wither and disappear the interrupted fern is rather common in
damp rocky woods and pastures newfoundland to minnesota south to north
carolina and missouri although fond of moisture it is easily cultivated
and its graceful outlines make it worthy of a prominent place in the
fern garden var dubia has the pinnules of the sterile frond widely
separated and the uppermiddle ones much elongated southern vermont

3 cinnamon fern brakes
osmunda cinnamomea
fronds one to six feet long pinnate pinn lanceolate pinnatifid with
oblong obtuse divisions fertile pinn on separate fronds which are
contracted and covered with brown sporangia
illustration cinnamon fern leaf gradations
illustration cinnamon fern gradations from sterile to fertile fronds
illustration cinnamon fern var frondosa
each fertile frond springs up at first outside the sterile ones but is
soon surrounded and overtopped by them and finds itself in the center of
a charming circle of green leaves curving gracefully outwards in a short
time however it withers and hangs down or falls to the ground the large
conspicuous clusters of cinnamon ferns give picturesqueness to many a
moist hillside pasture and swampy woodyard in its crosier stage it is
wrapped in wool which falls away as the fronds expand but leaves at the
base of each pinna a tiny tuft as if to mark its identity
illustration cinnamon fern var incisa maine
many people in the country call the cinnamon fern the buckhorn brake and
eat with relish the tender part which they find deep within the crown at
the base of the unfolding fronds this is known as the heart of osmund
the fern itself with its tall recurving leaves makes a beautiful
ornament for the shady lawn and like the interrupted fern is easy to
cultivate the spores of all the osmundas are green and need to
germinate quickly or they lose their vitality common in low and swampy
grounds in eastern north america and south america and japan may some
think it was this species which was coupled with the serpent in the old
rhyme
  break the first brake you see
  kill the first snake you see
  and you will conquer every enemy

var frondsa has its fronds partly sterile below and irregularly fertile
towards the summit
var incsa has the inner pinnules of some of the pinn more or less
cuttoothed
var glandulsa has glandular hairs on the pinn rachis and even the
stipes of the sterile frond this is known only on the coastal plain from
rhode island to maryland

curly grass family
schizce
curly grass schizea puslla
small slender ferns with linear or thready leaves the sterile one to
two inches high and tortuous or curled like corkscrews fertile fronds
longer three to five inches and bearing at the top about five pairs of
minute fruited pinn sporangia large ovoid sessile in a double row
along the single vein of the narrow divisions of the fertile leaves and
provided with a complete apical ring schiza from a greek root meaning
to split alluding to the cleft leaves of foreign species
illustration curly grass schiza pusilla
the curly grass is so minute that it is difficult to distinguish it when
growing amid its companion plants the grasses mosses sundews club
mosses etc the sterile leaves are evergreen pine barrens of new jersey
grand lake nova scotia and in new brunswick several new stations for the
curly grass have recently been discovered in the southwest counties of nova
scotia by the gray herbarium expedition mostly in bogs and hollows of
sandy peat or sphagnum

  the shadow of the thicket lies
  bryant
fronds slender climbing or twining three to five feet long the lower
pinn frondlets sterile roundish five to seven lobed distant in pairs
with simple veins the upper fertile contracted several times forked
forming a terminal panicle the ultimate segments crowded and bearing
the sporangia which are similar to those of curly grass and fixed to a
veinlet by the inner side next the base one or rarely two covered by each
indusium from the greek meaning like a willow twig pliant alluding to
the flexible stipes
illustration climbing fern lygodium palmatum
fifty years ago this beautiful fern was more common than at present there
was a considerable colony in a low alluvial meadow thicket at north
hadley mass not far from mt toby where we collected it freely in 1872
many used to decorate their homes with its handsome sprays draping it
gracefully over mirrors and pictures it was known locally as the hartford
fern greedy spoilers ruthlessly robbed its colonies and it became scarce
at least in the mt toby region in connecticut a law was enacted in 1867
for its protection and with good results but as mr ca weatherby states
in the american fern journal vol ii no 4 the encroachments of tillage
mainly of tobacco which likes the same soil are forcing it from its
cherished haunts thus jeopardizing its survival doubtless an aggressive
agriculture is in part responsible for its scarcity in the more northern
locality it is still found here and there in new england new york and new
jersey also in kentucky tennessee and florida but is nowhere common
the fertile portion dies when the spores mature but the sterile frondlets
remain green through the winter a handsome species for the fernery in the
house or out of doors

adders tongue family
ophioglossce
plants more or less fernlike consisting of a stem with a single leaf in
ophioglssum the leaf or sterile segment is entire the veins reticulated
and the sporangia in a simple spike in botrchium the sterile segment is
more or less incised the veins free and the sori in a panicle or compound
or rarely simple spike sporangia naked opening by a transverse slit
spores copious sulphuryellow
adders tongue ophioglssum vulgtum
rootstock erect fleshy stem simple two to ten inches high bearing
one smooth entire leaf about midway and a terminal spike embracing the
sporangia coherent in two ranks on its edges generic name from the greek
meaning the tongue of a snake in allusion to the narrow spike of the
sporangia
in moist meadows or rarely on dry slopes overlooked rather than rare
new england states and in general widely distributed july often grows
in company with the ragged orchis the ancient ointment known as adders
speare ointment had the adders tongue leaves as a chief ingredient and
is said to be still used for wounds in english villages
  for them that are with newts or snakes or adders stung
  he seeketh out a herb thats called adders tongue

segments turned down in the bud the sterile overtopping and clasping the
fertile one
illustration the matricary fern botrychium ramsum
the matricary fern differs from the preceding in ripening its spores about
a month earlier in having its sterile frond stalked besides being a
taller and fleshier plant it may also be noted that in the lanceleaved
species the midveins of the larger lobes are continuous running to the
tip whereas in the matricary fern the midveins fork repeatedly and are
soon indistinguishable from the veinlets the two are apt to grow near each
other with the rattlesnake fern as a near neighbor june
note in 1897 aa eaton discovered certain botrychia in a sphagnum
swamp in new hampshire to which he gave the specific name of botrychium
tenebrsum the plants were very small not averaging above two or three
inches high with the sterile blade sessile or slightly stalked many
botanists prefer to place this fern as a variety of the matricary but
others regard it as a form of botrychium smplex borders of maple

note
the student should have some idea of the terms genus species and
variety although they are not capable of exact definition
a species or kind is in botany the unit of classification it embraces
all such individuals as may have originated in a common stock such
individuals bear an essential resemblance to each other as well as to
their common parent in all their parts eg the cinnamon fern is a kind
or species of fern with the fronds evidently of one kind and of a common
origin and all producing individuals of their own kind by their spores or
rootstocks when such individuals differ perceptibly from the type in the
shape of the pinn or the cutting of the fronds we have varieties as
frondsum incsum etc or if the difference is less striking the
word form is used instead of variety but in any given case opinions may
differ in respect to the more fitting term
a genus is an assemblage of species closely related to each other and
having more points of resemblance than of difference eg the royal fern
the cinnamon fern and the interrupted fern are alike in having similar
spore cases borne in a somewhat similar manner on the fronds and forming
the genus osmunda in like manner certain members of the clover
groupred white yellow etc make up the genus trifolium
thus individuals are grouped into species and species are associated into
genera and the two groups are united to give each fern or plant its true
name the generic name being qualified by that of the species as in the
cinnamon fern osmnda genus cinnammea species

the petrified fern
  in a valley centuries ago
  grew a little fernleaf green and slender
  veining delicate and fibers tender
  waving when the wind crept down so low
  rushes tall and moss and grass grew round it
  playful sunbeams darted in and found it
  drops of dew stole down by night and crowned it
  but no foot of man eer came that way
  earth was young and keeping holiday
  monster fishes swam the silent main
  stately forests waved their giant branches
  mountains hurled their snowy avalanches
  mammoth creatures stalked across the plain
  nature reveled in grand mysteries
  but the little fern was not of these
  did not slumber with the hills and trees
  only grew and waved its wild sweet way
  no one came to note it day by day
  earth one time put on a frolic mood
  heaved the rocks and changed the mighty motion
  of the deep strong currents of the ocean
  moved the plain and shook the haughty wood
  crushed the little fern in soft moist clay
  covered it and hid it safe away
  oh the long long centuries since that day
  oh the changes oh lifes bitter cost
  since the useless little fern was lost
  useless lost there came a thoughtful man
  searching natures secrets far and deep
  from a fissure in a rocky steep
  he withdrew a stone oer which there ran
  fairy pencilings a quaint design
  leafage veining fibers clear and fine
  and the ferns life lay in every line
  so i think god hides some souls away
  sweetly to surprise us the last daymb branc
