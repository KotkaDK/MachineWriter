preface
in this volume the terminal phenomena of the sexual process are discussed
before an attempt is finally made in the concluding volume to consider
the bearings of the psychology of sex on that part of morals which may be
called social hygiene
under erotic symbolism i include practically all the aberrations of the
sexual instinct although some of these have seemed of sufficient
importance for separate discussion in previous volumes it is highly
probable that many readers will consider that the name scarcely suffices
to cover manifestations so numerous and so varied the term sexual
equivalents will seem preferable to some while however it may be fully
admitted that these perversions are sexual equivalentsor at all events
equivalents of the normal sexual impulsethat term is merely a
descriptive label which tells us nothing of the phenomena sexual
symbolism gives us the key to the process the key that makes all these
perversions intelligible in all of themvery clearly in some as in
shoefetichism more obscurely in others as in exhibitionismit has come
about by causes congenital acquired or both that some object or class
of objects some act or group of acts has acquired a dynamic power over
the psychophysical mechanism of the sexual process deflecting it from
its normal adjustment to the whole of a beloved person of the opposite
sex there has been a transmutation of values and certain objects
certain acts have acquired an emotional value which for the normal person
they do not possess such objects and acts are properly it seems to me
termed symbols and that term embodies the only justification that in most
cases these manifestations can legitimately claim
the mechanism of detumescence brings us at last to the final climax for
which the earlier and more prolonged stage of tumescence which has
occupied us so often in these studies is the elaborate preliminary
the art of love a clever woman novelist has written is the art of
preparation that preparation is on the physiological side the
production of tumescence and all courtship is concerned in building up
tumescence but the final conjugation of two individuals in an explosion
of detumescence thus slowly brought about though it is largely an
involuntary act is still not without its psychological implications and
consequences and it is therefore a matter for regret that so little is
yet known about it the one physiological act in which two individuals are
lifted out of all ends that center in self and become the instrument of
those higher forces which fashion the species can never be an act to be
slurred over as trivial or unworthy of study
in the brief study of the psychic state in pregnancy we at last touch
the point at which the whole complex process of sex reaches its goal a
woman with a child in her womb is the everlasting miracle which all the
romance of love all the cunning devices of tumescence and detumescence
have been invented to make manifest the psychic state of the woman who
thus occupies the supreme position which life has to offer cannot fail to
be of exceeding interest from many points of view and not least because
the maternal instinct is one of the elements even of love between the
sexes but the psychology of pregnancy is full of involved problems and
here again as so often in the wide field we have traversed we stand at
the threshold of a door it is not yet given us to pass

the definition of erotic symbolismsymbolism of act and symbolism of
objecterotic fetichismwide extension of the symbols of sexthe
immense variety of possible erotic fetichesthe normal foundations of
erotic symbolismclassification of the phenomenathe tendency to
idealize the defects of a beloved personstendhals crystallization
by erotic symbolism i mean that tendency whereby the lovers attention
is diverted from the central focus of sexual attraction to some object or
process which is on the periphery of that focus or is even outside of it
altogether though recalling it by association of contiguity or of
similarity it thus happens that tumescence or even in extreme cases
detumescence may be provoked by the contemplation of acts or objects
which are away from the end of sexual conjugation1
in considering the phenomena of sexual selection in a previous volume2
it was found that there are four or five main factors in the constitution
of beauty in so far as beauty determines sexual selection erotic
symbolism is founded on the factor of individual taste in beauty it
arises as a specialized development of that factor but it is
nevertheless incorrect to merge it in sexual selection the attractive
characteristics of a beloved woman or man from the point of view of
sexual selection are a complex but harmonious whole leading up to a
desire for the complete possession of the person who displays them there
is no tendency to isolate and dissociate any single character from the
individual and to concentrate attention upon that character at the expense
of the attention bestowed upon the individual generally as soon as such a
tendency begins to show itself even though only in a slight or temporary
form we may say that there is erotic symbolism
erotic symbolism is however by no means confined to the individualizing
tendency to concentrate amorous attention upon some single characteristic
of the adult woman or man who is normally the object of sexual love the
adult human being may not be concerned at all the attractive object or
act may not even be human not even animal and we may still be concerned
with a symbol which has parasitically rooted itself on the fruitful site
of sexual emotion and absorbed to itself the energy which normally goes
into the channels of healthy human love having for its final end the
procreation of the species thus understood in its widest sense it may be
said that every sexual perversion even homosexuality is a form of erotic
symbolism for we shall find that in every case some object or act that
for the normal human being has little or no erotic value has assumed such
value in a supreme degree that is to say it has become a symbol of the
normal object of love certain perversions are however of such great
importance on account of their wide relationships that they cannot be
adequately discussed merely as forms of erotic symbolism this is notably
the case as regards homosexuality autoerotism and algolagnia all of
which phenomena have therefore been separately discussed in previous
studies we are now mainly concerned with manifestations which are more
narrowly and exclusively symbolical
a portion of the field of erotic symbolism is covered by what binet
followed by lombroso krafftebing and others has termed erotic
fetichism or the tendency whereby sexual attraction is unduly exerted by
some special part or peculiarity of the body or by some inanimate object
which has become associated with it such erotic symbolism of object
cannot however be dissociated from the even more important erotic
symbolism of process and the two are so closely bound together that we
cannot attain a truly scientific view of them until we regard them broadly
as related parts of a common psychic tendency if as groos asserts3 a
symbol has two chief meanings one in which it indicates a physical
process which stands for a psychic process and another in which it
indicates a part which represents the whole erotic symbolism of act
corresponds to the first of these chief meanings and erotic symbolism of
object to the other
although it is not impossible to find some germs of erotic symbolism in
animals in its more pronounced manifestations it is only found in the
human species it could not be otherwise for such symbolism involves not
only the play of fancy and imagination the idealizing aptitude but also
a certain amount of power of concentrating the attention on a point
outside the natural path of instinct and the ability to form new mental
constructions around that point there are indeed as we shall see
elementary forms of erotic symbolism which are not uncommonly associated
with feeblemindedness but even these are still peculiarly human and in
its less crude manifestations erotic symbolism easily lends itself to
every degree of human refinement and intelligence
    it depends primarily upon an increase of the psychological
    process of representation colin scott remarks of sexual
    symbolism generally involving greater powers of comparison and
    analysis as compared with the lower animals the outer
    impressions come to be clearly distinguished as such but at the
    same time are often treated as symbols of inner experiences and
    a meaning read into them which they would not otherwise possess
    symbolism or fetichism is indeed just the capacity to see
    meaning to emphasize something for the sake of other things
    which do not appear in brain terms it indicates an activity of
    the higher centers a sort of sidetracking or longcircuiting of
    the primitive energy  rosettis poem the woodspurge
    gives a concrete example of the formation of such a symbol here
    the otherwise insignificant presentation of the threecupped
    woodspurge representing originally a mere sidecurrent of the
    stream of consciousness becomes the intellectual symbol or
    fetich of the whole psychosis forever after it seems indeed as
    if the stronger the emotion the more likely will become the
    formation of an overlying symbolism which serves to focus and
    stand in the place of something greater than itself nowhere at
    least is symbolism a more characteristic feature than as an
    expression of the sexual instinct the passion of sex with its
    immense hereditary background in early man became centered often
    upon the most trivial and unimportant features this
    symbolism now become fetichistic or symbolic in a bad sense is
    at least an exercise of the increasing representative power of
    man upon which so much of his advancement has depended while it
    also served to express and help to purify his most perennial
    emotion colin scott sex and art american journal of
    psychology vol vii no 2 p 189
in the study of love and pain in a previous volume the analysis of the
large and complex mass of sexual phenomena which are associated with pain
gradually resolved them to a considerable extent into a special case of
erotic symbolism pain or restraint whether inflicted on or by the loved
person becomes by a psychic process that is usually unconscious the
symbol of the sexual mechanism and hence arouses the same emotions as
that mechanism normally arouses we may now attempt to deal more broadly
and comprehensively with the normal and abnormal aspects of erotic
symbolism in some of their most typical and least mixed forms
when our human imagination seeks to animate artificial things huysmans
writes in lbas it is compelled to reproduce the movements of animals
in the act of propagation look at machines at the play of pistons in the
cylinders they are romeos of steel in juliets of castiron and not only
in the work of mans hands but throughout nature we find sexual symbols
which are the less deniable since for the most part they make not the
slightest appeal to even the most morbid human imagination language is
full of metaphorical symbols of sex which constantly tend to lose their
poetic symbolism and to become commonplace semen is but seed and for the
latins especially the whole process of human sex as well as the male and
female organs constantly presented itself in symbols derived from
agricultural and horticultural life the testicles were beans fab and
fruit or apples poma and mala the penis was a tree arbor or a
stalk thyrsus or a root radix or a sickle falx or a
ploughshare vomer the semen again was dew ros the labia majora
or minora were wings al the vulva and vagina were a field ager
and campus or a ploughed furrow sulcus or a vineyard vinea
or a fountain fons while the pudendal hair was herbage
plantaria4 in other languages it is not difficult to trace similar
and even identical imagery applied to sexual organs and sexual acts thus
it is noteworthy that shakespeare more than once applies the term
ploughed to a woman who has had sexual intercourse the talmud calls the
labia minora the doors the labia majora hinges and the clitoris the key
the greeks appear not only to have found in the myrtleberry the fruit of
a plant sacred to venus the image of the clitoris but also in the rose
an image of the feminine labia in the poetic literature of many
countries indeed this imagery of the rose may be traced in a more or
less veiled manner5
the widespread symbolism of sex arose in the theories and conceptions of
primitive peoples concerning the function of generation and its nearest
analogies in nature it was continued for the sake of the vigorous and
expressive terminology which it furnished both for daily life and for
literature its final survivals were cultivated because they furnished a
delicately sthetic method of approaching matters which a growing
refinement of sentiment made it difficult for lovers and poets to approach
in a more crude and direct manner its existence is of interest to us now
because it shows the objective validity of the basis on which erotic
symbolism as we have here to understand it develops but from first to
last it is a distinct phenomenon having a more or less reasoned and
intellectual basis and it scarcely serves in any degree to feed the
sexual impulse erotic symbolism is not intellectual but emotional in its
origin it starts into being obscurely with but a dim consciousness or
for the most part none at all either suddenly from the shock of some
usually youthful experience or more gradually through an instinctive
brooding on those things which are most intimately associated with a
sexually desirable person
    the kind of soil on which the germs of erotic symbolism may
    develop is well seen in cases of sexual hypersthesia in such
    cases all the emotionally sexual analogies and resemblances
    which in erotic symbolism are fixed and organized may be traced
    in vague and passing forms a single hypersthetic individual
    perhaps presenting a great variety of germinal symbolisms
    thus it has been recorded of an italian nun whose sister became
    a prostitute that from the age of 8 she had desire for coitus
    from the age of 10 masturbated and later had homosexual
    feelings that the same feelings and practices continued after
    she had taken the veil though from time to time they assumed
    religious equivalents the mere contact indeed of a priests
    hand the news of the presentation of an ecclesiastic she had
    known to a bishopric the sight of an ape the contemplation of
    the crucified christ the figure of a toy the picture of a
    demon the act of defecation in the children entrusted to her
    care whom on this account and against the regulations she
    would accompany to the closets especially the sight and the
    mere recollection of flies in sexual connectionall these things
    sufficed to produce in her a powerful orgasm archivio di
    psichiatria 1902 fasc iiiii p 338
    a boy of 15 given to masturbation studied by macdonald in
    america was similarly hypersthetic to the symbols of sexual
    emotion i like amusing myself with my comrades he told
    macdonald rolling ourselves into a ball which gives one a
    funny kind of warmth i have a special pleasure in talking about
    some things it is the same when the governess kisses me on
    saying good night or when i lean against her breast i have that
    sensation too when i see some of the pictures in the comic
    papers but only in those representing a woman as when a young
    man skating trips up a girl so that her clothes are raised a
    little when i read how a man saved a young girl from drowning
    so that they swam together i had the same sensation looking at
    the statues of women in the museum produces the same effect or
    when i see naked babies or when a mother suckles a child i
    have often had that sensation when reading novels i ought not to
    read or when looking at a newborn calf or seeing dogs and cows
    and horses mounting on each other when i see a girl flirting
    with a boy or leaning on his shoulder or with his arm round her
    waist i have an erection it is the same when i see women and
    little girls in bathing costume or when boys talk of what their
    fathers and mothers do together in the natural history museum i
    often see things which give me that sensation one day when i
    read how a man killed a young girl and carried her into a wood
    and undressed her i had a feeling of enjoyment when i read of
    men who were bastards the idea of a woman having a child in that
    way gives me this sensation some dances and seeing young girls
    astride a horse excited me too and so in a circus when a woman
    was shot out of a cannon and her skirts flew in the air it has
    no effect on me when i see men naked sometimes i enjoy seeing
    womens underclothes in a shop or when i see a lady or a girl
    buying them especially if they are drawers when i saw a lady in
    a dress which buttoned from top to bottom it had more effect on
    me than seeing underclothes seeing dogs coupling gives me more
    pleasure than looking at pretty women but less than looking at
    pretty little girls in order of increasing intensity he placed
    the phenomena that affected him thus the coupling of flies then
    of horses then the sight of womens undergarments then a boy
    and a girl flirting then cows mounting on each other the
    statues of women with naked breasts then contact with the
    governesss body and breasts finally coitus arthur macdonald
    le crimineltype pp 126 et seq
    it is worthy of remark that the instinct of nutrition when
    restrained may exhibit something of an analogous symbolism
    though in a minor degree to that of sex the ways in which a
    hypersthetic hunger may seek its symbols are illustrated in the
    case of a young woman called nadia who during several years was
    carefully studied by janet it is a case of obsession maladie
    du scrupule simulating hysterical anorexia in which the
    patient for fear of getting fat reduced her nourishment to the
    smallest possible amount nadia is generally hungry even very
    hungry one can tell this by her actions from time to time she
    forgets herself to such an extent as to devour greedily anything
    she can put her hands on at other times when she cannot resist
    the desire to eat she secretly takes a biscuit she feels
    horrible remorse for the action but all the same she does it
    again her confidences are very curious she recognizes that a
    great effort is needed to avoid eating and considers she is a
    heroine to resist so long sometimes i spent whole hours in
    thinking about food i was so hungry i swallowed my saliva i
    bit my handkerchief i rolled on the floor i wanted to eat so
    badly i would look in books for descriptions of meals and
    feasts and tried to deceive my hunger by imagining that i was
    sharing all these good things p janet la maladie du
    scrupule revue philosophique may 1901 p 502 the
    deviations of the instinct of nutrition are however confined
    within narrow limits and in the nature of things hunger
    unlike sexual desire cannot easily accept a fetich
there is almost no feature article of dress attitude act stanley
hall declares or even animal or perhaps object in nature that may not
have to some morbid soul specialized erogenic and erethic power6 even
a mere shadow may become a fetich goron tells of a merchant in parisa
man with a reputation for ability happily married and the father of a
family altogether irreproachable in his private lifewho was returning
home one evening after a game of billiards with a friend when on
chancing to raise his eyes he saw against a lighted window the shadow of
a woman changing her chemise he fell in love with that shadow and
returned to the spot every evening for many months to gaze at the window
yetand herein lies the fetichismhe made no attempt to see the woman or
to find out who she was the shadow sufficed he had no need of the
realty7 it is even possible to have a negative fetich the absence of
some character being alone demanded and the case has been recorded in
chicago of an american gentleman of average intelligence education and
good habits who having as a boy cherished a pure affection for a girl
whose leg had been amputated throughout life was relatively impotent with
normal women but experienced passion and affection for women who had lost
a leg he was found by his wife to be in extensive correspondence with
onelegged women all over the country expending no little money on the
purchase of artificial legs for his various proteges8
it is important to remember however that while erotic symbolism becomes
fantastic and abnormal in its extreme manifestations it is in its
essence absolutely normal it is only in the very grossest forms of sexual
desire that it is altogether absent stendhal described the mental side of
the process of tumescence as a crystallization a process whereby certain
features of the beloved person present points around which the emotions
held in solution in the lovers mind may concentrate and deposit
themselves in dazzling brilliance this process inevitably tends to take
place around all those features and objects associated with the beloved
person which have most deeply impressed the lovers mind and the more
sensitive and imaginative and emotional he is the more certainly will such
features and objects crystallize into erotic symbols devotion and love
wrote mary wollstonecraft may be allowed to hallow the garments as well
as the person for the lover must want fancy who has not a sort of sacred
respect for the glove or slipper of his mistress he would not confound
them with vulgar things of the same kind and nearly two centuries
earlier burton who had gathered together so much of the ancient lore of
love clearly asserted the entirely normal character of erotic symbolism
not one of a thousand falls in love he declares but there is some
peculiar part or other which pleaseth most and inflames him above the
rest if he gets any remnant of hers a buskpoint a feather of her
fan a shoetie a lace a ring a bracelet of hair he wears it for a
favor on his arm in his hat finger or next his heart as laodamia did
by protesilaus when he went to war sit at home with his picture before
her a garter or a bracelet of hers is more precious than any saints
relique he lays it up in his casket o blessed relique and every day
will kiss it if in her presence his eye is never off her and drink he
will where she drank if it be possible in that very place etc9
    burtons accuracy in describing the ways of lovers in his century
    is shown by a passage in hamiltons mmoires de gramont miss
    price one of the beauties of charles iis court and dongan were
    tenderly attached to each other when the latter died he left
    behind a casket full of all possible sorts of lovetokens
    pertaining to his mistress including among other things all
    kinds of hair and as regards france burtons contemporary
    howell wrote in 1627 in his familiar letters concerning the
    repulse of the english at rh a captain told me that when they
    were rifling the dead bodies of the french gentlemen after the
    first invasion they found that many of them had their mistresses
    favors tied about their genitories
    schurig spermatologia p 357 at the beginning of the
    eighteenth century knew a belgian lady who when her dearly loved
    husband died secretly cut off his penis and treasured it as a
    sacred relic in a silver casket she eventually powdered it he
    adds and found it an efficacious medicine for herself and
    others an earlier example of a lady at the french court who
    embalmed and perfumed the genital organs of her dead husband
    always preserving them in a gold casket is mentioned by
    brantme mantegazza knew a man who kept for many years on his
    desk the skull of his dead mistress making it his dearest
    companion some he remarks have slept for months and years
    with a book a garment a trifle i once had a friend who would
    spend long hours of joy and emotion kissing a thread of silk
    which she had held between her fingers now the only relic of
    love mantegazza fisiologia dell amore cap x in the
    same way i knew a lady who in old age still treasured in her
    desk as the one relic of the only man she had ever been
    attracted to a fragment of paper he had casually twisted up in a
    conversation with her half a century before
the tendency to treasure the relics of a beloved person more especially
the garments is the simplest and commonest foundation of erotic
symbolism it is without doubt absolutely normal it is inevitable that
those objects which have been in close contact with the beloved persons
body and are intimately associated with that person in the lovers mind
should possess a little of the same virtue the same emotional potency it
is a phenomenon closely analogous to that by which the relics of saints
are held to possess a singular virtue but it becomes somewhat less normal
when the garment is regarded as essential even in the presence of the
beloved person10
while an extremely large number of objects and acts may be found to
possess occasionally the value of erotic symbols such symbols most
frequently fall into certain welldefined groups a vast number of
isolated objects or acts may be exceptionally the focus of erotic
contemplation but the objects and acts which frequently become thus
symbolic are comparatively few
it seems to me that the phenomena of erotic symbolism may be most
conveniently grouped in three great classes on the basis of the objects
or acts which arouse them
i parts of the bodya normal hand foot breasts nates hair
secretions and excretions etc
b abnormal lameness squinting pitting of smallpox etc paidophilia
or the love of children presbyophilia or the love of the aged and
necrophilia or the attraction for corpses may be included under this
head as well as the excitement caused by various animals
ii inanimate objects11a garments gloves shoes and stockings and
garters caps aprons handkerchiefs underlinen
b impersonal objects here may be included all the various objects that
may accidentally acquire the power of exciting sexual feeling in
autoerotism pygmalionism may also be included
iii acts and attitudesa active whipping cruelty exhibitionism
b passive being whipped experiencing cruelty personal odors and the
sound of the voice may be included under this head c mixoscopic the
vision of climbing swinging etc the acts of urination and defecation
the coitus of animals
although the three main groups into which the phenomena of erotic
symbolism are here divided may seem fairly distinct they are yet very
closely allied and indeed overlap so that it is possible as we shall
see for a single complex symbol to fall into all three groups
a very complete kind of erotic symbolism is furnished by pygmalionism or
the love of statues12 it is exactly analogous to the childs love of a
doll which is also a form of sexual though not erotic symbolism in a
somewhat less abnormal form erotic symbolism probably shows itself in its
simplest shape in the tendency to idealize unbeautiful peculiarities in a
beloved person so that such peculiarities are ever afterward almost or
quite essential in order to arouse sexual attraction in this way men have
become attracted to limping women even the most normal man may idealize a
trifling defect in a beloved woman the attention is inevitably
concentrated on any such slight deviation from regular beauty and the
natural result of such concentration is that a complexus of associated
thoughts and emotions becomes attached to something that in itself is
unbeautiful a defect becomes an admired focus of attention the embodied
symbol of the lovers emotion
    thus a mole is not in itself beautiful but by the tendency to
    erotic symbolism it becomes so persian poets especially have
    lavished the richest imagery on moles anis elochchq in
    bibliothque des hautes etudes fasc 25 1875 the arabs as
    lane remarks arabian society in the middle ages p 214 are
    equally extravagant in their admiration of a mole
    stendhal long since well described the process by which a defect
    becomes a sexual symbol even little defects in a womans face
    he remarked such as a smallpox pit may arouse the tenderness
    of a man who loves her and throw him into deep reverie when he
    sees them in another woman it is because he has experienced a
    thousand feelings in the presence of that smallpox mark that
    these feelings have been for the most part delicious all of the
    highest interest and that whatever they may have been they are
    renewed with incredible vivacity on the sight of this sign even
    when perceived on the face of another woman if in such a case we
    come to prefer and love ugliness it is only because in such a
    case ugliness is beauty a man loved a woman who was very thin
    and marked by smallpox he lost her by death three years later
    in rome he became acquainted with two women one very beautiful
    the other thin and marked by smallpox on that account if you
    will rather ugly i saw him in love with this plain one at the
    end of a week which he had employed in effacing her plainness by
    his memories de lamour chapter xvii
in the tendency to idealize the unbeautiful features of a beloved person
erotic symbolism shows itself in a simple and normal form in a less
simple and more morbid form it appears in persons in whom the normal paths
of sexual gratification are for some reasons inhibited and who are thus
led to find the symbols of natural love in unnatural perversions it is
for this reason that so many erotic symbolisms take root in childhood and
puberty before the sexual instincts have reached full development it is
for the same reason also that at the other end of life when the sexual
energies are failing erotic symbols sometimes tend to be substituted for
the normal pleasures of sex it is for this reason again that both men
and women whose normal energies are inhibited sometimes find the symbols
of sexual gratification in the caresses of children
    the case of a schoolmistress recorded by penta instructively
    shows how an erotic symbolism of this last kind may develop by no
    means as a refinement of vice but as the one form in which
    sexual gratification becomes possible when normal gratification
    has been pathologically inhibited fr aged 48 schoolmistress
    she was some years ago in an asylum with religious mania but
    came out well in a few months at the age of 12 she had first
    experienced sexual excitement in a railway train from the jolting
    of the carriage soon after she fell in love with a youth who
    represented her ideal and who returned her affection when
    however she gave herself to him great was her disillusion and
    surprise to find that the sexual act which she had looked forward
    to could not be accomplished for at the first contact there was
    great pain and spasmodic resistance of the vagina there was a
    condition of vaginismus after repeated attempts on subsequent
    occasions her lover desisted her desire for intercourse
    increased however rather than diminished and at last she was
    able to tolerate coitus but the pain was so great that she
    acquired a horror of the sexual embrace and no longer sought it
    having much will power she restrained all erotic impulses during
    many years it was not until the period of the menopause that the
    long repressed desires broke out and at last found a symbolical
    outlet that was no longer normal but was felt to supply a
    complete gratification she sought the close physical contact of
    the young children in her care she would lie on her bed naked
    with two or three naked children make them suck her breasts and
    press them to every part of her body her conduct was discovered
    by means of other children who peeped through the keyhole and
    she was placed under penta for treatment in this case the loss
    of moral and mental inhibition due probably to troubles of the
    climacteric led to indulgence under abnormal conditions in
    those primitive contacts which are normally the beginning of
    love and these supported by the ideal image of the early lover
    constituted a complete and adequate symbol of natural love in a
    morbidly perverted individual p penta archivio delle

of all forms of erotic symbolism the most frequent is that which idealizes
the foot and the shoe the phenomena we here encounter are sometimes so
complex and raise so many interesting questions that it is necessary to
discuss them somewhat fully
it would seem that even for the normal lover the foot is one of the most
attractive parts of the body stanley hall found that among the parts
specified as most admired in the other sex by young men and women who
answered a questionnaire the feet came fourth after the eyes hair
stature and size13 casanova an acute student and lover of women who
was in no degree a foot fetichist remarks that all men who share his
interest in women are attracted by their feet they offer the same
interest he considers as the question of the particular edition offers
to the booklover14
    in a report of the results of a questionnaire concerning
    childrens sense of self to which over 500 replies were
    received stanley hall thus summarizes the main facts ascertained
    with reference to the feet a special period of noticing the
    feet comes somewhat later than that in which the hands are
    discovered to consciousness our records afford nearly twice as
    many cases for feet as for hands the former are more remote from
    the primary psychic focus or position and are also more often
    covered so that the sight of them is a more marked and
    exceptional event some children become greatly excited whenever
    their feet are exposed some infants show signs of fear at the
    movement of their own knees and feet covered and still more
    often fright is the first sensation which signalizes the childs
    discovery of its feet many are described as playing with them
    as if fascinated by strange newlydiscovered toys they pick
    them up and try to throw them away or out of the cradle or
    bring them to the mouth where all things tend to go children
    often handle their feet pat and stroke them offer them toys and
    the bottle as if they too had an independent hunger to
    gratify an ego of their own children often develop later
    a special interest in the feet of others and examine feel them
    etc sometimes expressing surprise that the pinch of the
    mothers toe hurts her and not the child or comparing their own
    and the feet of others point by point curious too are the
    intensifications of footconsciousness throughout the early years
    of childhood whenever children have the exceptional privilege of
    going barefoot or have new shoes the feet are often
    apostrophized punished beaten sometimes to the point of pain
    for breaking things throwing the child down etc several
    children have habits which reach great intensity and then
    vanish of touching or tickling the feet with gales of laughter
    and a few are described as showing an almost morbid reluctance to
    wear anything upon the feet or even to having them touched by
    others several almost fall in love with the great toe or the
    little one especially admiring some crease or dimple in it
    dressing it in some rag of silk or bit of ribbon or cutoff
    glove fingers winding it with string prolonging it by tying on
    bits of wood stroking the feet of others especially if they are
    shapely often becomes almost a passion with young children and
    several adults confess a survival of the same impulse which it is
    an exquisite pleasure to gratify the interest of some mothers in
    babies toes the expressions of which are ecstatic and almost
    incredible is a factor of great importance g stanley hall
    some aspects of the early sense of self american journal of
    psychology april 1898 in childhood stanley hall remarks
    elsewhere adolescence vol ii p 104 a form of courtship
    may consist solely in touching feet under the desk it would
    seem that even animals have a certain amount of sexual
    consciousness in the feet i have noticed a male donkey just
    before coitus bite the feet of his partner
at the same time it is scarcely usual for the normal lover in most
civilized countries today to attach primary importance to the foot such
as he very frequently attaches to the eyes though the feet play a very
conspicuous part in the work of certain novelists15
in a small but not inconsiderable minority of persons however the foot
or the boot becomes the most attractive part of a woman and in some
morbid cases the woman herself is regarded as a comparatively unimportant
appendage to her feet or her boots the boots under civilized conditions
much more frequently constitute the sexual symbol than do the feet
themselves this is not surprising since in ordinary life the feet are not
often seen
    it is usually only under exceptionally favoring conditions that
    footfetichism occurs as in the case recorded by marandon de
    montyel of a doctor who had been brought up in the west indies
    his mother had been insane and he himself was subject to
    obsessions especially of being incapable of urinating he had
    had nocturnal incontinence of urine in childhood all the women
    of the people in the west indies go about with naked feet which
    are often beautiful his puberty evolved under this influence
    and footfetichism developed he especially admired large fat
    arched feet with delicate skin and large regular toes he
    masturbated with images of feet at 15 he had relations with a
    colored chambermaid but feared to mention his fetichism though
    it was the touch of her feet that chiefly excited him he now
    gave up masturbation and had a succession of mistresses but was
    always ashamed to confess his fancies until at the age of 33 in
    paris a very intelligent woman who had become his mistress
    discovered his mania and skillfully enabled him to yield to it
    without shock to his modesty he was devoted to this mistress
    who had very beautiful feet he had been horrified by the feet of
    europeans generally until she finally left him archives de
    neurologie october 1904
    probably the first case of shoefetichism ever recorded in any
    detail is that of restif de la bretonne 17341806 publicist
    and novelist one of the most remarkable literary figures of the
    later eighteenth century in france restif was a neurotic
    subject though not to an extreme degree and his shoefetichism
    though distinctly pronounced was not pathological that is to
    say that the shoe was not itself an adequate gratification of
    the sexual impulse but simply a highly important aid to
    tumescence a prelude to the natural climax of detumescence only
    occasionally and faute de mieux in the absence of the beloved
    person was the shoe used as an adjunct to masturbation in
    restifs stories and elsewhere the attraction of the shoe is
    frequently discussed or used as a motive his first decided
    literary success le pied de fanchette was suggested by a
    vision of a girl with a charming foot casually seen in the
    street while all such passages in his books are really founded
    on his own personal feelings and experiences in his elaborate
    autobiography monsieur nicolas he has frankly set forth the
    gradual evolution and cause of his idiosyncrasy the first
    remembered trace dated from the age of 4 when he was able to
    recall having remarked the feet of a young girl in his native
    place restif was a sexually precocious youth and at the age of
    9 though both delicate in health and shy in manners his
    thoughts were already absorbed in the girls around him while
    little monsieur nicolas he tells us passed for a narcissus
    his thoughts as soon as he was alone by night or by day had no
    other object than that sex he seemed to flee from the girls most
    careful of their persons were naturally those who pleased him
    most and as the part least easy to keep clean is that which
    touches the earth it was to the footgear that he mechanically
    gave his chief attention agathe reine and especially
    madeleine were the most elegant of the girls at that time their
    carefully selected and kept shoes instead of laces or buckles
    which were not yet worn at sacy had blue or rose ribbon
    according to the color of the skirt i thought of these girls
    with emotion i desiredi knew not what but i desired
    something if it were only to subdue them the origin restif
    here assigns to his shoefetichism may seem paradoxical he
    admired the girls who were most clean and neat in their dress he
    tells us and therefore paid most attention to that part of
    their clothing which was least clean and neat but however
    paradoxical the remark may seem it is psychologically sound all
    fetichism is a kind of not necessarily morbid obsession and as
    the careful work of janet and others in that field has shown an
    obsession is a fascinated attraction to some object or idea
    which gives the subject a kind of emotional shock by its
    contrast to his habitual moods or ideas the ordinary morbid
    obsession cannot usually be harmoniously coordinated with the
    other experiences of the subjects daily life and shows
    therefore no tendency to become pleasurable sexual fetichisms
    on the other hand have a reservoir of agreeable emotion to draw
    on and are thus able to acquire both stability and harmony it
    will also be seen that no element of masochism is involved in
    restifs fetichism though the mistake has been frequently made
    of supposing that these two manifestations are usually or even
    necessarily allied restif wishes to subject the girl who
    attracts him he has no wish to be subjected by her he was
    especially dazzled by a young girl from another town whose shoes
    were of a fashionable cut with buckles and who was a charming
    person besides she was delicate as a fairy and rendered his
    thoughts unfaithful to the robust beauties of his native sacy
    no doubt he remarks because being frail and weak myself it
    seemed to me that it would be easier to subdue her this taste
    for the beauty of the feet he continues was so powerful in me
    that it unfailingly aroused desire and would have made me
    overlook ugliness it is excessive in all those who have it he
    admired the foot as well as the shoe the factitious taste for
    the shoe is only a reflection of that for pretty feet when i
    entered a house and saw the boots arranged in a row as is the
    custom i would tremble with pleasure i blushed and lowered my
    eyes as if in the presence of the girls themselves with this
    vivacity of feeling and a voluptuousness of ideas inconceivable
    at the age of 10 i still fled with an involuntary impulse of
    modesty from the girls i adored
    we may clearly see how this combination of sensitive and
    precocious sexual ardor with extreme shyness furnished the soil
    on which the germ of shoefetichism was able to gain a firm root
    and persist in some degree throughout a long life very largely
    given up to a pursuit of women abnormal rather by its
    excessiveness than its perversity a few years later he tells
    us he happened to see a pretty pair of shoes in a bootmakers
    shop and on hearing that they belonged to a girl whom at that
    time he reverently adored at a distance he blushed and nearly
    fainted
    in 1749 he was for a time attracted to a young woman very much
    older than himself he secretly carried away one of her slippers
    and kept it for a day a little later he again took away a shoe
    of the same woman which had fascinated him when on her foot and
    he seems to imply he used it to masturbate with
    perhaps the chief passion of restifs life was his love for
    colette parangon he was still a boy 1752 she was the young
    and virtuous wife of the printer whose apprentice restif was and
    in whose house he lived madame parangon a charming woman as
    she is described was not happily married and she evidently
    felt a tender affection for the boy whose excessive love and
    reverence for her were not always successfully concealed
    madonna parangon he tells us possessed a charm which i could
    never resist a pretty little foot it is a charm which arouses
    more than tenderness her shoes made in paris had that
    voluptuous elegance which seems to communicate soul and life
    sometimes colette wore shoes of simple white drugget or with
    silver flowers sometimes rosecolored slippers with green heels
    or green with rose heels her supple feet far from deforming her
    shoes increased their grace and rendered the form more
    exciting one day on entering the house he saw madame parangon
    elegantly dressed and wearing rosecolored shoes with tongues
    and with green heels and a pretty rosette they were new and she
    took them off to put on green slippers with rose heels and
    borders which he thought equally exciting as soon as she had
    left the room he continues carried away by the most impetuous
    passion and idolizing colette i seemed to see her and touch her
    in handling what she had just worn my lips pressed one of these
    jewels while the other deceiving the sacred end of nature from
    excess of exaltation replaced the object of sex i cannot express
    myself more clearly the warmth which she had communicated to
    the insensible object which had touched her still remained and
    gave a soul to it a voluptuous cloud covered my eyes he adds
    that he would kiss with rage and transport whatever had come in
    close contact with the woman he adored and on one occasion
    eagerly pressed his lips to her castoff underlinen vela
    secretiora penetralium
    at this period restifs footfetichism reached its highest point
    of development it was the aberration of a highly sensitive and
    very precocious boy while the preoccupation with feet and shoes
    persisted throughout life it never became a complete perversion
    and never replaced the normal end of sexual desire his love for
    madam parangon one of the deepest emotions in his whole life
    was also the climax of his shoefetichism she represented his
    ideal woman an ethereal sylph with waspwaist and a childs
    feet it was always his highest praise for a woman that she
    resembled madame parangon and he desired that her slipper should
    be buried with him restif de la bretonne monsieur nicolas

    shoefetichism more especially if we include under this term all
    the cases of real or pseudomasochism in which an attraction to
    the boots or slippers is the chief feature is a not infrequent
    phenomenon and is certainly the most frequently occurring form
    of fetichism many cases are brought together by krafftebing in
    his psychopathia sexualis every prostitute of any experience
    has known men who merely desire to gaze at her shoes or possibly
    to lick them and who are quite willing to pay for this
    privilege in london such a person is known as a bootman in
    germany as a stiefelfrier
the predominance of the foot as a focus of sexual attraction while among
us today it is a not uncommon phenomenon is still not sufficiently
common to be called normal the majority of even ardent lovers do not
experience this attraction in any marked degree but these manifestations
of footfetichism which with us today are abnormal even when they are
not so extreme as to be morbid may perhaps become more intelligible to us
when we realize that in earlier periods of civilization and even today
in some parts of the world the foot is generally recognized as a focus of
sexual attraction so that some degree of footfetichism becomes a normal
phenomenon
the most pronounced and the best known example of such normal
footfetichism at the present day is certainly to be found among the
southern chinese for a chinese husband his wifes foot is more
interesting than her face a chinese woman is as shy of showing her feet
to a man as a european woman her breasts they are reserved for her
husbands eyes alone and to look at a womans feet in the street is
highly improper and indelicate chinese footfetichism is connected with
the custom of compressing the feet this custom appears to rest on the
fact that chinese women naturally possess a very small foot and is thus an
example of the universal tendency in the search for beauty to accentuate
even by deformation the racial characteristics but there is more than
this beauty is largely a name for sexual attractiveness and the energy
expended in the effort to make the chinese womans small foot still
smaller is a measure of the sexual fascination which it exerts the
practice arose on the basis of the sexual attractiveness of the foot
though it has doubtless served to heighten that attractiveness just as
the small waist which if we may follow stratz is a characteristic
beauty of the european woman becomes to the average european man still
more attractive when accentuated even to the extent of deformity by the
compression of the corset
    referring to the sexual fascination exerted by the foot in china
    matignon writes my attention has been drawn to this point by a
    large number of pornographic engravings of which the chinese are
    very fond in all these lascivious scenes we see the male
    voluptuously fondling the womans foot when a celestial takes
    into his hand a womans foot especially if it is very small the
    effect upon him is precisely the same as is provoked in a
    european by the palpation of a young and firm bosom all the
    celestials whom i have interrogated on this point have replied
    unanimously oh a little foot you europeans cannot understand
    how exquisite how sweet how exciting it is the contact of the
    genital organ with the little foot produces in the male an
    indescribable degree of voluptuous feeling and women skilled in
    love know that to arouse the ardor of their lovers a better
    method than all chinese aphrodisiacsincluding giusen and
    swallows nestsis to take the penis between their feet it is
    not rare to find chinese christians accusing themselves at
    confession of having had evil thoughts on looking at a womans
    foot dr j matignon a propos dun pied de chinoise
    archives danthropologie criminelle 1898
    it is said that a chinese empress noted for her vice and having
    a congenital club foot about the year 1100 bc desired all
    women to resemble her and that the practice of compressing the
    foot thus arose but this is only tradition since in 300 bc
    chinese books were destroyed morache art chine
    dictionnaire encyclopdique des sciences mdicales p 191 it
    is also said that the practice owes its origin to the wish to
    keep women indoors but women are not secluded in china nor does
    foot compression usually render a woman unable to walk many
    intelligent chinese are of opinion that its object is to promote
    the development of the sexual parts and of the thighs and so to
    aid both intercourse and parturition there is no ground for
    believing that it has any such influence though morache found
    that the mons veneris and labia are largely developed in chinese
    women and not in tartar women living in pekin who do not
    compress the foot if there is any correlation between the feet
    and the pelvic regions it is more probably congenital than due
    to the artificial compression of the feet the ancients seem to
    have believed that a small foot indicated a small vagina restif
    de la bretonne who had ample opportunities for forming an
    opinion on a matter in which he took so great an interest
    believed that a small foot round and short indicated a large
    vagina monsieur nicolas vol i reprint of 1883 p 92
    even however if we admit that there is a real correlation
    between the foot and the vagina that would by no means suffice
    to render the foot a focus of sexual attraction
    it remains the most reasonable view that the foot bandage must be
    regarded as strictly analogous to the waist bandage or corset
    which also tends to produce deformity of the constricted region
    stratz has ingeniously remarked frauenkleidung third edition
    p 101 that the success of the chinese in dwarfing trees may
    have suggested a similar attempt in regard to womens feet and
    adds that in any case both dwarfed trees and bound feet bear
    witness in the mongolian to the same love for small and elegant
    not to say deformed things for a chinaman the deformed foot is
    a golden waterlily
    many facts together with illustrations bearing on chinese
    deformation of the foot will be found in ploss das weib vol
    i section iv
the significance of the sexual emotion aroused by the female foot in china
and the origin of its compression begin to become clear when we realize
that this footfetichism is merely an extreme development of a tendency
which is fairly well marked among nearly all the peoples of yellow race
jacoby who has brought together a number of interesting facts bearing on
the sexual significance of the foot states that a similar tendency is to
be found among the mongol and turk peoples of siberia and in the east and
central parts of european russia among the permiaks the wotiaks etc
here the woman at all events when young has always her feet as well as
head covered however little clothing she may otherwise wear
    on hot nights or on baking days jacoby states you may see
    these women with uncovered breasts or even entirely naked
    without embarrassment but you will never see them with bare
    feet and no male relations except the husband will ever see
    the feet and lower part of the legs of the women in the house
    these women have their modesty in their feet and also their
    coquetry to unbind the feet of a woman is for a man a voluptuous
    act and the touch of the bands produces the same effect as a
    corset still warm from a womans body on a european man a
    womans beauty that which attracts and excites a man lies in
    her foot in mordvin love poems celebrating the beauty of women
    there is much about her attire especially her embroidered
    chemise but as regards the charms of her person the poet is
    content to state that her feet are beautiful with that
    everything is said the young peasant woman of the central
    provinces as part of her holiday raiment puts on great woolen
    stockings which come up to the groin and are then folded over to
    below the knee to uncover the feet of a person of the opposite
    sex is a sexual act and has thus become the symbol of sexual
    possession so that the stocking or footgear became the emblem
    of marriage as later the ring it was so among the jews as we
    see in the book of ruth chapter iii v 4 and chapter iv vv
    7 and 8 st vladimir the great asked in marriage the daughter
    of prince rogvold as vladimirs mother had been a serf the
    princess proudly replied that she would not uncover the feet of

    girl tries to find out by divination whom she will have as a
    husband the traditional formula is come and take my stockings
    off among the populations of the north and east it is
    sometimes the bride who must do this for her husband on the
    wedding night and sometimes the bridegroom for his wife not as
    a token of love but as a nuptial ceremony among the
    professional classes and small nobility in russia parents place
    money in the stocking of their child at marriage as a present for
    the other partner it being supposed that the couple mutually

    ourselves of children hanging up their stockings at night for
    presents would seem to be a relic of the lastmentioned custom
while we may witness the sexual symbolism of the foot with or without an
associated footfetichism most highly developed in asia and eastern
europe it has by no means been altogether unknown in some stages of
western civilization and traces of it may be found here and there even
yet schinz refers to the connection between the feet and sexual pleasure
as existing not only among the egyptians and the arabs but among the
ancient germans and the modern spaniards16 while jacoby points out that
among the greeks the romans and especially the etruscans it was usual
to represent chaste and virgin goddesses with their feet covered even
though they might be otherwise nude ovid again is never weary of
dwelling on the sexual charm of the feminine foot he represents the
chaste matron as wearing a weighted stola which always fell so as to
cover her feet it was only the courtesan or the nymph who is taking part
in an erotic festival who appears with raised robes revealing her
feet17 so grave a historian as strabo as well as lian refers to the
story of the courtesan rhodope whose sandal was carried off by an eagle
and dropped in the king of egypts lap as he was administering justice so
that he could not rest until he had discovered to whom this delicately
small sandal belonged and finally made her his queen kleinpaul who
repeats this story has collected many european sayings and customs
including turkish indicating that the slipper is a very ancient symbol
of a womans sexual parts18

    spain ever tenacious of ancient ideas appears to have preserved
    longer than other countries the ancient classic traditions in
    regard to the foot as a focus of modesty and an object of sexual
    attraction in spanish religious pictures it was always necessary
    that the virgins feet should be concealed the clergy ordaining
    that her robe should be long and flowing so that the feet might
    be covered with decent folds pacheco the master and

    to the purity of our lady the virgin than to paint her sitting

    her sacred feet uncovered and naked let thanks be given to the
    holy inquisition which commands that this liberty should be
    corrected it was pachecos duty in seville to see that these
    commands were obeyed at the court of philip iv at this time the

    the countess daulnoys account of the madrid court in the
    seventeenth century and from other sources showing how careful
    spanish ladies were as regards their feet and how jealous
    spanish husbands were in this matter at this time when spanish
    influence was considerable the fashion of spain seems to have
    spread to other countries one may note that in vandycks
    pictures of english beauties the feet are not visible though in
    the more characteristically english painters of a somewhat later
    age it became usual to display them conspicuously while the
    french custom in this matter is the farthest removed from the
    spanish at the present day a wellbred spanish woman shows as
    little as possible of her feet in walking and even in some of
    the most characteristic spanish dances there is little or no
    kicking and the feet may even be invisible throughout it is
    noteworthy that in numerous figures of spanish women probably
    artists models reproduced in plosss das weib the stockings
    are worn although the women are otherwise in most cases quite
    naked max dessoir mentions psychologie der vita sexualis

    considers this an indication of perversity i have seen the
    statement attributed to gautiers voyage en espagne where
    however it does not occur that spanish prostitutes uncover
    their feet in sign of assent and madame daulnoy stated that in
    her time to show her lover her feet was a spanish womans final
    favor
the tendency which we thus find to be normal at some earlier periods of
civilization to insist on the sexual symbolism of the feminine foot or
its coverings and to regard them as a special sexual fascination is not
without significance for the interpretation of the sporadic manifestations
of footfetichism among ourselves eccentric as footfetichism may appear
to us it is simply the reemergence by a pseudoatavism or arrest of
development of a mental or emotional impulse which was probably
experienced by our forefathers and is often traceable among young
children today19 the occasional reappearance of this bygone impulse
and the stability which it may acquire are thus conditioned by the
sensitive reaction of an abnormally nervous and usually precocious
organism to influences which among the average and ordinary population of
europe today are either never felt or quickly outgrown or very
strictly subordinated in the highly complex crystallizations which the
course of love and the process of tumescence create within us
    it may be added that this is by no means true of footfetichism
    only in some other fetichisms a seemingly congenital
    predisposition is even more marked this is not only the case as
    regards hairfetichism and furfetichism see eg
    krafftebing psychopathia sexualis english translation of
    tenth edition pp 233 255 262 in many cases of fetichisms of
    all kinds not only is there no record of any commencement in a
    definite episode an absence which may be accounted for by the
    supposition that the original incident has been forgotten but
    it would seem in some cases that the fetichism developed very
    slowly
in this sense it will be seen although it is hazardous to speak of
footfetichism as strictly an atavism it may certainly be said to arise
on a congenital basis it represents the rare development of an inborn
germ usually latent among ourselves which in earlier stages of
civilization frequently reached a normal and general fruition
it is of interest to emphasize this congenital element of foot symbolism
because more than any other forms of sexual perversion the fetichisms are
those which are most vaguely conditioned by inborn states of the organism
and most definitely aroused by seemingly accidental associations or shocks
in early life inversion is sometimes so fundamentally ingrained in the
individuals constitution that it arises and develops in spite of the very
strongest influence in a contrary direction but a fetichism while it
tends to occur in sensitive nervous timid precocious individualsthat
is to say individuals of more or less neuropathic hereditycan usually
though not always be traced to a definite starting point in the shock of
some sexually emotional episode in early life
    a few examples of the influences of such association may here be
    given referring miscellaneously to various forms of erotic

such associations may naturally occur in the early experiences of even the
most normal persons the degree to which they will influence the
subsequent life and thought and feeling depends on the degree of the
individuals morbid emotional receptivity on the extent to which he is
hereditarily susceptible of abnormal deviation precocity is undoubtedly a
condition which favors such deviation a child who is precociously and
abnormally sensitive to persons of the opposite sex before puberty has
established the normal channels of sexual desire is peculiarly liable to
become the prey of a chance symbolism all degrees of such symbolism are
possible while the average insensitive person may fail to perceive them
at all for the more alert and imaginative lover they are a fascinating
part of the highly charged crystallization of passion a more nervously
exceptional person when once such a symbolism has become firmly
implanted may find it an absolutely essential element in the charm of a
beloved and charming person finally for the individual who is thoroughly
unsound the symbol becomes generalized a person is no longer desired at
all being merely regarded as an appendage of the symbol or being
dispensed with altogether the symbol is alone desired and is fully
adequate to impart by itself complete sexual gratification while it must
be considered a morbid state to demand a symbol as an almost essential
part of the charm of a desired person it is only in the final condition
in which the symbol becomes allsufficing that we have a true and
complete perversion in the less complete forms of symbolism it is still
the woman who is desired and the ends of procreation may be served when
the woman is ignored and the mere symbol is an adequate and even preferred
stimulus to detumescence the pathological condition becomes complete
krafftebing regarded shoefetichism as in large measure a more or less
latent form of masochism the foot or the shoe being the symbol of the
subjection and humiliation which the masochist feels in the presence of
the beloved object moll is also inclined to accept such a connection
    the very numerous class of bootandshoefetichists
    krafftebing wrote forms the transition to the manifestations
    of another independent perversion ie fetichism itself but it
    stands in closer relationship to the former it is highly
    probable and shown by a correct classification of the observed
    cases that the majority and perhaps all of the cases of
    shoefetichism rest upon a basis of more or less conscious
    masochistic desire for selfhumiliation the majority or all
    may be looked upon as instances of latent masochism the motive
    remaining unconscious in which the female foot or shoe as the
    masochists fetich has acquired an independent significance
    psychopathia sexualis english translation of tenth edition
    pp 159 et seq though krafftebing may not have cleared up
    the whole matter moll remarks i regard his deductions
    concerning the connection of footandshoe fetichism to masochism
    as the most important progress that has been made in the
    theoretic study of sexual perversions in any case the
    connection is very frequent kontrre sexualempfindung third
    edition p 306
it is quite easy to see that this supposed identity of masochism and
footfetichism forms a seductive theory it is also undoubtedly true that
a masochist may very easily be inclined to find in his mistresss foot an
aid to the ecstatic selfabnegation which he desires to attain20 but
only confusion is attained by any general attempt to amalgamate masochism
and footfetichism in the broad sense in which erotic symbolism is here
understood both masochism and footfetichism may be cordinated as
symbolisms for the masochist his selfhumiliating impulses are the symbol
of ecstatic adoration for the footfetichist his mistresss foot or shoe
is the concentrated symbol of all that is most beautiful and elegant and
feminine in her personality but if in this sense they are cordinated
they remain entirely distinct and have not even any necessary tendency to
become merged masochism merely simulates footfetichism for the
masochist the boot is not strictly a symbol it is only an instrument
which enables him to carry out his impulse the true sexual symbol for him
is not the boot but the emotion of selfsubjection for the
footfetichist on the other hand the foot or the shoe is not a mere
instrument but a true symbol the focus of his worship an idealized
object which he is content to contemplate or reverently touch he has no
necessary impulse to any selfdegrading action nor any constant emotion
of subjection it may be noted that in the very typical case of
footfetichism which is presented to us in the person of restif de la
bretonne ante p 18 he repeatedly speaks of subjecting the woman
for whom he feels this fetichistic adoration and mentions that even when
still a child he especially admired a delicate and fairylike girl in this
respect because she seemed to him easier to subjugate throughout life
restifs attitude toward women was active and masculine without the
slightest trace of masochism21
to suppose that a fetichistic admiration of his mistresss foot is due to
a lovers latent desire to be kicked is as unreasonable as it would be to
suppose that a fetichistic admiration for her hand indicated a latent
desire to have his ears boxed in determining whether we are concerned
with a case of footfetichism or of masochism we must take into
consideration the whole of the subjects mental and emotional attitude an
act however definite will not suffice as a criterion for the same act
in different persons may have altogether different implications to
amalgamate the two is the result of inadequate psychological analysis and
only leads to confusion
it is however often very difficult to decide whether we are dealing with
a case which is predominantly one of masochism or of footfetichism the
nature of the action desired as we have seen will not suffice to
determine the psychological character of the perversion krafftebing
believed that the desire to be trodden on very frequently experienced by
masochists is absolutely symptomatic of masochism22 this is scarcely
the case the desire to be trodden on may be fundamentally an erotic
symbolism closely approaching footfetichism and such slight indications
of masochism as appear may be merely a parasitic growth on the symbolism
a growth perhaps more suggested by the circumstances involved in the
gratification of the abnormal desire than inherent in the innate impulse
of the subject this may be illustrated by the interesting case of a very
intelligent man with whom i am well acquainted
    cp aged 38 heredity good parents both healthy and normal
    several children of the marriage all sexually normal so far as
    is known cp is the youngest of the family and separated from
    the others by an interval of many years he was a sevenmonths
    child he has always enjoyed good health and is active and
    vigorous both mentally and physically
    from the age of 9 or 10 to 14 he masturbated occasionally for the
    sake of physical relief having discovered the act for himself
    he was however quite innocent and knew nothing of sexual
    matters never having been initiated either by servants or by
    other boys
    when i encounter a woman who very strongly attracts me and whom
    i very greatly admire he writes my desire is never that i may
    have sexual connection with her in the ordinary sense but that i
    may lie down upon the floor on my back and be trampled upon by
    her this curious desire is seldom present unless the object of
    my admiration is really a lady and of fine proportions she must
    be richly dressedpreferably in an evening gown and wear dainty
    highheeled slippers either quite open so as to show the curve
    of the instep or with only one strap or bar across the skirts
    should be raised sufficiently to afford me the pleasure of seeing
    her feet and a liberal amount of ankle but in no case above the
    knee or the effect is greatly reduced although i often greatly
    admire a womans intellect and even person sexually no other
    part of her has any serious attraction for me except the leg
    from the knee downwards and the foot and these must be
    exquisitely clothed given this condition my desire amounts to a
    wish to gratify my sexual sense by contact with the to me
    attractive part of the woman comparatively few women have a leg
    or foot sufficiently beautiful to my mind to excite any serious
    or compelling desire but when this is so or i suspect it i am
    willing to spend any time or trouble to get her to tread upon me
    and am anxious to be trampled on with the greatest severity
    the treading should be inflicted for a few minutes all over the
    chest abdomen and groin and lastly on the penis which is of
    course lying along the belly in a violent state of erection and
    consequently too hard for the treading to damage it i also enjoy
    being nearly strangled by a womans foot
    if the lady finally stands facing my head and places her slipper
    upon my penis so that the high heel falls about where the penis
    leaves the scrotum the sole covering most of the rest of it and
    with the other foot upon the abdomen into which i can see as
    well as feel it sink as she shifts her weight from one foot to
    the other orgasm takes place almost at once emission under
    these conditions is to me an agony of delight during which
    practically the ladys whole weight should rest upon the penis
    one reason for my special pleasure in this method seems to be
    that first the heel and afterwards the sole of the slipper as it
    treads upon the penis greatly check the passage of the semen and
    consequently the pleasure is considerably prolonged there is
    also a curious mental side to the affair i love to imagine that
    the lady who is treading upon me is my mistress and i her slave
    and that she is doing it to punish me for some fault or to give
    herself not me pleasure
    it follows that the greater the contempt and severity with which
    i am punished the greater becomes my pleasure the idea of
    punishment or slavery is seldom aroused except when i have
    great difficulty in accomplishing my desire and the treader is
    more than usually handsome and heavy and the trampling
    mercilessly inflicted i have been trampled so long and so
    mercilessly several times that i have flinched each time the
    slipper pressed its way into my aching body and have been black
    and blue for days afterwards i take the greatest interest in
    leading ladies on to do this for me where i think i will not
    offend and have been surprisingly successful i must have lain
    beneath the feet of quite a hundred women many of them of good
    social position who would never dream of permitting any ordinary
    sexual intercourse but who have been so interested or amused by
    the idea as to do it for memany of them over and over again it
    is perhaps needless to say that none of my own or the ladies
    clothing is ever removed or disarranged for the accomplishment
    of orgasm in this manner after a long and varied experience i
    may say that my favorite weight is 10 to 11 stone and that
    black very highheeled slippers in combination with tan silk
    stockings seem to give me the greatest pleasure and create in me
    the strongest desires
    boots or outdoor shoes do not attract me to anything like the
    same degree although i have upon several occasions enjoyed
    myself fairly well by their use nude women repel me and i find
    no pleasure in seeing a woman in tights i am not averse to
    normal sexual connection and occasionally employ it to me
    however the pleasure is far inferior to that of being trampled
    upon i also derive keen pleasureand usually have a strong
    erectionfrom seeing a woman dressed as i have described tread
    upon anything which yields under her footsuch as the seat of a
    carriage the cushions of a punt a footstool etc and i enjoy
    seeing her crush flowers by treading upon them i have often
    strolled along in the wake of some handsome lady at a picnic or
    garden party for the pleasure of seeing the grass upon which she
    has trodden rise slowly again after her foot has pressed it i
    delight also to see a carriage sway as a woman leaves or enters
    itanything which needs the pressure of the foot
    to pass now to the origin of this direction of my feelings
    even in early childhood i admired pretty feminine footgear and
    in the contemplation of it experienced vague sensations which i
    now recognize as sexual when a lad of 14 or so i stayed a good
    deal at the house of some intimate friends of my parents the
    daughter of the housean only childa beautiful and powerful
    girl about six years my senior being my special chum this girl
    was always daintily dressed and having most lovely feet and
    ankles not unnaturally knew it whenever possible she dressed so
    as to show off their beauty to the best advantagerather short
    skirts and usually little highheeled slippersand was not
    averse to showing them in a most distractingly coquettish manner
    she seemed to have a passion for treading upon things which would
    scrunch or yield under her foot such as flowers little
    windfallen apples and pears acorns etc or heaps of hay straw
    or cut grass as we wandered about the gardensfor we were left
    to do exactly as we likedi got quite accustomed to seeing her
    hunt out and tread upon such things and used to chaff her about
    it at that time i wasas i am stillfond of lying at full
    length on a thick hearthrug before a good fire one evening as i
    was lying in this way and we were alone a crossed the room to
    reach a bangle from the mantelpiece instead of reaching over me
    she playfully stepped upon my body saying that she would show me
    how the hay and straw felt naturally i fell in with the joke and
    laughed after standing upon me a few moments she raised her
    skirt slightly and holding on to the mantelpiece for support
    stretched out one dainty foot in its brown silk stocking and
    highheeled slipper to the blaze to warm while looking down and
    laughing at my scarlet excited face she was a perfectly frank
    and charming girl and i feel pretty certain that although she
    evidently enjoyed my excitement and the feeling of my body
    yielding under her feet she did not on this first occasion
    clearly understand my condition nor can i remember that though
    the desire for sexual gratification drove me nearly mad it
    appeared to awaken in her any reciprocal feeling i took hold of
    her raised foot and after kissing it guided it by an absolutely
    irresistible impulse on to my penis which was as hard as wood
    and seemed almost bursting almost at the moment that her weight
    was thrown upon it orgasm took place for the first time in my
    life thoroughly and effectively no description can give any idea
    of what i felti only know that from that moment my distorted
    sexual focus was fixed forever numberless times after that
    evening i felt the weight of her dainty slippers and nothing
    will ever cause the memory of the pleasure she thus gave me to
    fade i know that a came to enjoy treading upon me as much as i
    enjoyed having her do it she had a liberal dress allowance and
    seeing the pleasure they gave me she was always buying pretty
    stockings and ravishing slippers with the highest and most
    slender louis heels she could find and would show them to me with
    the greatest glee urging me to lie down that she might try them
    on me she confessed that she loved to see and feel them sink
    into my body as she trod upon me and enjoyed the crunch of the
    muscles under her heel as she moved about after some minutes of
    this i always guided her slipper on to my penis and she would
    tread carefully but with her whole weightprobably about 9
    stoneand watch me with flashing eyes flushed cheeks and
    quivering lips as she feltas she must have done plainlythe
    throbbing and swelling of my penis under her foot as emission
    took place i have not the smallest doubt that orgasm took place
    simultaneously with her though we never at any time spoke openly
    of it this went on for several years on almost every favorable
    opportunity we had and after a month or two of separation
    sometimes four or five times during a single day several times
    during as absence i masturbated by getting her slipper and
    pressing it with all my strength against the penis while
    imagining that she was treading upon me the pleasure was of
    course very inferior to her attentions there was never at any
    time between us any question of normal sexual intercourse and we
    were both well content to let things drift as they were
    a little after 20 i went abroad and on my return about three
    years later i found her married although we met often the
    subject was never alluded to though we remained firm friends i
    confess i often when i could do so without being seen looked
    longingly at her feet and would have gladly accepted the pleasure
    she could have given me by an occasional resumption of our
    strange practicebut it never came
    i went abroad again and now neither she nor her husband are
    alive and leave no issue from time to time i have had occasional
    relations with prostitutes but always in this manner though i
    much prefer to find some lady of or above my own social position
    who will do the treading for me this is however interestingly
    difficult
    out of say a hundred women which at home and abroad is what i
    should estimate must have stood upon my body i should say quite
    80 or 85 were not prostitutes certainly not more than 10 to 12
    shared any sexual excitement but while they were evidently
    excited they were not gratified a alone so far as i know had
    complete sexual satisfaction of it i have never asked a woman in
    so many words to tread upon me for the purpose of gratifying my
    sexual desires prostitutes excepted but have always tempted
    them to do it in a jocular or teasing manner and it is very
    doubtful if more than a few married women really understood
    even after they had given me the extreme pleasure that they had
    done so because any flushing and movement on my part under their
    feet was not unnaturally put down to the trampling to which they
    were subjecting me and it was easy for me to guide the foot as
    often as was necessary on to the penis till orgasm took place
    and even to keep it there by laying hold of the other one to kiss
    it or on some other pretext during emission of course many
    understood after once doing it most have done it only once what
    i was at and although they did not ever discuss it nor did i
    they were not unwilling to give me as many treadings as i cared
    to playfully suggest i dont think they got any pleasure
    sexually out of it themselves though they could see plainly that
    i did and they did not object to give it me i have spent as
    long as twelve months with some women working gradually nearer
    and nearer to my desireoften getting what i want in the end
    but more often failing i never risk it till i am certain it
    would be safe to ask it and have never had a serious rebuff in
    very many cases i should say the doing of what i want has simply
    been regarded by the woman as gratifying a silly and perhaps
    amusing whim in which beyond the novelty of treading on a mans
    body she has taken but little interest
    as in normal seduction the endeavor to win the woman over to do
    what i want without arousing her antagonism is a great part of
    the charm to me and naturally the better her social position the
    more difficult this becomesand the more attractive i have
    found that in three instances prostitutes have performed the same
    office for other men and knew all about it it is not
    uninteresting to note that these three women were all of fine
    massive buildone standing about 5 feet 10 inches and weighing
    nearly 14 stonebut with comparatively uninteresting faces the
    weight build and clothing count for a good deal in exciting me
    i find that a sudden check to a man at the supreme moment of
    sexual pleasure tends to heighten and prolong the pleasure my
    physical satisfaction is due to the fact that by getting the lady
    to stand with all her weight upon my penis as it lies between
    her foot and the soft bed of my own body into which it is deeply
    pressed the act of emission is enormously prolonged with
    corresponding enjoyment for this reason also i prefer a very
    highheeled slipper the seminal fluid has to be forced past two
    separate obstaclesthe pressure of the heel close at the root of
    the penis and afterwards the ball of the foot which compresses
    the outer half leaving a free portion between them under the
    arched sole of the slipper i may add that the pleasure is
    greatly increased by the retention of the urine and i always try
    to retain as much water as i dare i have an unconquerable
    aversion to red in slippers or stockings it will even cause
    impotence why i know not strange as it may seem although pain
    and bruising are often inflicted by a severe treading i have
    never been in any way injured by the practice and my pleasure in
    it seems not to diminish by constant repetition the comparative
    difficulty of obtaining the pleasure from just the woman i want
    has a neverending if inexplicable charm for me
    it will be observed that in this case special importance is
    attached to shoes with high heels and the subject considers that
    the pressure of such shoes is for mechanical reasons most
    favorable for procuring ejaculation nearly all heterosexual
    shoefetichists seem however to be equally attracted by high
    heels restif de la bretonne frequently referred to this point
    and he gave a number of reasons for the attractiveness of high
    heels 1 they are unlike mens boots and therefore have a
    sexual fascination 2 they make the leg and foot look more
    charming 3 they give a less bold and more sylphlike character
    to the walk 4 they keep the feet clean restif de la
    bretonne nuits de paris vol v quoted in preface to his mes
    inscriptions p ciii it is doubtless the first reasonthe
    fact that high heels are a kind of secondary sexual
    characterwhich is most generally potent in this attraction
the foregoing history while it very distinctly brings before us a case of
erotic symbolism is not strictly an example of shoefetichism the
symbolism is more complex the focus of beauty in a desirable woman is
transferred and concentrated in the region below the knee in that sense
we have footfetichism but the act of coitus itself is also symbolically
transferred not only has the foot become the symbol of the vulva but
trampling has become the symbol of coitus intercourse takes place
symbolically per pedem it is a result of this symbolization of the foot
and of trampling that all acts of treading take on a new and symbolical
sexual charm the element of masochismof pleasure in being a womans
slaveis a parasitic growth that is to say it is not founded in the
subjects constitution but chances to have found a favorable soil in the
special circumstances under which his sexual life developed it is not
primary but secondary and remains an unimportant and merely occasional
element
it may be instructive to bring forward for comparison a case in which also
we have a symbolism involving bootfetichism but extending beyond it in
this case there is a basis of inversion as is not infrequent in erotic
symbolisms but from the present point of view the psychological
significance of the case remains the same

    i am an englishman his own narrative runs the third of three
    children at my birth my father was 41 and my mother 34 my
    mother died of cancer when i was 15 my father is still alive a
    reserved man who still nurses his sorrow for his wifes death i
    have no reason to believe my parents anything but normal and
    useful members of society my sister is normal and happily
    married my brother i have reason to believe to be an invert
    a horoscope cast for me describes me in a way i think correct
    and so do my friends a mild obliging gentle amiable person
    with many fine traits of character timid in nature fond of
    society loving peace and quietude delighting in warm and close
    friendships there is much that is firm steadfast and
    industrious some selflove a good deal of diplomacy a little
    that is subtle or what is called finesse you are reserved with
    those you dislike there is a serious and sad side to your
    character you are very thoughtful and contemplative when in
    these moods but you are not pessimistic you have superior
    abilities for they are intuitively intellectual there is a cold
    reticence which restrains generous impulses and which inclines to
    acquisitiveness it will make you deliberate inventive adding
    selfesteem some vanity
    at an early age i was left much alone in the nursery and there
    contracted the habit of masturbation long before the age of
    puberty i use the word masturbation for want of a better
    though it may not quite describe my case i have never used my
    hand to the penis as far back as i can remember i have had what
    a frenchman has described as le fetichisme de la chaussure and
    in those early days before i was 6 years old i would put on my
    fathers boots taken from a cupboard at hand and then tying or
    strapping my legs together would produce an erection and all the
    pleasurable feelings experienced i suppose by means of
    masturbation i always did this secretly but couldnt tell why
    i continued this practice on and off all my boyhood and youth
    when i discovered the first emission i was much surprised i
    always did this thing without loosening my trousers as to how
    these feelings arose i am totally unable to say i cant remember
    being without such feelings and they seem to me perfectly
    normal the sight or even thought of high boots or leggings
    especially if well polished or in patent leather would set all
    my sexual passions aflame and does yet as a boy my great desire
    was to wear these things a soldier in boots and spurs a groom
    in tops or even an errandboy in patent leather leggings
    fascinated me and to this day despite reason and everything
    else the sight of such things produced an erection an emission
    i could always produce by tightly tying my legs together but
    only when wearing boots and preferably leggings which when i
    had pocket money i bought for this purpose at the present
    moment i have five pairs in the house and two pairs of high
    boots quite unjustified by ordinary use this habit i lapse
    into yet at times the smell of leather affects me but i never
    know how far this may be due to association with boots the smell
    suggests the image restraint by a leather strap is more exciting
    than by cords erotic dreams always take the form of restraint on
    the limbs when booted
    uniforms and liveries have a great temptation for me but only
    when of a tightfitting nature and smart as soldiers grooms
    etc but not sailors most powerfully when the person is in
    boots or leggings and breeches
    i was a quiet sensitive boy taking no part in games or sports
    have always been indifferent to them i made few friends but
    didnt want them the craving for friendship came much later
    after i was 21 i was a day boy at a private school and never
    had any conversation with any boy on sexual matters though i was
    dimly aware of much nastiness about the school i knew nothing
    of sodomy but all these things were repulsive to me
    notwithstanding my secret practices i was a good boy
    up to the age of 21 i was perfectly satisfied with my own
    society something of a prig fond of books and reading etc i
    was and ever have been absolutely insensible to the influence of
    the other sex i am not a woman hater and take intellectual
    pleasure in the society of certain ladies but they are nearly
    all much older than myself i have a strong repulsion from sexual
    relations with women i should not mind being married for the
    sake of companionship and for the sake of having boys of my own
    but the sexual act would frighten me i could not in my present
    frame of mind go to bed with a woman yet i feel an immense envy
    of my married friends in that they are able to give out and find
    satisfaction for their affection in a way that is quite
    impossible for me i picture certain boys in the place of the
    wife
    i am now only happy in the society of men younger than myself
    age 17 to say 23 or 24 youths with smooth faces or first sign
    of hair on lip well groomed slightly effeminate in feature of
    sympathetic perhaps weak nature i feel i want to help them do
    something for them devote myself entirely to their welfare
    with such there is no fixed line between friendship and love i
    yearn for intimacy with particular friends but never dare
    express it i find so many people object to any strong expression
    of feeling that i dare not run the risk of appearing ridiculous
    in the eyes of these desired intimates
    i have no desire for pdicatio but the idea itself does not
    repulse me or seem unnatural though personally it repels me a
    little but i think this to be mere prejudice on my part which
    might be broken down if the loved person showed a willingness to
    act a passive part i should never dare to make an advance
    however
    i am restrained by moral and religious considerations from
    making my real feelings known and i feel i should sink in my own
    estimation if i gave way though my natural desire is to do so
    in the face of opportunities not i mean of pdicatio but of
    expression of excessive affection etc or what might be such
    i always fail to speak lest i should forfeit the esteem of the
    other person i have a feeling of surprise when any one i like
    evinces a liking for me i feel that those i love are
    immeasurably my superiors though my reason may tell me it is not
    so i would grovel at their feet do anything to win a smile from
    them or to make them give me their company
    ordinary bodily contact with the boy i love gives me most
    exquisite pleasure and i never lose an opportunity of bringing
    such contact about when it can be done naturally i feel an
    immense desire to embrace kiss squeeze etc the person to
    generally maul him and say nice thingsthe kind of things a man
    usually says to a woman a handshake the mere presence of the
    person makes me happy and content
    i can say with the albanian if i find myself in the presence
    of the beloved i rest absorbed in gazing on him absent i think
    of nought but him if the beloved unexpectedly appears i fall
    into confusion my heart beats faster i have eyes and ears only
    for the beloved
    i feel that my capacity of affection is finer and more spiritual
    than that which commonly subsists between persons of different
    sexes and so while trying to fight my instincts by religion i
    find my natural feeling to be part of my religion and its
    highest expression in this sense i can speak from experience in
    my own case and more especially in that of my brother that what
    you have said about philanthropic activity resulting from
    repressed homosexuality is very true indeed i can say with one
    of your female cases love is to me a religion the very nature
    of my affection for my friends precludes the possibility of any
    element entering into it which is not absolutely pure and
    sacred i am however madly jealous i want entire possession
    and i cant bear for a moment that any one i do not care for
    should know the person i love
    i am never attracted by men older than myself the youths who
    attract me may be of any class though preferably i think of a
    class a little lower than myself i am not quite sure of this
    however as circumstances may have contributed more than
    deliberate choice to bring certain youths under my notice those
    who have exercised the most powerful influence on me have been an
    oxford undergraduate a barbers assistant and a plumbers
    apprentice though naturally fond of intellectual society i do
    not ask for intellect in those i love it goes for nothing i
    always prefer their company to that of the most educated persons
    this preference has alienated me to some extent from more refined
    and educated circles that formerly i was intimate with
    i have been led entirely out of my old habits by association
    with younger friends and now do things which before i should
    never have dreamed of doing my thoughts now are always with
    certain youths and if they speak of leaving the town or in any
    way talk of a future that i cannot share i suffer horrid
    sinkings of the heart and depression of spirits
this case while it concerns a person of quite different temperament with
a more innate predisposition to specific perversions is yet in many
respects analogous to the previous case there is bootfetichism nothing
is felt to be so attractive as the footgear and there is also at the
same time more than this there is the attraction of repression and
constraint developed into a sexual symbol in cps case that symbolism
arises from the experience of an abnormal heterosexual relationship in
ans case it is founded on autoerotic experiences associated with
inversion in both alike the entire symbolism has become diffused and
generalized
in the two cases just brought forward we have an erotic symbolism of act
founded on and closely associated with an erotic symbolism of object it
may be instructive to bring forward another case in which no fetichistic
feeling toward an object can be traced but an erotic symbolism still
clearly exists in this case pain even when selfinflicted has acquired
a symbolic value as a stimulus to tumescence without any element of
masochism such a case serves to indicate how the sexual attraction of
pain is really a special case of the erotic symbolism with which we are
here concerned
    aw aged 50 a writer and lecturer physically and mentally
    energetic and enjoying good health he is however very
    emotional and of nervous temperament but selfcontrolled though
    physically well developed the sexual organs are small he is
    married to an attractive woman to whom he is much attached and
    has two healthy children
    at 10 or 12 years of age he had a frequent desire to be whipped
    his parents never having struck him and on one occasion he asked
    a brother to go with him to the closet to get him to whip him on
    the posterior but on arrival he was too shy to make the request
    he did not recognize the cause of these desires knowing nothing
    of such things except from the misinformation of his
    schoolfellows talk as far as he can remember he was an
    entirely normal healthy boy up to the age of about 15 when his
    attention was arrested by an advertisement of a quack medicine
    for the results of youthful excesses
    being a city boy he was unfamiliar with the coupling even of
    animals had never had a conscious erection and did not know of
    frictional excitement experiment however resulted in an
    orgasm and though believing that it was wicked or at least weak
    and degrading he indulged in masturbation at intervals usually
    about six times a month and has continued even up to the
    present
    he had an abnormally small opening in the prepuce making the
    uncovering of the glans almost impossible at the age of about
    37 he himself slit the prepuce by three or four cuts of a
    scissors at intervals of about ten days this was followed by a
    marked decrease in desire especially as he shortly afterwards
    learned the importance of local cleanliness while in college at
    about the age of 19 he began to have nocturnal emissions
    occasionally and once or twice a week when at stool alarmed by
    these he consulted a physician who warned him of the danger
    gave him bromide and prescribed cold bathing of the parts with a
    hard cool bed these stopped the emissions
    he never had connection with women until the age of about 25 and
    then only three times until his marriage at 30 years of age
    being deterred partly by conscientious scruples but more by
    shyness and convention and deriving very little pleasure from
    these instances even since marriage he has derived more pleasure
    from sexual excitement than from coitus and can maintain
    erection for as long as two hours
    he has always been accustomed to torture himself in various
    ingenious ways nearly always connected with sex he would burn
    his skin deeply with red hot wire in inconspicuous places these
    and similar acts were generally followed by manual excitation
    nearly always brought to a climax
    he considers that he is attracted to refined and intellectual
    women but he is without very ardent desires having several
    times gone to bed with attractive women who stripped themselves
    naked but without attempting any sexual intercourse with them
    he became interested in the karezza theory and has tried to
    practice it with his wife but could never entirely control the
    emission
    he has hired a masseur to whip him as children are whipped with
    a heavy dog whip which caused pleasurable excitement during
    this time he had relations with his wife generally about once a
    week without any great ecstasy she was cold and sexually slow
    owing to conventional sex repression and to an idea that the
    whole thing was like animals and to fear of childbearing
    usually necessitating the use of a cover or withdrawal it was
    only eight years after their marriage that she desired and
    obtained a child during these years he would often stick pins
    through his mamm and tie them together by a string round the
    pins drawn so short as to cause great pain and then indulge
    himself in the sexual act he used strong wooden clips with a
    tack fixed in them so as to pierce and pinch the mamm and once
    he drove a pin entirely through the penis itself then obtaining
    orgasm by friction he was never able to get an automatic
    emission in this way though he often tried not even by walking
    briskly during an erection
in another class of cases a purely ideal symbolism may be present by means
of a fetich which acts as a powerful stimulus without itself being felt to
possess any attraction a good illustration of this condition is furnished
by a case which has been communicated to me by a medical correspondent in
new zealand
    the patient went out to south africa as a trooper with the
    contingent from new zealand throwing up a good position in an
    office to do so he had never had any trouble as regards
    connection with women before going out to south africa while in
    active service at the front he sustained a nasty fall from his
    horse breaking his leg he was unconscious for four days and
    was then invalided down to cape town here he rapidly got well
    and his accustomed health returning to him he started having what
    he terms a good time he repeatedly went to brothels but was
    unable to have more than a temporary erection and no ejaculation
    would take place in one of these places he was in company with a
    drunken trooper who suggested that they should perform the
    sexual act with their boots and spurs only on my patient who
    was also drunk readily assented and to his surprise was enabled
    to perform the act of copulation without any difficulty at all
    he has repeatedly tried since to perform the act without any
    spurs but is quite unable to do so with the spurs he has no
    difficulty at all in obtaining all the gratification he desires
    his general health is good his mother was an extremely nervous
    woman and so is his sister his father died when he was quite
    young his only other relation in the colony is a married sister
    who seems to enjoy vigorous health
the consideration of the cases here brought forward may suffice to show
that beyond those fetichisms which find their satisfaction in the
contemplation of a part of the body or a garment there is a more subtle
symbolism the foot is a center of force an agent for exerting pressure
and thus it furnishes a point of departure not alone for the merely static
sexual fetich but for a dynamic erotic symbolization the energy of its
movements becomes a substitute for the energy of the sexual organs
themselves in coitus and exerts the same kind of fascination the young
girl page 35 who seemed to have a passion for treading upon things
which would scrunch or yield under her foot already possessed the germs
of an erotic symbolism which under the influence of circumstances in
which she herself took an active part developed into an adequate method
of sexual gratification23 the youth who was her partner learned in the
same way to find an erotic symbolism in all the pressure reactions of
attractive feminine feet the swaying of a carriage beneath their weight
the crushing of the flowers on which they tread the slow rising of the
grass which they have pressed here we have a symbolism which is
altogether different from that fetichism which adores a definite object
it is a dynamic symbolism finding its gratification in the spectacle of
movements which ideally recall the fundamental rhythm and pressure
reactions of the sexual process
we may trace a very similar erotic symbolism in an absolutely normal form
the fascination of clothes in the lovers eyes is no doubt a complex
phenomenon but in part it rests on the aptitudes of a womans garments to
express vaguely a dynamic symbolism which must always remain indefinite
and elusive and on that account always possess fascination no one has so
acutely described this symbolism as herrick often an admirable
psychologist in matters of sexual attractiveness especially instructive
in this respect are his poems delight in disorder upon julias
clothes and notably julias petticoat a sweet disorder in the
dress he tells us kindles in clothes a wantonness it is not on the
garment itself but on the character of its movement that he insists on
the erring lace the winning wave of the tempestuous petticoat he
speaks of the liquefaction of clothes their brave vibration each way
free and of julias petticoat he remarks with a more specific symbolism
still
    sometimes twould pant and sigh and heave
     as if to stir it scarce had leave
     but having got it thereupon
     twould make a brave expansion
in the play of the beloved womans garment he sees the whole process of
the central act of sex with its repressions and expansions and at the
sight is himself ready to fall into a swoon

19 jacoby loc cit p 797 appears to regard shoefetichism as a true
atavism the sexual adoration of feminine footgear he concludes
perhaps the most enigmatic and certainly the most singular of
degenerative insanities is thus merely a form of atavism the return of
the degenerate to the very ancient and primitive psychology which we no
longer understand and are no longer capable of feeling
20 moll has reported in detail untersuchungen ber die libido
sexualis bd i teil ii pp 320324 a case which both he and
krafftebing regard as illustrative of the connection between
bootfetichism and masochism it is essentially a case of masochism
though manifesting itself almost exclusively in the desire to perform
humiliating acts in connection with the attractive persons boots
21 krafftebing goes so far as to assert psychopathia sexualis
english translation of tenth edition p 174 that when in cases of
shoefetichism the female shoe appears alone as the excitant of sexual
desire one is justified in presuming that masochistic motives have
remained latent latent masochism may always be assumed as the
unconscious motive in this way he hopelessly misinterprets some of his
own cases
22 krafftebing goes so far as to assert psychopathia sexualis
english translation pp 159 and 174 yet some of the cases he brings
forward eg coxes as quoted by hammond show no sign of masochism
since according to krafftebings own definition p 116 the idea of
subjugation by the opposite sex is of the essence of masochism
23 her actions suggest that there is often a latent sexual consciousness
in regard to the feet in women atavistic or pseudoatavistic and
corresponding to the sexual attraction which the feet formerly aroused
almost normally in men this is also suggested by the case referred to
by shufeldt of an unmarried woman belonging to a family exhibiting in a
high degree both erotic and neurotic traits who had a certain
uncontrollable fascination for shoes she delights in new shoes and
changes her shoes all day long at regular intervals of three hours each
she keeps this row of shoes out in plain sight in her apartment rw

coprolagnia as symbols of coitus
we meet with another group of erotic symbolismsalike symbolisms of
object and of actin connection with the two functions adjoining the
anatomical sexual focus the urinary and alvine excretory functions these
are sometimes termed the scatalogical group with the two subdivisions of
urolagnia and coprolagnia24 inter fces et urinam nascimur is an
ancient text which has served the ascetic preachers of old for many
discourses on the littleness of man and the meanness of that reproductive
power which plays so large a part in mans life the stupid bungle of
nature a correspondent writes whereby the generative organs serve as a
means of relieving the bladder is doubtless responsible for much of the
disgust which those organs excite in some minds
at the same time it is necessary to point out such reflex influence may
act not in one direction only but also in the reverse direction from
the standpoint of ascetic contemplation eager to belittle humanity the
excretory centers may cast dishonor upon the genital center which they
adjoin from the more ecstatic standpoint of the impassioned lover eager
to magnify the charm of the woman he worships it is not impossible for
the excretory centers to take on some charm from the irradiating center of
sex which they enclose
even normally such a process is traceable the normal lover may not
idealize the excretory functions of his mistress but the fact that he
finds no repulsion in the most intimate contacts and feels no disgust at
the proximity of the excretory orifices or the existence of their
functions indicates that the idealization of love has exerted at all
events a neutralizing influence indeed the presence of an acute
sensibility to the disturbing influence of this proximity of the excretory
orifices and their functions must be considered abnormal swifts
strephon and chloewith the conviction underlying it that it is an easy
matter for the excretory functions to drown the possibilities of
lovecould only have proceeded from a morbidly sensitive brain25
a more than mere neutralizing influence a positively idealizing influence
of the sexual focus on the excretory processes adjoining it may take
place in the lovers mind without the normal variations of sexual
attraction being overpassed and even without the creation of an
excretory fetichism
    reflections of this attitude may be found in the poets in the
    song of songs the lover says of his mistress thy navel is
    like a round goblet wherein no mingled wine is wanting in his
    lyric to dianeme herrick says with clear reference to the
    mons veneris
        show me that hill where smiling love doth sit
        having a living fountain under it
    and in the very numerous poems in various languages which have
    more or less obscurely dealt with the rose as the emblem of the
    feminine pudenda there are occasional references to the stream
    which guards or presides over the rose it may indeed be
    recalled that even in the name nymph anatomists commonly apply
    to the labia minora there is generally believed to be a poetic
    allusion to the nymphs who presided over streams since the
    labia minora exert an influence on the direction of the urinary
    stream

    sentimental over her dirty towels etc which struck him with

    may be a very estimable man and yet love women even in what is

    rgniers novel are the remarks of a correspondent who writes to
    me of the function of urination that it appeals sexually to most
    normal individuals my own observations and inquiries prove this
    women themselves instinctively feel it the secrecy surrounding
    the matter lends too i think a sexual interest
    the fact that scatalogic processes may in some degree exert an
    attraction even in normal love has been especially emphasized by

    doubtful genuinely autobiographical in the same sense a man
    who falls in love with a girl is not dragged out of his poetic
    sphere by the thought that his beloved must relieve certain
    natural necessities every day it seems indeed to him to be
    just the opposite if one loves a person one finds nothing
    obscene or disgusting in the object that pleases me the
    opposite attitude is probably in extreme cases due to the
    influence of a neurotic or morbidly sensitive temperament swift
    possessed such a temperament the possession of a similar
    temperament is doubtless responsible for the little prose poem
    lextase in which huysmans in his first book le drageloir 
    epices has written an attenuated version of strephon and
    chloe to express the disillusionment of love the lover lies in
    a wood clasping the hand of the beloved with rapturous emotion
    suddenly she rose disengaged her hand disappeared in the
    bushes and i heard as it were the rustling of rain on the

in estimating the significance of the lovers attitude in this matter it
is important to realize the position which scatologic conceptions took in
primitive belief at certain stages of early culture when all the
emanations of the body are liable to possess mysterious magic properties
and become apt for sacred uses the excretions and especially the urine
are found to form part of religious ritual and ceremonial function even
among savages the excreta are frequently regarded as disgusting but under
the influence of these conceptions such disgust is inhibited and those
emanations of the body which are usually least honored become religious
symbols
    urine has been regarded as the original holy water and many
    customs which still survive in italy and various parts of europe
    involving the use of a fluid which must often be yellow and
    sometimes salt possibly indicate the earlier use of urine the
    greek water of aspersion according to theocritus was mixed
    with salt as is sometimes the modern italian holy water jj

    of her urine which was thrown over him as a special mark of honor
    to a distinguished guest pennant remarked that the highlanders
    sprinkled their cattle with urine as a kind of holy water on
    the first monday in every quarter bourke scatalogic rites
    pp 228 239 brand popular antiquities brideales
    even the excreta of animals have sometimes been counted sacred
    this is notably so in the case of the cow of all animals the
    most venerated by primitive peoples and especially in india
    jules bois visions de linde p 86 describes the spectacle
    presented in the temple of the cows at benares i put my head
    into the opening of the holy stables it was the largest of
    temples a splendor of precious stones and marble where the
    venerated heifers passed backwards and forwards a whole people
    adored them they take no notice plunged in their divine and
    obscure unconsciousness and they fulfil with serenity their
    animal functions they chew the offerings drink water from
    copper vessels and when they are filled they relieve themselves
    then a stercoraceous and religious insanity overcomes these
    starryfaced women and venerable men they fall on their knees
    prostrate themselves eat the droppings greedily drink the
    liquid which for them is miraculous and sacred cf bourke
    scatalogic rites chapter xvii
    among the chevsurs of the caucasus perhaps an iranian people a
    woman after her confinement for which she lives apart purifies
    herself by washing in the urine of a cow and then returns home
    this mode of purification is recommended in the avesta and is
    said to be used by the few remaining followers of this creed
we have not only to take into account the frequency with which among
primitive peoples the excretions possess a religious significance it is
further to be noted that in the folklore of modern europe we everywhere
find plentiful evidence of the earlier prevalence of legends and practices
of a scatalogical character it is significant that in the majority of
cases it is easy to see a sexual reference in these stories and customs
the legends have lost their earlier and often mythical significance and
frequently take on a suggestion of obscenity while the scatalogical
practices have become the magical devices of lovelorn maidens or forsaken
wives practiced in secrecy it has happened to scatalogical rites to be
regarded as we may gather from the clouds of aristophanes that the
sacred leathern phallus borne by the women in the bacchanalia was becoming
in his time an object to arouse the amusement of little boys
    among many primitive peoples throughout the world and among the
    lower social classes of civilized peoples urine possesses magic
    properties more especially it would seem the urine of women
    and that of people who stand or wish to stand in sexual
    relationship to each other in a legend of the indians of the
    northwest coast of america recorded by boas a woman gives her
    lover some of her urine and says you can wake the dead if you
    drop some of my urine in their ears and nose zeitschrift fr

    is a legend of a woman with a beautiful white skin who found on
    bathing every morning in the river that the fish were attracted
    to her skin and could not be driven off even by magical
    solutions at last she said to herself i will make water on
    them and then they will leave me alone she did so and
    henceforth the fish left her but shortly after fire came from

    this matter a study of popular beliefs in the magic power of
    urine published in bombay by professor eugen wilhelm in 1889 i
    have not seen
    the legends which narrate scatalogic exploits are numerous in the
    literature of all countries among primitive peoples they often
    have a purely theological character for in the popular
    mythologies of all countries even as we learn from
    aristophanes among the greeks natural phenomena such as the
    rain are apt to be regarded as divine excretions but in course
    of time the legends take on a more erotic or a more obscene
    character in the irish book of leinster written down
    somewhere about the twelfth century but containing material of
    very much older date we are told how a number of princesses in
    emain macha the seat of the ulster kings resolved to find out
    which of them could by urinating on it melt a snow pillar which
    the men had made the woman who succeeded to be regarded as the
    best among them none of them succeeded and they sent for
    derbforgaill who was in love with cuchullain and she was able
    to melt the pillar whereupon the other women jealous of the
    superiority she had thus shown tore out her eyes zimmer

    tear j rhys lectures on the origin and growth of religion as
    illustrated by celtic heathendom p 466 it is interesting to
    compare the legend of derbforgaill with a somewhat more modern
    picardy folklore conte which is clearly analogous but no
    longer seems to show any mythologic element la princesse qui
    pisse par dessus les meules this princess had a habit of
    urinating over haycocks the king her father in order to break
    her of the habit offered her in marriage to anyone who could
    make a haycock so high that she could not urinate over it the
    young men came but the princess would merely laugh and at once
    achieve the task at last there came a young man who argued with
    himself that she would not be able to perform this feat after she
    had lost her virginity he therefore seduced her first and she
    then failed ignobly merely wetting her stockings accordingly
    she became his bride kryptadia vol i p 333 such legends
    which have lost any mythologic elements they may originally have
    possessed and have become merely contes are not uncommon in
    the folklore of many countries but in their earlier more
    religious forms and in their later more obscene forms they alike
    bear witness to the large place which scatalogic conceptions play
    in the primitive mind
it is a notable fact in evidence of the close and seemingly normal
association with the sexual impulse of the scatalogic processes that an
interest in them arising naturally and spontaneously is one of the most
frequent channels by which the sexual impulse first manifests itself in
young boys and girls
    stanley hall who has made special inquiries into the matter
    remarks that in childhood the products of excretion by bladder
    and bowels are often objects of interest hardly less intense for
    a time than eating and drinking early sense of self
    american journal of psychology april 1898 p 361
    micturitional obscenities the same writer observes again
    which our returns show to be so common before adolescence
    culminate at 10 or 12 and seem to retreat into the background as
    sex phenomena appear they are he remarks of two classes
    fouling persons or things secretly from adults but openly with
    each other and less often ceremonial acts connected with the
    act or the product that almost suggest the scatalogical rites of
    savages unfit for description here but of great interest and
    importance g stanley hall adolescence vol i p 116
    the nature of such scatalogical phenomena in childhoodwhich are
    often clearly the instinctive manifestations of an erotic
    symbolismand their wide prevalence among both boys and girls
    are very well illustrated in a narrative which i include in
    appendix b history ii
in boys as they approach the age of puberty this attraction to the
scatalogic when it exists tends to die out giving place to more normal
sexual conceptions or at all events it takes a subordinate and less
serious place in the mind in girls on the other hand it often tends to
persist edmond de goncourt a minute observer of the feminine mind
refers in chrie to those innocent and triumphant gaieties which
scatalogic stories have the privilege of arousing in women who have
remained still children even the most distinguished women the extent to
which innocent young women who would frequently be uninterested or
repelled in presence of the sexually obscene are sometimes attracted by
the scatalogically obscene becomes intelligible however if we realize
that a symbolism comes here into play in women the more specifically
sexual knowledge and experience of life frequently develop much later than
in men or even remains in abeyance and the specifically sexual phenomena
cannot therefore easily lend themselves to wit or humor or imagination
but the scatalogic sphere by the very fact that in women it is a
specially intimate and secret region which is yet always liable to be
unexpectedly protruded into consciousness furnishes an inexhaustible
field for situations which have the same character as those furnished by
the sexually obscene it thus happens that the sexually obscene which in
men tends to overshadow the scatalogically obscene in womenpartly from
inexperience and partly it is probable from their almost physiological
modestyplays a part subordinate to the scatalogical in a somewhat
analogous way scatalogical wit and humor play a considerable part in the
work of various eminent authors who were clergymen or priests
in addition to the anatomical and psychological associations which
contribute to furnish a basis on which erotic symbolisms may spring up
there are also physiological connections between the genital and urinary
spheres which directly favor such symbolisms in discussing the analysis
of the sexual impulse in a previous volume of these studies i have
pointed out the remarkable relationshipsometimes of transference
sometimes of compensationwhich exists between genital tension and
vesical tension both in men and women in the histories of normal sexual
development brought together at the end of that and subsequent volumes the
relationship may frequently be traced as also in the case of cp in the
present study p 37 vesical power is also commonly believed to be in
relation with sexual potency and the inability to project the urinary
stream in a normal manner is one of the accepted signs of sexual
impotency26 fr again has recorded the history of a man with
periodic crises of sexual desire and subsequently sexual obsession
without desire which were always accompanied by the impulse to urinate
and by increased urination27 in the case recorded by pitres and rgis
of a young girl who having once at the sight of a young man she liked in
a theater been overcome by sexual feeling accompanied by a strong desire
to urinate was afterward tormented by a groundless fear of experiencing
an irresistible desire to urinate at inconvenient times28 we have an
example of what may be called a physiological scatalogic symbolism of sex
an emotion which was primarily erotic becoming transferred to the bladder
and then remaining persistent from such a physiological symbolism it is
but a step to the psychological symbolisms of scatalogic fetichism
    it is worthy of note as an indication that such phenomena are
    scarcely abnormal that a urinary symbolism and even a strictly
    sexual fetichism are normal among many animals
    the most familiar example of this kind is furnished by the dog
    who is sexually excited in this manner by traces of the bitch and
    himself takes every opportunity of making his own path
    recognizable this custom espinas remarks des socits
    animales p 228 has no other aim than to spread along the
    road recognizable traces of their presence for the benefit of
    individuals of the other sex the odor of these traces doubtless
    causing excitement
    it is noteworthy also that in animals as well as in man sexual
    excitement may manifest itself in the bladder thus daumas states
    chevaux de sahara p 49 that if the mare urinates when she
    hears the stallion neigh it is a sign that she is ready for
    connection
it is in masochism or passive algolagnia that we may most frequently
find scatalogic symbolism in its fully developed form the man whose
predominant impulse is to subjugate himself to his mistress and to receive
at her hands the utmost humiliation frequently finds the climax of his
gratification in being urinated on by her whether in actual fact or only
in imagination
in many such cases however it is evident that we have a mixed
phenomenon the symbolism is double the act becomes desirable because it
is the outward and visible sign of an inwardly experienced abject slavery
to an adored person but it is also desirable because of intimately sexual
associations in the act itself as a symbolical detumescence a simulacrum
of the sexual act and one which proceeds from the sexual focus itself
    krafftebing records various cases of masochism in which the
    emission of urine on to the body or into the mouth formed the
    climax of sexual gratification as for instance psychopathia
    sexualis english translation p 183 in the case of a russian
    official who as a boy had fancies of being bound between the
    thighs of a woman compelled to sleep beneath her nates and to
    drink her urine and in later life experienced the greatest
    excitement when practicing the last part of this early
    imagination
    in another case recorded by krafftebing and by him termed
    ideal masochism op cit pp 127130 the subject from
    childhood indulged in voluptuous daydreams in which he was the
    slave of a beautiful mistress who would compel him to obey all
    her caprices stand over him with one foot on his breast sit on
    his face and body make him wait on her in her bath or when she
    urinated and sometimes insist on doing this on his face though
    a highly intellectual man he was always too timid to attempt to
    carry any of his ideas into execution he had been troubled by
    nocturnal enuresis up to the age of 20
    neri again archivio delle psicopatie sessuali vol i fasc
    7 and 8 1896 records the case of an italian masochist who
    experienced the greatest pleasure when both urination and
    defecation were practiced in this manner by the woman he was
    attached to
    in a previous volume of these studies sexual inversion
    history xxvi i have recorded the masochistic daydreams of a boy
    whose impulses were at the same time inverted in his reveries
    the central fact he states became the discharge of urine
    from my lover over my body and limbs or if i were very fond of
    him i let it be in my face in actual life the act of urination
    casually witnessed in childhood became the symbol even the
    reality of the central secret of sex i stood rooted and
    flushing with downcast eyes till the act was over and was
    conscious for a considerable time of stammering speech and
    bewildered faculties i was overwhelmed with emotion and could
    barely drag my feet from the spot or my eyes from the damp
    herbage where he had deposited the waters of secrecy even today
    i cannot dissociate myself from the shuddering charm that moment
    had for me
it is not only the urine and the fces which may thus acquire a symbolic
fascination and attractiveness under the influence of masochistic
deviations of sexual idealization in some cases extreme rapture has been
experienced in licking sweating feet there is indeed no excretion or
product of the body which has not been a source of ecstasy the sweat from
every part of the body the saliva and menstrual fluid even the wax from
the ears
    krafftebing very truly points out psychopathia sexualis
    english translation p 178 that this sexual scatalogic
    symbolism is precisely paralleled by a religious scatalogic
    symbolism in the excesses of devout enthusiasm the ascetic
    performs exactly the same acts as are performed in these excesses
    of erotic enthusiasm to mix excreta with the food to lick up
    excrement to suck festering soresall these and the like are
    acts which holy and venerated women have performed
    not only the saint but also the prophet and medicineman have
    been frequently eaters of human excrement it is only necessary
    to refer to the instance of the prophet ezekiel who declared
    that he was commanded to bake his bread with human dung and to
    the practices of medicinemen at torres straits in whose
    training the eating of human excrement takes a recognized part
    deities notably baalphegor were sometimes supposed to eat
    excrement so that it was natural that their messengers and
    representatives among men should do so as regards baalphegor

    bourke scatalogic rites of all nations p 241 see also
    ezekiel chapter iv v 12 and reports anthropological
    expedition to torres straits vol v p 321
    it must be added however that while the masochist is overcome
    by sexual rapture so that he sees nothing disgusting in his act
    the medicineman and the ascetic are not so invariably overcome
    by religious rapture and several ascetic writers have referred
    to the horror and disgust they experienced at all events at
    first in accomplishing such acts while the medicinemen when
    novices sometimes find the ordeal too severe and have to abandon
    their career brnier de montmorand while remarking not without
    some exaggeration that the christian ascetics are almost all
    eaters of excrement asctisme et mysticisme revue
    philosophique march 1904 p 245 quotes the testimonies of
    margueritemarie and madame guyon as to the extreme repugnance
    which they had to overcome they were impelled by a merely
    intellectual symbolism of selfmortification rather than by the
    profoundly felt emotional symbolism which moves the masochist
    coprophagic acts whether under the influences of religious
    exaltation or of sexual rapture inevitably excite our disgust
    we regard them as almost insane fortified in that belief by the
    undoubted fact that coprophagia is not uncommon among the insane
    it may therefore be proper to point out that it is not so very
    long since the ingestion of human excrement was carried out by
    our own forefathers in the most sane and deliberate manner it
    was administered by medical practitioners for a great number of
    ailments apparently with entirely satisfactory results less
    than two centuries ago schurig who so admirably gathered
    together and arranged the medical lore of his own and the
    immediately preceding ages wrote a very long and detailed
    chapter de stercoris humani usu medico chylologia 1725
    cap xiii in the paris journal de mdecine for february 19
    1905 there appeared an article which i have not seen entitled
    mdicaments oublies lurine et la fiente humaine the
    classes of cases in which the drug was found beneficial would
    seem to have been extremely various it must not be supposed that
    it was usually ingested in the crude form a common method was to
    take the fces of boys dry them mix them with the best honey
    and administer an electuary at an earlier period such drugs
    appear to have met with some opposition from the church which
    seems to have seen in them only an application of magic thus i
    note that in burchards remarkable penitential of the fourteenth
    century as reproduced by wasserschleben 40 days penance is
    prescribed for the use of human urine or excrement as a medicine

the urolagnia of masochism is not a simple phenomenon it embodies a
double symbolism on the one hand a symbolism of selfabnegation such as
the ascetic feels on the other hand a symbolism of transferred sexual
emotion krafftebing was disposed to regard all cases in which a
scatalogical sexual attraction existed as due to latent masochism such
a point of view is quite untenable certainly the connection is common
but in the majority of cases of slightly marked scatalogical fetichism no
masochism is evident and when we bear in mind the various considerations
already brought forward which show how widespread and clearly realized is
the natural and normal basis furnished for such symbolism it becomes
quite unnecessary to invoke any aid from masochism there is ample
evidence to show that either as a habitual or more usually an occasional
act the impulse to bestow a symbolic value on the act of urination in a
beloved person is not extremely uncommon it has been noted of men of
high intellectual distinction it occurs in women as well as men when
existing in only a slight degree it must be regarded as within the normal
limits of variation of sexual emotion
    the occasional cases in which the urine is drunk may possibly
    suggest that the motive lies in the properties of the fluid
    acting on the system support for this supposition might be found
    in the fact that urine actually does possess apart altogether
    from its magic virtues embodied in folklore the properties of a
    general stimulant in composition as masterman first pointed
    out beeftea differs little from healthy urine containing
    exactly the same constituents except that in beeftea there is
    less urea and uric acid fresh urinemore especially that of
    children and young womenis taken as a medicine in nearly all
    parts of the world for various disorders such as epistaxis
    malaria and hysteria with benefit this benefit being almost
    certainly due to its qualities as a general stimulant and
    restorative william salmons dispensatory 1678 quoted in
    british medical journal april 21 1900 p 974 shows that in
    the seventeenth century urine still occupied an important place
    as a medicine and it frequently entered largely into the
    composition of aqua divina
    its use has been known even in england in the nineteenth century
    masterman lancet october 2 1880 r neale urine as a
    medicine practitioner november 1881 bourke brings together
    a great deal of evidence as to the therapeutic uses of urine in
    his scatalogic rites especially pp 331335 lusini has shown
    that normal urine invariably increases the frequency of the heart
    beats archivio di farmacologia fascs 1921 1893
    but it is an error to suppose that these facts account for the
    urolagnic drinking of urine as in the gratification of a normal
    sexual impulse the intense excitement of gratifying a scatalogic
    sexual impulse itself produces a degree of emotional stimulation
    far greater than the ingestion of a small amount of animal
    extractives would be adequate to effect in such cases as much
    as in normal sexuality the stimulation is clearly psychic
when as is most commonly the case it is the process of urination and not
the urine itself which is attractive we are clearly concerned with a
symbolism of act and not with the fetichistic attraction of an excretion
when the excretion apart from the act provides the attraction we seem
usually to be in the presence of an olfactory fetichism these fetichisms
connected with the excreta appear to be experienced chiefly by individuals
who are somewhat weakminded which is not necessarily the case in regard
to those persons for whom the act rather than its product apart from the
beloved person is the attractive symbol
    the sexually symbolic nature of the act of urination for many
    people is indicated by the existence according to bloch who
    enumerates various kinds of indecent photographs of a group
    which he terms the notorious pisseuses it is further
    indicated by several of the reproductions in fuchs erotsiche
    element in der karikatur such as delormes la necessit na
    point de loi it should be added that such a scene by no means
    necessarily possesses any erotic symbolism as we may see in
    rembrandts etching commonly called le femme qui pisse in
    which the reflected lights on the partly shadowed stream furnish
    an artistic motive which is obviously free from any trace of
    obscenity in the case which krafftebing quotes from maschka of
    a young man who would induce young girls to dance naked in his
    room to leap and to urinate in his presence whereupon seminal
    ejaculation would take place we have a typical example of
    urolagnic symbolism in a form adequate to produce complete
    gratification a case in which the urolagnic form of scatalogic
    symbolism reached its fullest development as a sexual perversion
    has been described in russia by sukhanoff summarized in
    archives danthropologie criminelle november 1900 and
    annales medicopsychologiques february 1901 that of a young
    man of 27 of neuropathic temperament who when he once chanced
    to witness a woman urinating experienced voluptuous sensations
    from that moment he sought close contact with women urinating
    the maximum of gratification being reached when he could place
    himself in such a position that a woman in all innocence would
    urinate into his mouth all his amorous adventures were concerned
    with the search for opportunities for procuring this difficult
    gratification closets in which he was able to hide winter
    weather and dull days he found most favorable to success a
    somewhat similar case is recorded in the archives de
    neurologie 1902 p 462
    in the case of a robust man of neuropathic heredity recorded by
    pelanda some light is shed on the psychic attitude in these
    manifestations there was masturbation up to the age of 16 when
    he abandoned the practice and up to the age of 30 found complete
    satisfaction in drinking the still hot urine of women when a
    lady or girl in the house went to her room to satisfy a need of
    this kind she had hardly left it but he hastened in overcome by
    extreme excitement culminating in spontaneous ejaculation the
    younger the woman the greater the transport he experienced it is
    noteworthy that in this as possibly in all similar cases there
    was no sensory perversion and no morbid attraction of taste or
    smell he stated that the action of his senses was suspended by
    his excitement and that he was quite unable to perceive the odor
    or taste of the fluid pelanda pornopatice archivio di
    psichiatria facs iiiiv 1889 p 356 it is in the emotional
    symbolism that the fascination lies and not in any sensory
    perversion
    magnan records the spontaneous development of this sexual
    symbolism in a girl of 11 of good intellectual development but
    alcoholic heredity who seduced a boy younger than herself to
    mutual masturbation and on one occasion lying on the ground and
    raising her clothes asked him to urinate on her international
    congress of criminal anthropology 1889 this case except for
    the early age of the subject illustrates sporadically occurring
    urolagnic symbolism in a woman to whom such symbolism is fairly
    obvious on account of the close resemblance between the emission
    of urine and the ejaculation of semen in the man and the fact
    that the same conduit serves for both fluids a urolagnic
    daydream of this kind is recorded in the history of a lady
    contained in the third volume of these studies appendix b
    history viii the natural and inevitable character of this
    symbolism is shown by the fact that among primitive peoples urine
    is sometimes supposed to possess the fertilizing virtues of

    intentionally drinking urine
    the symbolic sexual significance of urolagnia has hitherto
    usually been confused with the fetichistic and mainly olfactory
    perversion by which the excretion itself becomes a source of
    sexual excitement long since tardieu referred under the name of
    renifleurs to persons who were said to haunt the neighborhood
    of quiet passages more especially in the neighborhood of
    theatres and who when they perceived a woman emerge after
    urination would hasten to excite themselves by the odor of the
    excretion possibly a fetichism of this kind existed in a case
    recorded by belletrud and mercier annales dhygine publique
    june 1904 p 48 a weakminded timid youth who was very
    sexual but not attractive to women would watch for women who
    were about to urinate and immediately they had passed on would go
    and lick the spot they had moistened at the same time
    masturbating such a fetichistic perversion is strictly analogous
    to the fetichism by which womens handkerchiefs aprons or
    underlinen become capable of affording sexual gratification a
    very complete case of such urolagnic fetichismcomplete because
    separated from association with the person accomplishing the act
    of urinationhas been recorded by moraglia in a woman it is the
    case of a beautiful and attractive young woman of 18 with thick
    black hair and expressive vivacious eyes but sallow complexion
    married a year previously but childless she experienced a
    certain amount of pleasure in coitus but she preferred
    masturbation and frankly acknowledged that she was highly
    excited by the odor of fermented urine so strong was this
    fetichism that when for instance she passed a street urinal she
    was often obliged to go aside and masturbate once she went for
    this purpose into the urinal itself and was almost discovered in
    the act and on another occasion into a church her perversion
    caused her much worry because of the fear of detection she
    preferred when she could to obtain a bottle of urinewhich
    must be stale and a mans this she said she could detect by
    the smelland to shut herself up in her own room holding the
    bottle in one hand and repeatedly masturbating with the other
    moraglia psicopatie sessuali archivio di psichiatria vol
    xiii fasc 6 p 267 1892 this case is of especial interest
    because of the great rarity of fully developed fetichism in
    women in a slight and germinal degree i believe that cases of
    fetichism are not uncommon in women but they are certainly rare
    in a wellmarked form and krafftebing declared even in the
    late editions of his psychopathia sexualis that he knew of no
    cases in women
so far we have been concerned with the urolagnic rather than the
coprolagnic variety of scatalogical symbolism although the two are
sometimes associated there is no necessary connection and most usually
there is no tendency for the one to involve the other urolagnia is
certainly much the more frequently found the act of urination is far more
apt to suggest erotically symbolical ideas than the idea of defecation
it is not difficult to understand why this should be so the act of
urination lends itself more easily to sexual symbolism it is more
intimately associated with the genital function its repetition is
necessary at more frequent intervals so that it is more in evidence
moreover its product unlike that of the act of defecation is not
offensive to the senses still coprolagnia occurs and not so very
infrequently burton remarked that even the normal lover is affected by
this feeling immo nec ipsum amic stercus foctet29
of caligula who however was scarcely sane it was said et quidem
stercus uxoris degustavit30 in parisian brothels according to taxil
and others provision is made for those who are sexually excited by the
spectacle of the act of defecation without reference to contact or odor
by means of a tabouret de verre from under the glass floor of which the
spectacle of the defecating women may be closely observed it may be added
that the erotic nature of such a spectacle is referred to in the marquis
de sades novels
there is one motive for the existence of coprolagnia which must not be
passed over because it has doubtless frequently served as a mode of
transition to what taken by itself may well seem the least sthetically
attractive of erotic symbols i refer to the tendency of the nates to
become a sexual fetich the nates have in all ages and in all parts of the
world been frequently regarded as one of the most sthetically beautiful
parts of the feminine body31 it is probable that on the basis of this
entirely normal attraction more than one form of erotic symbolism is at
all events in part supported dhren and others have considered that the
sthetic charm of the nates is one of the motives which prompt the desire
to inflict flagellation on women in the same waycertainly in some and
probably in many casesthe sexual charm of the nates progressively
extends to the anal region to the act of defecation and finally to the
feces
    in a case of krafftebings op cit p 183 the subject
    when a child of 6 accidentally placed his hand in contact with
    the nates of the little girl who sat next to him in school and
    experienced so great a pleasure in this contact that he
    frequently repeated it when he was 10 a nursery governess to
    gratify her own desires placed his finger in her vagina in
    adult life he developed urolagnic tendencies
    in a case of molls the development of a youthful admiration for
    the nates in a coprolagnic direction may be clearly traced in
    this case a young man a merchant in a good position sought to
    come in contact with women defecating and with this object would
    seek to conceal himself in closets the excretal odor was
    pleasurable to him but was not essential to gratification and
    the sight of the nates was also exciting and at the same time not
    essential to gratification the act of defecation appears
    however to have been regarded as essential he never sought to
    witness prostitutes in this situation he was only attracted to
    young pretty and innocent women the coprolagnia here however
    had its source in a childish impression of admiration for the
    nates when 5 or 6 years old he crawled under the clothes of a
    servant girl his face coming in contact with her nates an
    impression that remained associated in his mind with pleasure
    three or four years later he used to experience much pleasure
    when a young girl cousin sat on his face thus was strengthened
    an association which developed naturally into coprolagnia moll
    untersuchungen ber die libido sexualis bd i p 837
    it is scarcely necessary to remark that an admiration for the
    nates even when reaching a fetichistic degree by no means
    necessarily involves even after many years any attraction to
    the excreta a correspondent for whom the nates have constituted
    a fetich for many years writes i find my craving for women with
    profuse pelvic or posterior development is growing and i wish to
    copulate from behind but i would feel a sickening feeling if any
    part of my person came in contact with the female anus it is
    more pleasing to me to see the nates than the mons yet i loathe
    everything associated with the anal region
moll has recorded in detail a case of what may be described as ideal
coprolagniathat is to say where the symbolism though fully developed
in imagination was not carried into real lifewhich is of great interest
because it shows how in a very intelligent subject the deviated
symbolism may become highly developed and irradiate all the views of life
in the same way as the normal impulse the subjects desires were also
inverted but from the present point of view the psychological interest of
the case is not thereby impaired molls case was one of symbolism of
act the excreta offering no attraction apart from the process of
defecation in a case which has been communicated to me there was on the
other hand an olfactory fetichistic attraction to the excreta even in the
absence of the person
    in molls case the patient x 23 years of age belongs to a
    family which he himself describes as nervous his mother who is
    anmic has long suffered from almost periodical attacks of
    excitement weakness syncope and palpitation a brother of the
    mother died in a lunatic asylum and several other brothers
    complain much of their nerves the mothers sisters are very
    goodnatured but liable to break out in furious passions this
    they inherit from their father there appears to be no nervous
    disease on the patients fathers side xs sisters are also
    healthy
    x himself is of powerful undersized build and enjoys good
    health injured by no excesses he considers himself nervous he
    worked hard at school and was always the first in his class he
    adds however that this is due less to his own abilities than
    the laziness of his schoolfellows he is as he remarks very
    religious and prays frequently but seldom goes to church
    in regard to his psychic characters he says that he has no
    specially prominent talent but is much interested in languages
    mathematics physics and philosophy in fact in abstract
    subjects generally while i take a lively interest in every kind
    of intellectual work he says it is only recently that i have
    been attracted to real life and its requirements i have never
    had much skill in physical exercises for external things until
    recently i have only had contempt i have a delicately
    constituted nature loving solitude and only associating with a
    few select persons i have a decided taste for fiction poetry
    and music my temperament is idealistic and religious with
    strict conceptions of duty and morality and aspirations towards
    the good and beautiful i detest all that is common and coarse
    and yet i can think and act in the way you will learn from the
    following pages
    regarding his sexual life x made the following communication
    during the last two years i have become convinced of the
    perversion of my sexual instinct i had often previously thought
    that in me the impulse was not quite normal but it is only
    lately that i have become convinced of my complete perversion i
    have never read or heard of any case in which the sexual feelings
    were of the same kind although i can feel a lively inclination
    towards superior representatives of the female sex and have
    twice felt something like love the sight or the recollection
    even of a beautiful woman have never caused sexual excitement
    in the two exceptional instances mentioned it appears that x had
    an inclination to kiss the women in question but that the
    thought of coitus had no attraction in my voluptuous dreams
    connected with the emission of semen women in seductive
    situations have never appeared i have never had any desire to
    visit a puella publica the lovestories of my fellowstudents
    seemed very silly dances and balls were a horror to me and only
    on very rare occasions could i be persuaded to go into society
    it will be easy to guess the diagnosis in my case i suffer from
    the sexual attraction of my own sex i am a lover of boys
    you cannot imagine what a world of thoughts wishes feelings
    and impulses the words knabe pais garcon boy
    ragazzo have for me one of these words even in an unmeaning
    clause of a translationbook calls before me the whole sum of
    associations which in course of time have become bound up with
    this idea and it is only with an effort that i can scare away
    the wild band this group of thoughts shows a wonderful mixture
    of warm sensuality and ideal love it unites my lowest and
    highest impulses the strength and the weakness of my nature my
    curse and my blessing my inclination is especially towards boys
    of the age of 12 to 15 though they may be rather younger or
    older that i should prefer beautiful and intelligent boys is
    comprehensible i do not want a prostitute but a friend or a
    son whose soul i love whom i can help to become a more perfect
    man such as i myself would willingly be
    when i myself belonged to that happy age ie below 15 i had
    no dearer wish than to possess a friend of similar tastes i have
    sought hoped waited grieved and been at last disillusioned
    overcome by desire and despair and have not found that friend
    even later the hope often reappeared but always in vain and i
    cannot boast of that sure recognition which one reads of in the
    autobiographies of urnings i do not know personally a single
    fellowsufferer it is also doubtful whether such an
    acquaintanceship would greatly help me for i have a very
    peculiar conception of homosexuality as you will see i have
    little more in common with what are called pderasts than sexual
    indifference to the female sex and i often ask myself does any
    other man in the whole world feel like you are you alone in the
    earth with your morbid desires are you a pariah of pariahs or
    is there perhaps another soul with similar longings living near
    you how often in summer have i gone to the lakes and streams
    outside cities to seek boys bathing but i always came back
    unsatisfied whether i found any or not and in winter i have
    been irresistibly impelled to return to the same spots as if it
    were sanctified by the boys but my darlings had vanished and
    cold winds blew over the icy floods so that i would return
    feeling as though i had buried all my happiness
    it must be borne in mind therefore that what i have to say
    regarding my sexual impulses only refers to fancies and never to
    their practical realization my sensual impulses are not
    connected with the sexual organs all my voluptuous ideas are not
    in the least connected with these parts for this reason i have
    never practiced onanism and immissio membri in anum is as
    repulsive to me as to a normal man even every imitation of
    coitus is for me without attraction in a boys body two things
    specially excite me his belly and his nates the first as
    containing the digestive tract the second as holding the opening
    of the bowels of the vegetable processes of life in the boy none
    interest me nearly so much as the progress of his digestion and
    the process of defecation it is incredible to what an extent
    this part of physiology has occupied me from youth if as a boy i
    wanted to read something of a piquantly exciting character i
    sought in my fathers encyclopdia for articles like
    obstruction constipation hmorrhoids fces etc no function
    of the body seemed to be so significant as this and i regarded
    its disturbances as the most important in the whole mechanism of
    life the description of other disorders i could read in cold
    blood but intussusception of the bowels makes me ill even
    today i am always extremely pleased to hear that the digestion
    of the people around me is in good condition a man who did not
    sufficiently watch over his digestion aroused distrust in me and
    i imagined that wicked men must be horribly indifferent regarding
    this weighty matter even more than in ordinary persons was i
    interested in the digestion of more mysterious beings like
    magicians in legends or men of other nations i would willingly
    have made an anthropological study of my favorite subject only
    to my annoyance books nearly always pass over the matter in
    silence in history and fiction i regretted the absence of
    information concerning the state of my heroes digestion when
    they languished in prison or in some unaccustomed or unhealthy
    spot for this reason i held no book more precious than one which
    describes how a young man after being shipwrecked lived for a
    long time in a narrow snowhut and it was conscientiously stated
    that he became aware of digestive disturbances no immorality
    angers me more than the foolish practice of ladies who in society
    neglect the satisfaction of their natural needs from misplaced
    motives of modesty on a railway journey i suffer horribly from
    the thought that one of my fellowtravelers may be prevented from
    fulfilling some imperative natural necessity
    i naturally devote the greatest attention to my own digestion
    with painful conscientiousness i go to stool every day at the
    same hour if the operation does not come off to my satisfaction
    i feel not so much physical as mental discomfort to this quite
    useful hygienic interest became associated at puberty a sensual
    interest since my fourteenth year i have had no greater
    enjoyment than to defecate undressed i do not do so now after
    having first carefully examined the distension of my abdomen in
    summer i would go into the woods undress myself in a secluded
    spot and indulge in the voluptuous pleasures of defecation i
    would sometimes combine with this a bath in a stream i would
    exhaust my imagination in the effort to invent specially
    enjoyable variations longed for a desert island where i could go
    about naked fill my body with much nourishing food hold in the
    excrement as long as possible and then discharge it in some
    subtlythoughtout spot these practices and ideas often caused
    erections and later on emissions but the genitals played no part
    in my conceptions their movements were uncomfortable and gave no
    pleasure
    i soon longed to be associated in these orgies with some boy of
    the same age but i wanted not only a companion in my passion
    but also a real friend since there could be no question of
    masturbation or pderasty our love would have been limited to
    kisses embraces andas a compensation for coitusdefecation
    together that would have been perfect bliss to me i will spare
    you the unsthetic contents of my voluptuous dreams but i
    remained without a companion and therefore without real
    enjoyment he has however on various occasions experienced
    erections and even emissions on seeing by chance men or boys
    defecate hinc ill lacrim the excitement over my own
    defecation only took place faute de mieux
    i knew very well that my thoughts and practices were impure and
    contemptible ah how often when the intoxication was over have
    i thrown myself remorsefully on my knees praying to god for
    pardon for some weeks i repressed my longing but at last it was
    too strong for me i tried to justify myself and fell into my
    vice anew that i was guilty of licentiousness and loved boys
    sexually first became clear to me later on when i knew the
    significance of erection as a sign of sexual excitement
    no one can imagine with what demoniacal joy i am possessed at
    the thought of a beautiful naked boy whose abdomen is filled as
    the result of long abstinence from stool the thought powerfully
    excites me a flood of passion goes through my blood and my limbs
    tremble i would never grow tired of feeling that belly and
    looking at it my passion would express itself in tempestuous
    caresses and the boy would have to assume various positions in
    order to show off the beauty of his form ie to bring the
    parts in question into better view to observe defecation would
    still further increase this peculiar enjoyment if the boys
    bowels were not sufficiently filled i would feed him with all
    sorts of food which produces much excrement such as potatoes
    coarse bread etc if possible i would seek to delay defecation
    for two or three days so that it might be as copious as
    possible when at last it occurred it would be an unspeakable joy
    for me to watch the fceswhich would have to be fairly
    firmemerging from the anus
    x would like to be a teacher and thinks he could exert a
    beneficial influence on boys in spite of the pain he has
    suffered he does not think he would like to be cured of his
    perverse inclinations for they have given him joy as well as
    pain and the pain has chiefly been owing to the fact that he
    could not gratify his inclinations x smokes and drinks in
    moderation and has no feminine habits the foregoing is a
    condensed summary of the case which is fully reported by moll
    kontrre sexualempfindung third edition pp 295305
    the case of coprolagnia communicated to me is that of a married
    man normal in all other respects intellectually brilliant and
    filling successfully a very responsible position when a child
    the women of his household were always indifferent as to his
    presence in their bedrooms and would satisfy all natural calls
    without reserve before him he would dream of this with
    erections his sexual interests became slowly centered in the act
    of defecation and this fetich throughout life never appealed to
    him so powerfully as when associated with the particular type of
    household furniture which was used for this purpose in his own
    house the act of defecation in the opposite sex or anything
    pertaining to or suggesting the same caused uncontrollable sexual
    excitement the nates also exerted a great attraction the alvine
    excreta exerted this influence even in the absence of the woman
    it was however necessary that she should be a sexually
    desirable person the perversion in this case was not complete
    that is to say that the excitement produced by the act of
    defecation or the excretion itself was not actually preferred to
    coitus the sexual idea was normal coitus in the normal manner
    but preceded by the visual and olfactory enjoyment of the
    exciting fetich when coitus was not possible the enjoyment of
    the fetich was accompanied by masturbation as in the analogous
    case of urolagnia in a woman summarized on p 62 on one
    occasion he was discovered by a friend in a bedroom belonging to
    a woman engaged in the act of masturbation over a vessel
    containing the desired fetich in an agony of shame he begged the
    mercy of silence concerning this episode at the same time
    revealing his lifehistory he has constantly been haunted by the
    dread of detection as well as by remorse and the consciousness
    of degradation also by the fear that his unconquerable obsession
    may lead him to the asylum
the scatalogic groups of sexual perversions urolagnia and coprolagnia as
may be sufficiently seen in this brief summary are not merely olfactory
fetiches they are in a larger proportion of cases dynamic symbols a
preoccupation with physiological acts which by associations of contiguity
and still more of resemblance have gained the virtue of stimulating in
slight cases and replacing in more extreme cases the normal
preoccupation with the central physiological act itself we have seen that
there are various considerations which amply suffice to furnish a basis
for such associations and when we reflect that in the popular mind and
to some extent in actual fact the sexual act itself is like urination
and defecation an excretory act we can understand that the true
excretory acts may easily become symbols of the pseudoexcretory act it
is indeed in the muscular release of accumulated pressures and tensions
involved by the act of liberating the storedup excretion that we have
the closest simulacrum of the tumescence and detumescence of the sexual
process32
in this way the erotic symbolism of urolagnia and coprolagnia is
completely analogous with that dynamic symbolism of the clinging and
swinging garments which herrick has so accurately described with the
complex symbolism of flagellation and its play of the rod against the
blushing and trembling nates with the symbols of sexual strain and stress
which are embodied in the foot and the act of treading

distinguishing sharply between the erotic and the obscene reserves
the latter term exclusively for the representation of excretory organs and
acts he considers that this is etymologically the most exact usage
however that may be it seems to me that in any case obscene has
become so vague a term that it is now impracticable to give it a
restricted and precise sense
25 in this connection we may profitably contemplate the hand and recall
the vast gamut of functions sacred and profane which that organ
exercises many savages strictly reserve the left hand to the lowlier
purposes of life but in civilization that is not considered necessary
and it may be wholesome for some of us to meditate on the more humble uses
of the same hand which is raised in the supreme gesture of benediction and
which men have often counted it a privilege to kiss

p 19 a similar symbolism may be traced in many of the cases in which the
focus of modesty becomes in modest women centered in the excretory sphere
and sometimes exaggerated to the extent of obsession it must not be
supposed however that every obsession in this sphere has a symbolical
value of an erotic kind in the case for instance which has been
recorded by raymond and janet les obsessions vol ii p 306 of a
woman who spent much of her time in the endeavor to urinate perfectly
always feeling that she failed in some respect the obsession seems to
have risen fortuitously on a somewhat neurotic basis without reference to
the sexual life

30 it may be remarked here that while the eating of excrement apart
from its former use as a magic charm and as a therapeutic agent is in
civilization now confined to sexual perverts and the insane among some
animals it is normal as a measure of hygiene in relation to their young
thus as eg the rev arthur east writes the mistle thrush swallows

as they urinate absorbing the fluid

the erotic symbols with which we have so far been concerned have in every
case been portions of the body or its physiological processes or at
least the garments which it has endowed with life the association on
which the symbol has arisen has in every case been in large measure
although not entirely an association of contiguity it is now necessary
to touch on a group of sexual symbols in which the association of
contiguity with the human body is absent the various methods by which
animals or animal products or the sight of animal copulation may arouse
sexual desire in human persons here we encounter a symbolism mainly
founded on association by resemblance the animal sexual act recalls the
human sexual act the animal becomes the symbol of the human being
the group of phenomena we are here concerned with includes several
subdivisions there is first the more or less sexual pleasure sometimes
experienced especially by young persons in the sight of copulating
animals this i would propose to call mixoscopic zoophilia it falls
within the range of normal variation then we have the cases in which the
contact of animals stroking etc produces sexual excitement or
gratification this is a sexual fetichism in the narrow sense and is by
krafftebing termed zoophilia erotica we have further the class of
cases in which a real or simulated sexual intercourse with animals is
desired such cases are not regarded as fetichism by krafftebing33
but they come within the phenomena of erotic symbolism as here understood
this class falls into two divisions one in which the individual is fairly
normal but belongs to a low grade of culture the other in which he may
belong to a more refined social class but is affected by a deep degree of
degeneration in the first case we may properly apply the term bestiality
in the second case it may perhaps be better to use the term zooerastia
proposed by krafftebing34
among children both boys and girls it is common to find that the
copulation of animals is a mysteriously fascinating spectacle it is
inevitable that this should be so for the spectacle is more or less
clearly felt to be the revelation of a secret which has been concealed
from them it is moreover a secret of which they feel intimate
reverberations within themselves and even in perfectly innocent and
ignorant children the sight may produce an obscure sexual excitement35
it would seem that this occurs more frequently in girls than in boys even
in adult age it may be added women are liable to experience the same
kind of emotion in the presence of such spectacles one lady recalls as a
girl that on several occasions an element of physical excitement entered
into the feelings with which she watched the coquetry of cats another
lady mentions that at the age of about 25 and when still quite ignorant
of sexual matters she saw from a window some boys tickling a dog and
inducing sexual excitement in the animal she vaguely divined what they
were doing and though feeling disgust at their conduct she at the same
time experienced in a strong degree what she now knows was sexual
excitement the coupling of the larger animals is often an impressive and
splendid spectacle which is far indeed from being obscene and has
commended itself to persons of intellectual distinction36 but in young
or illbalanced minds such sights tend to become both prurient and morbid
i have already referred to the curious case of a sexually hypersthetic
nun who was always powerfully excited by the sight or even the
recollection of flies in sexual connection so that she was compelled to
masturbate this dated from childhood after becoming a nun she recorded
having had this experience followed by masturbation more than four
hundred times37 animal spectacles sometimes produce a sexual effect on
children even when not specifically sexual thus a correspondent a
clergyman informs me that when a young and impressionable boy he was
much affected by seeing a veterinary surgeon insert his hand and arm into
a horses rectum and dreamed of this several times afterward with
emissions
while the contemplation of animal coitus is an easily intelligible and in
early life perhaps an almost normal symbol of sexual emotion there is
another subdivision of this group of animal fetichisms which forms a more
natural transition from the fetichisms which have their center in the
human body the stufffetichisms or the sexual attraction exerted by
various tissues perhaps always of animal origin here we are in the
presence of a somewhat complicated phenomenon in part we have in a
considerable number of such cases the sexual attraction of feminine
garments for all such tissues are liable to enter into the dress in
part also we have a sexual perversion of tactile sensibility for in a
considerable proportion of these cases it is the touch sensations which
are potent in arousing the erotic sensations but in part also it would
seem we have here the conscious or subconscious presence of an animal
fetich and it is notable that perhaps all these stuffs and especially
fur which is by far the commonest of the groups are distinctively animal
products we may perhaps regard the fetich of feminine haira much more
important and common fetich indeed than any of the stuff fetichismsas
a link of transition hair is at once an animal and a human product while
it may be separated from the body and possesses the qualities of a stuff
krafftebing remarks that the senses of touch smell and hearing as well
as sight seem to enter into the attraction exerted by hair
    the natural fascination of hair on which hairfetichism is
    founded begins at a very early age the hair is a special
    object of interest with infants stanley hall concludes which
    begins often in the latter part of the first year the hair
    no doubt gives quite unique tactile sensations both in its own
    roots and to hands and is plastic and yielding to the motor
    sense so that the earliest interest may be akin to that in fur
    which is a marked object in infant experience some children
    develop an almost fetichistic propensity to pull or later to
    stroke the hair or beard of every one with whom they come in
    contact g stanley hall the early sense of self american
    journal of psychology april 1898 p 359
    it should be added that the fascination of hair for the infantile
    and childish mind is not necessarily one of attraction but may
    be of repulsion it happens here as in the case of so many
    characteristics which are of sexual significance that we are in
    the presence of an object which may exert a dynamic emotional
    force a force which is capable of repelling with the same energy
    that it attracts fr records the instructive case of a child of
    3 of psychopathic heredity who when he could not sleep was
    sometimes taken by his mother into her bed one night his hand
    came in contact with a hairy portion of his mothers body and
    this arousing the idea of an animal caused him to leap out of
    the bed in terror he became curious as to the cause of his
    terror and in time was able to observe the animal but the
    train of feelings which had been set up led to a lifelong
    indifference to women and a tendency to homosexuality it is
    noteworthy that he was attracted to men in whom the hair and
    other secondary sexual characters were well developed fr
    linstinct sexuel second edition pp 262267
    as a sexual fetich hair strictly belongs to the group of parts of
    the body but since it can be removed from the body and is
    sexually effective as a fetich in the absence of the person to
    whom it belongs it is on a level with the garments which may
    serve in a similar way with shoes or handkerchiefs or gloves
    psychologically hairfetichism presents no special problem but
    the wide attraction of hairit is sexually the most generally
    noted part of the feminine body after the eyesand the peculiar
    facility with which when plaited it may be removed render
    hairfetichism a sexual perversion of specially great
    medicolegal interest
    the frequency of hairfetichism as well as of the natural
    admiration on which it rests is indicated by a case recorded by
    laurent a few years ago he states one constantly saw at the
    bal bullier in paris a tall girl whose face was lean and bony
    but whose black hair was of truly remarkable length she wore it
    flowing down her shoulders and loins men often followed her in
    the street to touch or kiss the hair others would accompany her
    home and pay her for the mere pleasure of touching and kissing
    the long black tresses one in consideration of a relatively
    considerable sum desired to pollute the silky hair she was
    obliged to be always on her guard and to take all sorts of
    precautions to prevent any one cutting off this ornament which
    constituted her only beauty as well as her livelihood e

    the hair despoiler coupeur des nattes or zopfabschneider
    may be found in any civilized country though the most carefully
    studied cases have occurred in paris several medicolegal
    histories of hairdespoilers are summarized by krafftebing op
    cit pp 329334 such persons are usually of nervous
    temperament and bad heredity the attraction to hair occasionally
    develops in early life sometimes the morbid impulse only appears
    in later life after fever the fetich may be either flowing hair
    or braided hair but is usually one or the other and not both
    sexual excitement and ejaculation may be produced in the act of
    touching or cutting off the hair which is subsequently in many
    cases used for masturbation as a rule the hairdespoiler is a
    pure fetichist no element of sadistic pleasure entering into his
    feelings in the case of a capillary kleptomaniac in chicagoa
    highly intelligent and athletic married young man of good
    familythe impulse to cut off girls braids appeared after
    recovery from a severe fever he would gaze admiringly at the
    long tresses and then clip them off with great rapidity he did
    this in some fifty cases before he was caught and imprisoned he
    usually threw the braids away before he reached home alienist
    and neurologist april 1889 p 325 in this case there is no
    history of sexual excitement probably because no proper
    medicolegal examination was made it may be added that
    hairdespoilers have been specially studied by motet les
    coupeurs de nattes annales dhygine 1890
the stufffetiches are most usually fur and velvet feathers silk and
leathers also sometimes exert this influence they are all it will be
noted animal substances38 the most interesting is probably fur the
attraction of which is not uncommon in association with passive
algolagnia as stanley hall has shown the fear of fur as well as the
love of it is by no means uncommon in childhood it may appear even in
infancy and in children who have never come in contact with animals39
it is noteworthy that in most cases of uncomplicated stufffetichism the
attraction apparently arises on a congenital basis as it appears in
persons of nervous or sensitive temperament at an early age and without
being attached to any definite causative incident the sexual excitation
is nearly always produced by the touch rather than by the sight as we
found when dealing with the sense of touch in the previous volume the
specific sexual sensations may be regarded as a special modification of
ticklishness the erotic symbolism in the case of these stufffetichisms
would seem to be a more or less congenital perversion of ticklishness in
relation to specific animal contacts
a further degree of perversion in this direction is reached in a case of
erotic zoophilia recorded by krafftebing40 in this case a
congenital neuropath of good intelligence but delicate and anmic with
feeble sexual powers had a great love of domestic animals especially
dogs and cats from an early age when petting them he experienced sexual
emotions although he was innocent in sexual matters at puberty he
realized the nature of his feelings and tried to break himself of his
habits he succeeded but then began erotic dreams accompanied by images
of animals and these led to masturbation associated with ideas of a
similar kind at the same time he had no wish for any sort of sexual
intercourse with animals and was indifferent as to the sex of the animals
which attracted him his sexual ideals were normal such a case seems to
be fundamentally one of fetichism on a tactile basis and thus forms a
transition between the stufffetichisms and the complete perversions of
sexual attraction toward animals
    in some cases sexually hypersthetic women have informed me that
    sexual feeling has been produced by casual contact with pet dogs
    and cats in such cases there is usually no real perversion but
    it seems probable that we may here have an occasional foundation
    for the somewhat morbid but scarcely vicious excesses of
    affection which women are apt to display towards their pet dogs
    or cats in most cases of this affection there is certainly no
    sexual element in the case of childless women it may rather be
    regarded as a maternal than as an erotic symbolism the excesses
    of this nonerotic zoophilia have been discussed by fr
    linstinct sexuel second edition pp 166171
krafftebing considers that complete perversion of sexual attraction
toward animals is radically distinct from erotic zoophilia this view
cannot be accepted bestiality and zooerastia merely present in a more
marked and profoundly perverted form a further degree of the same
phenomenon which we meet with in erotic zoophilia the difference is
that they occur either in more insensitive or in more markedly degenerate
persons
a fairly typical case of zooerastia has been recorded in america by
howard of baltimore this was the case of a boy of 16 precociously
mature and fairly bright he was however indifferent to the opposite
sex though he had ample opportunity for gratifying normal passions his
parents lived in the city but the youth had an inordinate desire for the
country and was therefore sent to school in a village on the second day
after his arrival at school a farmer missed a sow which was found secreted
in an outhouse on the school grounds this was the first of many similar
incidents in which a sow always took part so strong was his passion that
on one occasion force had to be used to take him away from the sow he was
caressing he did not masturbate and even when restrained from
approaching sows he had no sexual inclination for other animals his
nocturnal pollutions which were frequent were always accompanied by
images of wallowing swine notwithstanding careful treatment no cure was
effected mental and physical vigor failed and he died at the age of
2341
it is however somewhat doubtful whether we can always or even usually
distinguish between zooerastia and bestiality dr gf lydston of
chicago has communicated to me a case in which he was consulted which
seems fairly typical and is instructive in this respect the subject was a
young man of 21 a farmers son not very bright intellectually but very
healthy and strong of great assistance on the farm very capable and
industrious such a good farm hand that his father was unwilling to send
him away and to lose his services there was no history of insanity or
neurosis in the family and no injury or illness in his own history he
had spells of moroseness and irritability however and had also been a
masturbator women had no attraction for him but he would copulate with
the mares upon his fathers farm and this without regard to time place
or spectators such a case would seem to stand midway between ordinary
bestiality and pathological zooerastia as defined by krafftebing yet it
seems probable that in most cases of ordinary bestiality some slight
traces of mental anomaly might be found if such cases always were as
they should be properly investigated42
we have here reached the grossest and most frequent perversion in this
group bestiality or the impulse to attain sexual gratification by
intercourse or other close contact with animals in seeking to
comprehend this perversion it is necessary to divest ourselves of the
attitude toward animals which is the inevitable outcome of refined
civilization and urban life most sexual perversions if not in large
measure the actual outcome of civilized life easily adjust themselves to
it bestiality except in one form to be noted later is on the other
hand the sexual perversion of dull insensitive and unfastidious persons
it flourishes among primitive peoples and among peasants it is the vice
of the clodhopper unattractive to women or inapt to court them
three conditions have favored the extreme prevalence of bestiality 1
primitive conceptions of life which built up no great barrier between man
and the other animals 2 the extreme familiarity which necessarily
exists between the peasant and his beasts often combined with separation
from women 3 various folklore beliefs such as the efficacy of
intercourse with animals as a cure for venereal disease etc43
the beliefs and customs of primitive peoples as well as their mythology
and legends bring before us a community of man and animals altogether
unlike anything we know in civilization men may become animals and
animals may become men animals and men may communicate with each other
and live on terms of equality animals may be the ancestors of human
tribes the sacred totems of savages are most usually animals there is no
shame or degradation in the notion of a sexual relationship between men
and animals because in primitive conceptions animals are not inferior
beings separated from man by a great gulf they are much more like men in
disguise and in some respects possess powers which make them superior to
men this is recognized in those plays festivals and religious dances
so common among primitive peoples in which animal disguises are worn44
when men admire and emulate the qualities of animals and are proud to
believe that they descend from them it is not surprising that they should
sometimes see nothing derogatory in sexual intercourse with them45
a significant relic of primitive conceptions in this matter may perhaps be
found in the religious rites connected with the sacred goat of mendes
described by herodotus after telling how the mendesians reverence the
goat especially the hegoat out of their veneration for pan whom they
represent as a goat the real motive which they assign for this custom i
do not choose to relate he adds it happened in this country and
within my remembrance and was indeed universally notorious that a goat
had indecent and public communication with a woman46 the meaning of
the passage evidently is that in the ordinary intercourse of women with
the sacred goat connection was only simulated or incomplete on account of
the natural indifference of the goat to the human female but that in rare
cases the goat proved sexually excitable with the woman and capable of
connection47 the goat has always been a kind of sacred emblem of lust
in the middle ages it became associated with the devil as one of the
favorite forms he assumed it is significant of a primitively religious
sexual association between men and animals that witches constantly
confessed or were made to confess that they had had intercourse with the
devil in the shape of an animal very frequently a dog the figures of
human beings and animals in conjunction carved on temples in india also
seem to indicate the religious significance which this phenomenon
sometimes presents there is indeed no need to go beyond europe even in
her moments of highest culture to find a religious sanction for sexual
union between human beings or gods in human shape and animals the
legends of io and the bull of leda and the swan are among the most
familiar in greek mythology and in a later pictorial form they constitute
some of the most cherished works of the painters of the renaissance
as regards the prevalence of occasional sexual intercourse between men or
women and animals among primitive peoples at the present time it is
possible to find many scattered references by travelers in all parts of
the world such references by no means indicate that such practices are
as a rule common but they usually show that they are accepted with a
goodhumored indifference48
bestiality is very rarely found in towns in the country this vice of the
clodhopper is far from infrequent for the peasant whose sensibilities
are uncultivated and who makes but the most elementary demands from a
woman the difference between an animal and a human being in this respect
scarcely seems to be very great my wife was away too long a german
peasant explained to the magistrate and so i went with my sow it is
certainly an explanation that to the uncultivated peasant ignorant of
theological and juridical conceptions must often seem natural and
sufficient
    bestiality thus resembles masturbation and other abnormal
    manifestations of the sexual impulse which may be practiced
    merely faute de mieux and not as in the strict sense
    perversions of the impulse even necrophily may be thus
    practiced a young man who when assisting the gravedigger
    conceived and carried out the idea of digging up the bodies of
    young girls to satisfy his passions with and whose case has
    been recorded by belletrud and mercier said i could find no
    young girl who would agree to yield to my desires that is why i
    have done this i should have preferred to have relations with
    living persons i found it quite natural to do what i did i saw
    no harm in it and i did not think that any one else could as
    living women felt nothing but repulsion for me it was quite
    natural i should turn to the dead who have never repulsed me i
    used to say tender things to them like my beautiful my love i
    love you belletrud and mercier perversion de linstinct
    gensique annales dhygine publique june 1903 but when
    so highly abnormal an act is felt as natural we are dealing with
    a person who is congenitally defective so far as the finer
    developments of intelligence are concerned it was so in this
    case of necrophily he was the son of a weakminded woman of
    unrestrainable sexual inclinations and was himself somewhat
    feebleminded he was also it is instructive to observe
    anosmic
but it is by no means only their dulled sensibility or the absence of
women which accounts for the frequency of bestiality among peasants a
highly important factor is their constant familiarity with animals the
peasant lives with animals tends them learns to know all their
individual characters he understands them far better than he understands
men and women they are his constant companions his friends he knows
moreover the details of their sexual lives he witnesses the often highly
impressive spectacle of their coupling it is scarcely surprising that
peasants should sometimes regard animals as being not only as near to them
as their fellow human beings but even nearer
the significance of the factor of familiarity is indicated by the great
frequency of bestiality among shepherds goatherds and others whose
occupation is exclusively the care of animals mirabeau in the eighteenth
century stated on the evidence of basque priests that all the shepherds
in the pyrenees practice bestiality it is apparently much the same in
italy49 in south italy and sicily especially bestiality among
goatherds and peasants is said to be almost a national custom50 in the
extreme north of europe it is reported the reindeer in this respect
takes the place of the goat
the importance of the same factor is also shown by the fact that when
among women in civilization animal perversions appear the animal is
nearly always a pet dog usually in these cases the animal is taught to
give gratification by cunnilinctus in some cases however there is
really sexual intercourse between the animal and the woman
    moll mentions that in a case of cunnilinctus by a dog in
    germany there was a difficulty as to whether the matter should be
    considered an unnatural offence or simply an offence against
    decency the lower court considered it in the former light while
    the higher court took the more merciful view moll
    untersuchungen ber die libido sexualis bd i p 697 in a
    case reported by pfaff and mentioned by moll a country girl was
    accused of having sexual intercourse with a large dog on
    examination pfaff found in the girls thick pubic hair a loose
    hair which under the microscope proved to belong to the dog
    loc cit p 698 in such a case it must be noted that while
    this evidence may be held to show sexual contact with the dog it
    scarcely suffices to show sexual intercourse this has however
    undoubtedly occurred from time to time even more or less openly
    bloch op cit pp 277 and 282 remarks that this is not an
    infrequent exhibition given by prostitutes in certain brothels
    maschka has referred to such an exhibition between a woman and a
    bulldog which was given to select circles in paris rosse
    refers to a case in which a young unmarried woman in washington
    was surprised during intercourse with a large english mastiff
    who in his efforts to get loose caused such severe injuries that
    the woman died from hmorrhage in about an hour rosse also
    mentions that some years ago a performance of this kind between a
    prostitute and a newfoundland dog could be witnessed in san
    francisco by paying a small sum the woman declared that a woman
    who had once copulated with a dog would ever afterwards prefer
    this animal to a man rosse adds that he was acquainted with a
    similar performance between a woman and a donkey which used to
    take place in europe irving rosse sexual hypochondriasis and

    writes dr kiernan of chicago private letter that what rosse
    says of the animal exhibitions in san francisco is true of all
    great cities the animal employed in such exhibitions here has
    usually been a donkey and in one instance death occurred from

    occurs in country regions quite frequently thus in a case

    genitals and opening the labia three rents were discovered one
    through the fourchette and two through the left nymph the
    vagina was excessively congested and covered with points bleeding
    on the slightest irritation the patient confessed that one day
    while playing with the genitals of a large dog she became excited
    and thought she would have slight coitus after the dog had made
    an entrance she was unable to free herself from him as he
    clasped her so firmly with his fore legs the penis became so
    swollen that the dog could not free himself although for more
    than an hour she made persistent efforts to do so medical
    standard june 1903 p 184 in an indiana case concerning
    which i was consulted the girl was a hebephreniac who had
    resorted to this procedure with a newfoundland dog at the
    instance of another girl seemingly normal as regards mentality
    and had been badly injured a discharge resulted which resembled
    gonorrhoea but contained no gonococci these cases are probably
    more frequent than is usually assumed
    women are known to have had intercourse with various other
    animals occasionally or habitually in various parts of the
    world monkeys have been mentioned in this connection moll
    remarks that it seems to be an indication of an abnormal interest
    in monkeys that some women are observed by the attendants in the
    monkeyhouse of zological gardens to be very frequent visitors
    near the amazon the traveler castelnau saw an enormous coati
    monkey belonging to an indian woman and tried to purchase it
    though he offered a large sum the woman only laughed your
    efforts are useless remarked an indian in the same cabin he
    is her husband so far as the early literature of this subject
    is concerned a number of facts and fables regarding the congress
    of women with dogs goats and other animals was brought together
    at the beginning of the eighteenth century by schurig in his
    gyncologia section ii cap vii i have not drawn on this
    collection
    in some cases women and also men find gratification in the
    sexual manipulation of animals without any kind of congress this
    may be illustrated by an observation communicated to me by a
    correspondent a clergyman in ireland my fathers house
    adjoined the residence of an archdeacon of the established
    church i was then about 20 and was still kept in religious awe
    of evil ways the archdeacon had two daughters both of whom he
    brought up in great strictness resolved that they should grow up
    examples of virtue and piety our stables adjoined and were
    separated only by a thin wall in which was a doorway closed up by
    some boards as the two stables had formerly been one one night
    i had occasion to go to our stable to search for a garden tool i
    had missed and i heard a door open on the other side and saw a
    light glimmer through the cracks of the boards i looked through
    to ascertain who could be there at that late hour and soon
    recognized the stately figure of one of the daughters ff was
    tall dark and handsome but had never made any advances to me
    nor had i to her she was making love to her fathers mare after
    a singular fashion stripping her right arm she formed her
    fingers into a cone and pressed on the mares vulva i was
    astonished to see the beast stretching her hind legs as if to
    accommodate the hand of her mistress which she pushed in
    gradually and with seeming ease to the elbow at the same time
    she seemed to experience the most voluptuous sensation crisis
    after crisis arriving my correspondent adds that being
    exceedingly curious in the matter he tried a somewhat similar
    experiment himself with one of his fathers mares and experienced
    what he describes as a most powerful sexual battery which
    produced very exciting and exhausting effects ncke
    psychiatrische en neurologische bladen 1899 no 2 refers to
    an idiot who thus manipulated the vulva of mares in his charge
    the case has been recorded by guillereau journal de mdicine
    vterinaire et de zootechnie january 1899 of a youth who was
    accustomed to introduce his hand into the vulva of cows in order
    to obtain sexual excitement
    the possibility of sexual excitement between women and animals
    involves a certain degree of sexual excitability in animals from
    contact with women darwin stated that there could be no doubt
    that various quadrumanous animals could distinguish women from
    menin the first place probably by smell and secondarily by
    sightand be thus liable to sexual excitement he quotes the
    opinions on this point of youatt brehm sir andrew smith and
    cuvier descent of man second edition p 8 moll quotes the
    opinion of an experienced observer to the same effect
    untersuchungen ber die libido sexualis bd i p 429
    hufeland reported the case of a little girl of three who was
    playing seated on a stool with a dog placed between her thighs
    and locked against her seemingly excited by this contact the
    animal attempted a sort of copulation causing the genital parts
    of the child to become inflamed bloch op cit p 280 et
    seq discusses the same point he does not consider that
    animals will of their own motion sexually cohabit with women but
    that they may be easily trained to it there can be no doubt that
    dogs at all events are sometimes sexually excited by the presence
    of women perhaps especially during menstruation and many women
    are able to bear testimony to the embarrassing attentions they
    have sometimes received from strange dogs there can be no
    difficulty in believing that so far as cunnilinctus is
    concerned dogs would require no training in a case recorded by
    moll kontrre sexualempfindung third edition p 560 a lady
    states that this was done to her when a child as also to other
    children by dogs who she said showed signs of sexual
    excitement in this case there was also sexual excitement thus
    produced in the child and after puberty mutual cunnilinctus
    was practiced with girl friends guttceit dreissig jahre

    were in the turkish campaign of 1828 told him that from fear of
    veneral infection in wallachia they refrained from women and
    often used female asses which appeared to show signs of sexual
    pleasure
a very large number of animals have been recorded as having been employed
in the gratification of sexual desire at some period or in some country
by men and sometimes by women domestic animals are naturally those which
most frequently come into question and there are few if any of these
which can altogether be excepted the sow is one of the animals most
frequently abused in this manner51 cases in which mares cows and
donkeys figure constantly occur as well as goats and sheep dogs cats
and rabbits are heard of from time to time hens ducks and especially
in china geese are not uncommonly employed the roman ladies were said
to have had an abnormal affection for snakes the bear and even the
crocodile are also mentioned52
the social and legal attitude toward bestiality has reflected in part the
frequency with which it has been practiced and in part the disgust mixed
with mystical and sacrilegious horror which it has aroused it has
sometimes been met merely by a fine and sometimes the offender and his
innocent partner have been burnt together in the middle ages and later
its frequency is attested by the fact that it formed a favorite topic with
preachers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it is significant that
in the penitentialswhich were criminal codes half secular and half
spiritual in use before the thirteenth century when penance was
relegated to the judgment of the confessorit was thought necessary to
fix the periods of penance which should be undergone respectively by
bishops priests and deacons who should be guilty of bestiality
    in egberts penitential a document of the ninth and tenth
    centuries we read v 22 item episcopus cum quadrupede
    fornicans vii annos consuetudinem x presbyter v diaconus iii
    clerus ii there was a great range in the penances for
    bestiality from ten years to in the case of boys one hundred
    days the mare is specially mentioned haddon and stubbs
    councils and ecclesiastical documents vol iii p 422 in
    theodores penitential another anglosaxon document of about the
    same age those who habitually fornicate with animals are
    adjudged ten years of penance it would appear from the
    penitentiale pseudoromanum which is earlier than the eleventh
    century that one years penance was adequate for fornication
    with a mare when committed by a layman exactly the same as for
    simple fornication with a widow or virgin and this was
    mercifully reduced to half a year if he had no wife
    wasserschleben die bussordnungen der abendlndlichen kirche
    p 366 the penitentiale hubertense emanating from the
    monastery of st hubert in the ardennes fixes ten years penance
    for sodomy while fulberts penitential about the eleventh
    century fixes seven years for either sodomy or bestiality
    burchards penitential which is always detailed and precise
    specially mentions the mare the cow and the ass and assigns
    forty days bread and water and seven years penance raised to ten
    years in the case of married men a woman having intercourse with
    a horse is assigned seven years penance in burchards
    penitential wasserschleben ib pp 651 659
the extreme severity which was frequently exercised toward those guilty of
this offense was doubtless in large measure due to the fact that
bestiality was regarded as a kind of sodomy an offense which was
frequently viewed with a mystical horror apart altogether from any actual
social or personal injury it caused the jews seem to have felt this
horror it was ordered that the sinner and his victim should both be put
to death exodus ch 22 v 19 leviticus ch 20 v 15 in the middle
ages especially in france the same rule often prevailed men and sows
men and cows men and donkeys were burnt together at toulouse a woman was
burnt for having intercourse with a dog even in the seventeenth century a
learned french lawyer claude lebrun de la rochette justified such
sentences53 it seems probable that even today in the social and legal
attitude toward bestiality sufficient regard is not paid to the fact that
this offense is usually committed either by persons who are morbidly
abnormal or who are of so low a degree of intelligence that they border on
feeblemindedness to what extent and on what grounds it ought to be
punished is a question calling for serious reconsideration

34 in england it is not uncommon to use the term unnatural offence
this is an awkward and possibly misleading practice which should not be
followed in germany a similar confusion is caused by applying the term
sodomy to these cases as well as to pederasty krafftebing considers
that this error is due to the jurists while the theologians have always
distinguished correctly in this matter he adds science must be ancilla

as fetichsphallus worshipadolescent pride in sexual
developmentexhibitionism of the natesthe classification of the forms
of exhibitionismnature of the relationship of exhibitionism to epilepsy
there is a remarkable form of erotic symbolismvery definite and standing
clearly apart from all other formsin which sexual gratification is
experienced in the simple act of exhibiting the sexual organ to persons of
the opposite sex usually by preference to young and presumably innocent
persons very often children this is termed exhibitionism54 it would
appear to be a not very infrequent phenomenon and most women once or
more in their lives especially when young have encountered a man who has
thus deliberately exposed himself before them
the exhibitionist though often a young and apparently vigorous man is
always satisfied with the mere act of selfexhibition and the emotional
reaction which that act produces he makes no demands on the woman to whom
he exposes himself he seldom speaks he makes no effort to approach her
as a rule he fails even to display the signs of sexual excitation his
desires are completely gratified by the act of exhibition and by the
emotional reaction it arouses in the woman he departs satisfied and
relieved
    a case recorded by schrencknotzing very well represents both the
    nature of the impulse felt by the exhibitionist and the way in
    which it may originate it is the case of a business man of 49
    of neurotic heredity an affectionate husband and father of a
    family who to his own grief and shame is compelled from time
    to time to exhibit his sexual organs to women in the street as a
    boy of 10 a girl of 12 tried to induce him to coitus both had
    their sexual parts exposed from that time sexual contacts as of
    his own naked nates against those of a girl became attractive
    as well as games in which the boys and girls in turn marched
    before each other with their sexual parts exposed and also
    imitation of the copulation of animals coitus was first
    practiced about the age of 20 but sight and touch of the womans
    sexual parts were always necessary to produce sexual excitement
    it was also necessaryand this consideration is highly important
    as regards the development of the tendency to exhibitionthat
    the woman should be excited by the sight of his organs even when
    he saw or touched a womans parts orgasm often occurred it was
    the naked sexual organs in an otherwise clothed body which
    chiefly excited him he was not possessed of a high degree of
    potency girls between the ages of 10 and 17 chiefly excited him
    and especially if he felt that they were quite ignorant of sexual
    matters his selfexhibition was a sort of psychic defloration
    and it was accompanied by the idea that other people felt as he
    did about the sexual effects of the naked organs that he was
    shocking but at the same time sexually exciting a young girl he
    was thus gratifying himself through the belief that he was
    causing sexual gratification to an innocent girl this man was
    convicted several times and was finally declared to be suffering
    from impulsive insanity schrencknotzing

    portrait painter aged 31 in youth masturbated and was fond of
    contemplating the images of the sexual organs of both sexes
    finding little pleasure in coitus at the age of 24 at a bathing
    establishment he happened to occupy a compartment next to that
    occupied by a lady and when naked he became aware that his
    neighbor was watching him through a chink in the partition this
    caused him powerful excitement and he was obliged to masturbate
    ever since he has had an impulse to exhibit his organs and to
    masturbate in the presence of women he believes that the sight
    of his organs excites the woman ib pp 5768 the presence of
    masturbation in this case renders it untypical as a case of
    exhibitionism moll at one time went so far as to assert that
    when masturbation takes place we are not entitled to admit

    brother who was also an exhibitionist in some cases the penis
    was abnormally large in others abnormally small several had

    manner compelled to leave the town he returned to paris and in
    a few weeks time was again arrested for repeating his old
    offense in saint roch when examined by garnier the information
    he supplied was vague and incomplete and he was very embarrassed
    in the attempt to explain himself he was unable to say why he
    chose a church but he felt that it was to a church that he must
    go he had however no thought of profanation and no wish to
    give offense quite the contrary he declared he had the sad

    in some cases it would appear the impulse to exhibitionism may
    be overcome or may pass away this result is the more likely to
    come about in those cases in which exhibitionism has been largely
    conditioned by chronic alcoholism or other influences tending to
    destroy the inhibiting and restraining action of the higher
    centers which may be overcome by hygiene and treatment in this
    connection i may bring forward a case which has been communicated
    to me by a medical correspondent in london it is that of an
    actor of high standing in his profession and extremely
    intelligent 49 years of age married and father of a large
    family he is sexually vigorous and of erotic temperament his
    general health has always been good but he is a highstrung
    neurotic man with quick mental reactions his habits had for a
    long time been decidedly alcoholic but two years ago a small
    quantity of albumen being found in the urine he was persuaded to
    leave off alcohol and has since been a teetotaller though
    ordinarily very reticent about sexual matters he began four or
    five years ago to commit acts of exhibitionism exposing himself
    to servants in the house and occasionally to women in the
    country this continued after the alcohol had been abandoned and
    lasted for several years though the attention of the police was
    never attracted to the matter and so far as possible he was
    quietly supervised by his friends nine months after the acts of
    exhibitionism ceased apparently in a spontaneous manner and
    there has so far been no relapse
exhibitionism is an act which on the face of it seems nonsensical and
meaningless and as such as an inexplicable act of madness it has
frequently been treated both by writers on insanity and on sexual
perversion these acts are so lacking in common sense and intelligent
reflection that no other reason than insanity can be offered for the
patient ball concluded55 moll also who defines exhibitionism
somewhat too narrowly as a condition in which the charm of the exhibition
lies for the subject in the display itself not sufficiently taking into
consideration the imagined effect on the spectator concludes that the
psychological basis of exhibitionism is at present by no means cleared
up56
we may probably best approach exhibitionism by regarding it as
fundamentally a symbolic act based on a perversion of courtship the
exhibitionist displays the organ of sex to a feminine witness and in the
shock of modest sexual shame by which she reacts to that spectacle he
finds a gratifying similitude of the normal emotions of coitus57 he
feels that he has effected a psychic defloration
    exhibitionism is thus analogous and indeed related to the
    impulse felt by many persons to perform indecorous acts or tell
    indecent stories before young and innocent persons of the
    opposite sex this is a kind of psychic exhibitionism the
    gratification it causes lying exactly as in physical
    exhibitionism in the emotional confusion which it is felt to
    arouse the two kinds of exhibitionism may be combined in the
    same person thus in a case reported by hoche p 97 the
    exhibitionist an intellectual and highly educated man with a
    doctors degree also found pleasure in sending indecent poems
    and pictures to women whom however he made no attempt to
    seduce he was content with the thought of the emotions he
    aroused or believed that he aroused
    it is possible that within this group should come the agent in
    the following incident which was lately observed by a lady a
    friend of my own an elderly man in an overcoat was seen standing
    outside a large and wellknown drapers shop in the outskirts of
    london when able to attract the attention of any of the
    shopgirls or of any girl in the street he would fling back his
    coat and reveal that he was wearing over his own clothes a
    womans chemise or possibly bodice and a womans drawers there
    was no exposure the only intelligible explanation of this action
    would seem to be that pleasure was experienced in the mild shock
    of interested surprise and injured modesty which this vision was
    imagined to cause to a young girl it would thus be a
    comparatively innocent form of psychic defloration
it is of interest to point out that the sexual symbolism of active
flagellation is very closely analogous to this symbolism of exhibitionism
the flagellant approaches a woman with the rod itself a symbol of the
penis and in some countries bearing names which are also applied to that
organ and inflicts on an intimate part of her body the signs of blushing
and the spasmodic movements which are associated with sexual excitement
while at the same time she feels or the flagellant imagines that she
feels the corresponding emotions of delicious shame58 this is an even
closer mimicry of the sexual act than the exhibitionist attains for the
latter fails to secure the consent of the woman nor does he enjoy any
intimate contact with her naked body the difference is connected with the
fact that the active flagellant is usually a more virile and normal person
than the exhibitionist in the majority of cases the exhibitionists
sexual impulse is very feeble and as a rule he is either to some degree a
degenerate or else a person who is suffering from an early stage of
general paralysis dementia or some other highly enfeebling cause of
mental disorganization such as chronic alcoholism sexual feebleness is
further indicated by the fact that the individuals selected as witnesses
are frequently mere children
    it seems probable that a form of erotic symbolism somewhat
    similar to exhibitionism is to be found in the rare cases in
    which sexual gratification is derived from throwing ink acid or
    other defiling liquids on womens dresses thoinot has recorded a
    case of this kind attentats aux moeurs 1898 pp 484 et
    seq an instructive case has been presented by moll in this
    case a young man of somewhat neuropathic heredity had as a youth
    of 16 or 17 when romping with his young sisters playfellows
    experienced sexual sensations on chancing to see their white
    underlinen from that time white underlinen and white dresses
    became to him a fetich and he was only attracted to women so
    attired one day at the age of 25 when crossing the street in
    wet weather with a young lady in a white dress a passing vehicle
    splashed the dress with mud this incident caused him strong
    sexual excitement and from that time he had the impulse to throw
    ink perchloride of iron etc on to ladies white dresses and
    sometimes to cut and tear them sexual excitement and ejaculation
    taking place every time he effected this moll gutachten ber
    einem sexual perversen besudelungstrieb zeitschrift fr
    medizinalbeamte heft xiii 1900 such a case is of
    considerable psychological interest thoinot considers that in
    these cases the fleck is a fetich that is an incorrect account
    of the matter in this case the white garments constituted the
    primary fetich but that fetich becomes more acutely realized
    and at the same time both parties are thrown into an emotional
    state which to the fetichist becomes a mimicry of coitus by the
    act of defilement we may perhaps connect with this phenomenon
    the attraction which muddy shoes often exert over the
    shoefetichist and the curious way in which as we have seen p
    18 restif de la bretonne associates his love of neatness in
    women with his attraction to the feet the part he remarks
    least easy to keep clean
    garnier applied the term sadifetichism to active flagellation
    and many similar manifestations such as we are here concerned
    with on the grounds that they are hybrids which combine the
    morbid adoration for a definite object with the impulse to
    exercise a more or less degree of violence from the standpoint
    of the conception of erotic symbolism i have adopted there is no
    need for this term there is here no hybrid combination of two
    unlike mental states we are simply concerned with states of
    erotic symbolism more or less complete more or less complex
the conception of exhibitionism as a process of erotic symbolism involves
a conscious or unconscious attitude of attention in the exhibitionists
mind to the psychic reaction of the woman toward whom his display is
directed he seeks to cause an emotion which probably in most cases he
desires should be pleasurable but from one cause or another his finer
sensibilities are always inhibited or in abeyance and he is unable to
estimate accurately either the impression he is likely to produce or the
general results of his action or else he is moved by a strong impulsive
obsession which overpowers his judgment in many cases he has good reason
for believing that his act will be pleasurable and frequently he finds
complacent witnesses among the lowclass servant girls etc
    it may be pointed out here that we are quite justified in
    speaking of a penisfetichism and also of a vulvafetichism this
    might be questioned we are obviously justified in recognizing a
    fetichism which attaches itself to the pubic hair or as in a
    case with which i am acquainted to the clitoris but it may seem
    that we cannot regard the central sexual organs as symbols of
    sex symbols as it were of themselves properly regarded
    however it is the sexual act rather than the sexual organ which
    is craved in normal sexual desire the organ is regarded merely
    as the means and not as the end regarded as a means the organ is
    indeed an object of desire but it only becomes a fetich when it
    arrests and fixes the attention an attention thus pleasurably
    fixed a vulvafetichism or a penisfetichism is within the
    normal range of sexual emotion this point has been mentioned in
    the previous volume when discussing the part played by the
    primary sexual organs in sexual selection and in coarsegrained
    natures of either sex it is a normal allurement in its
    generalized shape apart from any attraction to the person to
    whom the organs belong in some morbid cases however this
    penisfetichism may become a fully developed sexual perversion a
    typical case of this kind has been recorded by howard in the
    united states mrs w aged 39 was married at 20 to a strong
    healthy man but derived no pleasure from coitus though she
    received great pleasure from masturbation practiced immediately
    after coitus and nine years after marriage she ceased actual
    coitus compelling her husband to adopt mutual masturbation she
    would introduce men into the house at all times of the day or
    night and after persuading them to expose their persons would
    retire to her room to masturbate the same man never aroused
    desire more than once this desire became so violent and
    persistent that she would seek out men in all sorts of public
    places and having induced them to expose themselves rapidly
    retreat to the nearest convenient spot for selfgratification
    she once abstracted a pair of trousers she had seen a man wear
    and after fondling them experienced the orgasm her husband
    finally left her after vainly attempting to have her confined in
    an asylum she was often arrested for her actions but through
    the intervention of friends set free again she was a highly
    intelligent woman and apart from this perversion entirely
    normal wl howard sexual perversion alienist and
    neurologist january 1896 it is on the existence of a more or
    less developed penisfetichism of this kind that the
    exhibitionist mostly by an ignorant instinct relies for the
    effects he desires to produce
the exhibitionist is not usually content to produce a mere titillated
amusement he seeks to produce a more powerful effect which must be
emotional whether or not it is pleasurable a professional man in
strassburg in a case reported by hoche59 would walk about in the
evening in a long cloak and when he met ladies would suddenly throw his
cloak back under a street lamp or igniting a redfire match and thus
exhibit his organs there was an evident efforton the part of a weak
vain and effeminate manto produce a maximum of emotional effect the
attempt to heighten the emotional shock is also seen in the fact that the
exhibitionist frequently chooses a church as the scene of his exploits
not during service for he always avoids a concourse of people but
perhaps toward evening when there are only a few kneeling women scattered
through the edifice the church is chosen often instinctively rather than
deliberately from no impulse to commit a sacrilegious outragewhich as
a rule the exhibitionist does not feel his act to bebut because it
really presents the conditions most favorable to the act and the effects
desired the exhibitionists attitude of mind is well illustrated by one
of garniers patients who declared that he never wished to be seen by more
than two women at once just what is necessary he added for an
exchange of impressions after each exhibition he would ask himself
anxiously did they see me what are they thinking what do they say to
each other about me oh how i should like to know another patient of
garniers who haunted churches for this purpose made this very
significant statement why do i like going to churches i can scarcely
say but i know that it is only there that my act has its full
importance the woman is in a devout frame of mind and she must see that
such an act in such a place is not a joke in bad taste or a disgusting
obscenity that if i go there it is not to amuse myself it is more
serious than that i watch the effect produced on the faces of the ladies
to whom i show my organs i wish to see them express a profound joy i
wish in fact that they may be forced to say to themselves how
impressive nature is when thus seen
    here we trace the presence of a feeling which recalls the
    phenomena of the ancient and worldwide phallic worship still
    liable to reappear sporadically women sometimes took part in
    these rites and the osculation of the male sexual organ or its
    emblematic representation by women is easily traceable in the
    phallic rites of india and many other lands not excluding europe
    even in comparatively recent times dulaure in his divinits
    gnratices brings together much bearing on these points cf
    ploss and bartels das weib vol i chapter xvii and bloch

    sexual hypochondriasis virginia medical monthly october
    1892
    putting aside any question of phallic worship a certain pride
    and more or less private feeling of ostentation in the new
    expansion and development of the organs of virility seems to be
    almost normal at adolescence we have much reason to assume
    stanley hall remarks that in a state of nature there is a
    certain instinctive pride and ostentation that accompanies the
    new local development i think it will be found that
    exhibitionists are usually those who have excessive growth here
    and that much that modern society stigmatizes as obscene is at
    bottom more or less spontaneous and perhaps in some cases not
    abnormal dr seerley tells me he has never examined a young man
    largely developed who had the usual strong instinctive tendency
    of modesty to cover himself with his hands but he finds this
    instinct general with those whose development is less than the
    average g stanley hall adolescence vol ii p 97 this
    instinct of ostentation however so far as it is normal is held
    in check by other considerations and is not in the strict
    sense exhibitionism i have observed a fullgrown telegraph boy
    walking across hampstead heath with his sexual organs exposed
    but immediately he realized that he was seen he concealed them
    the solemnity of exhibitionism at this age finds expression in
    the climax of the sonnet oraison du soir written at 16 by
    rimbaud whose verse generally is a splendid and insolent
    manifestation of rank  adolescence
        doux comme le seigneur du cdre et des hysopes
        je pisse vers les cieux bruns trs haut et trs loin

    in women also there would appear to be traceable a somewhat
    similar ostentation though in them it is complicated and largely
    inhibited by modesty and at the same time diffused over the body
    owing to the absence of external sexual organs primitive
    woman remarks madame renooz proud of her womanhood for a
    long time defended her nakedness which ancient art has always
    represented and in the actual life of the young girl today
    there is a moment when by a secret atavism she feels the pride of
    her sex the intuition of her moral superiority and cannot
    understand why she must hide its cause at this moment wavering
    between the laws of nature and social conventions she scarcely
    knows if nakedness should or should not affright her a sort of
    confused atavistic memory recalls to her a period before clothing
    was known and reveals to her as a paradisaical ideal the customs
    of that human epoch cline renooz psychologie compare de
    lhomme et de la femme p 85 it may be added that among
    primitive peoples and even among some remote european
    populations today the exhibition of feminine nudity has
    sometimes been regarded as a spectacle with religious or magic

    304 it is stated by gopcevic that in the long struggle between
    the albanians and the montenegrians the women of the former
    people would stand in the front rank and expose themselves by
    raising their skirts believing that they would thus insure
    victory as however they were shot down and as moreover
    victory usually fell to the montenegrians this custom became
    discredited quoted by bloch op cit teil ii p 307
    with regard to the association suggested by stanley hall
    between exhibitionism and an unusual degree of development of the
    sexual organs it must be remarked that both extremesa very
    large and a very small penisare specially common in
    exhibitionists the prevalence of the small organ is due to an
    association of exhibitionism with sexual feebleness the
    prevalence of the large organ may be due to the cause suggested
    by hall among mahommedans the sexual organs are sometimes
    habitually exposed by religious penitents and i note that
    bernhard stern in his book on the medical and sexual aspects of
    life in turkey referring to a penitent of this sort whom he saw
    on the stamboul bridge at constantinople remarks that the organ
    was very largely developed it may well be in such a case that
    the penitents religious attitude is reinforced by some lingering
    relic of a more fleshly ostentation
it is by a pseudoatavism that this phallicism is evoked in the
exhibitionist there is no true emergence of an ancestrally inherited
instinct but by the paralysis or inhibition of the finer and higher
feelings current in civilization the exhibitionist is placed on the same
mental level as the man of a more primitive age and he thus presents the
basis on which the impulses belonging to a higher culture may naturally
take root and develop
    reference may here be made to a form of primitive exhibitionism
    almost confined to women which although certainly symbolic is
    absolutely nonsexual and must not therefore be confused with
    the phenomena we are here occupied with i refer to the
    exhibition of the buttocks as a mark of contempt in its most
    primitive form no doubt this exhibitionism is a kind of
    exorcism a method of putting evil spirits primarily and
    secondarily evildisposed persons to flight it is the most
    effective way for a woman to display sexual centers and it
    shares in the magical virtues which all unveiling of the sexual
    centers is believed by primitive peoples to possess it is
    recorded that the women of some peoples in the balkan peninsula
    formerly used this gesture against enemies in battle in the
    sixteenth century so distinguished a theologian as luther when
    assailed by the evil one at night was able to put the adversary
    to flight by protruding his uncovered buttocks from the bed but
    the spiritual significance of this attitude is lost with the
    decay of primitive beliefs it survives but merely as a gesture
    of insult the symbolism comes to have reference to the nates as
    the excretory focus the seat of the anus in any case it ignores
    any sexual attractiveness in this part of the body exhibitionism
    of this kind therefore can scarcely arise in persons of any
    sensitiveness or sthetic perception even putting aside the
    question of modesty and there seems to be little trace of it in
    classic antiquity when the nates were regarded as objects of
    beauty among the egyptians however we gather from herodotus
    bk ii chapter lx that at a certain popular religious festival
    men and women would go in boats on the nile singing and playing
    and when they approached a town the women on the boats would
    insult the women of the town by injurious language and by
    exposing themselves among the arabs however the specific
    gesture we are concerned with is noted and a man to whom
    vengeance is forbidden would express his feelings by exposing his
    posterior and strewing earth on his head wellhausen rests
    arabischen heidentums 1897 p 195 it is in europe and in
    medival and later times that this emphatic gesture seems to have
    flourished as a violent method of expressing contempt it was by
    no means confined to the lower classes and kleinpaul in
    discussing this form of speech without words quotes examples
    of various noble persons even princesses who are recorded thus
    to have expressed their feelings kleinpaul sprache ohne
    worte pp 271273 in more recent times the gesture has become
    merely a rare and extreme expression of unrestrained feeling in
    coarsegrained peasants zola in the figure of mouquette in
    germinal may be said to have given a kind of classic
    expression to the gesture in the more remote parts of europe it
    appears to be still not altogether uncommon this seems to be
    notably the case among the south slavs and krauss states that
    when a south slav woman wishes to express her deepest contempt
    for anyone she bends forward with left hand raising her skirts
    and with the right slapping her posterior at the same time
    exclaiming this for you kryptadia vol vi p 200
    a verbal survival of this gesture consisting in the contemptuous
    invitation to kiss this region still exists among us in remote
    parts of the country especially as an insult offered by an angry
    woman who forgets herself it is said to be commonly used in
    wales welsh doelogy kryptadia vol ii pp 358 et seq
    in cornwall when addressed by a woman to a man it is sometimes
    regarded as a deadly insult even if the woman is young and
    attractive and may cause a lifelong enmity between related
    families from this point of view the nates are a symbol of
    contempt and any sexual significance is excluded the
    distinction is brought out by diderot in le neveu de rameau
    luiil y a dautres jours ou il ne men coterait rien pour
    tre vil tant quon voudrait ces joursl pour un liard je
    baiserais le cul  la petite hus moieh mais lami elle
    est blanche jolie douce potele et cest un acte dhumilit
    auquel un plus delicat que vous pourrait quelquefois sabaisser
    luientendonsnous cest quil y a baiser le cul au simple
    et baiser le cul au figur
    it must be added that a sexual form of exhibitionism of the nates
    must still be recognized it occurs in masochism and expresses
    the desire for passive flagellation rousseau whose emotional
    life was profoundly affected by the castigations which as a child
    he received from mlle lambercier has in his confessions told
    us how when a youth he would sometimes expose himself in this
    way in the presence of young women such masochistic
    exhibitionism seems however to be rare
while the manifestations of exhibitionism are substantially the same in
all cases there are many degrees and varieties of the condition we may
find among exhibitionists as garnier remarks dementia states of
unconsciousness epilepsy general paralysis alcoholism but the most
typical cases he adds if not indeed the cases to which the term properly
belongs are those in which it is an impulsive obsession krafftebing60
divides exhibitionists into four clinical groups 1 acquired states of
mental weakness with cerebral or spinal disease clouding consciousness
and at the same time causing impotence 2 epileptics in whom the act is
an abnormal organic impulse performed in a state of imperfect
consciousness 3 a somewhat allied group of neurasthenic cases 4
periodical impulsive cases with deep hereditary taint this classification
is not altogether satisfactory garniers classification placing the
group of obsessional cases in the foreground and leaving the other more
vaguely defined groups in the background is probably better i am
inclined to consider that most of the cases fall into one or other of two
mixed groups the first class includes cases in which there is more or
less congenital abnormality but otherwise a fair or even complete degree
of mental integrity they are usually young adults they are more or less
precisely conscious of the end they wish to attain and it is often only
with a severe struggle that they yield to their impulses in the second
class the beginnings of mental or nervous disease have diminished the
sensibility of the higher centers the subjects are usually old men whose
lives have been absolutely correct they are often only vaguely aware of
the nature of the satisfaction they are seeking and frequently no
struggle precedes the manifestation such was the case of the overworked
clergyman described by hughes61 who after much study became morose
and absentminded and committed acts of exhibitionism which he could not
explain but made no attempt to deny with rest and restorative treatment
his health improved and the acts ceased it is in the first class of cases
alone that there is a developed sexual perversion in the cases of the
second class there is a more or less definite sexual intention but it is
only just conscious and the emergence of the impulse is due not to its
strength but to the weakness temporary or permanent of the higher
inhibiting centers
epileptic cases with loss of consciousness during the act can only be
regarded as presenting a pseudoexhibitionism they should be excluded
altogether it is undoubtedly true that many cases of real or apparent
exhibitionism occur in epileptics62 we must not however too hastily
conclude that because these acts occur in epileptics they are necessarily
unconscious acts epilepsy frequently occurs on a basis of hereditary
degeneration and the exhibitionism may be and not infrequently is a
stigma of the degeneracy and not an indication of the occurrence of a
minor epileptic fit when the act of pseudoexhibitionism is truly
epileptic it will usually have no psychic sexual content and it will
certainly be liable to occur under all sorts of circumstances when the
patient is alone or in a miscellaneous concourse of people it will be on
a level with the acts of the highly respectable young woman who at the
conclusion of an attack of petit mal consisting chiefly of a sudden
desire to pass urine on one occasion lifted up her clothes and urinated
at a public entertainment so that it was with difficulty her friends
prevented her from being handed over to the police63 such an act is
automatic unconscious and involuntary the spectators are not even
perceived it cannot be an act of exhibitionism whenever on the other
hand the place and the time are evidently chosen deliberatelya quiet
spot the presence of only one or two young women or childrenit is
difficult to admit that we are in the presence of a fit of epileptic
unconsciousness even when the subject is known to be epileptic
even however when we exclude those epileptic pseudoexhibitionists who
from the legal point of view are clearly irresponsible it must still be
remembered that in every case of exhibitionism there is a high degree of
either mental abnormality on a neuropathic basis or else of actual
disease this is true to a greater extent in exhibitionism than in almost
any other form of sexual perversion no subject of exhibitionism should be
sent to prison without expert medical examination

the forms of erotic symbolism are simulacra of coituswide
extension of erotic symbolismfetichism not covering the whole
ground of sexual selectionit is based on the individual factor in
selectioncrystallizationthe lover and the artistthe key to erotic
symbolism to be found in the emotional spherethe passage to pathological
extremes
we have now examined several very various and yet very typical
manifestations in all of which it is not difficult to see how in some
strange and eccentric formon a basis of association through resemblance
or contiguity or both combinedthere arises a definite mimicry of the
normal sexual act together with the normal emotions which accompany that
act it has become clear in what sense we are justified in recognizing
erotic symbolism
    the symbolic and as it were abstracted nature of these
    manifestations is shown by the remarkable way in which they are
    sometimes capable of transference from the object to the subject
    that is to say that the fetichist may show a tendency to
    cultivate his fetich in his own person a footfetichist may like
    to go barefoot himself a man who admired lame women liked to
    halt himself a man who was attracted by small waists in women
    found sexual gratification in tightlacing himself a man who was
    fascinated by fine white skin and wished to cut it found
    satisfaction in cutting his own skin molls coprolagnic
    fetichist found a voluptuous pleasure in his own acts of
    defecation see eg krafftebing op cit p 221 224
    226 hammond sexual impotence p 74 cf ante p 68 such
    symbolic transference seems to have a profoundly natural basis
    for we may see a somewhat similar phenomenon in the wellknown
    tendency of cows to mount a cow in heat this would appear to be
    not so much a homosexual impulse as the dynamic psychic action
    of an olfactory sexual symbol in a transformed form
    we seem to have here a psychic process which is a curious
    reversal of that process of einfhlungthe projection of ones
    own activities into the object contemplatedwhich lipps has so
    fruitfully developed as the essence of every sthetic condition
    t lipps sthetik teil i 1903 by einfhlung our own
    interior activity becomes the activity of the object perceived
    a thing being beautiful in proportion as it lends itself to our
    einfhlung but by this action of erotic symbolism on the
    other hand we transfer the activity of the object into
    ourselves
when the idea of erotic symbolism as manifested in such definite and
typical forms becomes realized it further becomes clear that the vaguer
manifestations of such symbolism are exceedingly widespread when in a
previous volume we were discussing and drawing together the various
threads which unite love and pain it will now be understood that we
were standing throughout on the threshold of erotic symbolism pain
itself in the sense in which we slowly learned to define it in this
relationshipas a state of intense emotional excitementmay under a
great variety of special circumstances become an erotic symbol and afford
the same relief as the emotions normally accompanying the sexual act
active algolagnia or sadism is thus a form of erotic symbolism passive
algolagnia or masochism is in a man an inverted form of erotic
symbolism active flagellation or passive flagellation are in exactly the
same way manifestations of erotic symbolism the imaginative mimicry of
coitus
binet and also krafftebing64 have argued in effect that the whole of
sexual selection is a matter of fetichism that is to say of erotic
symbolism of object normal love binet states appears as the result
of a complicated fetichism tarde also seems to have regarded love as
normally a kind of fetichism we are a long time before we fall in love
with a woman he remarks we must wait to see the detail which strikes
and delights us and causes us to overlook what displeases us only in
normal love the details are many and always changing constancy in love is
rarely anything else but a voyage around the beloved person a voyage of
exploration and ever new discoveries the most faithful lover does not
love the same woman in the same way for two days in succession65
from that point of view normal sexual love is the sway of a fetichmore
or less arbitrary more or less as binet terms it polytheisticand it
can have little objective basis but as we saw when considering sexual
selection in man in the previous volume more especially when analyzing
the notion of beauty we are justified in believing that beauty has to a
large extent an objective basis and that love by no means depends simply
on the capricious selection of some individual fetich the individual
factor as we saw is but one of many factors which constitute beauty in
the study of sexual selection that individual factor was passed over very
lightly we now see that it is often a factor of great importance for in
it are rooted all these outgrowthsnormal in their germs highly abnormal
in their more extreme developmentswhich make up erotic symbolism
erotic symbolism is therefore concerned with all that is least generic
least specific all that is most intimately personal and individual in
sexual selection it is the final point in which the decreasing circle of
sexual attractiveness is fixed in the widest and most abstract form
sexual selection in man is merely human and we are attracted to that
which bears most fully the marks of humanity in a less abstract form it
is sexual and we are attracted to that which most vigorously presents the
secondary sexual characteristics still narrowing it is the type of our
own nation and people that appeals most strongly to us in matters of love
and still further concentrating we are affected by the idealin
civilization most often the somewhat exotic idealof our own day the
fashion of our own city but the individual factor still remains and amid
the infinite possibilities of erotic symbolism the individual may evolve
an ideal which is often as far as he knows and perhaps in actuality an
absolutely unique event in the history of the human soul
erotic symbolism works in its finer manifestations by means of the
idealizing aptitudes it is the field of sexual psychology in which that
faculty of crystallization on which stendhal loved to dwell achieves its
most brilliant results in the solitary passage in which we seem to see a
smile on the face of the austere poet of the de rerum natur lucretius
tells us how every lover however he may be amused by the amorous
extravagances of other men is himself blinded by passion if his mistress
is black she is a fascinating brunette if she squints she is the rival of
pallas if too tall she is majestic if too short she is one of the
graces tota merum sal if too lean it is her delicate refinement if
too fat then a ceres dirty and she disdains adornment a chatterer and
brilliantly vivacious silent and it is her exquisite modesty66 sixteen
hundred years later robert burton when describing the symptoms of love
made out a long and appalling list of the physical defects which the lover
is prepared to admire67
yet we must not be too certain that the lover is wrong in this matter we
too hastily assume that the casual and hasty judgment of the world is
necessarily more reliable more conformed to what we call truth than
the judgment of the lover which is founded on absorbed and patient study
in some cases where there is lack of intelligence in the lover and
dissimulation in the object of his love it may be so but even a poem or
a picture will often not reveal its beauty except by the expenditure of
time and study it is foolish to expect that the secret beauty of a human
person will reveal itself more easily the lover is an artist an artist
who constructs an image it is true but only by patient and concentrated
attention to nature he knows the defects of his image probably better
than anyone but he knows also that art lies not in the avoidance of
defects but in the realization of those traits which swallow up defects
and so render them nonexistent a great artist rodin after a life spent
in the study of nature has declared that for art there is no ugliness in
nature i have arrived at this belief by the study of nature he said
i can only grasp the beauty of the soul by the beauty of the body but
some day one will come who will explain what i only catch a glimpse of and
will declare how the whole earth is beautiful and all human beings
beautiful i have never been able to say this in sculpture so well as i
wish and as i feel it affirmed within me for poets beauty has always
been some particular landscape some particular woman but it should be
all women all landscapes a negro or a mongol has his beauty however
remote from ours and it must be the same with their characters there is
no ugliness when i was young i made that mistake as others do i could
not undertake a womans bust unless i thought her pretty according to my
particular idea of beauty today i should do the bust of any woman and
it would be just as beautiful and however ugly a woman may look when she
is with her lover she becomes beautiful there is beauty in her character
in her passions and beauty exists as soon as character or passion becomes
visible for the body is a casting on which passions are imprinted and
even without that there is always the blood that flows in the veins and
the air that fills the lungs68
the saint also is here at one with the lover and the artist the man who
has so profoundly realized the worth of his fellow men that he is ready
even to die in order to save them feels that he has discovered a great
secret cyples traces the secret delights that have thus risen in the
hearts of holy men to the same source as the feelings generated between
lovers friends parents and children a few have at intervals walked in
the world he remarks who have each in his own original way found out
this marvel straightway man in general has become to them so sweet a
thing that the infatuation has seemed to the rest of their fellows to be a
celestial madness beggars rags to their unhesitating lips grew fit for
kissing because humanity had touched the garb there were no longer any
menial acts but only welcome services remember by how much man is the
subtlest circumstance in the world at how many points he can attach
relationships how manifold and perennial he is in his results all other
things are dull meager tame beside him69
it may be added that even if we still believe that lover and artist and
saint are drawing the main elements of their conceptions from the depths
of their own consciousness there is a sense in which they are coming
nearer to the truth of things than those for whom their conceptions are
mere illusions the aptitude for realizing beauty has involved an
adjustment of the nerves and the associated brain centers through
countless ages that began before man was when the vision of supreme
beauty is slowly or suddenly realized by anyone with a reverberation that
extends throughout his organism he has attained to something which for
his species and for far more than his species is truth and can only be
illusion to one who has artificially placed himself outside the stream of
life
    in an essay on the gods as apparitions of the racelife edward
    carpenter though in somewhat platonic phraseology thus well
    states the matter the youth sees the girl it may be a chance
    face a chance outline amid the most banal surroundings but it
    gives the cue there is a memory a confused reminiscence the
    mortal figure without penetrates to the immortal figure within
    and there rises into consciousness a shining form glorious not
    belonging to this world but vibrating with the agelong life of
    humanity and the memory of a thousand lovedreams the waking of
    this vision intoxicates the man it glows and burns within him a
    goddess it may be venus herself stands in the sacred place of
    his temple a sense of awestruck splendor fills him and the
    world is changed he sees something the same writer continues
    in a subsequent essay beauty and duty which in a sense is
    more real than the figures in the street for he sees something
    that has lived and moved for hundreds of years in the heart of
    the race something which has been one of the great formative
    influences of his own life and which has done as much to create
    those very figures in the street as qualities in the circulation
    of the blood may do to form a finger or other limb he comes into
    touch with a very real presence or powerone of those organic
    centers of growth in the life of humanityand feels this larger
    life within himself subjective if you like and yet intensely
    objective and more for is it not also evident that the woman
    the mortal woman who excites his vision has some closest
    relation to it and is indeed far more than a mere mask or
    empty formula which reminds him of it for she indeed has within
    her just as much as the man has deep subconscious powers
    working and the ideal which has dawned so entrancingly on the
    man is in all probability closely related to that which has been
    working most powerfully in the heredity of the woman and which
    has most contributed to mold her form and outline no wonder
    then that her form should remind him of it indeed when he
    looks into her eyes he sees through to a far deeper life even
    than she herself may be aware of and yet which is truly hersa
    life perennial and wonderful the more than mortal in him beholds
    the more than mortal in her and the gods descend to meet
    edward carpenter the art of creation pp 137 186
it is this mighty force which lies behind and beneath the aberrations we
have been concerned with a great reservoir from which they draw the
lifeblood that vivifies even their most fantastic shapes fetichism and
the other forms of erotic symbolism are but the development and the
isolation of the crystallizations which normally arise on the basis of
sexual selection normal in their basis in their extreme forms they
present the utmost pathological aberrations of the sexual instinct which
can be attained or conceived in the intermediate space all degrees are
possible in the slightest degree the symbol is merely a specially
fascinating and beloved feature in a person who is in all other respects
felt to be lovable as such its recognition is a legitimate part of
courtship an effective aid to tumescence in a further degree the symbol
is the one arresting and attracting character of a person who must
however still be felt as a sexually attractive individual in a still
further degree of perversion the symbol is effective even though the
person with whom it is associated is altogether unattractive in the final
stage the person and even all association with a person disappear
altogether from the field of sexual consciousness the abstract symbol
rules supreme
long however before the symbol has reached that final climax of morbid
intensity we may be said to have passed beyond the sphere of sexual love
a person not an abstracted quality must be the goal of love so long as
the fetich is subordinated to the person it serves to heighten love but
love must be based on a complexus of attractive qualities or it has no
stability70 as soon as the fetich becomes isolated and omnipotent so
that the person sinks into the background as an unimportant appendage of
the fetich all stability is lost the fetichist now follows an impersonal
and abstract symbol withersoever it may lead him
it has been seen that there are an extraordinary number of forms in which
erotic symbolism may be felt it must be remembered and it cannot be too
distinctly emphasized that the links that bind together the forms of
erotic symbolism are not to be found in objects or even in acts but in
the underlying emotion a feeling is the first condition of the symbol a
feeling which recalls by a subtle and unconscious automatic association
of resemblance or of contiguity some former feeling it is the similarity
of emotion instinctively apprehended which links on a symbol only
partially sexual or even apparently not sexual at all to the great
central focus of sexual emotion the great dominating force which brings
the symbol its lifeblood71
the cases of sexual hypersthesia quoted at the beginning of this study
do but present in a morbidly comprehensive and sensitive form those
possibilities of erotic symbolism which in some degree or at some
period are latent in most persons they are genuinely instinctive and
automatic and have nothing in common with that fanciful and deliberate
play of the intelligence around sexual imagerynot infrequently seen in
abnormal and insane personswhich has no significance for sexual
psychology
it is to the extreme individualization involved by the developments of
erotic symbolism that the fetichist owes his morbid and perilous
isolation the lover who is influenced by all the elements of sexual
selection is always supported by the fellowfeeling of a larger body of
other human beings he has behind him his species his sex his nation or
at the very least a fashion even the inverted lover in most cases is soon
able to create around him an atmosphere constituted by persons whose
ideals resemble his own but it is not so with the erotic symbolist he is
nearly always alone he is predisposed to isolation from the outset for
it would seem to be on a basis of excessive shyness and timidity that the
manifestations of erotic symbolism are most likely to develop when at
length the symbolist realizes his own aspirationswhich seem to him for
the most part an altogether new phenomenon in the worldand at the same
time realizes the wide degree in which they deviate from those of the rest
of mankind his natural secretiveness is still further reinforced he
stands alone his most sacred ideals are for all those around him a
childish absurdity or a disgusting obscenity possibly a matter calling
for the intervention of the policeman we have forgotten that all these
impulses which to us seem so unnaturalthis adoration of the foot and
other despised parts of the body this reverence for the excretory acts
and products the acceptance of congress with animals the solemnity of
selfexhibitionwere all beliefs and practices which to our remote
forefathers were bound up with the highest conceptions of life and the
deepest ardors of religion
a man cannot however deviate at once so widely and so spontaneously in
his impulses from the rest of the world in which he himself lives without
possessing an aboriginally abnormal temperament at the very least he
exhibits a neuropathic sensitiveness to abnormal impressions not
infrequently there is more than this the distinct stigmata of
degeneration sometimes a certain degree of congenital feeblemindedness
or a tendency to insanity
yet regarded as a whole and notwithstanding the frequency with which
they witness to congenital morbidity the phenomena of erotic symbolism
can scarcely fail to be profoundly impressive to the patient and impartial
student of the human soul they often seem absurd sometimes disgusting
occasionally criminal they are always when carried to an extreme degree
abnormal but of all the manifestations of sexual psychology normal and
abnormal they are the most specifically human more than any others they
involve the potently plastic force of the imagination they bring before
us the individual man not only apart from his fellows but in opposition
himself creating his own paradise they constitute the supreme triumph of
human idealism

in analyzing the sexual impulse we have seen that the process whereby the
conjunction of the sexes is achieved falls naturally into two phases the
first phase of tumescence during which force is generated in the
organism and the second phase of detumescence in which that force is
discharged during conjugation72 hitherto we have been occupied mainly
with the first phase that of tumescence and with its associated psychic
phenomena it was inevitable that this should be so for it is during the
slow process of tumescence that sexual selection is decided the
crystallizations of love elaborated and to a large extent the
individual erotic symbols determined but we can by no means altogether
pass over the final phase of detumescence its consideration it is true
brings us directly into the field of anatomy and physiology while
tumescence is largely under control of the will when the moment of
detumescence arrives the reins slip from the control of the will the more
fundamental and uncontrollable impulses of the organism gallop on
unchecked the chariot of phathon dashes blindly down into a sea of
emotion
yet detumescence is the end and climax of the whole drama it is an
anatomicophysiological process certainly but one that inevitably
touches psychology at every point73 it is indeed the very key to the
process of tumescence and unless we understand and realize very precisely
what it is that happens during detumescence our psychological analysis of
the sexual impulse must remain vague and inadequate
from the point of view we now occupy a man and a woman are no longer two
highly sensitive organisms vibrating voluptuously it may indeed be but
vaguely and indefinitely to all kinds of influences and with fluctuating
impulses capable of being directed into any channel even in the highest
degree divergent from the proper ends of procreation they are now two
genital organisms who exist to propagate the race and whatever else they
may be they must be adequately constituted to effect the act by which the
future of the race is ensured we have to consider what are the material
conditions which ensure the most satisfactory and complete fulfillment of
this act and how those conditions may be correlated with other
circumstances in the organism in thus approaching the subject we shall
find that we have not really abandoned the study of the psychic aspects of
sex
the two most primary sexual organs are the testis and the ovary it is the
object of conjugation to bring into contact the sperm from the testis with
the germ from the ovary there is no reason to suppose that the germcell
and the spermcell are essentially different from each other sexual
conjugation thus remains a process which is radically the same as the
nonsexual mode of propagation which preceded it the fusion of the nuclei
of the two cells was regarded by van beneden who in 1875 first accurately
described it as a process of conjugation comparable to that of the
protozoa and the protophyta boveri who has further extended our
knowledge of the process considers that the spermatozoon removes an
inhibitory influence preventing the commencement of development in the
ovum the spermatozoon replaces a portion of the ovum which has already
undergone degeneration so that the object of conjugation is chiefly to
effect the union of the properties of two cells in one sexual
fertilization achieving a division of labor with reciprocal inhibition
the two cells have renounced their original faculty of separate
development in order to attain a fusion of qualities and thus render
possible that production of new forms and qualities which has involved the
progress of the organized world74
while in fishes this conjugation of the male and female elements is
usually ensured by the female casting her spawn into an artificial nest
outside the body on to which the male sheds his milt in all animals
and to some extent birds who occupy an intermediate position there is
an organic nest or incubation chamber as bland sutton terms it the womb
in the female body wherein the fertilized egg may develop to a high
degree of maturity sheltered from those manifold risks of the external
world which make it necessary for the spawn of fishes to be so enormous in
amount since however men and women have descended from remote ancestors
who in the manner of aquatic creatures exercised functions of
spermextrusion and germextrusion that were exactly analogous in the two
sexes without any specialized female uterine organization the early
stages of human male and female foetal development still display the
comparatively undifferentiated sexual organization of those remote
ancestors and during the first months of foetal life it is practically
impossible to tell by the inspection of the genital regions whether the
embryo would have developed into a man or into a woman if we examine the
embryo at an early stage of development we see that the hind end is the
body stalk this stalk in later stages becoming part of the umbilical
cord the urogenital region formed by the rapid extension of the hind
end beyond its original limit which corresponds to what is later the
umbilicus develops mainly by the gradual differentiation of structures
the wolffian and mllerian bodies which originally exist identically in
both sexes this process of sexual differentiation is highly complex so
that it cannot yet be said that there is complete agreement among
investigators as to its details when some irregularity or arrest of
development occurs in the process we have one or other of the numerous
malformations which may affect this region if the arrest occurs at a very
early stage we may even find a condition of things which seems to
approximate to that which normally exists in the adult reptilia75 owing
to the fact that both male and female organs develop from more primitive
structures which were sexually undifferentiated a fundamental analogy in
the sexual organs of the sexes always remains the developed organs of one
sex exist as rudiments in the other sex the testicles correspond to the
ovaries the female clitoris is the homologue of the male penis the
scrotum of one sex is the labia majora in the other sex and so
throughout although it is not always possible at present to be quite
certain in regard to these homologics
since the object to be attained by the sexual organs in the human species
is identical with that which they subserve in their prehuman ancestors
it is not surprising to find that these structures have a clear
resemblance to the corresponding structures in the apes although on the
whole there would appear to be in man a higher degree of sexual
differentiation thus the uterus of various species of semnopithecus
seems to show a noteworthy correspondence with the same organ in
woman76 the somewhat less degree of sexual differentiation is well
shown in the gorilla in the male the external organs are in the passive
state covered by the wrinkled skin of the abdomen while in the female
on the contrary they are very apparent and in sexual excitement the
large clitoris and nymph become markedly prominent the penis of the
gorilla however more nearly resembles that of man according to
hartmann than does that of the other anthropoid apes which diverge from
the human type in this respect more than do the cynocephalic apes and some
species of baboon
from the psychological point of view we are less interested in the
internal sexual organs which are most fundamentally concerned with the
production and reception of the sexual elements than with the more
external parts of the genital apparatus which serve as the instruments of
sexual excitation and the channels for the intromission and passage of
the seminal fluid it is these only which can play any part at all in
sexual selection they are the only part of the sexual apparatus which can
enter into the formation of either normal or abnormal erotic conceptions
they are the organs most prominently concerned with detumescence they
alone enter normally into the conscious process of sex at any time it
seems desirable therefore to discuss them briefly at this point
    our knowledge of the individual and racial variations of the
    external sexual organs is still extremely imperfect a few
    monographs and collections of data on isolated points may be
    found in more or less inaccessible publications as regards
    women ploss and bartels have devoted a chapter to the sexual
    organs of women which extends to a hundred pages but remains
    scanty and fragmentary das weib vol i chapter vi the
    most systematic series of observations have been made in the case
    of the various kinds of degeneratesidiots the insane
    criminals etcbut it would be obviously unsafe to rely too
    absolutely on such investigations for our knowledge of the sexual
    organs of the ordinary population
    there can be no doubt however that the external sexual organs
    in normal men and women exhibit a peculiarly wide range of
    variation this is indicated not only by the unsystematic results
    attained by experienced observers but also by more systematic
    studies thus herman has shown by detailed measurements that
    there are great normal variations in the conformation of the
    parts that form the floor of the female pelvis he found that the
    projection of the pelvic floor varied from nothing to as much as
    two inches and that in healthy women who had borne no children
    the distance between the coccyx and anus the length of the
    perineum the distance between the fourchette and the symphysis
    pubis and the length of the vagina are subject to wide
    variations lancet october 12 1889 even the female
    urethral opening varies very greatly as has been shown by bergh
    who investigated it in nearly 700 women and reproduces the
    various shapes found while most usually in about a third of the
    cases observed a longitudinal slit it may be crossshaped
    starshaped crescentic etc and while sometimes very small in
    about 6 per cent of the cases it admitted the tip of the little

    as regards both sexes stanley hall states that dr fn
    seerley who has examined over 2000 normal young men as well as
    many young women tells me that in his opinion individual
    variations in these parts are much greater even than those of
    face and form and that the range of adult and apparently normal
    size and proportion as well as function and of both the age and
    order of development not only of each of the several parts
    themselves but of all their immediate annexes and in females as
    well as males is far greater than has been recognized by any
    writer this fact is the basis of the anxieties and fears of
    morphological abnormality so frequent during adolescence gs
    hall adolescence vol i p 414
in accordance with the supreme importance of the part they play and the
intimately psychic nature of that part the sexual organs both internal
and external are very richly supplied with nerves while the internal
organs are very abundantly furnished with sympathetic nerves and ganglia
the external organs show the highest possible degree of specialization of
the various peripheral nervous devices which the organism has developed
for receiving accumulating and transmitting stimuli to the brain77
    the number of conducting cords which attach the genitals to the
    nervous centers is simply enormous writes bryan robinson the
    pudic nerve is composed of nearly all the third sacral and
    branches from the second and fourth sacral as one examines this
    nerve he is forced to the conclusion that it is an enormous
    supply for a small organ the periphery of the pudic nerve
    spreads itself like a fan over the genitals the lesser sciatic
    nerve supplies only one musclethe gluteus maximusand then
    sends the large pudendal branch to the side of the penis and
    hence the friction of coitus induces active contraction of the
    gluteus maximus the main muscle of coition the large pudic
    and the pudendal constitute the main supply of the external
    genitals in women the pudic nerve is equally large but the
    pudendal much smaller possibly bryan robinson suggests because
    women take a less active part in coitus the nerve supply of the
    clitoris however is three or four times as large as that of the
    penis in proportion to size fb robinson the intimate

of all the sexual organs the penis is without doubt that which has most
powerfully impressed the human imagination it is the very emblem of
generation and everywhere men have contemplated it with a mixture of
reverence and shuddering awe that has sometimes even among civilized
peoples amounted to horror and disgust its image is worn as an amulet to
ward off evil and invoked as a charm to call forth blessing the sexual
organs were once the most sacred object on which a man could place his
hands to swear an inviolate oath just as now he takes up the testament
even in the traditions of the great classic civilization which we inherit
the penis is fascinus the symbol of all fascination in the history of
human culture it has had far more than a merely human significance it has
been the symbol of all the generative force of nature the embodiment of
creative energy in the animal and vegetable worlds alike an image to be
held aloft for worship the sign of all unconscious ecstasy as a symbol
the sacred phallus it has been woven in and out of all the highest and
deepest human conceptions so intimately that it is possible to see it
everywhere that it is possible to fail to see it anywhere
in correspondence with the importance of the penis is the large number of
names which men have everywhere bestowed upon it in french literature
many hundred synonyms may be found they were also numerous in latin in
english the literary terms for the penis seem to be comparatively few but
a large number of nonliterary synonyms exist in colloquial and perhaps
merely local usage the latin term penis which has established itself
among us as the most correct designation is generally considered to be
associated with pendere and to be connected therefore with the usually
pendent position of the organ in the middle ages the general literary
term throughout europe was coles or colis from caulis a stalk
and virga a rod the only serious english literary term yard exactly
equivalent to virga as used by chauceralmost the last great english
writer whose vocabulary was adequate to the central facts of lifehas now
fallen out of literary and even colloquial usage
    pierer and chaulant in their anatomical and physiological
    reallexicon vol vi p 134 give nearly a hundred synonyms
    for the penis hyrtl topographisches anatomie seventh
    edition vol ii pp 6769 adds others schurig in his
    spermatologia 1720 pp 8991 also presents a number of
    names for the penis in chapter iii pp 189192 of the same
    book he discusses the penis generally with more fullness than
    most authors louis de landes in his glossaire erotique of the
    french language pp 239242 enumerates several hundred
    literary synonyms for the penis though many of them probably
    only occur once
    there is no thorough and comprehensive modern study of the penis
    on an anthropological basis though i should mention a valuable
    and fully illustrated study of anthropological and pathological
    variations of the penis in a series of articles by marandon de

    and it would be out of place here to attempt to collect the
    scattered notices regarding racial and other variations it may
    suffice to note some of the evidence showing that such variations
    seem to be numerous and important the arab penis according to
    kocher is slender and long a third longer than the average
    european penis and with a clubshaped glans it undergoes little
    change when it enters the erect state the clothes leaves it
    quite free and the arab practices manual excitement at an early
    age to favor its development
    among the fuegians also according to hyades and deniker cap
    horn vol vii p 153 the average length of the penis is 77
    millimeters which is longer than in europeans
    in men of black race also the penis is decidedly large thus
    sir hh johnston british central africa p 399 states this
    to be a universal rule among the wankenda of northern nyassa
    for instance he remarks that while the body is of medium size
    the penis is generally large he gives the usual length as about
    six inches reaching nine or ten in erection the prepuce it is
    added is often very long and circumcision is practiced by many
    tribes
    among the american negroes hrdlicka has found also proceedings
    american association for the advancement of science vol xlvii
    p 475 that the penis in black boys is larger than in white
    boys
    the passages cited above suggest the question whether the penis
    becomes larger by exercise of its generative functions most old
    authors assert that frequent erection makes the penis large and
    long schurig spermatologia p 107 galen noted that in
    singers and athletes who were chaste in order to preserve their
    strength the sexual parts were small and rugrose like those of
    old men and that exercise of the organs from youth develops
    them roubaud quoting this observation trait de
    limpuissance p 373 agrees with the statement it seems
    probable that there is an element of truth in this ancient
    belief at the same time it must be remembered that the penis is
    only to small extent a muscular organ and that the increase of
    size produced by frequent congestion of erectile tissues cannot
    be either rapid or pronounced variations in the size of the
    sexual organs are probably on the whole mainly inherited though
    it is impossible to speak decisively on this point until more
    systematic observations become customary
the scrotum has usually in the human imagination been regarded merely as
an appendage of the penis of secondary importance although it is the
garment of the primary and essential organs of sex and the fact that it
is not the seat of any voluptuous sensation has doubtless helped to
confirm this position even the name is merely a medival perversion of
scortum skin or hide in classic times it was usually called the pouch
or purse the importance of the testicles has not however been
altogether ignored as the very word testis itself shows for the
testis is simply the witness of virility78
it is easy to understand why the penis should occupy this special place in
mans thoughts as the supreme sexual organ it is the one conspicuous and
prominent portion of the sexual apparatus while its aptitude for swelling
and erecting itself involuntarily under the influence of sexual emotion
gives it a peculiar and almost unique position in the body at the same
time it is the point at which in the male body all voluptuous sensation
is concentrated the only normal masculine center of sex79
it is not easy to find any correspondingly conspicuous symbol of sex in
the sexual region of women in the normal position nothing is visible but
the peculiarly human cushion of fat picturesquely termed the mons veneris
because as palfyn said all those who enroll themselves under the banner
of venus must necessarily scale it and even that is veiled from view in
the adult by the more or less bushy plantation of hair which grows upon
it a triangle of varyingly precise definition is thus formed at the lower
apex of the trunk and this would sometimes appear to have been regarded
as a feminine symbol80 but the more usual and typical symbol of
femininity is the idealized ring by some savages drawn as a lozenge of
the vulvar openingthe yoni corresponding to the masculine
lingamwhich is normally closed from view by the larger lips arising
from beneath the shadow of the mons it is a symbol that like the
masculine phallus has a double meaning among primitive peoples and is
sometimes used to call down a blessing and sometimes to invoke a
curse81
this external opening of the feminine genital passage with its two
enclosing lips is now generally called the vulva it would appear that
originally as by celsus and pliny this term included the womb also but
when the term uterus came into use vulva was confined as its sense of
folding doors suggests that it should be to the external entrance the
classic term cunnus for the external genitals was chiefly used by the
poets it has been the etymological source of various european names for
this region such as the old french con which has now however
disappeared from literature while even in popular usage it has given place
to lapin and similar terms but there is always a tendency marked in
most parts of the world for the names of the external female parts to
become indecorous even in classic antiquity this part was the pudendum
the part to be ashamed of and among ourselves the mass of the
population still preserving the traditions of primitive times continue
to cherish the same notion

    external and to some extent the internal feminine sexual region

    other passages several of schurigs works especially
    gyncologia muliebria and parthenologia contain full
    summaries of the statements of the early writers
the external or larger lips like the mons veneris are specifically human
in their full development for in the anthropoid apes they are small as is
the mons and in the lower apes absent altogether they are moreover
larger in the white than in the other human races thus in the negro and
to a less degree in the japanese wernich and the javanese scherzer
they are less developed than in women of white race the greater lips
develop in the foetus later than the lesser lips which are thus at first
uncovered this condition thus constitutes an infantile state which
occasionally in less than 2 per cent of cases according to bergh
persists in the adult their generally accepted name labia majora is
comparatively modern82
    the outer sides of the labia majora are covered with hair and on
    the inner sides which are smooth and moist but are not true
    mucous membrane there are a few sweat glands and numerous large
    sebaceous glands bergh considers that there is little or no hair
    on the inner sides of the labia majora but lamb states that
    careful examination shows that from one to twothirds of the
    inner surface in adult women show hairs like those of the
    external surface in brunettes and women of dark races this
    surface is pigmented in dark races it is usually a slate gray
    from an examination of 2200 young danish prostitutes bergh has
    found that there are two main varieties in the shape of the labia
    majora with transitional forms in the first and most frequent
    form the labia tend to be less marked and more effaced and
    separated at the upper and anterior part often being lost in the
    sides of the mons and presenting a fissure which is broader in
    its upper part and showing the inner lips more or less bare in
    the second form the labia are thicker and more outstanding and
    the inner edges lie in contact throughout their whole length
    showing the rima pudendi as a long narrow fissure whatever the
    form the labia close more tightly together in virgins and in
    young individuals generally than in the deflowered and the
    elderly in children as martineau pointed out the vulva appears
    to look directly forward and the clitoris and urinary meatus
    easily appear while in adult women and especially after
    attempts at coitus have been made the vulva appears directed
    more below and behind and the clitoris and meatus more covered
    by the labia majora so that the child urinates forward while
    the adult woman is usually able to urinate almost directly
    downwards in the erect position though in some cases as may
    occasionally be observed in the street she can only do so when
    bending slightly forwards this difference in the direction of
    the stream formerly furnished one of the methods of diagnosing
    virginity an uncertain one since the difference is largely due
    to age and individual variation the main factor in the position
    and aspect of the vulva is pelvic inclination see havelock
    ellis man and woman fourth edition p 64 stratz die
    schnheit des weiblichen krpers chapter xii in the european
    woman according to stratz a considerable degree of pelvic
    inclination is essential to beauty concealing all but the
    anterior third of the vulva in negresses and other women of
    lower race the vulva however usually lies further back being
    more conspicuous from behind than in european women in this
    respect lower races resemble the apes those women of dark race
    therefore whose modesty is focused behind rather than in front
    thus have sound anatomical considerations on their side
    as ploss and bartels remark a very common variation among
    european women consists in an unusually posterior position of the
    vulva and vaginal entrance so that unless a cushion is placed
    under the buttocks it is difficult for the man to effect coitus
    in the usual position without giving much pain to the woman they
    add that another anomaly less easy to remedy consists in an
    abnormally anterior position of the vaginal entrance close
    beneath the pelvic bone so that although intromission is easy
    the spasmodic contraction of the vagina at the culmination of
    orgasm presses the penis against the bone and causes intolerable
    pain to the man
the mons veneris and the labia majora are after the age of puberty
always normally covered by a more or less profuse growth of hair it is
notable that the apes notwithstanding their general tendency to
hairiness show no such special development of hair in this region we
thus see that all the external and more conspicuous portions of the sexual
sphere in womanthe mons veneris the labia majora and the
hairrepresent not so much an animal inheritance such as we commonly
misrepresent them to be but a higher and genuinely human development as
none of these structures subserve any clear practical use it would appear
that they must have developed by sexual selection to satisfy the sthetic
demands of the eye83
    the character and arrangement of the pubic hair investigated by
    eschricht and voigt more than half a century ago have been more
    recently studied by bergh as these observers have pointed out
    there are various converging hair streams from above and below
    the clitoris seeming to be the center towards which they are
    directed the haircovering thus formed is usually ample and as
    a rule is more so in brunettes than in blondes it is nearly
    always bent curly and more or less spirally twisted84 there
    are frequently one or two curls at the commencement of the
    fissure rolled outwards and occasionally a well marked tuft in
    the middle line in abundance the pubic hair corresponds with the
    axillary hair when one region is defective in hair the other is
    usually so also strong eyebrows also usually indicate a strong
    development of pubic hair but the hair of the head usually
    varies independently and bergh found that of 154 women with
    spare pubic hair 72 had good and often profuse hair on the head
    complete or almost complete absence of pubic hair is in berghs
    experience only found in about 3 per cent of women these were
    all young and blonde
rothe in his investigation of the pubic hair of 1000 berlin women found
that no two women were really alike in this respect but there was a
tendency to two main types of arrangement with minor subdivisions
according as the hair tended to grow chiefly in the middle line extending
laterally from that line or to grow equally over the whole extent of the
pubic region these two groups included half the cases investigated
    in men the pubic hair normally ascends anteriorly in a faint line
    up to the navel with tendency to form a triangle with the apex
    above and posteriorly extends backwards to the anus in women
    these anterior and posterior extensions are comparatively rare
    or at all events are only represented by a few stray hairs rothe
    found this variation in 4 per cent of north german women though
    a triangle of hair was only found in 2 per cent lombroso found
    it in 5 per cent of italian women bergh found it in only 16
    per cent among 1000 danish prostitutes all sixteen of whom with
    three exceptions were brunettes in vienna among 600 women coe
    found only 1 per cent with this distribution of hair and states
    that they were women of decidedly masculine type though ploss
    and bartels as well as rothe find however that heterogeny as
    they term the masculine distribution is more common in blondes
    the anterior extension of hair is usually accompanied by the
    posterior extension around the anus usually very slight but
    occasionally as pronounce as in men according to rothe
    however anterior heterogeny comparatively rare these masculine
    variations in the extension of the pubic hair appear to be not
    uncommonly associated with other physical and psychic anomalies
    it is on this account that they have sometimes been regarded as
    indications of a vicious or a criminal temperament they are
    however found in quite normal women
    the pubic hair of women is usually shorter than that of men but
    thick and the individual hairs stronger and larger in diameter
    than those of men as pfaff first showed dark hair is usually
    stronger than light in both length and size the individual
    variations are considerable the usual length is about 2 inches
    or 35 centimeters occasionally reaching about 4 inches or 910
    centimeters in the larger curls in a series of 100 women
    attended during confinement in london and the north of england i
    have only once in a rather blonde lancashire woman found the
    hair on labia reaching a conspicuous length of several inches and
    forming an obstruction to the manipulations involved in delivery
    but jahn delivered a woman whose pubic hair was longer than that
    of her head reaching below her knee paulini also knew a woman
    whose pubic hair nearly reached her knees and was sold to make
    wigs bartholin mentions a soldiers wife who plaited her pubic
    hair behind her back while brantme has several references to
    abnormally long hair in ladies of the french court during the
    sixteenth century in 8 cases out of 2200 bergh found the pubic
    hair forming a large curly wig extending to the iliac spines the
    individual hairs have occasionally been found so stiff and
    brushlike as to render coitus difficult
    in color the pubic hair while generally approximating to that of
    the head is sometimes according to rothe in germany in
    onethird cases lighter and sometimes somewhat darker as is
    found to be the case by coe especially in brunettes and also by
    bergh in denmark bergh remarks that it is generally
    intermediate in color between the eyebrows and the axillary hair
    the latter being more or less decolorized by sweat and that
    owing to the influence of the urine and vaginal discharges the
    labial hair is paler than that on the mons blondes with dark
    eyebrows usually have dark hair on the mons the hair on this
    spot as aristotle observed is usually the last to turn gray
the key to the genital apparatus in women from the psychic point of view
and indeed to some extent its anatomical center is to be found in the
clitoris anatomically and developmentally the clitoris is the rudimentary
analogue of the masculine penis functionally however its scope is very
much smaller while the penis both receives and imparts specific
voluptuous sensations and is at the same time both the intromittent organ
for the semen and the conduit for the urine the sole function of the
clitoris is to enter into erection under the stress of sexual emotion and
receive and transmit the stimulatory voluptuous sensations imparted to it
by friction with the masculine genital apparatus it is so insignificant
an organ that it is only within recent times that its homology with the
penis has been realized in 1844 kobelt wrote in his important book die
mannlichen und weiblichen wollustorgane that in his attempt to show
that the female organs are exactly analogous to the male the reader will
probably be unable to follow him while even johannes mller the father
of scientific physiology declared at about the same period that the
clitoris is essentially different from the penis it is indeed but three
centuries since the clitoris was so little known that in 1593 realdus
columbus actually claimed the honor of discovering it columbus was not
its discoverer for fallopius speedily showed that avicenna and albucasis
had referred to it85 the arabs appear to have been very familiar with
it and from the various names they gave it clearly understood the
important part it plays in generating voluptuous emotion86 but it was
known in classic antiquity the greeks called it myrton the myrtleberry
galen and soranus called it nymph because it is covered as a bride is
veiled while the old latin name was tentigo from its power of entering
into erection and columella the little pillar from its shape the
modern term which is greek and refers to the sensitiveness of the part to
voluptuous titillation is said to have originated with suidas and
pollux87 it was mentioned though not adopted by rufus
the clitoris declared haller is a part extremely sensible and
wonderfully prurient it is certainly the chief though by no means the
only point through which the immediate call to detumescence is conveyed to
the female organism it is indeed as bryan robinson remarks a
veritable electrical bell button which being pressed or irritated rings
up the whole nervous system
    the nervous supply of this little organ is very large and the
    dorsal nerve of the clitoris is relatively three or four times
    larger than that of the penis yet the sensitive point of this
    organ is only 5 to 7 millimeters in extent the length of the
    clitoris is usually rather over 2 centimeters or about an inch
    and 3 centimeters when erect a length of 4 centimeters or more
    was regarded by martineau as within the normal range of
    variation it is not usual to find the clitoris longer than this
    in europe for among some races like the negro the clitoris is
    generally large but all degrees of magnitude may be found as
    rare exceptions see eg sir jy simpson hermaphrodites
    obstetric memoirs and contributions vol ii pp 217226 also
    dickinson loc cit it was formerly thought that the clitoris
    is easily enlarged by masturbation and martineau believed that
    in this way it might be doubled in length it is probable that
    slight enlargement of the clitoris may be caused by very
    frequent masturbation but only to an insignificant extent and
    it is impossible to diagnose masturbation from the size of the
    clitoris among the women of lake nyassa as well as in the
    caroline islands special methods are practiced for elongating
    the clitoris but in europe at all events it is probable that
    the variations in the size of the organ are mainly congenital it
    may well be that a congenitally large clitoris is associated with
    an abnormally developed excitability of the sexual apparatus
    tilt stated on uterine and ovarian inflammation p 37 that
    in his experience there was a frequent though not invariable
    connection between a large clitoris and sexual proclivity
    schurig referred to a case of intense and lifelong sexual
    obsession associated with an extremely large clitoris
    gyncologia pp 1617 of recent years considerable
    importance has been attached by some gynecologists eg rt
    morris is evolution trying to do away with the clitoris
    transactions american association of obstetricians and
    gynecologists vol v 1893 to preputial adhesions around the
    clitoris as a source of nervous disturbance and invalidism in
    young women
while the clitoris is anatomically analogous to the penis its actual
mechanism under the stress of sexual excitement is somewhat different as
litaud long since pointed out it cannot rise freely in erection as the
penis can it is apparently bound down by its prepuce and its frenulum
waldeyer in his book on the pelvis states more precisely that unlike
the penis when erect it retains its angle only this becomes somewhat
rounded so that the organ is to some slight extent lifted and protruded
waldeyer considered that the clitoris was thus perfectly fitted to fulfill
its part as the recipient of erotic stimulation from friction by the
penis adler however has pointed out with considerable justice that
this is not altogether the case the clitoris was developed in mammals who
practiced the posterior mode of coitus in this position the clitoris was
beneath the penis which was thus easily able in coitus to press it
against the pubic bone close beneath which it is situated and thus impart
the compression and friction which the feminine organ craves but in the
human anterior mode of coitus it is not necessarily brought into close
contact with the penis during the act of coitus and thus fails to receive
powerful stimulation its restricted position which is an advantage in
posterior coitus is a disadvantage in anterior coitus adler observes
that it thus comes about that the human method of coitus while by
bringing breast to breast and face to face it has added a new dignity and
refinement a fresh source of enjoyment to the embrace of the sexes has
not been an unmixed advantage to woman for while man has lost nothing by
the change woman has now to contend with an increased difficulty in
attaining an adequate amount of pressure on that electric button which
normally sets the whole mechanism in operation88
we may well bring into connection with the changed conditions brought
about by anterior coitus the interesting fact that while the clitoris
remains the most exquisitely sensitive of the sexual centers in woman
voluptuous sensitivity is much more widely diffused in woman than in man
over the whole body indeed it is apt to be more distinctly marked than
is usually the case in man but even if we confine ourselves to the
genital region while in man that portion of the penis which enters the
vagina and especially the glans is normally the only portion which even
during turgescence is sensitive to voluptuous contacts in woman the
whole of the region comprised within the larger lips including even the
anus and internally the vagina and the vaginal portion of the womb89
become sensitive to voluptuous contacts deprived of the penis the ability
of a man to experience specifically sexual sensations becomes very limited
indeed but the loss of the clitoris or of any other structure involves no
correspondingly serious disability on women ablation of the clitoris for
sexual hypersthesia has for this reason been abandoned except under
special circumstances the members of the russian skoptzy sect habitually
amputate the clitoris nymph and breasts yet many young skoptzy women
told the russian physician guttceit that they were perfectly well able
to enjoy coitus
    freud believes that in very young girls the clitoris is the
    exclusive seat of sexual sensation masturbation at this age
    being directed to the clitoris alone and spontaneous sexual
    excitement being confined to twitchings and erection of this
    organ so that young girls are able from their own experience
    to recognize without instruction the signs of sexual excitement
    in boys at a later age sexual excitability spreads from the
    clitoris to other regionsjust as the easy inflammability of
    wood sets light to coalthough in the male the penis remains
    from first to last normally the almost exclusive seat of specific
    excitability s freud drei abhandlungen zur sexualtheorie
    p 62
    the anus would however seem to be sometimes an erogenous zone
    even at an early age titillation of the anus appears to be
    frequently pleasurable in women and this is not surprising
    considering the high degree of erotic sensitivity which is easily
    developed at the body orifices where skin meets mucous membrane
    thus the meatus of the urethra is a highly erogenous zone as is
    sufficiently shown by the frequency with which hairpins and
    other articles used in masturbation find their way into the
    bladder it is in this germinal sensitivity undoubtedly that
    we find a chief key to the practice of pedicatio freud
    attaches great importance to the anus as a sexually erogenous
    zone at a very early age and considers that it very frequently
    makes its influence felt in this respect he believes that
    intestinal catarrhs in very early life and hmorrhoids later tend
    to develop sensibility in the anus he finds an indication that
    the anus has become a sexually erogenous zone when children wish
    to allow the contents of the rectum to accumulate so that
    defecation may by its increased difficulty involve voluptuous
    sensations and adds that masturbatory excitation of the anus
    with the fingers is by no means rare in older children s
    freud op cit pp 4042 a medical correspondent in india
    tells me of a european lady who derived she said quite as
    much indeed more pleasure from digitally titillating her
    rectum as from vulvovaginal titillation she had several times
    submitted to pedicatio and enjoyed it though it was painful
    during penetration the anus may retain this erogenous
    irritability even in old age and routh mentions the case of a
    lady of over 70 the reverse of lustful who was so excited by
    the act of defecation that she was invariably compelled to
    masturbate although this state of things was a source of great
    mental misery to her chf routh british gyncological
    journal february 1887 p 48
    blsche has sought the explanation of the erogenous nature of the
    anus and the key to pedicatio in an atavistic return to the
    very remote amphibian days when the anus was combined with the
    sexual parts in a common cloaca but it is unnecessary to invoke
    any vestigial inheritance from a vastly remote past when we bear
    in mind that the innervation of these two adjoining regions is
    inevitably very closely related the presence of a body exit with
    its marked and special sensitivity at a point where it can
    scarcely fail to receive the nervous overflow from an immensely
    active center of nervous energy quite adequately accounts for the
    phenomenon in question
the inner lips the nymph or labia minora running parallel with the
greater lips which enclose them embrace the clitoris anteriorly and
extend backward enclosing the urethral exit between them as well as the
vaginal entrance they form little wings whence their old latin name
al and from their resemblance to the cocks comb were by spigelius
termed crista galli the red and especially in brunettes dark appearance
of the nymph suggests that they are mucous membrane and not
integumentary it is however now considered that even on the inner
surface they are covered by skin and separated from the mucous membrane by
a line90 in structure as described by waldeyer they consist of fine
connective tissue rich in elastic fibers as well as some muscular tissue
and full of large veins so that they are capable of a considerable degree
of turgescence resembling erection during sexual excitement while
ballantyne finds that the nymph are supplied to a notable extent with
nervous endorgans
more than any other part of the sexual apparatus in either sex the lesser
lips on account of their shape their position and their structure are
capable of acquired modifications more especially hypertrophy and
elongation by stretching it is stated a labium can be doubled in its
dimensions the hottentot apron or elongated nymph commonly found
among some peoples in south africa has long been a familiar phenomenon
in such cases a length or transverse diameter of 3 to 5 centimeters is
commonly found but such elongated nymph are by no means confined to one
part of the world or to one race they are quite common among women of
european race and reach a size equal to most of the more reliably
recorded hottentot cases dickinson who has very carefully studied this
question in new york finds that in 1000 consecutive gyncological cases
the labia showed some form of hypertrophy in 36 per cent or more than 1
in 3 while among 150 of these cases who were neurasthenic the proportion
reached 56 per cent even when minor or doubtful enlargements were
disregarded bergh in about 16 per cent cases found very enlarged
nymph the height reached in about 5 per cent of the cases of
enlargement being nearly six centimeters ploss and bartels in a full
discussion of the hottentot apron come to the conclusion that this
condition is perhaps in most cases artificially produced it is known that
among the basutos it is the custom for the elder girls to manipulate the
nymph of younger children when alone with them almost from birth and
on account of the elastic nature of these structures such manipulation
quite adequately accounts for the elongation it is not necessary to
suppose that the custom is practiced for the sake of producing sexual
stimulationthough this may frequently occursince there are numerous
similar primitive customs involving deformation of the sexual organs
without the production of sexual excitement dickinson has come to a
similar conclusion as regards the corresponding elongation of the nymph
in civilized european women in 361 out of 1000 women of good social class
he found elongation or thickening often with a notable degree of
wrinkling and pigmentation and believes that this is always the result of
frequently repeated masturbation practiced with the separation of the
nymph in 30 per cent of the cases admission of masturbation was
made91 while this conclusion is probably correct in the main it
requires some qualification to assert that whenever in women who have
not been pregnant the marked protrusion of the inner lips beyond the outer
lips means that at some period manipulation has been practiced with or
without the production of sexual excitement is to make too absolute a
statement it is highly probable that the nymph like the clitoris are
congenitally more prominent in some of the lower human races as they are
also in the apes among the fuegians for instance according to hyades
and deniker the labia minora descend lower than in europeans although
there is not the slightest reason to suppose that these women practice any
manipulations among european women again the nymph sometimes protrude
very prominently beyond the labia majora in women who are organically of
somewhat infantile type this occurs in cases in which we may be convinced
that no manipulations have ever been practiced92
it is difficult to speak very decisively as to the function of the labia
minora they doubtless exert some amount of protective influence over the
entrance to the vagina and in this way correspond to the lips of the
mouth after which they are called they fulfill however one very
definite though not obviously important function which is indicated by the
mythologic name they have received there is indeed some obscurity in
the origin of this term nymph which has not i believe been
satisfactorily cleared up it has been stated that the greek name nymph
has been transferred from the clitoris to the labia minora any such
transfer could only have taken place when the meaning of the word had been
forgotten and nymph had become the totally different word nymph the
goddesses who presided over streams the old anatomists were much
exercised in their minds as to the meaning of the name but on the whole
were inclined to believe that it referred to the action of the labia
minora in directing the urinary stream the term nymph was first applied
in the modern sense according to bergh in 1599 by pinus mainly from
the influence of these structures on the urinary stream and he dilated in
his de virginitate on the suitability of the term to designate so poetic
a spot93 in more modern times luschka and sir charles bell considered
that it is one of the uses of the nymph to direct the stream of urine
and lamb from his own observation thinks the same conclusion probable in
reality there cannot be the slightest doubt about the function of the
nymph as in hyrtls phrase the naiads of the urinary source and it
can be demonstrated by the simplest experiment94
the nymph form the intermediate portal of the vagina as the canal which
conducts to the womb was in anatomy first termed according to hyrtl by
de graaf95 it is a secreting erectile more or less sensitive canal
lined by what is usually considered mucous membrane though some have
regarded it as integument of the same character as that of the external
genitals it certainly resembles such integument more than for instance
the mucous membrane of the rectum in the woman who has never had sexual
intercourse and has been subjected to no manipulations or accidents
affecting this region the vagina is closed by a last and final gate of
delicate membranescarcely admitting more than a slender fingercalled
the hymen
    the poets called the hymen fios virginitatis the flower of
    virginity whence the medicolegal term defloratio
    notwithstanding the great significance which has long been
    attached to the phenomena connected with it the hymen was not
    accurately known until vesalius fallopius and spigelius
    described and named it it was however recognized by the arab
    authors avicenna and averroes the early literature concerning
    it is summarized by schurig muliebria 1729 section ii cap
    v the same authors parthenologia is devoted to the various
    ancient problems connected with the question of virginity
to say that this delicate piece of membrane is from the nonphysical point
of view a more important structure than any other part of the body is to
convey but a feeble idea of the immense importance of the hymen in the
eyes of the men of many past ages and even of our own times and among our
own people96 for the uses of the feminine body or for its beauty
there is no part which is more absolutely insignificant but in human
estimation it has acquired a spiritual value which has made it far more
than a part of the body it has taken the place of the soul that whose
presence gives all her worth and dignity even her name to the unmarried
woman her purity her sexual desirability her market value without
itthough in all physical and mental respects she might remain the same
personshe has sometimes been a mark for contempt a worthless
outcast97
    so fragile a membrane scarcely possesses the reliability which
    should be possessed by a structure whose presence or absence has
    often meant so much its absence by no means necessarily
    signifies that a woman has had intercourse with a man its
    presence by no means signifies that she has never had such
    intercourse
    there are many ways in which the hymen may be destroyed apart
    from coitus among the chinese and also it would appear in
    india and some other parts of the east the female parts are from
    infancy kept so scrupulously clean by daily washing the finger
    being introduced into the vagina that the hymen rapidly
    disappears and its existence is unknown even to chinese doctors
    among some brazilian indians a similar practice exists among
    mothers as regards their young children less however for the
    sake of cleanliness than in order to facilitate sexual
    intercourse in future years ploss and bartels das weib vol
    i chapter vi the manipulations of vaginal masturbation will
    of course similarly destroy the hymen it is also quite possible
    for the hymen to be ruptured by falls and other accidents see
    eg a lengthy study by ninarodrigues des ruptures de lhymen
    dans les chutes annales dhygine publique september 1903
    on the other hand integrity of the hymen is no proof of
    virginity apart from the obvious fact that there may be
    intercourse without penetration the case has even been recorded
    of a prostitute with syphilitic condylomata a somewhat masculine
    type of pubic arch and vulva rather posteriorly placed whose
    hymen had never been penetrated the hymen may be of a yielding
    or folding type so that complete penetration may take place and
    yet the hymen be afterwards found unruptured it occasionally
    happens that the hymen is found intact at the end of pregnancy
    in some though not all of these cases there has been conception
    without intromission of the penis this has occurred even when
    the entrance was very minute the possibility of such conception
    has long been recognized and schurig syllepsilogia 1731
    section i cap viii p 2 quotes ancient authors who have
    recorded cases for some typical modern cases see gurard
    centralblatt fr gynkologie no 15 1895 in one of whose
    cases the hymen of the pregnant woman scarcely admitted a hair
    also braun ib no 23 1895
the hymen has played a very definite and pronounced part in the social and
moral life of humanity until recently it has been more difficult to
decide what precise biological function it has exercised to ensure its
development and preservation sexual selection no doubt has worked in
its favor but that influence has been very limited and comparatively very
recent virginity is not usually of any value among peoples who are
entirely primitive indeed even in the classic civilization which we
inherit it is easy to show that the virgin and the admiration for
virginity are of late growth the virgin goddesses were not originally
virgins in our modern sense diana was the manybreasted patroness of
childbirth before she became the chaste and solitary huntress for the
earliest distinction would appear to have been simply between the woman
who was attached to a man and the woman who followed an earlier rule of
freedom and independence it was a later notion to suppose that the latter
woman was debarred from sexual intercourse we certainly must not seek the
origin of the hymen in sexual selection we must find it in natural
selection and here it might seem at first sight that we come upon a
contradiction in nature for nature is always devising contrivances to
secure the maximum amount of fertilization increase and multiply is so
obviously the command of nature that the hebrews with their usual
insight unhesitatingly dared to place it in the mouth of jehovah but the
hymen is a barrier to fertilization it has however always to be
remembered that as we rise in the zological scale and as the period of
gestation lengthens and the possible number of offspring is fewer it
becomes constantly more essential that fertilization shall be effective
rather than easy the fewer the progeny the more necessary it is that they
shall be vigorous enough to survive there can be little doubt that as
one or two writers have already suggested the hymen owes its development
to the fact that its influence is on the side of effective fertilization
it is an obstacle to the impregnation of the young female by immature
aged or feeble males the hymen is thus an anatomical expression of that
admiration of force which marks the female in her choice of a mate so
regarded it is an interesting example of the intimate manner in which
sexual selection is really based on natural selection sexual selection is
but the translation into psychic terms of a process which has already
found expression in the physical texture of the body
    it may be added that this interpretation of the biological
    function of the hymen is supported by the facts of its evolution
    it is unknown among the lower mammals with whom fertilization is
    easy gestation short and offspring numerous it only begins to
    appear among the higher mammals in whom reproduction is already
    beginning to take on the characters which become fully developed
    in man various authors have found traces of a rudimentary hymen
    not only in apes but in elephants horses donkeys bitches
    bears pigs hyenas and giraffes hyrtl op cit vol ii
    p 189 g gellhoen anatomy and development of the hymen

    species that the tendency to limitation of offspring is most
    marked combined at the same time with a greater aptitude for
    impregnation than exists among any lower mammals it is here
    therefore that a physical check is of most value and
    accordingly we find that in woman alone of all animals is the
    hymen fully developed

82 hyrtl states that the name labia was first used by haller in the
middle of the eighteenth century in his elements of physiology being
adopted by him from the greek poet erotion who gave these structures the
very obvious name cheilea lips but this seems to be a mistake for the
seventeenth century anatomists certainly used the name labia for these
parts
83 bergh tentatively suggests as regards the pubic hair that its
appearance may be due to the upright walk in man and the human position
during coitus the hair preventing irritation of the genitals from the
sweat pouring down from the body and protecting the skin from direct
friction in coitus in both these suggestions he was however long
previously anticipated by fabricius ab aquapendente the fanciful
suggestion of louis robinson that the pubic hair has developed in order to
enable the human infant to cling securely to his mother is very poorly
supported by facts and has not met with acceptance it may be mentioned
that as stated by ploss and bartels the women of the bismarck
archipelago whose pubic hair is very abundant use it as a kind of
handkerchief on which to clean their hands

significance american gyncologist september 1902 it is perhaps
noteworthy that bergh found that in 302 cases in which the nymph were of
unequal length in all but 24 the left was longer
92 it may be remarked that bergh believes that the nymph and indeed
the external genitals generally are congenitally more strongly developed
in libidinous persons and at the same time in brunettes while in public
prostitutes this is not usually the case which confirms the belief that
exalted sexual sensibility does not usually lead to prostitution he adds
that prostitution unless carried on for many years has little effect on
the shape of the external genitals
93 schurig muliebria 1729 section ii cap ii gives numerous
quotations on this point thus de graaf wrote in his book on the sexual
organs of women tales protuberanti nymph appellantur ea propter quod

serious effects of coitus
we have seen what the object of detumescence is and we have briefly
considered the organs and structures which are chiefly concerned in the
process we have now to inquire what are the actual phenomena which take
place during the act of detumescence
detumescence is normally linked closely to tumescence tumescence is the
piling on of the fuel detumescence is the leaping out of the devouring
flame whence is lighted the torch of life to be handed on from generation
to generation the whole process is double and yet single it is exactly
analogous to that by which a pile is driven into the earth by the raising
and then the letting go of a heavy weight which falls on to the head of
the pile in tumescence the organism is slowly wound up and force
accumulated in the act of detumescence the accumulated force is let go
and by its liberation the spermbearing instrument is driven home
courtship as we commonly term the process of tumescence which takes place
when a woman is first sexually approached by a man is usually a highly
prolonged process but it is always necessary to remember that every
repetition of the act of coitus to be normally and effectively carried
out on both sides demands a similar double process detumescence must be
preceded by an abbreviated courtship
this abbreviated courtship by which tumescence is secured or heightened in
the repetition of acts of coitus which have become familiar is mainly
tactile98 since the part of the man in coitus is more active and that
of the woman more passive the sexual sensitivity of the skin seems to be
more pronounced in women there are moreover regions of the surface of a
womans body where contact when sympathetic seems specially liable to
arouse erotic excitement such erogenous zones are often specially marked
in the breasts occasionally in the palm of the hand the nape of the
neck the lobule of the ear the little finger there is indeed perhaps
no part of the surface of the body which may not in some individuals at
some time become normally an erogenous zone in hysteria the erotic
excitability of these zones is sometimes very intense the lips are
however without doubt the most persistently and poignantly sensitive
region of the whole body outside the sphere of the sexual organs
themselves hence the significance of the kiss as a preliminary of
detumescence99
    the importance of the lips as a normal erogenous zone is shown by
    the experiments of gualino he applied a thread folded on itself
    several times to the lips thus stimulating them in a simple
    mechanical manner of 20 women between the ages of 18 and 35
    only 8 felt this as a merely mechanical operation 4 felt a
    vaguely erotic element in the proceeding 3 experienced a desire
    for coitus and in 5 there was actual sexual excitement with
    emission of mucus of 25 men between the ages of 20 and 30 in
    15 all sexual feeling was absent in 7 erotic ideas were
    suggested with congestion of the sexual organs without erection
    and in 3 there was the beginning of erection it should be added
    that both the women and the men in whom this sexual reflex was
    more especially marked were of somewhat nervous temperament in
    such persons erotic reactions of all kinds generally occur most

as tumescence under the influence of sensory stimulation proceeds toward
the climax when it gives place to detumescence the physical phenomena
become more and more acutely localized in the sexual organs the process
which was at first predominantly nervous and psychic now becomes more
prominently vascular the ancient sexual relationship of the skin asserts
itself there is marked surface congestion showing itself in various ways
the face tends to become red and exactly the same phenomenon is taking
place in the genital organs an erection it has been said is a
blushing of the penis the difference is that in the genital organs this
heightened vascularity has a definite and specific function to
accomplishthe erection of the male organ which fits it to enter the
female partsand that consequently there has been developed in the penis
that special kind of vascular mechanism consisting of veins in connective
tissue with unstriped muscular fibers termed erectile tissue100
it is not only the man who is supplied with erectile tissue which in the
process of tumescence becomes congested and swollen the woman also in
the corresponding external genital region is likewise supplied with
erectile tissue now also charged with blood and exhibits the same changes
as have taken place in her partner though less conspicuously visible in
the anthropoid apes as the gorilla the large clitoris and the nymph
become prominent in sexual excitement but the less development of the
clitoris in women together with the specifically human evolution of the
mons veneris and larger lips renders this sexual turgescence practically
invisible though it is perceptible to touch in an increased degree of
spongy and elastic tension the whole feminine genital canal including
the uterus indeed is richly supplied with bloodvessels and is capable
during sexual excitement of a very high degree of turgescence a kind of
erection
the process of erection in woman is accompanied by the pouring out of
fluid which copiously bathes all parts of the vulva around the entrance to
the vagina this is a bland more or less odorless mucus which under
ordinary circumstances slowly and imperceptibly suffuses the parts when
however the entrance to the vagina is exposed and extended as during a
gyncological examination which occasionally produces sexual excitement
there may be seen a real ejaculation of the fluid which as usually
described comes largely from the glands of bartholin situated at the
mouth of the vagina under these circumstances it is sometimes described
as being emitted in a jet which is thrown to a distance101 this mucous
ejaculation was in former days regarded as analogous to the seminal
ejaculation in man and hence essential to conception although this
belief was erroneous the fluid poured out in this manner whenever a high
degree of tumescence is attained and before the onset of detumescence
certainly performs an important function in lubricating the entrance to
the genital canal and so facilitating the intromission of the male
organ102 menstruation has a similar influence in facilitating coitus
as schurig long since pointed out103 a like process takes place during
parturition when the same parts are being lubricated and stretched in
preparation for the protrusion of the foetal head the occurrence of the
mucous flow in tumescence always indicates that that process is actively
affecting the central sexual organs and that voluptuous emotions are
present104
    the secretions of the genital canal and outlet in women are
    somewhat numerous we have the odoriferous glands of sebaceous
    origin and with them the prepuce of the clitoris which has been
    described as a kind of gigantic sebaceous follicle with the
    clitoris occupying its interior hyrtl there is the secretion
    from the glands of bartholin there is again the vaginal
    secretion opaque and albuminous which appears to be alkaline
    when secreted but becomes acid under the decomposing influence
    of bacteria which are however harmless and not pathogenic
    gow obstetrical society of london january 3 1894 there
    is finally the mucous uterine secretion which is alkaline
    and being poured out during orgasm is believed to protect the
    spermatozoa from destruction by the acid vaginal secretion
    the belief that the mucus poured out in women during sexual
    excitement is feminine semen and therefore essential to
    conception had many remarkable consequences and was widespread
    until the seventeenth century thus in the chapter de modo
    coeundi et de regimine eorum qui coeunt of de secretis
    mulierum there is insistence on the importance of the proper
    mixture of the male semen with the female semen and of arranging
    that it shall not escape from the vagina the woman must lie
    quiet for several hours at least not rising even to urinate and
    when she gets up be very temperate in eating and drinking and
    not run or jump pretending that she has a headache it was the
    belief in feminine semen which led some theologians to lay down
    that a woman might masturbate if she had not experienced orgasm
    in coitus schurig in his muliebria 1729 pp 159 et seq
    discusses the opinions of old authors regarding the nature
    source and uses of the female genital secretions and quotes
    authorities against the old view that it was female semen in a
    subsequent work syllepsilogia 1731 pp 3 et seq he
    returns to the same question quotes authors who accept a
    feminine semen shows that harvey denied it any significance and
    himself decides against it it has not seriously been brought
    forward since
when erection is completed in both the man and the woman the conditions
necessary for conjugation have at last been fulfilled in all animals
even those most nearly allied to man coitus is effected by the male
approaching the female posteriorly in man the normal method of male
approach is anteriorly face to face leonardo da vinci in a wellknown
drawing representing a sagittal section of a man and a woman connected in
this position of socalled venus obversa has shown how well adapted the
position is to the normal position of the organs in the human
species105
    among monkeys it is stated congress is sometimes performed when
    the female is on all fours at other times the male brings the
    female between his thighs when he is sitting holding her with
    his forepaws froriep informed lawrence that the male sometimes
    supported his feet on the females calves sir w lawrence

    the anterior position in coitus with the female partner lying
    supine is so widespread throughout the world that it may fairly
    be termed the most typically human attitude in sexual congress
    it is found represented in egyptian graves at benihassan
    belonging to the twelfth dynasty it is regarded by mohammedans
    as the normal position although other positions are permitted by
    the prophet your wives are your tillage go in unto your
    tillage in what manner soever you will it is that adopted in
    malacca it appears from peruvian antiquities to have been the
    position generally though not exclusively adopted in ancient
    peru it is found in many parts of africa and seems also to have
    been the most usual position among the american aborigines
    various modifications of this position are however found thus
    in some parts of the world as among the suahelis in zanzibar
    the male partner adopts the supine position in loango according
    to pechuelloesche coitus is performed lying on the side
    sometimes as on the west coast of africa the woman is supine
    and the man more or less erect or as among the queenslanders
    as described by roth the woman is supine and the man squats on
    his heels with her thighs clasping his flanks while he raises
    her buttocks with his hands
    the position of coitus in which the man is supine is without
    doubt a natural and frequent variation of the specifically human
    obverse method of coitus it was evidently familiar to the
    romans ovid mentions it ars amatoria iii 7778
    recommending it to little women and saying that andromache was
    too tall to practice it with hector aristophanes refers to it
    and there are greek epigrams in which women boast of their skill
    in riding their lovers it has sometimes been viewed with a
    certain disfavor because it seems to confer a superiority on the
    woman cursed be he according to a mohammedan saying who
    maketh woman heaven and man earth
    of special interest is the wide prevalence of an attitude in
    coitus recalling that which prevails among quadrupeds the
    frequency with which on the walls of pompeii coitus is
    represented with the woman bending forward and her partner
    approaching her posteriorly has led to the belief that this
    attitude was formerly very common in southern italy however that
    may be it is certainly normal at the present day among various
    more or less primitive peoples in whom the vulva is often placed
    somewhat posteriorly it is thus among the soudanese as also in
    an altogether different part of the world among the eskimo
    innuit and koniags the new caledonians according to foley
    cohabit in the quadrupedal manner and so also the papuans of new
    guinea bongu according to vahness the same custom is also
    found in australia where however other postures are also
    adopted in europe the quadrupedal posture would seem to prevail
    among some of the south slavs notably the dalmatians the
    different methods of coitus practiced by the south slavs are
    described in kryptadia vol vi pp 220 et seq
    this method of coitus was recommended by lucretius lib iv and
    also advised by paulus ginetus as favorable to conception the
    opinions of various early physicians are quoted by schurig
    spermatologia 1720 pp 232 et seq it seems to be a
    position that is not infrequently agreeable to women a fact
    which may be brought into connection with the remarks of adler
    already quoted p 131 concerning the comparative lack of
    adjustment of the feminine organs to the obverse position it is
    noteworthy that in the days of witchcraft hysterical women
    constantly believed that they had had intercourse with the devil
    in this manner this circumstance indeed probably aided in the
    very marked disfavor in which coitus a posteriori fell after
    the decay of classic influences the medival physicians
    described it as mos diabolicus and mistakenly supposed that it
    produced abortion hyrtl op cit vol ii p 87 the
    theologians needless to say were opposed to the mos
    diabolicus and already in the anglosaxon penitential of
    theodore at the end of the seventh century 40 days penance is
    prescribed for this method of coitus
    from the frequency with which they have been adopted by various
    peoples as national customs most of the postures in coitus here
    referred to must be said to come within the normal range of
    variation it is a mistake to regard them as vicious perversions
up to the point to which we have so far considered it the process of
detumescence has been mainly nervous and vascular in character it has in
fact been but the more acute stage of a process which has been going on
throughout tumescence but now we reach the point at which a new element
comes in muscular action with the onset of muscular action which is
mainly involuntary even when it affects the voluntary muscles
detumescence proper begins to take place henceforward purposeful psychic
action except by an effort is virtually abolished the individual as a
separate person tends to disappear he has become one with another
person as nearly one as the conditions of existence ever permit he and
she are now merely an instrument in the hands of a higher powerby
whatever name we may choose to call that powerwhich is using them for an
end not themselves
the decisive moment in the production of the instinctive and involuntary
orgasm occurs when under the influence of the stimulus applied to the
penis by friction with the vagina the tension of the seminal fluid poured
into the urethra arouses the ejaculatory center in the spinal cord and the
bulbocavernosus muscle surrounding the urethra responsively contracts in
rhythmic spasms then it is that ejaculation occurs106
the circulation quickens the arteries beat strongly wrote roubaud in a
description of the physical state during coitus which may almost be termed
classic the venous blood arrested by muscular contraction increases
the general heat and this stagnation more pronounced in the brain by the
contraction of the muscles of the neck and the throwing of the head
backward causes a momentary cerebral congestion during which
intelligence is lost and the faculties abolished the eyes violently
injected become haggard and the look uncertain or in the majority of
cases the eyes are closed spasmodically to avoid the contact of the
light the respiration is hurried sometimes interrupted and may be
suspended by the spasmodic contraction of the larynx and the air for a
time compressed is at last emitted in broken and meaningless words the
congested nervous centers only communicate confused sensations and
volitions mobility and sensation show extreme disorder the limbs are
seized by convulsions and sometimes by cramps or are thrown wildly about
or become stiff like iron bars the jaws tightly pressed grind the
teeth and in some persons the delirium is carried so far that they bite
to bleeding the shoulders their companions have imprudently abandoned to
them this frantic state of epilepsy lasts but a short time but it
suffices to exhaust the forces of the organism especially in man it is
i believe galen who said omne animal post coitum triste prter
mulierem gallumque107 most of the elements that make up this typical
picture of the state of coitus are not absolutely essential to that state
but they all come within the normal range of variation there can be no
doubt that this range is considerable there would appear to be not only
individual but also racial differences there is a remarkable passage in
vatsyayanas kama sutra describing the varying behavior of the women of
different races in india under the stress of sexual excitementdravidian
women with difficulty attaining erethism women of the punjaub fond of
being caressed with the tongue women of oude with impetuous desire and
profuse flow of mucus etcand it is highly probable ploss and bartels
remark that these characterizations are founded on exact
observations108
the various phenomena included in roubauds description of the condition
during coitus may all be directly or indirectly reduced to two groups the
first circulatory and respiratory the second motor it is necessary to
consider both these aspects of the process of detumescence in somewhat
greater detail although while it is most convenient to discuss them
separately it must be borne in mind that they are not really separable
the circulatory phenomena are in large measure a byproduct of the
involuntary motor process
with the approach of detumescence the respiration becomes shallow rapid
and to some extent arrested this characteristic of the breathing during
sexual excitement is well recognized so that in for instance the
arabian nights it is commonly noted of women when gazing at beautiful
youths whose love they desired that they ceased breathing109 it may be
added that exactly the same tendency to superficial and arrested
respiration takes place whenever there is any intense mental
concentration as in severe intellectual work110
the arrest of respiration tends to render the blood venous and thus aids
in stimulating the vasomotor centers raising the bloodpressure in the
body generally and especially in the erectile tissues high
bloodpressure is one of the most marked features of the state of
detumescence the heart beats are stronger and quicker the surface
arteries are more visible the conjunctiv become red the precise degree
of bloodpressure attained during coitus has been most accurately
ascertained in the dog in bechterews laboratory in st petersburg a
manometer was introduced into the central end of the carotid artery of a
bitch a male dog was then introduced and during coitus observations were
made on the bloodpressure at the peripheral and central ends of the
artery it was found that there was a great general elevation of
bloodpressure intense hypermia of the brain rapid alternations during
the act of vasoconstriction and vasodilatation of the brain with
increase and diminution of the general arterial tension in relation with
the various phases of the act the greatest cerebral vasodilatation and
hypermia coinciding with the moment following the intromission of the
penis the end of the act is followed by a considerable fall in the
bloodpressure111 i am not acquainted with any precise observations on
the bloodpressure in human subjects during detumescence and there are
obvious difficulties in the way of such observations it is probable
however that the conditions found would be substantially the same this
is indicated so far as the very marked increase of bloodpressure is
concerned by some observations made by vaschide and vurpas with the
sphygmanometer on a lady under the influence of sexual excitement in this
case there was a relationship of sympathy and friendly tenderness between
the experimenter and the subject madame x aged 25 experimenter and
subject talked sympathetically and finally we are told while the latter
still had her hands in the sphygmanometer the former almost made a
declaration of love madame x was greatly impressed and afterward
admitted that her emotions had been genuine and strong the
bloodpressure which was in this subject habitually 65 millimeters rose
to 150 and even 160 indicating a very high pressure which rarely occurs
at the same time madame x looked very emotional and troubled112
    some authorities are of opinion that irregularities in the
    accomplishment of the sexual act are specially liable to cause
    disturbances in the circulation thus kisch of prague refers to
    the case of a couple practising coitus interruptusthe husband
    withdrawing before ejaculationin which the wife a vigorous
    woman became liable after some years to attacks termed by kisch
    neurasthenia cordis vasomotoria in which there was at daily or
    longer intervals palpitation with feelings of anxiety headache
    dizziness muscular weakness and tendency to faint he regards
    coitus as a cause of various heart troubles in women 1 attacks
    of tachycardia in very excitable and sexually inclined women 2
    attacks of tachycardia with dyspnoea in young women with
    vaginismus 3 cardiac symptoms with lowered vascular tone in
    women who for a long time have practised coitus interruptus
    without complete sexual gratification kisch herzbeschwerden
    der frauen verursacht durch den cohabitationsact mnchener
    medizinisches wochenschrift 1897 p 617 in this connection
    also reference may probably be made to those attacks of anxiety
    which freud associates with psychic sexual lesions of an
    emotional character
associated with this vascular activity in detumescence we find a general
tendency to glandular activity various secretions are formed abundantly
perspiration is copious and the ancient relationship between the
cutaneous and sexual systems seems to evoke a general activity of the skin
and its odoriferous secretions salivation which also occurs is very
conspicuous in many lower animals as for instance in the donkey notably
the female who just before coitus stands with mouth open jaws moving
and saliva dribbling in men corresponding to the more copious secretion
in women there is during the latter stages of tumescence a slight
secretion of mucusfrbringers urethrorrhoea ex libidinewhich
appears in drops at the urethral orifice it comes from the small glands
of littr and cowper which open into the urethra this phenomenon was well
known to the old theologians who called it distillatio and realized
its significance as at once distinct from semen and an indication that the
mind was dwelling on voluptuous images it was also known in classic
times113 more recently it has often been confused with semen and has
thus sometimes caused needless anxiety to nervous persons there is also
an increased secretion of urine and it is probable that if the viscera
were more accessible to observation we might be able to demonstrate that
the glands throughout the body share in this increased activity
the phenomena of detumescence culminate however and have their most
obvious manifestation in motor activity the genital act as vaschide and
vurpas remark consists essentially in a more and more marked tension of
the motor state which reaching its maximum presents a short tonic phase
followed by a clonic phase and terminates in a period of adynamia and
repose this motor activity is of the essence of the impulse of
detumescence because without it the sperm cells could not be brought into
the neighborhood of the germ cell and be propelled into the organic nest
which is assigned for their conjunction and incubation
the motor activity is general as well as specifically sexual there is a
general tendency to more or less involuntary movement without any
increase of voluntary muscular power which is indeed decreased and
vaschide and vurpas state that dynamometric results are somewhat lower
than normal during sexual excitement and the variations greater114 the
tendency to diffused activity of involuntary muscle is well illustrated by
the contraction of the bladder associated with detumescence while this
occurs in both sexes in men erection produces a mechanical impediment to
any evacuation of the bladder in women there is not only a desire to
urinate but occasionally actual urination many quite healthy and normal
women have as a rare accident supervening on the coincidence of an
unusually full bladder with an unusual degree of sexual excitement
experienced a powerful and quite involuntary evacuation of the bladder at
the moment of orgasm in women with less normal nervous systems this has
more rarely been almost habitual brantme has perhaps recorded the
earliest case of this kind in referring to a lady he knew who quand on
lui faisait cela elle se compissait  bon escient115 the tendency to
trembling constriction of throat sneezing emission of internal gas and
the other similar phenomena occasionally associated with detumescence are
likewise due to diffusion of the motor disturbance even in infancy the
motor signs of sexual excitement are the most obvious indications of
orgasm thus west describing masturbation in a child of six or nine
months who practiced thighrubbing states that when sitting in her high
chair she would grasp the handles stiffen herself and stare rubbing her
thighs quickly together several times and then come to herself with a
sigh tired relaxed and sweating these seizures which lasted one or
two minutes being mistaken by the relations for epileptic fits116
    the essentially motor character of detumescence is well shown by
    the extreme forms of erotic intoxication which sometimes appear
    as the result of sexual excitement fr who has especially
    called attention to the various manifestations of this condition
    presents an instructive case of a man of neurotic heredity and
    antecedents in whom it occasionally happened that sexual
    excitement instead of culminating in the normal orgasm attained
    its climax in a fit of uncontrollable muscular excitement he
    would then sing dance gesticulate roughly treat his partner
    break the objects around him and finally sink down exhausted and
    stupefied fr linstinct sexuel chapter x in such a case
    a diffused and general detumescence has taken the place of the
    normal detumescence which has its main focus in the sexual
    sphere
    the same relationship is shown in a case of impotence accompanied
    by cramps in the calves and elsewhere which has been recorded by
    brgelmann zur lehre vom perversen sexualismus zeitschrift
    fr hypnotismus 1900 heft i these muscular conditions ceased
    for several days whenever coitus was effected
    an instructive analogy to the motor irradiations preceding the
    moment of sexual detumescence may be found in the somewhat
    similar motor irradiations which follow the delayed expulsion of
    a highly distended bladder these sometimes become very marked in
    a child or young woman unable to control the motor system
    absolutely the legs are crossed the foot swung the thighs
    tightly pressed together the toes curled the fingers are flexed
    in rhythmic succession the whole body slowly twists as though
    the seat had become uncomfortable it is difficult to concentrate
    the mind the same remark may be automatically repeated the eyes
    search restlessly and there is a tendency to count surrounding
    objects or patterns when the extreme degree of tension is
    reached it is only by executing a kind of dance that the
    explosive contraction of the bladder is restrained
    the picture of muscular irradiation presented under these
    circumstances differs but slightly from that of the onset of
    detumescence in one case the explosion is sought in the other
    case it is dreaded but in both cases there is a retarded
    muscular tensionin the one case involuntary in the other case
    voluntarymaintained at a point of acute intensity and in both
    cases the muscular irradiations of this tension spread over the
    whole body
    the increased motor irritability of the state of detumescence
    somewhat resembles the conditions produced by a weak ansthetic
    and there is some interest in noting the sexual excitement liable
    to occur in ansthesia i am indebted to dr jfw silk for some
    remarks on this point
    i sexual emotions may apparently be aroused during the stage of
    excitement preceding or following the administration of any
    ansthetic these emotions may take the form of mere delirious
    utterances or may be associated with what is apparently a sexual
    orgasm or reflex phenomena connected with the sexual organs may
    occasionally be observed under special circumstances or to put
    it in another way such reflex possibilities are not always
    abolished by the condition of narcosis or ansthesia
    ii of the particular ansthetics employed i am inclined to
    think that the possibility of such conditions arising is
    inversely proportionate to their strength eg they are more
    frequently observed with a weak ansthetic like nitrous oxide
    than with chloroform
    iii sexual emotions i believe to be rarely observable in men
    and this is remarkable or i should say particularly
    noticeable for the presence of nurses female students etc
    might almost have led one to expect that the contrary would have
    been the case on the other hand it is among men that i have
    frequently observed a reflex phenomenon which has usually taken
    the shape of an erection of the penis when the structures in the
    neighborhood of the spermatic cord have been handled
    iv among females the emotional sexual phenomena most frequently
    obtrude themselves and i believe that if it were possible to
    induce people to relate their dreams they would very often be
    found to be of a sexual character
much more important than the general motor phenomena more purposive
though involuntary are the specifically sexual muscular movements from
the very beginning of detumescence indeed muscular activity makes itself
felt and the peripheral muscles of sex act according to kobelts
expression as a peripheral sexual heart in the male these movements are
fairly obvious and fairly simple it is required that the semen should be
expressed from the vesicul seminales propelled along the urethra in
combination with the prostatic fluid which is equally essential and
finally ejected with a certain amount of force from the urethral orifice
under the influence of the stimulation furnished by the contact and
friction of the vagina this process is effectively carried out mainly by
the rhythmic contractions of the bulbocavernosus muscle and the semen is
emitted in a jet which may be ejaculated to a distance varying from a few
centimeters to a meter or more
    with regard to the details of the psychic sides of this process a
    correspondent a psychologist writes as follows
    i have never noticed in my reading any attempt to analyze the
    sensations which accompany the orgasm and as i have made a good
    many attempts to make such an analysis myself i will append the
    results on the chance that they may be of some value i have
    checked my results so far as possible by comparing them with the
    experience of such of my friends as had coitus frequently and
    were willing to tell me as much as they could of the psychology
    of the process
    the first fact that i hit upon was the importance of pressure
    as one of my informants picturesquely phrases itthe tighter
    the fit the greater the pleasure this agrees too with their
    unanimous testimony that the pleasurable sensations were much
    greater when the orgasm occurred simultaneously in the man and
    woman their analysis seldom went further than this but a few
    remarked that the distinctive sensations accompanying the orgasm
    seem to begin near the root of the penis or in the testes and
    that they are qualitatively different from the tickling
    sensations which precede them
    these tickling sensations are caused i think by the friction
    of the glands against the vaginal walls and are supplemented by
    other sensations from the urethra whose nerves are stimulated by
    pressure of the vaginal walls and sphincter the specific
    sensation of the orgasm begins i believe with a strong
    contraction of the muscles of the urethral walls along the entire
    length of the canal and is felt as a peculiar ache starting
    from the base of the penis and quickly becoming diffused through
    the whole organ this sensation reaches its climax with the
    expulsion of the semen into the urethra and the consequent
    feeling of distention which is instantly followed by the
    rhythmic peristaltic contractions of the urethral muscles which
    mark the climax of the orgasm
    the most careful introspection possible under the circumstances
    seems to show that these sensations arise almost wholly from the
    urethra and in a far less degree from the corona during periods
    of great sexual excitement the nerves of the urethra and corona
    seem to possess a peculiar sensitivity and are powerfully
    stimulated by the violent peristaltic contractions of the muscles
    in the urethral walls during ejaculation it seems possible that
    the intensity and volume of sensation felt at the glans may be
    due in part to the greater area of sensitive surface presented in
    the fossa as well as to the sensitivity of the corona and in
    part to the fact that during the orgasm the glans is more highly
    congested than at any other time and the nerve endings thus
    subjected to additional pressure
    if the foregoing statements are true it is easy to see why the
    pleasure of the man is much increased when the orgasm occurs at
    the same time in his partner and himself for the contractions of
    the vagina upon the penis would increase the stimulation of all
    the nerve endings in that organ for which a mechanical stimulus
    is adequate and the prominence of the corpus spongiosum and
    corona would ensure them the greatest stimulation it seems not
    improbable that the specific sensation of orgasm rises from the
    stimulation of the peculiar form of nerve endbulbs which krause
    found in the corpus spongiosum and in the glans
    the characteristic massiveness of the experience is probably due
    largely to the great number of sensations of strain and pressure
    caused by the powerful reflex contraction of so many of the
    voluntary muscles
    of course the foregoing analysis is purely tentative and i
    offer it only on the chance that it may suggest some line of
    inquiry which may lead to results of value to the student of
    sexual psychology
    in man the whole process of detumescence when it has once really
    begun only occupies a few moments it is so likewise in many
    animals in the genera bos ovis etc it is very short almost
    instantaneous and rather short also in the equid in a vigorous
    stallion according to colin ten to twelve seconds as
    disselhorst has pointed out this is dependent on the fact that
    these animals like man possess a vas deferens which broadens
    into an ampulla serving as a receptacle which holds the semen
    ready for instant emission when required on the other hand in
    the dog cat boar and the canid felid and suid generally
    there is no receptacle of this kind and coitus is slow since a
    longer time is required for the peristaltic action of the vas to
    bring the semen to the urogenital sinus r disselhorst die

    in man there can be little doubt that detumescence is more
    rapidly accomplished in the european than in the east in india
    among the yellow races or in polynesia this is probably in part
    due to a deliberate attempt to prolong the act in the east and
    in part to a greater nervous erethism among westerns
in the woman the specifically sexual muscular process is less visible
more obscure more complex and uncertain before detumescence actually
begins there are at intervals involuntary rhythmic contractions of the
walls of the vagina seeming to have the object of at once stimulating and
harmonizing with those that are about to begin in the male organ it would
appear that these rhythmic contractions are the exaggeration of a
phenomenon which is normal just as slight contraction is normal and
constant in the bladder jastreboff has shown in the rabbit that the
vagina is in constant spontaneous rhythmic contraction from above
downward not peristaltic but in segments the intensity of the
contractions increasing with age and especially with sexual development
this vaginal contraction which in women only becomes well marked just
before detumescence and is due mainly to the action of the sphincter
cunni analogous to the bulbocavernosus in the male is only a part of
the localized muscular process at first there would appear to be a reflex
peristaltic movement of the fallopian tubes and uterus dembo observed
that in animals stimulation of the upper anterior wall of the vagina
caused gradual contraction of the uterus which is erected by powerful
contraction of its muscular fiber and round ligaments while at the same
time it descends toward the vagina its cavity becoming more and more
diminished and mucus being forced out in relaxing aristotle long ago
remarked it aspirates the seminal fluid
although the active participation of the sexual organs in woman to the
end of directing the semen into the womb at the moment of detumescence is
thus a very ancient belief and harmonizes with the greek view of the womb
as an animal in the body endowed with a considerable amount of
activity117 precise observation in modern times has offered but little
confirmation of the reality of this participation such observations as
have been made have usually been the accidental result of sexual
excitement and orgasm occurring during a gyncological examination as
however such a result is liable to occur in erotic subjects a certain
number of precise observations have accumulated during the past century
so far as the evidence goes it would seem that in women as in mares
bitches and other animals the uterus becomes shorter broader and
softer during the orgasm at the same time descending lower into the
pelvis with its mouth open intermittently so that as one writer
remarks spontaneously recurring to the simile which commended itself to
the greeks the uterus might be likened to an animal gasping for
breath118 this sensitive responsive mobility of the uterus is
indeed not confined to the moment of detumescence but may occur at other
times under the influence of sexual emotion
it would seem probable that in this erection contraction and descent of
the uterus and its simultaneous expulsion of mucus we have the decisive
moment in the completion of detumescence in woman and it is probable that
the thick mucus unlike the earlier more limpid secretion which women are
sometimes aware of after orgasm is emitted from the womb at this time
this is however not absolutely certain some authorities regard
detumescence in women as accomplished in the pouring out of secretions
others in the rhythmic genital contractions the sexual parts may
however be copiously bathed in mucus for an indefinitely long period
before the final stage of detumescence is achieved and the rhythmic
contractions are also taking place at a somewhat early period in neither
respect is there any obvious increase at the final moment of orgasm in
women this would seem to be more conspicuously a nervous manifestation
than in men on the subjective side it is very pronounced with its
feeling of relieved tension and agreeable reposea moment when as one
woman expresses it together with intense pleasure there is as it were
a floating up into a higher sphere like the beginning of chloroform
narcosisbut on the objective side this culminating moment is less easy
to define
    various observations and remarks made during the past two or
    three centuries by bond valisneri dionis haller gnther and
    bischoff tending to show a sucking action of the uterus in both
    women and other female animals have been brought together by
    litzmann in r wagners handwrterbuch der physiologie 1846
    vol iii p 53 litzmann added an experience of his own i had
    an opportunity lately while examining a young and very erethic
    woman to observe how suddenly the uterus assumed a more erect
    position and descended deeper in the pelvis the lips of the
    womb became equal in length the cervix rounded softer and more
    easily reached by the finger and at the same time a high state
    of sexual excitement was revealed by the respiration and voice
    the general belief still remained however that the womans part
    in conjugation is passive and that it is entirely by the energy
    of the male organ and of the male sexual elements the
    spermatozoa that conjunction with the germ cell is attained
    according to this theory it was believed that the spermatozoa
    were as wilkinson expresses it in a history of opinion on this
    question endowed with some sort of intuition or instinct that
    they would turn in the direction of the os uteri wading through
    the acid mucus of the vagina travel patiently upward and around
    the vaginal portion of the uterus enter the uterus and proceed
    onward in search of the waiting ovum ad wilkinson
    sterility in the female transactions of the lincoln medical
    society nebraska 1896
    about the year 1859 fichstedt seems to have done something to
    overthrow this theory by declaring his belief that the uterus was
    not as commonly supposed a passive organ in coitus but was
    capable of sucking in the semen during the brief period of
    detumescence various authorities then began to bring forward
    arguments and observations in the same sense wernich
    especially directed attention to this point in 1872 in a paper
    on the erectile properties of the lower segment of the uterus
    die erectionsfahigkeit des untern uterusabschnitts beitrge
    zur geburtshlfe und gynkologie vol i p 296 he made
    precise observations and came to the conclusion that owing to
    erectile properties in the neck of the uterus this part of the
    womb elongates during congress and reaches down into the pelvis
    with an aspiratory movement as if to meet the glans of the male
    a little later in a case of partial prolapse beck in ignorance
    of wernichs theory was enabled to make a very precise
    observation of the action of the uterus during excitement in
    this case the woman was sexually very excitable even under
    ordinary examination and beck carefully noted the phenomena that
    took place during the orgasm the os and cervix uteri he
    states had been about as firm as usual moderately hard and
    generally speaking in a natural and normal condition with the
    external os closed to such an extent as to admit of the uterine
    probe with difficulty but the instant that the height of
    excitement was at hand the os opened itself to the extent of
    fully an inch as nearly as my eye can judge made five or six
    successive gasps as if it were drawing the external os into the
    cervix each time powerfully and it seemed to me with a
    regular rhythmical action at the same time losing its former
    density and hardness and becoming quite soft to the touch upon
    the cessation of the action as related the os suddenly closed
    the cervix again hardened itself and the intense congestion was
    dissipated jr beck how do the spermatozoa enter the
    uterus american journal of obstetrics 1874 it would appear
    that in the early part of this final process of detumescence the
    action of the uterus is mainly one of contraction and ejaculation
    of any mucus that may be contained dr paul mund has described
    the gushing almost in jets of this mucus which he has
    observed in an erotic woman under a rather long digital and
    specular examination american journal of obstetrics 1893
    it is during the latter part of detumescence it would seem and
    perhaps for a short time after the orgasm is over that the
    action of the uterus is mainly aspiratory
while the active part played by the womb in detumescence can no longer be
questioned it need not too hastily be assumed that the belief in the
active movements of the spermatozoa must therefore be denied the vigorous
motility of the tadpolelike organisms is obvious to anyone who has ever
seen fresh semen under the microscope and if it is correct as clifton
edgar states that the spermatozoa may retain their full activity in the
female organs for at least seventeen days they have ample time to exert
their energies the fact that impregnation sometimes occurs without
rupture of the hymen is not decisive evidence that there has been no
penetration as the hymen may dilate without rupturing but there seems no
reason to doubt that conception has sometimes taken place when ejaculation
has occurred without penetration this is indicated in a fairly objective
manner when as has been occasionally observed conception has occurred in
women whose vaginas were so narrow as scarcely to admit the entrance of a
goosequill such was the condition in the case of a pregnant woman
brought forward by roubaud the stories repeated in various books of
women who have conceived after homosexual relations with partners who had
just left their husbands beds are not therefore inherently
impossible119 janke quotes numerous cases in which there has been
impregnation in virgins who have merely allowed the penis to be placed in
contact with the vulva the hymen remaining unruptured until
delivery120
it must be added however that even if the semen is effused merely at the
mouth of the vagina without actual penetration the spermatozoa are still
not entirely without any resource save their own motility in the task of
reaching the ovum as we have seen it is not only the uterus which takes
an active part in detumescence the vagina also is in active movement and
it seems highly probable that at all events in some women and under some
circumstances such movement favoring aspiration toward the womb may be
communicated to the external mouth of the vagina
    riolan anthropographia 1626 p 294 referred to the
    constriction and dilation of the vulva under the influence of
    sexual excitement it is said that in abyssinia women can when
    adopting the straddling posture of coitus by the movements of
    their own vaginal muscles alone grasp the male organ and cause
    ejaculation although the man remains passive according to
    lorion the annamites adopting the normal posture of coitus
    introduce the penis when flaccid or only half erect the
    contraction of the vaginal walls completing the process the
    penis is very small in this people it is recognized by
    gyncologists that the condition of vaginismus in which there is
    spasmodic contraction of the vagina making intercourse painful
    or impossible is but a morbid exaggeration of the normal
    contraction which occurs in sexual excitement even in the
    absence of sexual excitement there is a vague affection
    occurring in both married and unmarried women and not it would
    seem necessarily hysterical characterized by quivering or
    twitching of the vulva i am told that this is popularly termed
    flackering of the shape in yorkshire and taittering of the
    lips in ireland it may be added that quivering of the gluteal
    muscles also takes place during detumescence and that in indian
    medicine this is likewise regarded as a sign of sexual desire in
    women apart from coitus
    a nonmedical correspondent in australia wj chidley from whom
    i have received many communications on this subject is strongly
    of opinion from his own observations that not only does the
    uterus take an active part in coitus but that under natural
    conditions the vagina also plays an active part in the process
    he was led to suspect such an action many years ago as well by
    an experience of his own as also by hearing from a young woman
    who met her lover after a long absence that by the excitement
    thus aroused a tape attached to the underclothes had been drawn
    into the vagina since then the confidences of various friends
    together with observations of animals have confirmed him in the
    view that the general belief that coitus must be effected by
    forcible entry of the male organ into a passive vagina is
    incorrect he considers that under normal circumstances coitus
    should take place but rarely and then only under the most
    favorable circumstances perhaps exclusively in spring and most
    especially only when the woman is ready for it then when in
    the arms of the man she loves the vagina in sympathy with the
    active movements of the womb becomes distended at the touch of
    the turgescent but not fully erect penis flashes open and
    draws in the male organ all animals he adds have sexual
    intercourse by the male organ being drawn not forced into the
    female i have been borne out in this by friends who have seen
    horses camels mules and other large animals in the coupling
    season what is more absurd for instance than to say that an
    entire penetrates the mare his penis is a sensitive beautiful
    piece of mechanism which brings its light head here and there
    till it touches the right spot when the mare if ready takes
    it in an entires penis could not penetrate anything it is a
    curve a beautiful curve which would easily bend a bulls
    again is turned down at the end and more palpably still would
    fold on itself if pressed with force the womb and vagina of a
    beautiful and healthy woman constitute a living vital moving
    organ sensitive to a look a word a thought a hand on the
    waist
    a wellknown american author thus writes in confirmation of the
    foregoing view in nature the woman wooes when impassioned her
    vagina becomes erect and dilated and so lubricated with abundant
    mucus to the lips that entrance is easy this dilatation and
    erectile expansion of vagina withdraws the hymen so close to the
    walls that penetration need not tear it or cause pain the more
    muscular primitive and healthy the woman the tougher and less
    sensitive the hymen and the less likely to break or bleed i
    think one great function of the foreskin also is to moisten the
    glans so that it can be lubricated for entrance and then to
    retract moist side out to make entrance still easier i think
    that in nature the glans penetrates within the labia is
    withstood a moment vibrating and then all resistance is
    withdrawn by a sudden flashing open of the gates permitting
    easy entrance and that the sudden giving up of resistance and
    substitution of welcome with its instantaneous deep entrance
    causes an almost immediate male orgasm the thrill being
    irresistibly exciting certainly this is the process as observed
    in horses cattle goats etc and it seems likely something
    analogous is natural in man
    while it is easily possible to carry to excess a view which would
    make the woman rather than the man the active agent in coitus
    and it may be recalled that in the cebid the penis as also the
    clitoris is furnished with a bone there is probably an element
    of truth in the belief that the vagina shares in the active part
    which there can now be little doubt is played by the uterus in
    detumescence such a view certainly enables us to understand how
    it is that semen effused on the exterior sexual organs can be
    conveyed to the uterus
    it was indeed the failure to understand the vital activity of the
    semen and the feminine genital canal cooperating together
    towards the junction of sperm cell and germ cell which for so
    long stood in the way of the proper understanding of conception
    even the genius of harvey which had grappled successfully with
    the problem of the circulation failed in the attempt to
    comprehend the problem of generation mainly on account of this
    difficulty he was unable to see how the male element could
    possibly enter the uterus although he devoted much observation
    and study to the question writing of the uterus of the doe after
    copulation he says i began to doubt to ask myself whether the
    semen of the male could by any possibility make its way by
    attraction or injection to the seat of conception and repeated
    examination led me to the conclusion that none of the semen
    reached this seat degeneratione animalium exercise lxvii
    the woman he finally concluded after contact with the
    spermatic fluid in coitu seems to receive an influence and
    become fecundated without the cooperation of any sensible
    corporeal agent in the same way as iron touched by the magnet is
    endowed with its powers
although the specifically sexual muscular process of detumescence in
womenas distinguished from the general muscular phenomena of sexual
excitement which may be fairly obviousis thus seen to be somewhat
complex and obscure in women as well as in men detumescence is a
convulsion which discharges a slowly accumulated store of nervous force
in women also as in men the motor discharge is directed to a specific
endthe intromission of the semen in the one sex its reception in the
other in both sexes the sexual orgasm and the pleasure and satisfaction
associated with it involve as their most essential element the motor
activity of the sexual sphere121
    the active cooperation of the female organs in detumescence is
    probably indicated by the difficulty which is experienced in
    achieving conception by the artificial injection of semen marion
    sims stated in 1866 in clinical notes on uterine surgery that
    in 55 injections in six women he had only once been successful
    he believed that that was the only case at that time on record
    jacobi had however practiced artificial fecundation in animals
    in 1700 and john hunter in man see gould and pyle anomalies
    and curiosities of medicine p 43 also janke die
    willkrliche hervorbringen des geschlechts pp 230 et seq who
    discusses the question of artificial fecundation and brings
    together a mass of data
the facial expression when tumescence is completed is marked by a high
degree of energy in men and of loveliness in women at this moment when
the culminating act of life is about to be accomplished the individual
thus reaches his supreme state of radiant beauty the color is heightened
the eyes are larger and brighter the facial muscles are more tense so
that in mature individuals any wrinkles disappear and youthfulness
returns
at the beginning of detumescence the features are frequently more
discomposed there is a general expression of eager receptivity to sensory
impressions the dilatation of the pupils the expansion of the nostrils
the tendency to salivation and to movements of the tongue all go to make
up a picture which indicates an approaching gratification of sensory
desires it is significant that in some animals there is at this moment
erection of the ears122 there is sometimes a tendency to utter broken
and meaningless words and it is noted that sometimes women have called
out on their mothers123 the dilatation of the pupils produces
photophobia and in the course of detumescence the eyes are frequently
closed from this cause at the beginning of sexual excitement vaschide
and vurpas have observed tonicity of the eyemuscles seems to increase
the elevators of the upper lids contract so that the eyes look larger and
their mobility and brightness are heightened with the increase of
muscular tonicity strabismus occurs owing to the greater strength of the
muscles that carry the eyes inward124
    the facial expression which marks the culmination of tumescence
    and the approach of detumescence is that which is generally
    expressive of joy in an interesting psychophysical study of the
    emotion of joy dearborn thus summarizes its characteristics
    the eyes are brighter and the upper eyelid elevated as also are
    the brows the skin over the glabella the upper lip and the
    corners of the mouth while the skin at the outer canthi of the
    eye is puckered the nostrils are moderately dilated the tongue
    slightly extended and the cheeks somewhat expanded while in
    persons with largely developed pinnal muscles the ears tend
    somewhat to incline forwards the whole arterial system is
    dilated with consequent blushing from this effect on the dermal
    capillaries of the face neck scalp and hands and sometimes
    more extensively even from the same cause the eyes slightly

    62 all these signs of joy appear to occur at some stage of the
    process of sexual excitement
    in some monkeys it would seem that the muscular movement which in
    man has become the smile is the characteristic facial expression
    of sexual tumescence or courtship discussing the facial
    expression of pleasure in children ss buckman has the
    following remarks there is one point in such expression which
    has not received due consideration namely the raising of lumps
    of flesh each side of the nose as an indication of pleasure
    accompanying this may be seen small furrows both in children and
    adults running from the eyes somewhat obliquely towards the
    nose what these characters indicate may be learned from the male
    mandril whose face particularly in the breeding season shows
    colored fleshy prominences each side of the nose with
    conspicuous furrows and ridges in the male mandril these
    characters have been developed because being an unmistakable
    sign of sexual ardor they gave the female particular evidence of
    sexual feelings thus such characters would come to be recognized
    as habitually symptomatic of pleasurable feelings finding
    similar features in human beings and particularly in children
    though not developed in the same degree we may assume that in
    our monkeylike ancestors facial characters similar to those of
    the mandril were developed though to a less extent and that
    they were symptomatic of pleasure because connected with the
    period of courtship then they became conventionalized as
    pleasurable symptoms ss buckmann human babies what they
    teach nature july 5 1900 if this view is accepted it may
    be said that the smile having in man become a generalized sign
    of amiability has no longer any special sexual significance it
    is true that a faint and involuntary smile is often associated
    with the later stages of tumescence but this is usually lost
    during detumescence and may even give place to an expression of
    ferocity
when we have realized how profound is the organic convulsion involved by
the process of detumescence and how great the general motor excitement
involved we can understand how it is that very serious effects may follow
coitus even in animals this is sometimes the case young bulls and
stallions have fallen in a faint after the first congress boars may be
seriously affected in a similar way mares have been known even to fall
dead125 in the human species and especially in menprobably as bryan
robinson remarks because women are protected by the greater slowness with
which detumescence occurs in themnot only death itself but innumerable
disorders and accidents have been known to follow immediately after
coitus these results being mainly due to the vascular and muscular
excitement involved by the processes of detumescence fainting vomiting
urination defcation have been noted as occurring in young men after a
first coitus epilepsy has been not infrequently recorded lesions of
various organs even rupture of the spleen have sometimes taken place in
men of mature age the arteries have at times been unable to resist the
high bloodpressure and cerebral hmorrhage with paralysis has occurred
in elderly men the excitement of intercourse with strange women has
sometimes caused death and various cases are known of eminent persons who
have thus died in the arms of young wives or of prostitutes126
these morbid results are however very exceptional they usually occur
in persons who are abnormally sensitive or who have imprudently
transgressed the obvious rules of sexual hygiene detumescence is so
profoundly natural a process it is so deeply and intimately a function of
the organism that it is frequently harmless even when the bodily
condition is far from absolutely sound its usual results under favorable
circumstances are entirely beneficial in men there normally supervenes
together with the relief from the prolonged tension of tumescence with
the muscular repose and falling bloodpressure127 a sense of profound
satisfaction a glow of diffused wellbeing128 perhaps an agreeable
lassitude occasionally also a sense of mental liberation from an
overmastering obsession under reasonably happy circumstances there is no
pain or exhaustion or sadness or emotional revulsion the happy lovers
attitude toward his partner is not expressed by the wellknown sonnet
cxxix of shakespeare
    past reason hunted and no sooner had
    past reason hated
he feels rather with boccaccio that the kissed mouth loses not its charm
    bocca baciata non perde ventura
in women the results of detumescence are the same except that the
tendency to lassitude is not marked unless the act has been several times
repeated there is a sensation of repose and selfassurance and often an
accession of free and joyous energy after completely satisfactory
detumescence she may experience a feeling as of intoxication lasting for
several hours an intoxication that is followed by no evil reaction
such so far as our present vague and imperfect knowledge extends are the
main features in the process of detumescence in the future without
doubt we shall learn to know more precisely a process which has been so
supremely important in the life of man and of his ancestors

here a connection between conditions of high bloodpressure with mental
and bodily depression and the act of masturbation for this act will
relieve those conditions and will tend to be practiced for this purpose

the germ cell never comes into the sphere of consciousness and cannot
therefore concern us in the psychological study of the phenomena of the
sexual instinct but it is otherwise with the sperm cell and the seminal
fluid has a relationship both direct and indirect to psychic phenomena
which it is now necessary to discuss
while the spermatozoa are formed in the glandular tissue of the testes
the seminal fluid as finally emitted in detumescence is not a purely
testicular product but is formed by mixture with the fluids poured out at
or before detumescence by various glands which open into the urethra and
notably the prostate129 this is a purely sexual gland which in animals
only becomes large and active during the breeding season and may even be
hardly distinguishable at other times moreover if the testes are removed
in infancy the prostate remains rudimentary so that during recent years
removal of the testes has been widely advocated and practiced for that
hypertrophy of the prostate which is sometimes a distressing ailment of
old age it is the prostatic fluid according to frbringer which imparts
its characteristic odor to semen it appears however to be the main
function of the prostatic fluid to arouse and maintain the motility of the
spermatozoa before meeting the prostatic fluid the spermatozoa are
motionless that fluid seems to furnish a thinner medium in which they
for the first time gain their full vitality130
when at length the semen is ejaculated it contains various substances
which may be separated from it131 and possesses various qualities some
of which have only lately been investigated while others have evidently
been known to mankind from a very early period when held for some time
in the mouth remarked john hunter it produces a warmth similar to
spices which lasts some time132 possibly this fact first suggested
that semen might when ingested possess valuable stimulant qualities a
discovery which has been made by various savages notably by the
australian aborigines who in many parts of australia administer a
potion of semen to dying or feeble members of the tribe133 it is
perhaps noteworthy that in central africa the testes of the goat are
consumed as an aphrodisiac134 in eighteenth century europe schurig in
his spermatologia still found it necessary to discuss at considerable
length the possible medical properties of human semen giving many
prescriptions which contained it135 the stimulation produced by the
ingestion of semen would appear to form in some cases a part of the
attraction exerted by fellatio de sade emphasized this point and in a
case recorded by howard semen appears to have acted as a stimulant for
which the craving was as irresistible as is that for alcohol in
dipsomania136
    it must be remembered that the early history of this subject is
    more or less inextricably commingled with folklore practices of
    magical origin not necessarily founded on actual observation of
    the physiological effects of consuming the semen or testes thus
    according to wh pearse scalpel december 1897 it is the
    custom in cornwall for country maids to eat the testicles of the
    young male lambs when they are castrated in the spring the
    survival probably of a very ancient religious cult i have not
    myself been able to hear of this custom in cornwall in
    burchards penitential cap cliv wasserschleben op cit p
    660 seven years penance is assigned to the woman who swallows
    her husbands semen to make him love her more in the seventeenth
    century as shown in william salmons london dispensatory
    1678 semen was still considered to be good against witchcraft
    and also valuable as a lovephilter in which latter capacity its
    use still survives bourke scatalogic rites pp 343 355
    in an earlier age picart quoted by crawley the mystic rose
    p 109 the manichans it is said sprinkled their eucharistic
    bread with human semen a custom followed by the albigenses
    the belief perhaps founded in experience that semen possesses
    medical and stimulant virtues was doubtless fortified by the
    ancient opinion that the spinal cord is the source of this fluid
    this was not only held by the highest medical authorities in
    greece but also in india and persia
    the semen is thus a natural stimulant a physiological
    aphrodisiac the type of a class of drugs which have been known
    and cultivated in all parts of the world from time immemorial
    dufour has discussed the aphrodisiacs used in ancient rome
    histoire de la prostitution vol ii ch 21 it would be vain
    to attempt to enumerate all the foods and medicaments to which
    has been ascribed an influence in heightening the sexual impulse
    thus in the sixteenth century aphrodisiacal virtues were
    attributed to an immense variety of foods by libault in his
    thresor des remdes secrets pour les maladies des femmes 1585
    pp 104 et seq a large number of them certainly have no such
    effect at all but have obtained this credit either on some
    magical ground or from a mistaken association thus the potato
    when first introduced from america had the reputation of being a
    powerful aphrodisiac and the elizabethan dramatists contain many
    references to this supposed virtue as we know potatoes even
    when taken in the largest doses have not the slightest
    aphrodisiac effect and the irish peasantry whose diet consists
    very largely of potatoes are even regarded as possessing an
    unusually small measure of sexual feeling it is probable that
    the mistake arose from the fact that potatoes were originally a
    luxury and luxuries frequently tend to be regarded as
    aphrodisiacs since they are consumed under circumstances which
    tend to arouse the sexual desires it is possible also that as
    has been plausibly suggested the misunderstanding may have been
    due to sailorsthe first to be familiar with the potatowho
    attributed to this particular element of their diet ashore the
    generally stimulating qualities of their life in port the eryngo
    eryngium maritimum or sea holly which also had an erotic
    reputation in elizabethan times may well have acquired it in the
    same way many other vegetables have a similar reputation which
    they still retain thus onions are regarded as aphrodisiacal and
    were so regarded by the greeks as we learn from aristophanes it
    is noteworthy that marro a reliable observer has found that in
    italy both in prisons and asylums lascivious people are fond of
    onions la pubert p 297 and it may perhaps be worth while
    to recall the observation of srieux that in a woman in whom the
    sexual instinct only awoke in middle age there was a horror of
    leeks in some countries and especially in belgium celery is
    popularly looked upon as a sexual stimulant various condiments
    again have the same reputation perhaps because they are hot and
    because sexual desire is regarded rightly enough as a kind of
    heat fishskate for instance and notably oysters and other
    shellfishare very widely regarded as aphrodisiacs and kisch
    attributes this property to caviar it is probable that all these
    and other foods which have obtained this reputation in so far as
    they have any action whatever on the sexual appetite only
    possess it by virtue of their generally nutritious and
    stimulating qualities and not by the presence of any special
    principle having a selective action on the sexual sphere a
    beefsteak is probably as powerful a sexual stimulant as any food
    a nutritious food however which is at the same time easily
    digestible and thus requiring less expenditure of energy for its
    absorption may well exert a specially rapid and conspicuous
    stimulant effect but it is not possible to draw a line and as
    aquinas long since said if we wish to maintain ourselves in a
    state of purity we shall fear even an immoderate use of bread and
    water
    more definitely aphrodisiacal effects are produced by drugs and
    especially by drugs which in large doses are poisons the
    aphrodisiac with the widest popular reputation is cantharides
    but its sexually exciting effects are merely an accidental result
    of its action in causing inflammation of the genitourinary
    passage and it is both an uncertain and a dangerous result
    except in skillful hands and when administered in small doses
    nux vomica with its alkaloid strychnia by virtue of its
    special action on the spinal cord has a notably pronounced
    effect in heightening the irritability of the spinal ejaculatory
    center though it by no means necessarily exerts any
    strengthening influence alcohol exerts a sexually exciting
    effect but in a different manner it produces little stimulation
    of the cord and indeed even paralyzes the lumbar sexual center
    in large doses but it has an influence on the peripheral
    nerveendings and on the skin and also on the cerebral centers
    tending to arouse desire and to diminish inhibition in this
    latter way as adler remarks it may in small doses under some
    circumstances be beneficial in men with an excessive
    nervousness or dread of coitus and women in whom orgasm has
    been difficult to reach have frequently found this facilitated
    by some previous indulgence in alcohol the aphrodisiac effect of
    alcohol seems specially marked on women but against the use of
    alcohol as an aphrodisiac it must be remembered that it is far
    from being a tonic to detumescence at all events in men and
    that there is much evidence tending to show that not only chronic
    alcoholism but even procreation during intoxication is perilous
    to the offspring see eg andriezen journal of mental
    science january 1905 and cf wc sullivan alcoholism and
    suicidal impulses ib april 1898 p 268 it may be added
    that bunge has found a very high proportion of cases of
    immoderate use of alcohol in the fathers of women unable to
    suckle their infants g von bunge die zunehmende unfhigkeit
    der frauen ihre kinder zu stillen 1903 while even an
    approximation to the drunken state is far from being a desirable
    prelude to the creation of a new human being it is obvious that
    those who wish for any reason to cultivate a strict chastity of
    thought and feeling would do well to avoid alcohol altogether or
    only in its lightest forms and in moderation the aphrodisiacal
    effects of wine have long been known ovid refers to them eg
    ars am bk iii 765 clement of alexandria who was
    something of a man of science as well as a christian moralist

        this knowen lechours by experience
    alcohol as chaucer pointed out comes to the aid of the man who
    is unscrupulous in his efforts to overcome a woman and this not
    merely by virtue of its aphrodisiacal effects and the apparently
    special influence which it seems to exert on women but also
    because it lulls the mental and emotional characteristics which
    are the guardians of personality a correspondent who has
    questioned on this point a number of prostitutes he has known
    writes their accounts of the first fall were nearly always the
    same they got to know a gentleman and on one occasion they
    drank too much before they quite realized what was happening
    they were no longer virgins in the mental areas under the
    influence of alcohol schmiedeberg remarks in his elements of
    pharmacology the finer degrees of observation judgment and
    reflection are the first to disappear while the remaining mental
    functions remain in a normal condition the soldier acts more
    boldly because he notices dangers less and reflects over them
    less the orator does not allow himself to be influenced by any
    disturbing sideconsiderations as to his audience hence he
    speaks more freely and spiritedly selfconsciousness is lost to
    a very great extent and many are astounded at the ease with
    which they can express their thoughts and at the acuteness of
    their judgment in matters which when they are perfectly sober
    with difficulty reach their minds and then afterwards they are
    ashamed at their mistakes
    the action of opium in small doses is also to some extent
    aphrodisiacal it slightly stimulates both the brain and the
    spinal cord and has sensory effects on the skin like alcohol
    these effects are favored by the state of agreeable dreaminess it
    produces in the seventeenth century venette la gnration de
    lhomme part ii chapter v strongly recommended small doses of
    opium then little known for this purpose he had himself he

    been a not uncommon aphrodisiac it is specially used to diminish
    local sensibility delaying the orgasm and thus prolonging the
    sexual act wd sutherland de impotentia indian medical
    gazette january 1900 its more direct and stimulating
    influence on the sexual emotions seems indicated by the statement
    that prostitutes are found standing outside the opiumsmoking
    dens of bombay but not outside the neighboring liquor shops
    gc lucas lancet february 2 1884 like alcohol opium
    seems to have a marked aphrodisiacal effect on women the case is
    recorded of a mentally deranged girl with no nymphomania though
    she masturbated who on taking small doses of opium at once
    showed signs of nymphomania following men about etc american
    journal obstetrics may 1901 p 74 it may well be believed
    that opium acts beneficially in men when the ejaculatory centers
    are weak but irritable but its actions are too widespread over
    the organism to make it in any degree a valuable aphrodisiac
    various other drugs have more or less reputation as aphrodisiacs
    thus bromide of gold a nervous and glandular stimulant is said
    to have as one of its effects a heightening of sexual feeling
    yohimbin an alkaloid derived from the west african yohimbehe
    tree has obtained considerable repute during recent years in the
    treatment of impotence in some cases see eg toffs results
    summarized in british medical journal february 18 1905 it
    has produced good results apparently by increasing the blood
    supply to the sexual organs but has not been successful in all
    cases or in all hands it must always be remembered that in cases
    of psychical impotence suggestion necessarily exerts a beneficial
    influence and this may work through any drug or merely with the
    aid of bread pills all exercise often even walking may be a
    sexual stimulant and it is scarcely necessary to add that
    powerful stimulation of the skin in the sexual sphere and more
    especially of the nates is often a more effective aphrodisiac
    than any drug whether the irritation is purely mechanical as by
    flogging or mechanicochemical as by urtication or the
    application of nettles among the malays with whom both men and
    women often use a variety of plants as aphrodisiacs according to

    activities camphor has an ancient reputation as an
    anaphrodisiac and its use in this respect was known to the arabs
    as may be seen by a reference to it in the perfumed garden

    doses see eg becker berliner klinische wochenschrift

    direction it may be doubted however whether there is any
    satisfactory and reliable anaphrodisiac charcot indeed it is
    said used to declare that the only anaphrodisiac in which he had
    any confidence was that used by the uncle of helose in the case

if semen is a stimulant when ingested it is easy to suppose that it may
exert a similar action on the woman who receives it into the vagina in
normal sexual congress it is by no means improbable that as mattei
argued in 1878 this is actually the case it is known that the vagina
possesses considerable absorptive power thus coen and levi among others
have shown that if a tampon soaked in a solution of iodine is introduced
into the vagina iodine will be found in the urine within an hour and the
same is true of various other substances137 if the vagina absorbs drugs
it probably absorbs semen toff of braila roumania who attaches much
importance to such absorption considers that it must be analogous to the
ingestion of organic extractives it is due to this influence he
believes that weak and anmic girls so often become fullblooded and
robust after marriage and lose their nervous tendencies and shyness138
it is however most certainly a mistake to suppose that the beneficial
influence of coitus on women is exclusively or even mainly dependent
upon the absorption of semen this is conclusively demonstrated by the
fact that such beneficial influence is exerted and in full measure even
when all precautions have been taken to avoid any contact with the semen
in so far as coitus reservatus or interruptus may lead to haste or
discomfort which prevents satisfactory orgasm on the part of the woman it
is without doubt a cause of defective detumescence and incomplete
satisfaction but if orgasm is complete the beneficial effects of coitus
follow even if there has been no possibility of the absorption of semen
even after coitus interruptus if it can be prolonged for a period long
enough for the woman to attain full and complete satisfaction she is
enabled to experience what she may describe as a feeling of intoxication
lasting for several hours it is in the action of the orgasm itself and
the vascular secretory and metabolic activities set up by the psychic
and nervous influence of coitus with a beloved person that we must seek
the chief key to the effects produced by coitus on women however these
effects may possibly be still further heightened by the actual absorption
of semen139
the positive action of semen or rather of the testicular products has
been much investigated during recent years and appears on the whole to be
demonstrated the notable discovery by brownsquard a quarter of a
century ago that the ingestion of the testicular juices in states of
debility and senility acted as a beneficial stimulant and tonic opened
the way to a new field of therapeutics many investigators in various
countries have found that testicular extracts and more especially the
spermin as studied by poehl140 and by him regarded as a positive
katalysator or accelerator of metabolic processes exert a real influence
in giving tone to the heart and other muscles and in improving the
metabolism of the tissues even when all influences of mental suggestion
have been excluded141
    as the ovaries are strictly analogous to the testes it was
    surmised that ovarian extract might prove a drug equally valuable
    with testicular products as a matter of fact ovarian extract
    in the form of ovarin etc would seem to have proved beneficial
    in various disorders more especially in anmia and in troubles
    due to the artificial menopause in most conditions however in
    which it has been employed the results are doubtful or uncertain
    and some authorities believe that the influence of suggestion
    plays a considerable part here
there is however another use which is subserved by the testicular
products a use which may indeed be said to be implied in those uses to
which reference has already been made but is yet historically the latest
to be realized and studied it was not until 1869 that brownsquard first
suggested that an important secretion was elaborated by the ductless
glands and received into the circulation but that suggestion proved to be
epochmaking if these glandular secretions are so valuable when
administered as drugs to other persons must they not be of far greater
value when naturally secreted and poured out into the circulation in the
living body it is now generally believed on the basis of a large and
various body of evidence that this is undoubtedly so in a very crude
form indeed this belief is by no means modern in opposition to the old
writers who were inclined to regard the semen as an excretion which it was
beneficial to expel there were other ancient authorities who argued that
it was beneficial to retain it as being a vital fluid which if
reabsorbed served to invigorate the body the great physiologist haller
in the middle of the eighteenth century came very near to the modern
doctrine when he stated in his elements of physiology that the sperm
accumulated in the seminical vesicles is pumped back into the blood and
thus produces the beard and the hair together with the other surprising
changes of puberty which are absent in the eunuch the reabsorption of
semen can scarcely be said to be a part of the modern physiological
doctrine but it is at least now generally held that the testes secrete
substances which pass into the circulation and are of immense importance
in the development of the organism
the experiments of shattock and seligmann indicate that the semen and its
reabsorption in the seminal vesicles or the nervous reactions produced by
its presence can have no part in the formation of secondary sexual
characters these investigators occluded the vas deferens in sheep by
ligature at an early age rendering them later sterile though not
impotent the secondary sexual characters appeared as in ordinary sheep
spermatogenesis these inquirers conclude may be the initial factor but
the results must be attributed to the elaboration by the testicles of an
internal secretion and its absorption into the general circulation142
when animals are castrated there is enlargement of the ductless glands in
the body notably the thyroid and the suprarenal capsules143 it is
evident therefore that the secretions of these ductless glands are in
some degree compensatory to those of the testes but this compensatory
action is inadequate to produce any sexual development in the absence of
the testes
we see therefore how extremely important is the function of the testis
its significance is not alone for the race it is not simply concerned
with the formation of the spermatozoa which share equally with the ova the
honor of making the mankind of the future it also has a separate and
distinct function which has reference to the individual it elaborates
those internal secretions which stimulate and maintain the physical and
mental characters constituting all that is most masculine in the male
animal all that makes the man in distinction from the eunuch among
various primitive peoples including those of the european race whence we
ourselves spring the most solemn form of oath was sworn by placing the
hand on the testes dimly recognized as the most sacred part of the body
a crude and passing phase of civilization has ignorantly cast ignominy
upon the sexual organs the more primitive belief is now justified by our
advancing knowledge
    in these as in other respects the ovaries are precisely analogous
    to the testes they not only form the ova but they elaborate for
    internal use a secretion which develops and maintains the special
    physical and mental qualities of womanhood as the testicular
    secretion those of manhood moreover as cecca and zappi found
    removal of the ovaries has exactly the same effect on the
    abnormal development of the other ductless glands as has removal
    of the testes it is of interest to point out that the internal
    secretion of the ovaries and its important functions seem to have
    been suggested before any other secretion than the sperm was
    attributed to the testes early in the nineteenth century cabanis
    argued de linfluence des sexes sur le caractre des ides et
    des affections morales rapport du physique et du moral de
    lhomme 1824 vol ii p 18 that the ovaries are secreting
    glands forming a particular humor which is reabsorbed into the
    blood and imparts excitations which are felt by the whole system
    and all its organs

what if any are the indications which the body generally may furnish as

there an erotic temperament outwardly and visibly displayed that is a
question which has often occupied those who have sought to penetrate the
more intimate mysteries of human nature and since we are here concerned
with human beings in their relationship to the process of detumescence we
cannot altogether pass over this question difficult as it is to discuss
it with precision
    the old physiognomists showed much confidence in dealing with the
    matter possibly they had more opportunities for observation than
    we have since they often wrote in days when life was lived more
    nakedly than among ourselves but their descriptions while
    sometimes showing much insight are inextricably mixed up with
    false science and superstition
    in the de secretis mulierum wrongly attributed to albertus
    magnus we find a chapter entitled signa mulieris calid natur
    et qu coit libenter which may be summarized here the signs
    we are told of a woman of warm temperament and one who
    willingly cohabits are these youth an age of over 12 or
    younger if she has been seduced small high breasts full and
    hard hair in the usual positions she is bold of speech with a
    delicate and high voice haughty and even cruel of disposition
    of good complexion lean rather than stout inclined to like
    drinking such a woman always desires coitus and receives
    satisfaction in the act the menstrual flow is not abundant nor
    always regular if she becomes pregnant the milk is not abundant
    her perspiration is less odorous than that of the woman of
    opposite temperament she is fond of singing and of moving
    about and delights in adornments if she has any
    polemon in his sulla physionomia has given among the signs of

    women length of leg below the knee aristotle had mentioned among
    the signs of wantonness paleness abundance of hair on the body
    thick and black hair hairs covering the temples and thick
    eyelids
    in the seventeenth century bouchet in his seres troisime
    sere gave as the signs of virility which indicated that a man
    could have children a great voice a thick rough black beard a
    large thick nose
    g tourdes art aphrodisie dictionnaire encyclopdique des

    subject the erotic temperament has been described as marked by
    a lean figure white and wellranged teeth a developed hairy
    system a characteristic voice air and expression and even a
    special odor
in approaching the question of the general physical indications of a
special aptitude to the manifestation of vigorous detumescence the most
obvious preliminary would seem to be a study of the castrated if we know
the special peculiarities of those who by removal of the sexual glands at
a very early age have been deprived of all ability to present the
manifestations of detumescence we shall probably be in possession of a
type which is the reverse of that which we may expect in persons of a
vigorously erotic temperament
the most general characteristics of eunuchs would appear to be an unusual
tendency to put on fat a notably greater length of the legs absence of

    castration notes on the castration of idiot children
    american journal of psychology january 1899 it is often
    forgotten that the physical and psychic qualities associated with
    and largely dependent on the ability to experience the impulse of
    detumescence while essential to the perfect man involve many
    egoistic aggressive and acquisitive characteristics which are of
    little intellectual value and at the same time inimical to many
    moral virtues
we have a further standardpositive this time rather than negativeto
aid us in determining the erotic temperament the phenomena of puberty
the efflorescence of puberty is essentially the manifestation of the
ability to experience detumescence it is therefore reasonable to suppose
that the individuals in whom the special phenomena of puberty develop most
markedly are those in whom detumescence is likely to be most vigorous if
such is the case we should expect to find the erotic temperament marked by
developed larynx and deep voice a considerable degree of pigmentary
development in hair and skin and a marked tendency to hairiness while
in women there should be a pronounced growth of the breasts and
pelvis144
there is yet another standard by which we may measure the individuals
aptitude for detumescence the presence of those activities which are most
prominently brought into play during the process of detumescence the
individual that is to say who is organically most apt to manifest the
physiological activities which mainly make up the process of detumescence
is most likely to be of pronounced erotic temperament
erotic persons are of motor type remark vaschide and vurpas and we
may say generally that nearly all persons of motor type are erotic the
state of detumescence is one of motor and muscular energy and of great
vascular activity so that habitual energy of motor response and an active
circulation may reasonably be taken to indicate an aptitude for the
manifestation of detumescence
these three types may be said therefore to furnish us valuable though
somewhat general indications the individual who is farthest removed from
the castrated type who presents in fullest degree the characters which
begin to emerge at the period of puberty and who reveals a physiological
aptitude for the vigorous manifestation of those activities which are
called into action during detumescence is most likely to be of erotic
temperament the most cautious description of the characteristics of this
temperament given by modern scientific writers unlike the more detailed
and hazardous descriptions of the early physiognomists will be found to
be fairly true to the standards thus presented to us

adler and moll remark very truly that so far at least as women are
concerned sexual ansthesia or sexual proclivity cannot be unfailingly
read on the features every woman desires to please and coquetry is the
sign of a cold rather than of an erotic temperament145 it may be added
that a considerable degree of congenital sexual ansthesia by no means
prevents a woman from being beautiful and attractive though it must
probably still always be said that as roubaud points out146 the woman
of cold and intellectual temperament the femme de tte however
beautiful and skillful she may be cannot compete in the struggle for love
with the woman whose qualities are of the heart and of the emotions but
it seems sufficiently clear that the practical observations of skilled and
experienced observers agree in attributing to persons of erotic type
certain general characteristics which accord with those negative and
positive standards we may frame on the basis of castration of puberty
and of detumescence it may be worth while to note a few of these
characteristics briefly
the abnormal lengthening of the long bones at the age of puberty in the
castrated is as we have seen very pronounced there is little tendency
to associate length of limb with an erotic temperament and a certain
amount of data as well as of more vague opinion points in the opposite
direction the arabs would appear to believe that it is short rather than
tall people in whom the sexual instinct is strongly developed and we read
in the perfumed garden under all circumstances little women love
coitus more and evince a stronger affection for the virile member than
women of a large size in his elaborate investigation of criminals marro
found that prostitutes and women guilty of sexual offenses as also male
sexual offenders tend to be short and thick set147 in european
folklore the thick bull neck is regarded as a sign of strong
sexuality148 mantegazza refers to a strong sexual temperament as being
associated with arrest or disorder of bony development and marro suggests
that the proverbial salacity of rachitic individuals may be due to an
increased activity of the sexual organs149 it may be added that
acromegaly with its excessive bony growths tends to be associated with
premature sexual involution
a further point which is frequently mentioned in the case of women is the
development of the chief secondary sexual regions the pelvis and the
breasts it is indeed almost inevitable that there should be some degree
of correlation between the aptitude for bearing children and the aptitude
for experiencing detumescence the reality of such a connection is not
only evidenced by medical observations but receives further testimony in
popular beliefs in italy women with large buttocks are considered wanton
and among the south slavs they are regarded as especially fruitful150
blumenbach asserted that precocious venery will enlarge the breasts and
believed that he had found evidence of this among young london
prostitutes151
the association of the aptitude for detumescence with a tendency to a deep
rather than to a high voice both in men and women has frequently been
noted and has seldom been denied the onset of puberty always affects the
voice in general birent states the more bass the voice is the more
marked is the development of the sexual apparatus a very robust man
with very developed sexual organs and very dark and abundant hairy
system a man of strong puberty in a word is nearly always a bass152
the influence of sexual excitement in deepening the voice is shown by the
rules of sexual hygiene prescribed to tenors while a bass has less need
to observe similar precautions in women every phase of sexual
lifepuberty menstruation coitus pregnancytends to affect the voice
and always by giving it a deeper character the deepening of the voice by
sexual intercourse was an ancient greek observation and martial refers to
a womans good or bad singing as an index to her recent sexual habits
prostitutes tend to have a deep voice venturi points out that married
women preserve a fresh voice to a more advanced age than spinsters this
being due to the precocious senility in the latter of an unused function
such a phenomenon indicates that the relationship of detumescence to the
deepening of the voice is not quite simple this is further indicated by
the fact that in robust men abstinence still further deepens the voice
the monk of melodrama always has a bass voice while excessive or
precocious sexual indulgence tends to be associated with the same kind of
puerile voice as is found in those persons in whom pubertal development
has not been carried very far or who are of what griffiths terms
eunuchoid type idiot boys who are often sexually undeveloped tend to
have a high voice while idiot girls who often manifest marked sexual
proclivities not infrequently have a deep voice153
bright dilated eyes are among the phenomena of detumescence and are very
frequently noted in persons of a pronounced erotic temperament this is
indeed an ancient observation and burton says of people with a black
lively and sparkling eye without question they are most amorous
drawing his illustrations mostly from classic literature154 tardieu
described the erotic woman as having bright eyes and heywood smith states
that the eyes of lascivious women resemble though in a less degree those
of the insane155 sexual excitement is one among many
causesintellectual excitement pain a loud noise even any sensory
irritationwhich produce dilatation of the pupils and enlargement of the
palpebral fissure with some protrusion of the eyeball the influence of
the sexual system upon the eye appears to be far less potent in men than
in women156 sexual desire is however by no means the only irritant
within the sexual sphere which may thus influence the eye morbid
irritations may produce the same effect milner fothergill in his book on
indigestion vividly describes the appearance of the eyes sometimes
seen in ovarian disorder the glittering flash which glances out from
some female irides is the external indication of ovarian irritation and
the ovarian gleam has features quite its own the most marked instance
which ever came under my notice was due to irritation in the ovaries
which had been forced down in front of the uterus and been fixed there by
adhesions here there was little sexual proclivity but the eyes were very
remarkable they flashed and glittered unceasingly and at times perfect
lightning bolts shot from them usually there is a bright glittering sheen
in them which contrasts with the dead look in the irides of sexual excess
or profuse uterine discharges
the activity of the glandular secretions and especially those of the
skin during detumescence would lead us to expect that such secretory
activity is an index to an aptitude for detumescence as a matter of fact
it is occasionally though not frequently noted by medical observers it
is stated that the erotic temperament is characterized by a special
odor157 the activity of the sweatglands is seldom referred to by
medical observers in describing persons of erotic temperament although
the descriptions of novelists not infrequently contain allusions to this
point and the literature of an earlier age shows that the tendency to
perspiration especially the moist hand was regarded as a sure sign of a
sensual temperament the moisthanded madonna imperia a most rare and
divine creature remarks lazarillo in middletons comedy blurt
masterconstable to quote one of many allusions to this point in the
elizabethan drama
the lips are sometimes noted as red and everted perhaps thick158
tardieu remarked that the typically erotic woman has thick red lips this
corresponds with the characteristic type of the satyr in classic statues
as in later paintings his lips are always thick and everted fullness
redness and eversion of the lips are correlated with good breathing the
absence of anmia laughter a wellfleshed face
    this kind of mouth indicates perhaps not so much a congenitally
    erotic temperament as an abandonment to impulse the opposite
    type of mouthwith inverted thin and retracted lipswould
    appear to be found with especial frequency in persons who
    habitually repress their impulses on moral grounds any kind of
    effort to restrain involuntary muscular action may lead to
    retraction of the lips the effort to overcome anger or fear or
    even the resistance to a strong desire to urinate or defecate in
    religious young men however it becomes habitual and fixed i
    recall a small band of medical students gathered together from a
    large medical school who were accustomed to meet together for
    prayer and biblereading the majority showed this type of mouth
    to a very marked degree pale faces with drawn retracted lips
    it may be termed the christian or pious facies it is much less
    frequently seen in religious women unless of masculine type
    doubtless because religion for women is in a much less degree
    than for men a moral discipline
    it may be added that an interesting form of this contraction of
    the lips and one that is not purely repressive is that which
    indicates the state of muscular tension associated with the
    impulse to guard and protect in this form the contracted mouth
    is the index of tenderness and is characteristic of the mother
    who is watching over the infant she is suckling at her breast i
    have observed precisely the same expression in the face of a boy
    of 14 with a large congenital scrotal hernia when the tumor was
    being examined his lower lip became retracted well marked lines
    appearing from the angles downwards though the upper lip
    retained its normal expression it was precisely the tender look
    we may see in the faces of mothers who are watching anxiously
    over their offspring and the emotion is evidently the same in
    both cases solicitude for a sensitive and tenderly guarded
    object
the degree of pigmentation is clearly correlated with sexual vigor in
general heusinger laid down in 1823 the quantity of pigment is
proportional to the functional effectiveness of the genital organs this
connection is so profound that it may be traced very widely throughout the
organic world
the connection between pigmentation and sexual activity is very ancient
even leaving out of account the wedding apparel of animals nearly always
gorgeous in scales and plumage and hair the sexual orifice shows a more
or less marked tendency to pigmentation during the breeding season from
fishes upward while in mammals the darker pigmentation of this region is
a constant phenomenon in sexually mature individuals159
in the human species both the negative standard of castration and the
positive standard of puberty alike indicate a correlation of this kind
those individuals in whom puberty never fully develops and who are
consequently said to be affected by infantilism reveal a relative absence
of pigment in the sexual centers which are normally pigmented to a high
degree160 among those asiatic races who extirpate the ovaries in young
girls the skin remains white in the perineum round the anus and in the
armpits161 even in mature women who undergo ovariotomy as kepler
found the pigmentation of the nipples and areola disappears as well as
of the perineum and anus the skin taking on a remarkable whiteness
normally the sexual centers and in a high degree the genital orifice
represent the maximum of pigmentation and under some circumstances this
is clearly visible even in infancy thus babies of mixed black and white
blood may show no traces of negro ancestry at birth but there will always
be increased pigmentation about the external genitalia162 the linea
fusca which reaches from the pubes to the navel and occasionally to the
ensiform cartilage is a line of sexual pigmentation sometimes regarded as
characteristic of pregnancy but as andersen of copenhagen has found by
the examination of several hundred children of both sexes it exists in a
slight form in about 75 per cent of young girls and in almost as large a
proportion of boys but there is no doubt that it tends to increase with
age as well as to become marked at pregnancy at puberty there is a
general tendency to changes in pigmentation thus godin found that in 28
per cent adolescent changes occurred in the eyes and hair at this period
the hair becoming darker though the eyes sometimes become lighter ammon
in his investigation of conscripts at the age of 20 post p 196
discovered the significant fact that the eyes and hair darken pari passu
with sexual development in women during menstruation there is a general
tendency to pigmentation this is especially obvious around the eyes and
in some cases black rings of true pigment form in this position even the
skin of the negro women of loango sometimes becomes a few shades darker
during menstruation163 during pregnancy this tendency to pigmentation
reaches its climax pregnancy constantly gives rise to pigmentation of the
face the neck the nipples the abdomen and this is especially marked in
brunettes
this association of pigmentation and sexual aptitudes has been recognized
in the popular lore of some peoples thus the sicilians who admire brown
skin and have no liking either for a fair skin or light hair believe that
a white woman is incapable of responding to love it is the brown woman
who feels love as it is said in sicilian dialect fimmina scura fimmina
amurusa164
    the dependence of pigmentation upon the sexual system is shown by
    the fact that irritation of the genital organs by disease will
    frequently suffice to produce a high degree of pigmentation this
    may the neck the trunk the hands simpson long since noted that
    uterine irritation apart from pregnancy may produce pigmentation

    subject in la gyncologie february 1903 will be found in

of all physical traits vigor of the hairy system has most frequently
perhaps been regarded as the index of vigorous sexuality in this matter
modern medical observations are at one with popular belief and ancient
physiognomical assertions165 the negative test of castration and the
positive test of puberty point in the same direction
it is at puberty that all the hair on the body except that on the head
begins to develop indeed the very word puberty has reference to this
growth as the most obvious sign of the whole process when castration
takes place at an early age all this development of pubescent hair is
arrested when the primary sexual organs are undeveloped the sexual hair
is also undeveloped as in a case recorded by plant166 of a girl with
rudimentary uterus and ovaries who had little or no axillary and pubic
hair although the hair of the head was long and strong167
    the pseudomichael scot among the signa mulieris calid natur
    et qu coit libenter stated that her hair both on the head and
    body is thick and coarse and crisp and della porta the
    greatest of the physiognomists said that thickness of hair in
    women meant wantonness venette in his generation de lhomme
    remarked that men who have much hair on the body are most
    amorous at a more recent period roubaud has said that pubic hair
    in its quantity color and curliness is an index of genital
    energy a poor pilous system on the other hand roubaud regarded
    as a probable though not an irrefragable proof of sexual
    frigidity in women in the cold woman the pilous system is
    remarkable for the languor of its vitality the hairs are fair
    delicate scarce and smooth while in ardent natures there are
    little curly tufts about the temples trait de

    a correspondent who has always taken a special interest in the
    condition as regards hairiness of the women to whom he has been
    attracted has sent me notes concerning a series of 12 women it
    may be gathered from these notes that 5 women were neither
    markedly sexual nor markedly hairy either as regards head or
    pubes 6 cases both hairy and sexual 1 was sexual and not
    hairy none were hairy and not sexual my correspondent remarks
    there may be women with scanty pubic hair possessing very strong
    sexual emotions my own experience is quite the opposite he has
    also independently reached the conclusion arrived at by many
    medical observers and clearly suggested by some of the facts here
    brought together that profuse hair frequently denotes a neurotic
    temperament
    it may be added that mirabeau as we learn from an anecdote told
    by an eyewitness and recorded by legouv had a very hairy chest
    while the same is recorded of restif de la bretonne
it is a very ancient and popular belief that if a hairy man is not sensual
he is strong vir pilosus aut libidinosus aut fortis the greeks
insisted on the hairy nates of hercules and ninon de lenclos when the
great cond shared her bed without touching her remarked on seeing his
hairy body ah monseigneur que vous devez tre fort it may be doubted
whether there is any exact parallelism between muscular strength and
hairiness for strength is largely a matter of training but there can be
no doubt that hairiness really tends to be associated with a generally
vigorous development of the body
although the observations concerning hairiness of body as an index of
vigor whether sexual or only generally physical are so ancient until
recent years no attempts have been made to demonstrate on a large scale
whether there is actually a correlation between hairiness and sexual or
general development of the body some importance therefore attaches to
ammons careful observations of many thousand conscripts in baden these
observations fully justify this ancient belief since they show that on
the one hand the size of the testicles and on the other hand girth of
chest and stature are correlated with hairiness of body
    ammons observations were made on nearly 4000 conscripts of the
    age of 20 from the point of view of the hairy system he divided
    them into four classes
    i to which 61 per cent of the men belonged with smooth
    bodies
    ii including 253 per cent only slight hairiness
    iii 538 per cent more developed hairy system but belly
    breast and back smooth
    iv 147 per cent hair all over body
    v 01 per cent extreme cases of hairiness
    the beardless were 121 per cent those with no axillary hair 9
    per cent those with no hair on pubis 04 per cent this
    corresponds with the fact that hair appears first on the pubis
    and last on the chin
    in the first class 69 per cent were beardless 54 per cent
    without any axillary hair and 6 per cent without pubic hair in
    the second class 24 per cent were beardless 17 per cent
    without axillary hair in the third class 3 per cent were
    beardless and 3 per cent without axillary hair
    below puberty the diameter of testicles is below 14 millimeters
    there were 13 conscripts having a testicular diameter of less
    than 14 millimeters these infantile individuals all belonged to
    the first three classes and mostly to the first the average
    testicular diameter in the first class was nearly 24 millimeters
    and progressively rose in the succeeding classes to over 26
    millimeters in the fourth
    while there was not much difference in height the first class
    was the shortest the fourth the tallest the fourth class also
    showed the greatest chest perimeter the cephalic index of all
    classes was 84 o ammon linfantilisme et le feminisme au

we thus see that it is quite justifiable to admit a type of person who
possesses a more than average aptitude for detumescence such persons are
more likely to be short than tall they will show a full development of
the secondary sexual characters the voice will tend to be deep and the
eyes bright the glandular activity of the skin will probably be marked
the lips everted there is a tendency to a more than average degree of
pigmentation and there is frequently an abnormal prevalence of hair on
some parts of the body while none of these signs taken separately can
be said to have any necessary connection with the sexual impulse taken
altogether they indicate an organism that responds to the instinct of
detumescence with special aptitude or with marked energy in these
respects observation both scientific and popular concords with the
probabilities suggested by the three standards in this matter which have
already been set forth
no generalization however can here be set down in an absolute and
unqualified manner there are definite reasons why this should be so
there is for instance the highly important consideration that the sexual
impulse of the individual may be conspicuous in two quite distinct ways
it may assume prominence because the individual possesses a highly
vigorous and wellnourished organism or its prominence may be due to
mental irritation in a very morbid individual in the latter
casealthough occasionally the two sets of conditions are combinedmost
of the signs we might expect in the former case may be absent indeed the
sexual impulses which proceed from a morbid psychic irritability do not in
most cases indicate any special aptitude for detumescence at all in that
largely lies their morbid character
again just in the same way that the exaggerated impulse itself may either
be healthy or morbid so the various characters which we have found to
possess some value as signs of the impulse may themselves either be
healthy or morbid this is notably the case as regards an abnormal growth
of hair on the body more especially when it appears on regions where
normally there is little or no hair such hypertrichosis is frequently
degenerative in character though still often associated with the sexual
system when however it is thus a degenerative character of sexual
nature having its origin in some abnormal foetal condition or later
atrophy of the ovaries it is no necessary indication of any aptitude for
detumescence
    idiots more especially it would seem idiot girls tend to show a
    highly developed hairy system thus voisin when investigating
    150 idiot and imbecile girls found the hair long and thick and
    tending to occupy a large surface one girl had hair on the
    areol of the mamma j voisin conformation des organes
    gnitaux chez les idiots annales dhygine publique june
    1894 it should be said that in idiot boys puberty is late and
    the sexual organs as well as the sexual instinct frequently
    undeveloped while in idiot girls there is no delay in puberty
    and the sexual organs and instinct are frequently fully and even
    abnormally developed
    hegar has described an interesting case showing an association
    of foetal origin between sexual anomaly and abnormal hairness
    in this case a girl of 16 had a uterus duplex an infantile
    pelvis very slight menstruation and undeveloped breasts she was
    very hairy on the face the anterior aspects of the chest and
    abdomen the sexual regions and the thighs but not specially so
    on the rest of the body the hairs were of lanugolike character
    but dark in color a hegar beitrge zur geburtshlfe und
    gynkologie vol i p iii 1898 sometimes hiruties of the
    face and abdomen begin to appear during pregnancy apparently
    from disease or degeneration of the ovaries a case is noted in
    british medical journal august 2 and 16 pp 375 and 436
    1902 laycock many years ago referred to the popular belief that
    women who have hair on the upper lip seldom bear children and
    regarded this opinion as questionless founded on fact
    laycock nervous diseases of women p 22 when this is so
    we may suppose that the abnormal hairy growth is associated with
    degeneration of the ovaries
there is another factor which enters into this question and renders the
definition of a physical sexual type less precise than it would otherwise
be the sexual instinct is common to all persons and while it seems
probable that there is a type of person in whom sexual energies are
predominant it would also appear that the people who otherwise show a
very high level of energy in life usually exhibit a more than average
degree of energy in matters of love the predominantly sexual type as we
have seen tends to be associated with a high degree of pigmentation the
person specially apt for detumescence inclines to belong to the dark
rather than to the purely fair group of the population on the other hand
the active energetic practical man the man who is most apt for the
achievement of success in life tends to belong to the fair rather than to
the dark type168 thus we have a certain conflict of tendencies and it
becomes possible to assert that while persons with pronounced aptitude for
sexual detumescence tend to be dark persons whose pronounced energy in
sexual matters tends to ensure success are most likely to be fair
    the tendency of the fair energetic type the type of the northern
    european man to sexuality may be connected with the fact that
    the violent and criminal man who commits sexual crimes tends to
    be fair even amid a dark population criminals on the whole would
    appear to tend to be dark rather than fair but marro found in
    italy that the group of sexual offenders differed from all other
    groups of criminals in that their hair was predominantly fair
    caratteri del delinquenti p 374 ottolenghi in the same
    way in examining 100 sexual offenders found that they showed 17
    per cent of fair hair though criminals generally on a basis
    of nearly 2000 showed only 6 per cent and normal persons
    nearly 1000 9 per cent similarly while the normal persons
    showed only 20 per cent of blue eyes and criminals generally 36
    per cent the sexual offenders showed 50 per cent of blue eyes

    fellow or adulterer is fairhaired in folklore it has been
    noted kryptadia vol ii p 258 red or yellow hair is
    sometimes regarded as a mark of sexuality
    in harmony with this fairness sexual offenders would appear to
    be more dolichocephalic than other criminals in italy marro
    found the foreheads of sexual offenders to be narrow and in
    california drhms found that while murderers had an average
    cephalic index of 835 and thieves of 805 that of sexual
    offenders was 79
    on the other hand high cheekbones and broad facesa condition
    most usually found associated with brachycephalyhave sometimes
    been noted as associated with undue or violent sexuality marro
    noted the excess of prominent cheekbones in sexual offenders
    and in america it has been found that unchaste girls tend to have
    broad faces pedagogical seminary december 1896 pp 231
    235
it will be seen that when we take a comprehensive view of the facts and
considerations involved it is possible to obtain a more definite and
coherent picture of the physical signs of a marked aptitude for
detumescence than has hitherto been usually supposed possible but we also
see that while the ensemble of these signs is probably fairly reliable
as an index of marked sexuality the separate signs have no such definite
significance and under some circumstances their significance may even be
reversed

circulationthe thyroidchanges in the nervous systemthe vomiting of
pregnancythe longings of pregnant womenmaternal impressionsevidence
for and against their validitythe question still openimperfection of
our knowledgethe significance of pregnancy
in analyzing the sexual impulse i have so far deliberately kept out of
view the maternal instinct this is necessary for the maternal instinct
is specific and distinct it is directed to an aim which however
intimately associated it may be with that of the sexual impulse proper
can by no means be confounded with it yet the emotion of love as it has
finally developed in the world is not purely of sexual origin it is
partly sexual but it is also partly parental169
in so far as it is parental it is certainly mainly maternal there is a
drawing by bronzino in the louvre of a womans head gazing tenderly down
at some invisible object is it her child or her lover doubtless her
child yet the expression is equally adequate to the emotion evoked by a
lover if we were here specifically dealing with the emotion of love as a
complex whole and not with the psychology of the sexual impulse it would
certainly be necessary to discuss the maternal instinct and its associated
emotions in any case it seems desirable to touch on the psychic state of
pregnancy for we are here concerned not only with emotions very closely
connected with the sexual emotions in the narrower sense but we here at
last approach that state which it is the object of the whole sexual
process to achieve
in civilized life a period of weeks months even years may elapse
between the establishment of sexual relations and the occurrence of
conception under primitive conditions the loss of the virginal condition
practically involves the pregnant condition so that under primitive
conditions very little allowance is made for the state so common among
civilized peoples of the woman who is no longer a virgin yet not about
to become a mother
    there is some interest in noting the signs of loss of virginity
    chiefly relied upon by ancient authors in doing this it is
    convenient to follow mainly the full summary of authorities given
    by schurig in his barthenologia early in the eighteenth
    century the ancient custom known in classic times of measuring
    the neck the day after marriage was frequently practiced to
    ascertain if a girl was or was not a virgin there were various
    ways of doing this one was to measure with a thread the
    circumference of the brides neck before she went to bed on the
    bridal night if in the morning the same thread would not go
    around her neck it was a sure sign that she had lost her
    virginity during the night if not she was still a virgin or had
    been deflowered at an earlier period catullus alluded to this
    custom which still exists or existed until lately in the south
    of france it is perfectly sound for it rests on the intimate
    response by congestion of the thyroid gland to sexual excitement
    parthenologia p 283 birent la pubert p 150 havelock
    ellis man and woman fourth edition p 267
    some say schurig tells us that the voice which in the virgin
    is shrill becomes rougher and deeper after the first coitus he
    quotes riolans statement that it is certain that the voice of
    those who indulge in venery is changed on that account the
    ancients bound down the penis of their singers and martial said
    that those who wish to preserve their voices should avoid coitus
    democritus who one day had greeted a girl as maiden on the
    following day addressed her as woman while in the same way it
    is said that albertus magnus observing from his study a girl
    going for wine for her master knew that she had had sexual
    intercourse by the way because on her return her voice had become
    deeper here again the ancient belief has a solid basis for
    the voice and the larynx are really affected by sexual
    conditions parthenologia p 286 marro la pubert p
    303 havelock ellis op cit pp 271 289
    others again schurig proceeds have judged that the goaty smell
    given out in the armpits during the venereal act is also no
    uncertain sign of defloration such odor being perceptible in
    those who use much venery and not seldom in harlots and the
    newly married while as hippocrates said it is not perceived in
    boys and girls parthenologia p 286 cf the previous volume
    of these studies sexual selection in man p 64
    in virgins schurig remarks the pubic hair is said to be long
    and not twisted while in women accustomed to coitus it is
    crisper but it is only after long and repeated coitus some
    authors add that the pubic hairs become crisp some recent
    observers it may be remarked have noted a connection between
    sexual excitation and the condition of the pubic hair in women
    cf the present volume ante p 127
    a sign to which the old authors often attached much importance
    was furnished by the urinary stream in the de secretis
    mulierum wrongly attributed to albertus magnus it is laid down
    that the virgin urinates higher than the woman riolan in his
    anthropographia discussing the ability of virgins to ejaculate
    urine to a height states that scaliger had observed women who
    were virgins emit urine in a high jet against a wall but that
    married women could seldom do this bouaciolus also stated that
    the urine of virgins is emitted in a small stream to a distance
    with an acute hissing sound parthenologia p 281 a
    folklore belief in the reality of this influence is evidenced by
    the picardy conte referred to already ante p 53 la
    princesse qui pisse au dessus les meules there is no doubt a
    tendency for the various stresses of sexual life to produce an
    influence in this direction though they act far too slowly and
    uncertainly to be a reliable index to the presence or the absence
    of virginity
    another common ancient test of virginity by urination rests on a
    psychic basis and appears in a variety of forms which are really
    all reducible to the same principle thus we are told in de
    secretis mulierum that to ascertain if a girl is seduced she
    should be given to eat of powdered crocus flowers and if she has
    been seduced she immediately urinates we are here concerned with
    autosuggestion and it may well be believed that with nervous
    and credulous girls this test often revealed the truth
    a further test of virginity discussed by schurig is the presence
    of modesty of countenance if a woman blushes her virtue is safe
    in this way girls who have themselves had experience of the
    marriage bed are said to detect the virgin the virgins eyes are
    cast down and almost motionless while she who has known a man
    has eyes that are bright and quick but this sign is equivocal
    says schurig for girls are different and can simulate the
    modesty they do not feel yet this indication also rests on a
    fundamentally sound psychological basis see the evolution of
    modesty in the first volume of these studies
    in his syllepsilogia section v cap iii published in 1731

    pregnancy the real or imaginary signs of pregnancy sought by
    various primitive peoples of the past and present are brought

both physically and psychically the occurrence of pregnancy is however a
distinct event it marks the beginning of a continuous physical process
which cannot fail to manifest psychic reactions a great center of vital
activitypractically a new center for only the germinal form of it in
menstruation had previously existedhas appeared and affects the whole
organism from the moment that the embryo takes possession of the woman
robert barnes puts it every drop of blood every fiber every organ is
affected170
a woman artist once observed to dr stratz that as the final aim of a
woman is to become a mother and pregnancy is thus her blossoming time a
beautiful woman ought to be most beautiful when she is pregnant that is
so stratz replied if her moment of greatest physical perfection
corresponds with the early months of pregnancy for with the beginning of
pregnancy metabolism is increased the color of the skin becomes more
lively and delicate the breasts firmer171 pregnancy may indeed often
become visible soon after conception by the brighter eye the livelier
glance resulting from greater vascular activity though later with the
increase of strain the face may tend to become somewhat thin and
distorted the hair barnes states assumes a new vigor even though it
may have been falling out before the temperature rises the weight
increases even apart from the growth of the foetus the efflorescence of
pregnancy shows itself as in the blossoming and fecundated flower by
increased pigmentation172 the nipples with their areol and the
midline of the belly become darker brown flecks lentigo tend to
appear on the forehead neck arms and body while striat first
bluered then a brilliant whiteappear on the belly and thighs though
these are scarcely normal for they are not seen in women with very
elastic skins and are rare among peasants and savages173 the whole
carriage of the woman tends to become changed with the development of the
mighty seed of man planted within her it simulates the carriage of pride
with the arched back and protruded abdomen174 the pregnant woman has
been lifted above the level of ordinary humanity to become the casket of
an inestimable jewel
it is in the blood and the circulation that the earliest of the most
prominent symptoms of pregnancy are to be found the ever increasing
development of this new focus of vascular activity involves an increased
vascular activity in the whole organism this activity is present almost
from the firsta few days after the impregnation of the ovumin the
breasts and quickly becomes obvious to inspection and palpation before a
quite passive organ the breast now rapidly increases in activity of
circulation and in size while certain characteristic changes begin to
take place around the nipples175 as a result of the additional work
imposed upon it the heart tends to become slightly hypertrophied in order
to meet the additional strain there may be some dilatation also176
    the recent investigations of stengel and stanton tend to show
    that the increase of the hearts work during pregnancy is less
    considerable than has generally been supposed and that beyond
    some enlargement and dilatation of the right ventricle there is
    not usually any hypertrophy of the heart
the total quantity of blood is raised while increased in quantity the
blood appears on the whole to be somewhat depreciated in quality though
on this point there are considerable differences of opinion thus as
regards hmoglobin some investigators have found that the old idea as to
the poverty of hmoglobin in pregnancy is quite unfounded a few have even
found that the hmoglobin is increased most authorities have found the
red cells diminished though some only slightly while the white cells
and also the fibrin are increased but toward the end of pregnancy there
is a tendency perhaps due to the establishment of compensation for the
blood to revert to the normal condition177
it would appear probable however that the vascular phenomena of
pregnancy are not altogether so simple as the above statement would imply
the activity of various glands at this timewell illustrated by the
marked salivation which sometimes occursindicates that other modifying
forces are at work and it has been suggested that the changes in the
maternal circulation during pregnancy may best be explained by the theory
that there are two opposing kinds of secretion poured into the blood in
unusual degree during pregnancy one contracting the vessels the other
dilating them one or the other sometimes gaining the upper hand
suprarenal extract when administered has a vasoconstricting influence
and thyroid extract a vasodilating influence it may be surmised that
within the body these glands perform similar functions178
the important part played by the thyroid gland is indicated by its marked
activity at the very beginning of pregnancy we may probably associate the
general tendency to vasodilatation during early pregnancy with the
tendency to goitre freund found an increase of the thyroid in 45 per
cent of 50 cases the thyroid belongs to the same class of ductless
glands as the ovary and as bland sutton and others have insisted the
analogies between the thyroid and the ovary are very numerous and
significant it may be added that in recent years armand gautier has noted
the importance of the thyroid in elaborating nucleoproteids containing
arsenic and iodine which are poured into the circulation during
menstruation and pregnancy the whole metabolism of the body is indeed
affected and during the latter part of pregnancy study of the ingesta and
egesta has shown that a storage of nitrogen and even of water is taking
place179 the woman as pinard puts it forms the child out of her own
flesh not merely out of her food the individual is being sacrificed to
the species
the changes in the nervous system of the pregnant woman correspond to
those in the vascular system there is the same increase of activity a
heightening of tension bruno wolff from experiments on bitches
concluded that the central nervous system in women is probably more easily
excited in the pregnant than in the nonpregnant state though he was not
prepared to call this cerebral excitability specific180 direct
observations on pregnant women have shown without doubt a heightened
nervous irritability reflex action generally is increased neumann
investigated the kneejerk in 500 women during pregnancy labor and the
puerperium and in a large number found that there was a progressive
exaggeration with the advance of pregnancy little or no change being
observed in the early months sometimes when no change was observed during
pregnancy the kneejerk still increased during labor reaching its maximum
at the moment of the expulsion of the foetus the return to the normal
condition took place gradually during the puerperium tridandani found in
pregnant women that though the superficial reflexes with the exception of
the abdominal were diminished the deep and tendon reflexes were markedly
increased especially that of the knee these changes being more marked in
primipar than in multipar and more pronounced as pregnancy advanced
the normal condition returning with ten days after labor electrical
excitability was sensibly diminished181
one of the first signs of high nervous tension is vomiting as is well
known this phenomenon commonly appears early in pregnancy and it is by
many considered entirely physiological barnes regards it as a kind of
safety valve a regulating function letting off excessive tension and
maintaining equilibrium182 vomiting is however a convulsion and is
thus the simplest form of a kind of manifestationto which the heightened
nervous tension of pregnancy easily lends itselfthat finds its extreme
pathological form in eclampsia in this connection it is of interest to
point out that the pregnant woman here manifests in the highest degree a
tendency which is marked in women generally for the female sex apart
altogether from pregnancy is specially liable to convulsive
phenomena183
    there is some slight difference of opinion among authorities as
    to the precise nature and causation of the sickness of pregnancy
    barnes horrocks and others regard it as physiological but many
    consider it pathological this is for instance the opinion of
    giles graily hewitt attributed it to flexion of the gravid
    uterus kaltenbach to hysteria and zaborsky terms it a neurosis
    whitridge williams considers that it may be 1 reflex or 2
    neurotic when it is allied to hysteria and amenable to
    suggestion or 3 toxmic it really appears to lie on the
    borderland between healthy and diseased manifestations it is
    said to be unknown to farmers and veterinary surgeons it appears
    to be little known among savages it is comparatively infrequent
    among women of the lower social classes and as giles has found
    women who habitually menstruate in a painless and normal manner
    suffer comparatively little from the sickness of pregnancy
    we owe a valuable study of the sickness of pregnancy to giles
    who analyzed the records of 300 cases he concluded that about
    onethird of the pregnant women were free from sickness
    throughout pregnancy 45 per cent were free during the first
    three months when sickness occurred it began in 70 per cent of
    cases in the first month and was most frequent during the second
    month the duration varied from a few days to all through
    between the ages of 20 and 25 sickness was least frequent and
    there was less sickness in the third than in any other pregnancy
    this corresponds with the conclusion of matthews duncan that 25
    is the most favorable age for pregnancy to some extent in
    agreement with guniot giles believes that the vomiting of
    pregnancy is one form of manifestation of the high nervous
    irritability of pregnancy this high nervous tension may
    overflow into other channels into the vascular and excretory
    system causing eclampsia into the muscular system causing
    chorea or expending itself in the brain give rise to hysteria
    when mild or insanity when severe but the vagi form a very ready
    channel for such overflow and hence the frequency of sickness in
    pregnancy there are thus three main factors in the causation of
    this phenomenon 1 an increased nervous irritability 2 a
    local source of irritation 3 a ready efferent channel for
    nervous energy arthur giles observations on the etiology of
    the sickness of pregnancy transactions obstetrical society of
    london vol xxv 1894
    martin who regards the phenomenon as normal points out that
    when nausea and vomiting are absent or suddenly cease there is
    often reason to suspect something wrong especially the death of
    the embryo he also remarks that women who suffer from large
    varicose veins are seldom troubled by the nausea of pregnancy
    jmh martin the vomiting of pregnancy british medical
    journal december 10 1904 these observations may be connected
    with those of evans american gyncological and obstetrical
    journal january 1900 who attributes primary importance to
    the undoubtedly active factor of the irritation set up by the
    uterus more especially the rhythmic uterine contractions
    stimulation of the breasts produces active uterine contractions
    and evans found that examination of the breasts sufficed to bring
    on a severe attack of vomiting while on another occasion this
    was produced by a vaginal examination evans believes that the
    purpose of these contractions is to facilitate the circulation of
    the blood through the large venous sinuses the surcharging of
    the relatively stagnant pools with effete blood producing the
    irritation which leads to rhythmic contractions
it is on the basis of the increased vascular and glandular activity and
the heightened nervous tension that the special psychic phenomena of
pregnancy develop the best known and perhaps the most characteristic of
these manifestations is that known as longings by this term is meant
more or less irresistible desires for some special food or drink which
may be digestible or indigestible sometimes a substance which the woman
ordinarily likes such as fruit and occasionally one which under
ordinary circumstances she dislikes as in one case known to me of a
young country woman who when bearing her child was always longing for
tobacco and never happy except when she could get a pipe to smoke
although under ordinary circumstances like other young women of her
class she was without any desire to smoke occasionally the longings lead
to actions which are more unscrupulous than is common in the case of the
same person at other times thus in one case known to me a young woman
pregnant with her first child insisted to her sisters horror on entering
a strawberry field and eating a quantity of fruit these longings in
their extreme form may properly be considered as neurasthenic obsessions
but in their simple and less pronounced forms they may well be normal and
healthy
    the old medical authors abound in narratives describing the
    longings of pregnant women for natural and unnatural foods this
    affection was commonly called pica sometimes citra or
    malatia schurig whose works are a comprehensive treasure
    house of ancient medical lore devotes a long chapter cap ii
    of his chylologia published in 1725 to pica as manifested
    mainly though not exclusively in pregnant women some women he
    tells us have been compelled to eat all sorts of earthy
    substances of which sand seems the most common and one italian
    woman when pregnant ate several pounds of sand with much
    satisfaction following it up with a draught of her own urine
    lime mud chalk charcoal cinders pitch are also the desired
    substances in other cases detailed one pregnant woman must eat
    bread fresh from the oven in very large quantities and a certain
    noble matron ate 140 sweet cakes in one day and night wheat and
    various kinds of corn as well as of vegetables were the foods
    desired by many longing women one woman was responsible for 20
    pounds of pepper another ate ginger in large quantities a third
    kept mace under her pillow cinnamon salt emulsion of almonds
    treacle mushrooms were desired by others cherries were longed
    for by one and another ate 30 or 40 lemons in one night various
    kinds of fishmullet oysters crabs live eels etcare
    mentioned while other women have found delectation in lizards
    frogs spiders and flies even scorpions lice and fleas a
    pregnant woman aged 33 of sanguine temperament ate a live fowl
    completely with intense satisfaction skin wool cotton thread
    linen blotting paper have been desired as well as more
    repulsive substances such as nasal mucus and feces eaten with
    bread vinegar ice and snow occur in other cases one woman
    stilled a desire for human flesh by biting the nates of children
    or the arms of men metals are also swallowed such as iron
    silver etc one pregnant woman wished to throw eggs in her
    husbands face and another to have her husband throw eggs in her
    face
    in the next chapter of the same work schurig describes cases of
    acute antipathy which may arise under the same circumstances
    cap iii de nausea seu antipathia certorum ciborum the list
    includes bread meat fowls fish eels a very common
    repulsion crabs milk butter very often cheese often
    honey sugar salt eggs caviar sulphur apples especially
    their odor strawberries mulberries cinnamon mace capers
    pepper onions mustard beetroot rice mint absinthe roses
    many pages are devoted to this antipathy lilies elder
    flowers musk which sometimes caused vomiting amber coffee
    opiates olive oil vinegar cats frogs spiders wasps swords
    more recently gould and pyle anomalies and curiosities of
    medicine p 80 have briefly summarized some of the ancient and
    modern records concerning the longings of pregnant women
various theories are put forward concerning the causation of the longings
of pregnant women but none of these seems to furnish by itself a complete
and adequate explanation of all cases thus it is said that the craving is
the expression of a natural instinct the system of the pregnant woman
really requiring the food she longs for it is quite probable that this is
so in many cases but it is obviously not so in the majority of cases
even when we confine ourselves to the longings for fairly natural foods
while we know so little of the special needs of the organism during
pregnancy that the theory in any case is insusceptible of clear
demonstration
allied to this theory is the explanation that the longings are for things
that counteract the tendency to nausea and sickness giles however in
his valuable statistical study of the longings of a series of 300 pregnant
women has shown that the percentage of women with longings is exactly the
same 33 per cent among women who had suffered at some time during
pregnancy from sickness as among the women who had not so suffered
moreover giles found that the period of sickness frequently bore no
relation to the time when there were cravings and the patient often had
cravings after the sickness had ceased
according to another theory these longings are mainly a matter of
autosuggestion the pregnant woman has received the tradition of such
longings persuades herself that she has such a longing and then becomes
convinced that according to a popular belief it will be bad for the
child if the longing is not gratified giles considers that this process
of autosuggestion takes place in a certain number perhaps even in the
majority of cases184
    the duchess dabrants the wife of marshal junot in her
    mmoires gives an amusing account of how in her first pregnancy
    a longing was apparently imposed upon her by the anxious
    solicitude of her own and her husbands relations though
    suffering from constant nausea and sickness she had no longings
    one day at dinner after the pregnancy had gone on for some months
    her mother suddenly put down her fork exclaiming i have never
    asked you what longing you have she replied with truth that she
    had none her days and her nights being occupied with suffering
    no envie said the mother such a thing was never heard of
    i must speak to your motherinlaw the two old ladies consulted
    anxiously and explained to the young mother how an unsatisfied
    longing might produce a monstrous child and the husband also now
    began to ask her every day what she longed for her
    sisterinlaw moreover brought her all sorts of stories of
    children born with appalling mothers marks due to this cause
    she became frightened and began to wonder what she most wanted
    but could think of nothing at last when eating a pastille
    flavored with pineapple it occurred to her that pineapple is an
    excellent fruit and one moreover which she had never seen for
    at that time it was extremely rare thereupon she began to long
    for pineapple and all the more when she was told that at that
    season they could not be obtained she now began to feel that she
    must have pineapple or die and her husband ran all over paris
    vainly offering twenty louis for a pineapple at last he
    succeeded in obtaining one through the kindness of mme
    bonaparte and drove home furiously just as his wife always
    talking of pineapples had gone to bed he entered the room with
    the pineapple to the great satisfaction of the duchesss mother
    in one of her own pregnancies it appears she longed in vain
    for cherries in january and the child was born with a mark on
    her body resembling a cherryin scientific terminology a
    nvus the duchess effusively thanked her husband and wished
    to eat of the fruit immediately but her husband stopped her and
    said that corvisart the famous physician had told him that she
    must on no account touch it at night as it was extremely
    indigestible she promised not to do so and spent the night in
    caressing the pineapple in the morning the husband came and cut
    up the fruit presenting it to her in a porcelain bowl suddenly
    however there was a revulsion of feeling she felt that she
    could not possibly eat pineapple persuasion was useless the
    fruit had to be taken away and the windows opened for the very
    smell of it had become odious the duchess adds that henceforth
    throughout her life though still liking the flavor she was only
    able to eat pineapple by doing a sort of violence to herself

the influence of suggestion must certainly be accepted as at all events
increasing and emphasizing the tendency to longings it can scarcely
however be regarded as a radical and adequate explanation of the
phenomenon generally if it is a matter of autosuggestion due to a
tradition then we should expect to find longings most frequent and most
pronounced in multiparous women who are best acquainted with the
tradition and best able to experience all that is expected of a pregnant
woman but as a matter of fact the women who have borne most children
are precisely those who are least likely to be affected by the longings
which tradition demands they should manifest giles has shown that
longings occur much more frequently in the first than in any subsequent
pregnancy there is a regular decrease with the increase in number of
pregnancies until in women with ten or more children the longings scarcely
occur at all
we must probably regard longings as based on a physiological and psychic
tendency which is of universal extension and almost or quite normal they
are known throughout europe and were known to the medical writers of
antiquity old indian as well as old jewish physicians recognized them
they have been noted among many savage races today among the indians of
north and south america among the peoples of the nile and the soudan in
the malay archipelago185 in europe they are most common among the
women of the people living simple and natural lives186
the true normal relationship of the longings of pregnancy is with the
impulsive and often irresistible longings for food delicacies which are
apt to overcome children and in girls often persist or revive through
adolescence and even beyond such sudden fits of greediness belong to
those kind of normal psychic manifestations which are on the verge of the
abnormal into which they occasionally pass they may occur however in
healthy wellbred and wellbehaved children who under the stress of the
sudden craving will without compunction and apparently without
reflection steal the food they long for or even steal from their parents
the money to buy it the food thus seized by a wellnigh irresistible
craving is nearly always a fruit fruit is usually doled out to children
in small quantities as a luxury but we are descended from primitive human
peoples and still more remote apelike ancestors by whom fruit was in its
season eaten copiously and it is not surprising that when that season
comes round the child more sensitive than the adult to primitive
influences should sometimes experience the impulse of its ancestors with
overwhelming intensity all the more so if as is probable the craving is
to some extent the expression of a physiological need
    sanford bell who has investigated the food impulses of children
    in america finds that girls have a greater number of likes and
    dislikes in foods than boys of the same age though at the same
    time they have less dislikes to some foods than boys the
    proclivity for sweets and fruits shows itself as soon as a child
    begins to eat solids the chief fruits liked are oranges
    bananas apples peaches and pears this strong preference for
    fruits lasts till the age of 13 or 14 though relatively weaker
    from 10 to 13 in girls however bell notes the significant fact
    from our present point of view that at midadolescence there is a
    revived taste for sweets and fruits he believes that the growth
    of children in taste in foods recapitulates the experience of the
    race s bell an introductory study of the psychology of
    foods pedagogical seminary march 1904
the heightened nervous impressionability of pregnancy would appear to
arouse into activity those primitive impulses which are liable to occur in
childhood and in the unmarried girl continue to the nubile age it is a
significant fact that the longings of pregnant women are mainly for fruit
and notably for so wholesome a fruit as the apple which may very well
have a beneficial effect on the system of the pregnant woman giles in
his tabulation of the foods longed for by 300 pregnant women found that
the fruit group was by far the largest furnishing 79 cases apples were
far away at the head occurring in 34 cases out of the 99 who had
longings while oranges followed at a distance with 13 cases and in the
vegetable group tomatoes came first with 6 cases several women declared
i could have lived on apples i was eating apples all day i used to
sit up in bed eating apples187 pregnant women appear seldom to long
for the possession of objects outside the edible class and it seems
doubtful whether they have any special tendency to kleptomania pinard has
pointed out that neither lasgue nor lunier in their studies of
kleptomania have mentioned a single shop robbery committed by a pregnant
woman188 brouardel has indeed found such cases but the object stolen
was usually a food
a further significant fact connecting the longings of pregnant women with
the longings of children is to be found in the fact that they occur mainly
in young women we have indeed no tabulation of the ages of pregnant
women who have manifested longings but giles has clearly shown that these
chiefly occur in primipar and steadily and rapidly decrease in each
successive pregnancy this fact otherwise somewhat difficult of
explanation is natural if we look upon the longings of pregnancy as a
revival of those of childhood it certainly indicates also that we can by
no means regard these longings as exclusively the expression of a
physiological craving for in that case they would be liable to occur in
any pregnancy unless indeed it is argued that with each successive
pregnancy the woman becomes less sensitive to her own physiological state
    there has been a frequent tendency more especially among
    primitive peoples to regard a pregnant womans longings as
    something sacred and to be indulged all the more no doubt as
    they are usually of a simple and harmless character in the black
    forest according to ploss and bartels a pregnant woman may go
    freely into other peoples gardens and take fruit provided she
    eats it on the spot and very similar privileges are accorded to
    her elsewhere old english opinion as reflected for instance
    in ben jonsons plays as dr harriet cb alexander has pointed
    out regards the pregnant woman as not responsible for her
    longings and kiernan remarks kleptomania and collectivism
    alienist and neurologist november 1902 that this is in a
    most natural and just view in france at the revolution a law of
    the 28th germinal in the year iii to some extent admitted the
    irresponsibility of the pregnant woman generallyfollowing the
    classic precedent by which a woman could not be brought before a
    court of justice so long as she was pregnantbut the napoleonic
    code never tender to women abrogated this pinard does not
    consider that the longings of pregnant women are irresistible
    and consequently regards the pregnant woman as responsible
    this is probably the view most widely held in any case these
    longings seldom come up for medicolegal consideration
the phenomena of the longings of pregnancy are linked to the much more
obscure and dubious phenomena of the influence of maternal impressions on
the child within the womb it is true indeed that there is no real
connection whatever between these two groups of manifestations but they
have been so widely and for so long closely associated in the popular mind
that it is convenient to pass directly from one to the other the same
name is sometimes given to the two manifestations thus in france a
pregnant longing is an envie while a mothers mark on the child is also
called an envie because it is supposed to be due to the mothers
unsatisfied longing
the conception of a maternal impression the german versehen rests on
the belief that a powerful mental influence working on the mothers mind
may produce an impression either general or definite on the child she is
carrying it makes a great deal of difference whether the effect of the
impression on the child is general or definite and circumscribed it is
not difficult to believe that a general effecteven as sir arthur
mitchell first gave good reason for believing idiocymay be produced on
the child by strong and prolonged emotional influence working on the
mother because such general influence may be transmitted through a
deteriorated bloodstream but it is impossible at present to understand
how a definite and limited influence working on the mother could produce a
definite and limited effect on the child for there are no channels of
nervous communications for the passage of such influences our difficulty
in conceiving of the process must however be put aside if the fact
itself can be demonstrated by convincing evidence
    in order to illustrate the nature of maternal impressions i will
    summarize a few cases which i have collected from the best
    medical periodical literature during the past fifteen years i
    have exercised no selection and in no way guarantee the

the belief in the reality of the transference of strong mental or physical
impressions on the mother into physical changes in the child she is
bearing is very ancient and widespread most writers on the subject begin
with the book of genesis and the astute device of jacob in influencing the
color of his lambs by mental impressions on his ewes but the belief
exists among even more primitive people than the early hebrews and in all
parts of the world189 among the greeks there is a trace of the belief
in hippocrates the first of the worlds great physicians while soranus
the most famous of ancient gyncologists states the matter in the most
precise manner with instances in proof the belief continued to persist
unquestioned throughout the middle ages the first author who denied the
influence of maternal impressions altogether appears to have been the
famous anatomist realdus columbus who was a professor at padua pisa
and rome at the beginning of the sixteenth century in the same century
however another and not less famous neapolitan della porta for the
first time formulated a definite theory of maternal impressions a little
later early in the seventeenth century a philosophic physician at padua
fortunatus licetus took up an intermediate position which still finds
perhaps reasonably a great many adherents he recognized that a very
frequent cause of malformation in the child is to be found in morbid
antenatal conditions but at the same time was not prepared to deny
absolutely and in every case the influence of maternal impression on such
conditions malebranche the platonic philosopher allowed the greatest
extension to the power of the maternal imagination in the eighteenth
century however the new spirit of free inquiry of radical criticism
and unfettered logic led to a sceptical attitude toward this ancient
belief then flourishing vigorously190 in 1727 a few years after
malebranches death james blondel a physician of extreme acuteness who
had been born in paris was educated at leyden and practiced in london
published the first methodical and thorough attack on the doctrine of
maternal impressions the strength of imagination of pregnant women
examined and exercised his great ability in ridiculing it haller
roederer and smmering followed in the steps of blondel and were either
sceptical or hostile to the ancient belief blumenbach however admitted
the influence of maternal impressions erasmus darwin as well as goethe
in his wahlverwandtschaften even accepted the influence of paternal
impressions on the child by the beginning of the nineteenth century the
majority of physicians were inclined to relegate maternal impressions to
the region of superstition yet the exceptions were of notable importance
burdach when all deductions were made still found it necessary to retain
the belief in maternal impressions and von baer the founder of
embryology also accepted it supported by a case occurring in his own
sister which he was able to investigate before the childs birth lwt
bischoff also while submitting the doctrine to acute criticism found it
impossible to reject maternal impressions absolutely and he remarked that
the number of adherents to the doctrine was showing a tendency to increase
rather than diminish johannes mller the founder of modern physiology in
germany declared himself against it and his influence long prevailed
valentin rudolf wagner and emil du boisreymond were on the same side
on the other hand various eminent gyncologistslitzmann roth hennig
etchave argued in favor of the reality of maternal impressions191
the long conflict of opinion which has taken place over this opinion has
still left the matter unsettled the acutest critics of the ancient
belief constantly conclude the discussion with an expression of doubt and
uncertainty even if the majority of authorities are inclined to reject
maternal impressions the scientific eminence of those who accept them
makes a decisive opinion difficult the arguments against such influence
are perfectly sound 1 it is a primitive belief of unscientific origin
2 it is impossible to conceive how such influence can operate since
there is no nervous connection between mother and child 3 comparatively
few cases have been submitted to severe critical investigation 4 it is
absurd to ascribe developmental defects to influences which arise long
after the foetus had assumed its definite shape192 5 in any case the
phenomenon must be rare for william hunter could not find a coincidence
between maternal impressions and foetal marks through a period of several
years and bischoff found no case in 11000 deliveries these statements
embody the whole of the argument against maternal impressions yet it is
clear that they do not settle the matter edgar in a manual of obstetrics
which is widely regarded as a standard work states that this is yet a
mooted question193 ballantyne again in a discussion of this
influence at the edinburgh obstetrical society summarizing the result of
a years inquiry concluded that it is still sub judice194 in a
subsequent discussion of the question he has somewhat modified his
opinion and is inclined to deny that definite impressions on the pregnant
womans mind can cause similar defects in the foetus they are accidental
coincidences but he adds that a few of the cases are difficult to
explain away at the same time he fully believes that prolonged and
strongly marked mental states of the mother may affect the development of
the foetus in her uterus causing vascular and nutritive disturbances
irregularities of development and idiocy195
    whether and in how far mental impressions on the mother can
    produce definite mental and emotional disposition in the child is
    a special aspect of the question to which scarcely any inquiry
    has been devoted so distinguished a biologist as mr aw
    wallace has however called attention to this point bringing
    forward evidence on the question and emphasizing the need of
    further investigation such transmission of mental influence
    he remarks will hardly be held to be impossible or even very
    improbable aw wallace prenatal influences on character
    nature august 24 1893
it has already been pointed out that a large number of cases of foetal
deformities supposed to be due to maternal impressions cannot possibly
be so caused because the impression took place at a period when the
development of the foetus must already have been decided in this
connection however it must be noted that dabney has observed a
relationship between the time of supposed mental impressions and the
nature of the actual defect which is of considerable significance as an
argument in favor of the influence of mental impressions he tabulated 90
carefully reported cases from recent medical literature and found that 21
of them were concerned with defects of structure of the lips and palate
in all but 2 of these 21 the defect was referred to an impression
occurring within the first three months of pregnancy this is an important
point as showing that the assigned cause really falls within a period when
a defect of development actually could produce the observed result
although the person reporting the cases was in many instances manifestly
ignorant of the details of embryology and teratology there was no such
preponderance of early impressions among the defects of skin and hair
which might well so far as development is concerned have been caused at
a later period here in 7 out of 15 cases it was distinctly stated that
the impression was made later than the fourth month196
it would seem on the whole that while the influence of maternal
impressions in producing definite effects on the child within the womb has
by no means been positively demonstrated we are not entitled to reject it
with any positive assurance even if we accept it however it must
remain for the present an inexplicable fact the modus operandi we can
scarcely even guess at general influences from the mother on the child we
can easily conceive of as conveyed by the mothers blood we can even
suppose that the modified blood might act specifically on one particular
kind of tissue we can again as suggested by fr very well believe
that the maternal emotions act upon the womb and produce various kinds and
degrees of pressure on the child within so that the apparently active
movements of the foetus may be really consecutive on unconscious maternal
excitations197 we may also believe that as suggested by john thomson
there are slight incordinations in utero a kind of developmental
neurosis produced by some slight lack of harmony of whatever origin and
leading to the production of malformations198 we know finally that
as fr and others have repeatedly demonstrated during recent years by
experiments on chickens etc very subtle agents even odors may
profoundly affect embryonic development and produce deformity but how the
mothers psychic disposition can apart from heredity affect specifically
the physical conformation or even the psychic disposition of the child
within her womb must remain for the present an insoluble mystery even if
we feel disposed to conclude that in some cases such action seems to be
indicated
    in comprehending such a connection however at present
    undemonstrated it may well be borne in mind that the
    relationship of the mother to the child within her womb is of a
    uniquely intimate character it is of interest in this
    connection to quote some remarks by an able psychologist dr
    henry rutgers marshall the remarks are not less interesting for
    being brought forward without any connection with the question of
    maternal impressions it is true that so far as we know the
    nervous system of the embryo never has a direct connection with
    the nervous system of the mother nevertheless as there is a
    reciprocity of reaction between the physical body of the mother
    and its embryonic parasite the relation of the embryonic nervous
    system to the nervous system of the mother is not very far
    removed from the relation of the preeminent part of the nervous
    system of a man to some minor nervous system within his body
    which is to a marked extent dissociated from the whole neural
    mass
    correspondingly then and within the consciousness of the
    mother there develops a new little minor consciousness which
    although but lightly integrated with the mass of her
    consciousness nevertheless has its part in her consciousness
    taken as a whole much as the psychic correspondents of the
    action of the nerve which govern the secretions of the glands of
    the body have their part in her consciousness taken as a whole
    it is very much as if the optic ganglia developed fully in
    themselves without any closer connection with the rest of the
    brain than existed at their first appearance they would form a
    little complex nervous system almost but not quite apart from the
    brain system and it would be difficult to deny them a
    consciousness of their own which would indeed form part of the
    whole consciousness of the individual but which would be in a
    manner selfdependent it must if this is so be said that
    before birth on the psychic side the embryos activities form
    part of a complex consciousness which is that of the mother and
    embryo together without subscribing to the strange stories of
    telepathy of the solemn apparition of a person somewhere at the
    moment of his death a thousand miles away of the unquiet ghost
    haunting the scenes of its bygone hopes and endeavors one may
    ask with the author of the address in medicine at the leicester
    gathering of the british medical association british medical
    journal july 29 1905 whether two brains cannot be so tuned
    in sympathy as to transmit and receive a subtile transfusion of
    mind without mediation of sense considering what is implied by
    the human brain with its countless millions of cells its
    complexities of minute structure its innumerable chemical
    compositions and the condensed forces in its microscopic and
    ultramicroscopic elementsthe whole a sort of microcosm of
    cosmic forces to which no conceivable compound of electric
    batteries is comparable considering again that from an
    electric station waves of energy radiate through the viewless air
    to be caught up by a fit receiver a thousand miles distant it is
    not inconceivable that the human brain may send off still more
    subtile waves to be accepted and interpreted by the fitly tuned
    receiving brain is it after all mere fancy that a mental
    atmosphere or effluence emanates from one person to affect
    another either soothing sympathetically or irritating
    antipathically these remarks like dr marshalls were made
    without reference to maternal impressions but it may be pointed
    out that under no conceivable circumstance could we find a brain
    in so virginal and receptive a state as is the childs in the
    womb
on the whole we see that pregnancy induces a psychic state which is at
once in healthy persons one of full development and vigor and at the
same time one which especially in individuals who are slightly abnormal
is apt to involve a state of strained or overstrained nervous tension and
to evoke various manifestations which are in many respects still
imperfectly understood even the specifically sexual emotions tend to be
heightened more especially during the earlier period of pregnancy in 24
cases of pregnancy in which the point was investigated by harry campbell
sexual feeling was decidedly increased in 8 in one case of a woman aged
31 who had had four children being indeed only present during pregnancy
when it was considerable in only 7 cases was there diminution or
disappearance of sexual feeling199 pregnancy may produce mental
depression200 but on the other hand it frequently leads to a change of
the most favorable character in the mental and general wellbeing some
women indeed are only well during pregnancy it is remarkable that some
women who habitually suffer from various nervous troublesneuralgias
gastralgia headache insomniaare only free from them at this moment
this paradox of gestation as vinay has termed it is specially marked
in the hysterical and those suffering from slight nervous disorders but
it is by no means universal so that although it is possible vinay
states to confirm the opinion of the ancients as to the beneficial
action of marriage on hysteria that is only true of slight cases and
scarcely enables us to counsel marriage in hysteria201 even a womans
intelligence is sometimes heightened by pregnancy and tarnier as quoted
by vinay knew many women whose intelligence habitually somewhat obtuse
has only risen to the normal level during pregnancy202 the pregnant
woman has reached the climax of womanhood she has attained to that state
toward which the periodically recurring menstrual wave has been drifting
her at regular intervals throughout her sexual life203 she has achieved
that function for which her body has been constructed and her mental and
emotional disposition adapted through countless ages
and yet as we have seen our ignorance of the changes effected by the
occurrence of this supremely important eventeven on the physical
sidestill remains profound pregnancy even for us the critical and
unprejudiced children of a civilized age still remains as for the
children of more primitive ages a mystery conception itself is a mystery
for the primitive man and may be produced by all sorts of subtle ways
apart from sexual connection even by smelling a flower204 the pregnant
woman was surrounded by ceremonies by reverence and fear often shut up
in a place apart205 her presence her exhalations were of extreme
potency even in some parts of europe today as in the walloon districts

has somewhat changed its form it still remains the future of the race is

misapplied horror that there is nothing a woman is less modest about than
the state of pregnancy while weininger exclaims never yet has a

contemplate the mystery of pregnancy and all that it involves how trivial
all such considerations become we are here lifted into a region where our
highest intelligence can only lead us to adoration for we are gazing at a
process in which the operations of nature become one with the divine task
of creation

groos observes the entrance of another instinct the impulse to tend and
foster so closely connected with the sexual life it is seemingly due to
the cooperation of this impulse that the little female bird during
courtship is so often fed by the male like a young fledgling in man
love from the biological standpoint is also an amalgamation of two
needs when the tender need to protect and foster and serve is lacking the
emotion is not quite perfect heines expression with my mantle i
protect you from the storm has always seemed to me very characteristic
sometimes the sexual impulse may undergo a complete transformation in this
direction i believe there is really a tendency in women a lady writes
in a letter to allow maternal feeling to take the place of sexual
feeling very often a womans feeling for her husband becomes this though
he may be twenty years older than herself sometimes it does not
remaining purely sex feeling sometimes it is for some other man she has
this curious selfobliterating maternal feeling it is not necessarily
connected with sex intercourse a prostitute who has relations with
dozens of men may have it for some feeble drunken fool who perhaps goes
after other women i once saw the change from sex feeling to mother
feeling as i call it come almost suddenly over a woman after she had
lived about four years with a man who was unfaithful to her then when
all real sex feeling the hatred of the woman he followed the desire he
should give her love and tenderness had all gone came the other feeling
and she said to me you dont understand at all hes only my little
baby nothing he does can make any difference to me now as i grow older
and understand womens natures better i can see almost at once which
relation it is a woman has to her husband or any given man it is this
feeling and not sex passion that keeps woman from being free not only
is there a sexual association in the impulse to foster and protect there
would appear to be a similar element also in the response to that impulse
freud has especially insisted on the partly sexual character of the
childs feelings for those who care for it and tend it and satisfy its
needs it is begun in earliest infancy whoever has seen the sated infant
sink back from the breast to fall asleep with flushed cheeks and happy
smile must say that the picture is adequate to the expression of the
sexual satisfaction of later life the lips moreover are the earliest
erogenous zone there will perhaps be some opposition freud remarks
drei abhandlungen zur sexualtheorie pp 36 64 to the
identification of the childs feelings of tenderness and appreciation for
those who tend it with sexual love but i believe that exact psychological
analysis will place the identity beyond doubt the relationship of the
child with the person who tends it is for it a continual source of sexual
excitement and satisfaction flowing from the erogenous zones especially
since the fostering personas a rule the motherregards the child with
emotions which proceed from her sexual life strokes it kisses it rocks
it and very plainly treats it as a compensation for a fully valid sexual
object freud remarks that girls who retain the childish character of
their love for their parents to adult age are apt to make cold wives and
to be sexually ansthetic

appendix
histories of sexual development
    history ithe following narrative has been written by a
    university man trained in psychology
    so far as i have been able to learn none of my ancestors for at
    least three generations have suffered from any nervous or mental
    disease and of those more remote i can learn nothing at all it
    appears probable then that any peculiarities of my own sexual
    development must be explained by reference to the somewhat
    peculiar environment
    i was the first child and was naturally somewhat spoileda
    process which tended to increase my natural tendency to
    sentimentality on the other hand i was shy and undemonstrative
    with all except my nearest relatives and with them as well after
    my seventh or eighth year and here it may be well to describe my
    mental type as this is probably the most important factor in
    determining the direction of ones mental development of mental
    types the visual is of course by far the most common but in
    my own case visual imagery was never strong or vivid and has
    constantly grown weaker the dominant part has been played by
    tactual muscular and organic sensations placing me as one of
    the tactual motor type with strong verbal motor and
    organic tendencies in reading a novel i seldom have a mental
    picture of the character or situation but easily imagine the
    sensations except the visual and feel something of the emotions
    described when telling of any event i have a strong impulse to
    make the movements described and to gesticulate i remember
    events in terms of movements and the words to be used in giving
    an account of them and in thinking of any subject i can feel the
    movements of the larynx and in a less degree of the lips and
    tongue that would be involved in putting my thoughts into words
    i am easily moved to emotion even to sentimentality but am
    seldom if ever deeply affected and am so averse to any display of
    my feelings that i have the reputation among my acquaintances of
    being cold unfeeling and unemotional i am naturally quiet and
    bashful to a degree which has rendered all forms of social
    intercourse painful through much of my life and this in spite of
    a real longing to associate with people on terms of intimacy as
    a child i was sensitive and solitary later i became morbid as
    well in a character so constituted the feelings and impulses of
    the moment are likely to rule and such has been my constant
    experience though a large element of obstinacy in my character
    has kept me from appearing impulsive and slight influences will
    bring about reactions which seem out of all proportion to their
    cause for instance i cannot even now read the more erotic of
    boccaccios stories without a good deal of sexual excitement and
    restlessness which can be relieved only by vigorous exercise or
    masturbation
    the first ten years of my life were passed on a farm most of the
    time without playmates or companions of my own age
    as far back as i can remember i indulged in elaborate daydreams
    in which i figured as the chief character along with a few others
    who were chiefly creatures of my imagination but at times
    borrowed from reality these others were always boys until i
    learned the proper function of the sexual organs when girls
    usurped the whole stage in numbers beyond the limits of a turkish
    harem even at school my daydreams were scarcely interrupted
    for my shyness and timidity made me very unpopular among my
    schoolmates who tormented me after the fashion of small boys or
    neglected me as the spirit moved them to make matters worse i
    was brought up under the sheltered life system kept carefully
    away from the bad boys which category included nearly all the
    youngsters of the community and deluged with moral homilies and
    tirades on things religious until i was thoroughly convinced that
    goodness and discomfort the right and the unpleasant were
    strictly synonymous and i was kept through much of the time
    facing the prospect of an early death to be followed by the good
    old orthodox hell or the equal miseries of its gorgeous
    alternative i may say in all seriousness that this is a
    conservative and unexaggerated account of one phase of my early
    lifethe one i think that tended most strongly to make me
    introspective and morbid later on when i was trying to abandon
    the habit of masturbation this early training greatly increased
    the despair i felt at each successive failure
    the first traces of sexual excitement that i can now recall
    occurred when i was about 4 years old i had erections quite
    frequently and found a mild pleasure in fondling my genitals when
    these occurred especially just after waking in the morning i
    had no notion of an orgasm and never succeeded in producing one
    until i was 13 years of age in the summer of my sixth year i
    experienced pleasurable sensations in daubing my genitals with
    oil and then fondling or rubbing them but i abandoned this
    amusement after getting some irritating substance into the
    meatus a year later my mother warned me that playing with my
    penis would make me very sick but since experience had taught
    me that this was not true my conviction that what was forbidden
    must necessarily be pleasant sent me directly to my favorite
    retreat in the barn loft to experiment since however i failed
    in spite of persistent effort to produce any such pleasant
    results as i had expected i soon gave up my attempts for other
    kinds of amusement
    a few months after this in midsummer a very sensual servant
    girl began a series of attempts to satisfy herself sexually with
    my help she came nearly every day into the loft where i was
    playing and did her best to initiate me into the mysteries of
    sexual relationships but i proved a sorry pupil she would rub
    my penis until it became erect and then placing me upon her
    would insert the penis in her vulva and make movements of her
    thighs and hips calculated to cause friction at times she varied
    the program by lying upon me and embracing me passionately i can
    remember distinctly her quick gasping breath and convulsive
    movements she generally ended the seance by persuading me to
    perform cunnilingus upon her none of these performances were
    intelligible to me and i invariably protested against being
    compelled to leave my play to amuse her even her fondling of my
    genitals annoyed me and stranger still i preferred satisfying
    her by cunnilingus to the attempts at coitus
    it was nearly a year later that i experienced the first
    unmistakable manifestations of the sexual impulseerections
    accompanied by lustful feeling and vague desires of whose proper
    satisfaction i had no notion whatever it never occurred to me to
    associate my experiences with the servant girl with these new
    sensations the peculiar fact about them was that they were
    generally occasioned by the infliction of pain upon animals i do
    not remember how i first discovered that they could be evoked in
    this way but i can clearly recollect many of my efforts to
    arouse this pleasurable excitement by abusing the dog or the
    cats or by prodding the calves with a nail set in the end of a
    broom handle i seldom manipulated my genitals at this time and
    when i did it was for the purpose of causing sexual excitement
    rather than allaying it
    during this same year i got my first idea of sexual intercourse
    by watching animals copulate but my powers of observation must
    have been limited for i supposed that the penis of the male
    entered the anus of the female in watching the coitus of animals
    i experienced lively sexual excitement and lustful sensations
    located not only in the genitals but apparently in the anus as
    well i often excited myself by imagining myself playing the
    part of the female animala peculiar combination of passive
    pederasty and bestiality a servant girl put me to right on the
    error of observation just mentioned but neglected to apply the
    principle to human animals and i remained for another year in
    complete ignorance of the structure of womans sexual organs and
    of the intercourse between man and woman in the meantime i
    cultivated my fancies of intercourse with animals often still
    perversely imagining myself taking the part of the female and
    the notion of such relationships gradually became so familiar as
    to seem possible and desirable this is especially significant in
    view of later developments
    up to my eleventh or twelfth year the erotic element in my
    daydreaming varied with the seasons in the summer it played a
    dominant part while in the winter it was almost entirely absent
    owing it may be to the fact that most of my time was spent
    indoors or on long tiresome tramps to and from school and the
    further fact that during the winter i saw but little of the
    animals which had acted as a stimulus to sexual excitement so
    little was i troubled in winter and so ignorant was i of normal
    intercourse that sleeping with a cousin a girl of about my own
    age 7 or 8 years resulted in no addition to my knowledge of
    things sexual
    it was early in my ninth year that i first learned something of
    the anatomical difference between man and woman and of the
    functions of the sexual organs in coitus these were explained to
    me by a young male servant who however told me nothing of
    conception or pregnancy at first i was very little interested
    as it did not immediately occur to me to associate my own erotic
    experiences with the matter of these revelations but under the
    faithful tuition of my new instructor i soon began to desire
    normal coitus and my interest in the sexual affairs of animals
    weakened accordingly his teachings went still further for he
    masturbated before me then persuaded me to masturbate him and
    finally practiced coitus inter femora upon me he also tried to
    masturbate me but was unable to produce an orgasm though i
    found the experiment mildly pleasurable
    early in my eleventh year we left the farm and lived in the city
    for several months in the meantime there had been no
    developments in my sexual life beyond what has already been
    indicated in the city i found so much to interest and amuse me
    that i almost entirely forgot my erotic daydreams and desires
    though my chief playmates were two girls of about my own age i
    never thought of attempting sexual intercourse with them as i
    might easily have done for they were much wiser and more
    experienced in these things than myself shortly before the end
    of our stay in town an older schoolmate explained to me as much
    of the process of reproduction as is usually known by a
    precocious youngster of 12 years but i firmly refused to credit
    his statements he adduced the fact of lactation in proof of the
    correctness of his views but i had been too thoroughly steeped
    in supernaturalism to be very amenable to naturalistic evidence
    of this sort and remained obdurate but the suggestion stayed
    with me and perplexed me not a little when we returned to the
    farm i began to watch the reproductive process in animals
    the following two years were decidedly unpleasant i was growing
    rapidly and was sluggish awkward and stupid at school i was
    more unpopular than ever and seemed to have a positive genius
    for doing the wrong thing on the rare occasions when my
    companions admitted me to their counsels i was a willing dupe and
    catspaw with the result that i was much in trouble with my
    teachers being morbidly sensitive i suffered keenly under these
    circumstances and as my health was not at all good i often made
    of my frequent headaches excuses to stay at home where i would
    lie abed brooding over my small troubles or more often dreaming
    erotic daydreams and making repeated attempts to produce an
    orgasm but though these efforts were accompanied by the most
    lustful thoughts and my imagination created situations of
    oriental extravagance i was 13 years old when they first met
    with success i remember the occasion very distinctly the more
    so because i thought of it much and bitterly when shortly
    afterwards i tried to abandon a habit which the family doctor
    book assured me must result in every variety of damnation at
    the moment however i was greatly surprised and gratified and
    tried at once to repeat the delightful sensation but was unable
    to do so until the following day from that time to the present i
    think i have masturbated an average of ten times per week and
    this is certainly a very conservative estimate for though up to
    my sixteenth year i could seldom produce an orgasm more than once
    a day i have often during the last four or five years produced
    it from four to seven times per day without difficulty and this
    for days and even weeks in succession during these periods of
    excessive masturbation very little liquid was ejaculated and the
    pleasurable sensations were slight or entirely lacking
    from the time when i began masturbating regularly practically my
    whole interest centered in things pertaining to sex i read the
    chapters of the family doctor book which treated of sexual
    matters my daydreams were almost exclusively erotic i sought
    opportunities to talk about sexrelationships with my
    schoolmates with whom i was now slowly getting on better terms
    i collected pictures of nude women learned a great number of
    obscene stories read such obscene books as i could obtain and
    even searched the dictionary for words having a sexual
    connotation up to my fifteenth year when ejaculation of semen
    began there was a strong sadistic coloring to my daydreams
    through this period too my bashfulness in the presence of the
    opposite sex increased until it reached the point of absurdity
    when fifteen years old i began to practice coitus inter femora on
    my brother and continued it intermittently for about two years
    the experience was disappointing for i had confidently expected
    a great increase of pleasure over masturbation in this act and
    in casting about for some stronger stimulus i recurred to the
    forgotten idea of intercourse with animals i promptly tried to
    put the idea to a test but failed several times and finally
    succeeded only to find that the result fell far short of my
    expectations nevertheless i continued the practice irregularly
    for about three yearsor rather through that part of the three
    years that i spent at home for while i was at school opportunity
    for such indulgence was lacking long familiarity with the idea
    of intercourse with animals had made it impossible for me to feel
    the disgust with the practice which it inspires in most people
    and even the perusal of exodus xxii 19 failed to make me abandon
    it firmly as i believed in the mosaic law the supremacy of the
    sexual impulse was complete
    as early as my sixteenth year i tried to abandon selfabuse in
    all its forms and have repeatedly made the same effort since that
    time but never with more than very partial success on two or
    three occasions i have stopped for periods of several weeks but
    only to begin again and indulge more recklessly than before the
    deep depression which followed each failure and often each act
    of masturbation i attributed solely to the loss of semen
    leaving out of account the fact that i expected to feel depressed
    and the utter discouragement and selfcontempt which accompanied
    the sense of failure and weakness when in the face of my
    resolution i repeatedly gave way and yielded to the temptation
    to an act whose consequences i firmly believed must be ruinous i
    am now convinced that by far the greater part of this depression
    was due to suggestion and the humiliating sense of defeat and
    this feeling of moral impotence this seeming helplessness
    against an overpowering impulse which on the other hand seemed
    so trivial when viewed without passion eventually weakened my
    selfcontrol to a degree guessed by no one but myself and sapped
    the foundations of my moral life in a way which i have constant
    occasion to deplore
    the foregoing paragraphs give i think a fair idea of my
    condition when i left home for a boarding school at the beginning
    of my seventeenth year from this time my experiences may be said
    to have run on in two distinct cyclesthat of the summer months
    when i was at home and that of the remainder of the year when i
    was at school this fact will make some confusion and apparent
    inconsistency in the rest of this history unavoidable when i
    left home i was shy retiring totally ignorant of social usage
    without selfconfidence unambitious dreamy and subject to fits
    of melancholy i masturbated at least once a day though i was in
    almost constant rebellion against the habit in my more idle
    moments i elaborated erotic day dreams in which there was a
    peculiar mixture of the purely sensual and the purely ideal
    element which never fused in my experience but held the field
    alternately or mingled somewhat in the manner of air and water
    one person usually served as the object of my ideal attachment
    another as the center round which i grouped my sensual dreams and
    desires
    at school i found more congenial companions than i had fallen in
    with elsewhere and the necessary contact with people of both
    sexes gradually wore off some of the rougher corners and brought
    a measure of selfconfidence i had two or three incipient love
    affairs which my backwardness kept from growing serious out of
    this change of environment came a sense of expansion of escape
    from self which was distinctly pleasant i still masturbated
    regularly but no longer experienced the former depression except
    when at home during vacation relatively to the past life was
    now so varied and interesting that i had less and less time for
    melancholy and the discovery that i could lead my classes and
    hold my own in athletic sports seemed to indicate that my past
    fears had been exaggerated nevertheless i was never reconciled
    to the habit and often rebelled at the weakness that kept me its
    slave
    when i entered the university the effects of my useless struggle
    with the practice of masturbation were pretty well developed i
    could no longer fix my attention steadily upon my work and found
    that only by cribbing and bluffing could i keep my place at
    the head of my classes i was troubled not a little by the
    shoddiness of my work and tried again and again during the
    course of the two years spent at this college to shake off the
    habit at the university i was introduced gradually to a wider
    social circle and so far outgrew my bashfulness that i began to
    seek the society of the opposite sex assiduously as i gained
    selfconfidence i became reckless getting at one time into
    serious trouble with the authorities which came near resulting in
    my expulsion i became one of the more popular members of the
    clique to which i belongedmuch to my surprise and even more to
    that of my acquaintances the physical culture craze attacked me
    at this time and my pet ambition was the attainment of strength
    and agility my bump of vanity also grew apace but an unmeasured
    hatred of all kinds of foppishness kept me on the safe side of
    moderation in my dress and behavior
    during my second year of university life i had two love affairs
    in the course of which i found that my interest in any particular
    member of the fair sex disappeared as soon as it was returned
    the pursuit was fascinating enough but i cared nothing at all
    for the prize when once it was within reach i may add that the
    interest i had in the girls was purely ideal while at this
    school i do not think i masturbated half as often as while at the
    preparatory school
    when i left this college for  university i took with me a
    formidable catalogue of good resolutions first among which was
    the determination to abandon all kinds of selfabuse i think i
    kept this one about a month as i had gone from a comparatively
    small school to one of the largest of american universities the
    change was great and the revelations it brought me frequently
    humiliating i was lonesome homesick and my bump of
    selfesteem was woefully bruised and not unnaturally i soon
    began to seek a partial solace in daydreams and masturbation
    after i had become somewhat adapted to my new environment i
    indulged less frequently in either and from that time to the
    present i have masturbated very irregularly sometimes but little
    and again to excess
    not long after i came to this place i met a young lady with whom
    i soon became quite intimate for over a year our friendship was
    strictly platonic and then swung suddenly around to a sexual
    basis we were ardent lovers for a few weeks after which i tired
    of the game as i had before in other cases and broke off all
    relations with her as abruptly as was possible since then i have
    almost wholly withdrawn from the society and companionship of
    women and have almost entirely lost whatever tact and assurance i
    once possessed in their company things pertaining to sexual life
    have interested me rather more than less but have occupied my
    attention much less exclusively than before this episode though
    i have never intended to marry my breaking off relations with
    this girl affected me much at any rate it marked an abrupt
    change in the character of my sexual experiences the sexual
    impulse seems to have lost its power to rouse me to action
    hitherto i had practiced masturbation always under protest as it
    wereas the only available form of sexual satisfaction while
    now i resigned myself to it as all that there was to hope for in
    that field of course i knew that a little effort or a little
    money would procure natural satisfaction of my sexual needs but
    i also knew that i would never under any ordinary circumstances
    put forth the necessary effort and fear of venereal disease has
    been more than enough to keep me away from houses of
    prostitution
    some months ago i refrained from masturbation for a period of
    about six weeks and watched carefully for any change in my health
    or spirits but noticed none at all the only impulse to
    masturbate was occasioned by fits of restlessness accompanied by
    erections and a mildly pleasurable feeling of fullness in the
    penis and scrotum i think that over 75 per cent of my acts of
    masturbation are provoked by these fits of restlessness and are
    unaccompanied by fancy images erotic thoughts lustful desires
    or marked pleasure at other times the act is occasioned by
    erotic thoughts and images and is accompanied by a considerable
    degree of lustful pleasure which however is never so intense as
    in my earlier experiences and has steadily decreased from the
    first usually the orgasm is accompanied by a strong contraction
    of all the voluntary muscles particularly the extensors
    followed by a slight giddiness and slight feeling of exhaustion
    if repeated several times in the course of a single day the acts
    are followed by dullness and lassitude otherwise the feeling of
    exhaustion passes away quickly and a sense of relief and quiet
    takes its place so natural or rather habitual has this resort
    to masturbation as a means of relief from nervousness and
    restlessness become that the act is almost instinctive in its
    unconsciousness
    i am extremely sensitive to all kinds of sexual influences and
    have an insatiable curiosity regarding everything that pertains
    to the sexual life of men or women i am not however excited
    sexually by conversation about sexual facts and relationships no
    matter what its nature though in reading erotic literature my
    excitement is often intense
    the tendency to day dream has never left me but there are no
    longer any elaborate scenes or longcontinued stories these
    having been replaced by vaguely imagined incidents which are
    usually broken off before they reach a satisfactory climax they
    are always interrupted by the intrusion of other matters usually
    of more practical interest and the longcontinued habit of
    satisfying myself by masturbation has made erotic dreams rather
    tantalizing than pleasurable i dream very seldom at nightat
    least i can scarcely ever remember any dreams upon wakingand
    practically never of sexual relations i have not had a nocturnal
    emission for over three years and probably not more than
    twentyfive in my life
    in my love passages with girls there has been no serious
    thought of coitus on my part and i have never had intercourse
    with a womanunless my early experiences with the servant girl
    be called such like all masturbators i always idealized love
    to the utter exclusion of all sensual cravings and the notion
    that the physical act of coitus was something degrading and
    destructive of real love rather than its consummation was of all
    prejudices i have ever formed the most difficult to escapea
    circumstance due i suppose to the fact that all i had ever been
    taught on the subject tended to the complete divorce of what was
    called love from what was stigmatized as a base sensual
    desire judging from my own experience and observation i should
    say that ideal love is a mere surface feeling bound to
    disappear as soon as it has gained its object by arousing a
    reciprocal interest on the part of the one to whom it is
    directed so little did i materialize the objects of my love
    that i have never cared for kissing or the warm embraces in which
    lovers usually indulge i have never kissed but one girl and her
    with far too little enthusiasm to satisfy her my last sweetheart
    was a very passionate girl the warmth of whose embraces was
    somewhat torrid and to me both puzzling and annoying the
    intensity of feeling which demanded such strenuous expression was
    beyond my knowledge of human nature a somewhat peculiar
    circumstance in connection with these experiences is the fact
    that i often found myself trying to analyze my emotions with a
    purely psychological interest while playing the part of the
    intoxicated lover in his mistresss arms
    there is but little left to say on the subject of my sexual
    development during the last two or three years my knowledge of
    the facts of the sexual life has been very greatly increased
    and i have become acquainted with phases of human nature which
    were wholly unknown to me before the part played by things
    sexual in my life is still i suppose abnormally large it is
    undoubtedly the largest single interest though my outer life is
    determined almost wholly by other considerations
    of course i know nothing of the effect which longcontinued
    masturbation may have had on my ability to perform normal coitus
    i do not think i am subject to any kind of sexual perversion for
    all my indulgence has been faute de mieux and at least since i
    began masturbation all my desires and erotic daydreams have had
    to do only with normal coitus the mystery which surrounds the
    sexual act seems at times to be regaining its former influence
    and power of fascination i have no doubt however but that i
    should be greatly disillusioned should i ever perform coitus and
    i greatly regret that i have not been able to test this
    conviction and so round out and complete this history
    it may be worth while to say a word about my religious
    experiences as in many cases they are closely bound up with
    the sexual impulse i was never converted but on a dozen or
    more occasions approached the crisis more or less closely the
    dominant emotion in these experiences was always fear sometimes
    with anger and despair intermixed in varying proportions a
    complete analysis of these experiences is of course impossible
    but the various pleasurable feelings of which converts spoke in
    the revivals which i attended were a closed book to me following
    my revivalmeeting experiences came a few days spent in a sort of
    moral exaltation during which i eschewed all my habits of which
    conventional morality disapproved save masturbation and felt no
    small satisfaction with my moral conditions i became a
    firstrate pharisee toward the women who had figured in my day
    dreams i suddenly conceived the chastest affection resolutely
    smothering every sensual thought and fancy when thinking of them
    and putting in place of these elements ideal love
    selfsacrifice knightly devotionsundayschool gardenofeden
    pictures with a medival romantic coloring these daydreams
    were always sexual involving situations of extreme complexity
    and monumental silliness masturbation was always continued and
    usually with increased frequency the end of these periods was
    always abrupt and much like awaking from a dream in which the
    dreamer has been behaving in a manner to arouse his own disgust
    they were followed by feelings of sheepishness and selfcontempt
    mingled with anger and a dislike of all things having to do with
    religion my inability to pass the conversion crisis and a
    growing contempt for empty enthusiasm finally led me to a saner
    attitude toward religion from which i passed easily into
    religious scepticism and later the study of philosophy and
    science and particularly of psychology banished the last
    lingering remnant of faith in a supernatural agency and led me
    to the passion for facts and indifference to values which have
    caused me to be often called dead to all morality
    history iica aged 25 unmarried tutor preparing to take
    holy orders
    my paternal ancestry which is largely huguenot is noteworthy
    for its patriotism and its large families my father who died
    when i was a year old is remembered for the singular uprightness
    and purity of his life from his earliest childhood the
    photograph which i have shows him as possessed of a rare classic
    beauty of features he was an ideal husband and father at the
    time of his death he was a master of arts and a school principal
    my mother is an extraordinarily neurotic woman yet famed among
    her friends for her great domesticity attachment to her
    husbands and an almost abnormal love of babies she has nobly
    borne the illtreatment of her second husband who for several
    years has been in a state of melancholia my mother has been
    highlywrought all her life and has suffered intensely from
    fears of all kinds as a young girl she was somnambulistic and
    once fell down a stairhead during sleep in spite of her bodily
    sufferings with indigestion eyestrain and depression she
    retains her youthfulness she has slight powers of reasoning she
    has had times of unconsciousness and rigidity i have never heard
    any mention of epilepsy she has a horror of showing prudishness
    in regard to the healthful manifestations of sex life and is
    always praising examples of what she terms a natural woman
    i have heard that during my first year my mother detected my
    nurse in the act of putting a morphine powder on my tongue for
    the purpose of keeping me quiet i was subject to convulsions at
    this period and narrowly escaped a permanent hernia my family
    tell me that from the beginning i was a welldeveloped and boyish
    boy full of mischief impulsive good to look upon unusually
    affectionate beloved by all
    in my third year i took pleasure in crawling under the bed with
    my boycousin who was nine months my senior and after we had
    taken down our drawers in kissing each others nates i do not
    remember which of us first thought of this pastime
    at the age of 4 i gave myself a treat by gazing upward through a
    cellar window at the nates of a woman who was defecating from
    several feet above into a cesspool that lay beneath it was
    during this summer also that i frightened myself by pulling back
    my prepuce far enough to disclose the purple glans which i had
    never seen before but this act gave me no desire to masturbate
    when 5 years old and living in a great city i drew indecent
    pictures in company with a little girl and her younger brother
    these pictures represented men in the act of urinating the
    penes were drawn large and the streams of urine plainly
    indicated one afternoon i induced the boy to go to the
    bathroom lie on his back and allow me to perform fellatio on
    him i did not ask him to return the favor i remember the
    curious tarlike smell of his clothing and the region about his
    genitals it is possible that i gained my knowledge of fellatio
    from an unknown boy of 10 who had induced me during the
    preceding summer to enter a sandy lot with him watch him
    urinate and then kneeling before him commit fellatio a year
    later as i was walking home in the rain to our summer cottage
    with an open umbrella over my shoulder a boy of 15 who was
    leaning against our fence exhibited a large erect penis and
    when i had passed him urinated upon me and my umbrella i never
    saw the boy again i felt peculiarly insulted by his act back of
    the house there lived a 12yearold boy who invited me to watch
    him defecate in the outdoor privy and during the act told me a
    number of indecent stories and words which i cannot remember
    about this time i fell in love with a little jewish boy next
    door often i cried myself to sleep over the thought that perhaps
    he was lying on a sofa alone and crying with a stomachache i
    longed to embrace him and yet i saw little of him and made
    little of him when i was with him
    living in a western city a few months later some girls of 12 and
    14 led me to their barn where they dressed themselves in boys
    clothing and made believe that they were cowboys one of them
    told me to shut my eyes open my mouth and get a surprise
    when i opened my eyes once more a piece of hendung lay in my
    mouth i have a vague remembrance of one of the girls asking me
    to enter a watercloset with her she uttered some indelicate
    phrase but i performed no act with her in the house where i
    lived i once entered the bedroom of a halfgrown girl while she
    was dressing she knelt to kiss me innocently enough and i by a
    sudden impulse ran my hand between her bare neck and her corset
    as far as i could reach apparently she took no notice of my
    movement although i did not masturbate yet during this winter i
    experienced a tickling sensation about my genitals when i placed
    my hand beneath them as i lay on my stomach in bed one evening i
    pulled up my nightdress and holding my penis in my hand i
    danced to and fro on the carpet i imagined that i was one of a
    line of naked men and women who were advancing toward another
    similar line that faced them i imagined myself as pleasurably
    coming in contact with my female partner who possessed male
    genitals
    the following summer i lived in the woods my nextdoor playmate
    was a little girl of my own age6 years she sat down before me
    in the barn and exposed her genitals this was the first time i
    had seen female organs or had thought for a moment that they
    differed from my own in great perplexity i asked the little
    girl has it been cut off she and i defecated in peach baskets
    that we found in the upper part of the barn
    when i was 7 years old and back in the eastern city i lived in
    the house of a physician alone with his 3yearold daughter one
    day i showed her my erect organ and felt a delicious
    gratification when she stroked it with the words nice nice i
    confessed my fault to my guardian that night after i had said my
    prayers i had complained to my mother a year before of the
    inconvenience i found in my penis being so long sometimes she
    said that she would see about having the end taken off but i
    was never circumcised her words gave me the doubly unpleasant
    impression that my glans was to be cut off
    there came occasionally to the kitchen of dr ws house a
    foulmouthed irish laundress who used coarse language to me
    concerning urination i loathed the woman and yet one night i
    dreamed that i was embracing her naked form and rolling over and
    over with her on the bed and in spite of my sight of female
    genitals a few months before i thought of her as having organs
    of my own kind and size at my first school i watched a
    redhaired boy of 12 expose the penis of a 7yearold boy as he
    lay on his back in the bathroom i do not remember that the
    sight gave me sexual pleasure
    i spent the summer before i was 8 in a double house the adopted
    daughter of our neighbor a neurotic retired physician was a
    girl of 13 who had been taken from a poor laboring family she
    got me to show her my parts touched them and asked whether i
    urinated from my scrotum she also induced me to play with her
    genitals as we sat on a sofa in the twilight and to spank her
    naked nates with the back of a hairbrush as she lay on a bed
    but from none of these performances did i derive physical
    satisfaction the girl e and i took delight in talking dirty
    secrets as she expressed it her young cousin h nephew of her
    adopted mother never heard me use the word thing without
    suggestively smiling e recalled the pleasant hours that she had
    spent with her cousin when they were in their nightgowns she
    did not particularize these sexual relations under the
    boardwalk the boy h and i once defecated in bottles some
    little girls who lived opposite us pulled up their dresses one
    night and dared each other to dance out beyond the end of the
    house in full view of the road we boys merely looked on
    i now fell passionately in love with a remarkably handsome little
    boy of my own age i longed to kiss and hug him but i did not
    dare to do so for he was haughty and intolerant of my
    attentions i even allowed him to stand with one foot on me and
    remark in a loud tone i am conqueror i endured no end of
    petty insults and much illtreatment from this boy i reached the
    height of my passion on the night that he appeared at our
    cottage in a tightfitting suit of pepperandsalt i gloried in
    his perfect legs and besought my guardian that she would buy me a
    similar suit of clothes
    for the summer after i was 8 years old i lived in a cottage in a
    country town the servant maid m was a young girl of 16 who
    listened eagerly to my accounts of the secrets and actions in
    which the girl e and i had taken delight a year before i think
    that m arranged a meeting between a little blackhaired girl and
    me in order that we might take a walk and play sexually with each
    other just as we were starting on our walk one of my relatives
    said that i must not leave the yard
    the little girl and i had seesawed together and i had been
    interested in her legs as she rose in the air when i was 13
    years old and seesawing at a picnic with a stout girl the
    motion of the board and the sight of her straddled form filled me
    with longing to embrace her sexually one afternoon m took me
    to the house of an acquaintance of hers ms brother was in the
    room and made a number of unremembered remarks which struck me as
    being rather free and m told me later that she and the girl
    once dressed as ballet dancers and danced before ms brother i
    felt that he was lascivious i was always remarkably intuitive
    i fell in love with a handsome stout blackhaired boy who lived
    on a farm but he was not a farmers son in the common sense of
    the word i visited him for two or three days and we slept with
    each other to my boundless joy for his freckled girl cousin i
    did not care the turn of my wrist although she was a nice enough
    little thing one night when we three lay on a bed in the dark
    and neither of us boys had eyes or words for her she silently
    left us he and i never committed the slightest sexual fault i
    left him with tears at the summerend and i often kissed his
    photograph during the following winter
    in the flathouse where i began to live when i was 8 years old i
    once practiced mutual tickling of a very slight character with a
    boy of my own age we sat on chairs placed opposite to each other
    and we inserted our fingers through the openings in our trousers
    just as we were beginning to enjoy the titillation we were
    interrupted by the approach of one of my family who however was
    not quick enough to discover us down cellar i often saw the
    genitals of the janitors little girlsthey were fond of lifting
    their skirts and they did not wear drawersbut i had no desire
    to attempt conjunction i once caught an older friend of mine he
    was 13 in the act of leaving one of the girls the pair had been
    in a coalcompartment the boy was buttoning his trousers and i
    guessed what he had been doing when i began to sleep alone in my
    tenth year i had no desire to masturbate and was loath to do so
    by reason of ample warnings given me by my guardian and by the
    family physician one afternoon a stunted friend of mine sat down
    in the back yard and astonished me by tying a piece of string to
    his penis at a large private school which i now attended i made
    the acquaintance of the principals son and wondered why he had
    such a fancy for dressing his 5yearold sister in boys clothes
    he closed the door on me while he was thus engaged at my house
    we went to the bathroom together and he showed me his
    circumcised and muchridged penis neither of us made any mention
    of masturbating
    at this period i fell slightly in love with a 5yearold boy with
    intensely black eyes i would kiss him whenever we were alone
    but i had no wish to seduce him i was always interested in
    watching the urination of younger children when i was 5 years
    old i went on my knees to a strange little boy in order to
    whisper in his ear an inquiry as to whether he wanted to urinate
    i experienced a pleasurable thrill when i was 10 years old in
    leading a small girl cousin to the outdoor privy in helping her
    on and off the open seat in buttoning and unbuttoning her
    drawers and in gazing at her vulva
    the summer before i was 10 i lived a wild life in the mountains
    my companions were a negro girl the two daughters of a
    clergyman the two sons of a questionable woman hotelkeeper and
    the daughter of the irish scavenger all of these children were
    extraordinarily sensual their leading pastime from morning
    until night was varying forms of indecency with the supreme
    caresswhich they termed raising dickieas the most frequent
    enjoyment the 5yearold daughter of the scavenger explained to
    us how she had seen her father approaching her stout mother with
    an erect penis the pair standing up before the lamplight during
    the act this curlyheaded rosycheeked child handled her
    genitals so much that they were inflamed i once saw her sitting
    in the road and rubbing dust against her vulva i saw little of
    the elder daughter of the minister she was 12 years old she
    persuaded me to expose myself before her in the cellar of a
    partiallybuilt house in return for my favor she allowed me to
    look at her genitals she did not ask for conjunctio the two
    younger daughters were my intimates with the middle one i was
    forever performing a weak conjunction that consisted in the
    laying of my member against her vulva notwithstanding all the
    entreaties of my little friend i could not be persuaded to
    protrude my penis against her vagina and not on one occasion can
    i remember obtaining an erection or extreme pleasure up in the
    garret she straddled slanting beams with her genitals exposed
    and i followed her example the negro girl and my little friend
    both urinated on a tent floor at my request i did not fancy the
    odor of a girls genitals nor the appearance of the vulva when
    the labia were held apart
    the following summer when i was almost 11 i took a long walk
    one day with my old friend the girl e we entered a patch of
    woods and ate our lunch but no sense of sexual drawing toward
    the girl came over me and she did not offer to entice me i
    slept with her boycousin one night and her neuropathic aunt a
    retired lady physician bothered us by repeatedly creeping into
    our room i felt intuitively that she was watching to see whether
    we would commit mutual masturbationwhich we had no thought of
    doing three years before i had opened the door of her bedroom
    suddenly and saw es naked form the physician had been
    examining her e told me later my guardian also annoyed me by
    repeated warnings not to play with myself
    just before i turned 11 i was sent to a small and socalled
    home boardingschool eight of us lived in the smaller
    dormitory the matron roomed downstairs there was no resident
    mastera serious error we small boys were told to strip one
    evening we were then tied necktoneck and made to dance a
    slavedance which was marked by no sexuality a boy of 15 r
    one afternoon gave me the astonishing information that my father
    had taken a part in my procreation up to this moment i had known
    only of the maternal offices information of which had been
    beautifully supplied to me by my guardian when i was 7 years old
    at that time i talked freely about the coming of a baby brother
    in a distant city i watched the construction of baby clothes i
    named the newcomer and i was momentarily disappointed when he
    proved to be a girl this same r a strong boy with a large
    penis got into the custom of lying in bed with me just before
    lights were put out he would read to himself and occasionally
    pause to pump his penis and make with his lips the sound of a
    laboring locomotive i felt impelled to handle his organ for i
    was fascinated by its size and stiffness and warmth rarely he
    would titillate my then small and unerect penis r never
    ejaculated when he was with me hence not until my third year was
    i acquainted with the appearance of a flow of semen sometimes r
    would stop during his dressing to manipulate his penis but was
    such a picture of rosy health that i doubt whether he brought
    himself often to ejaculation r told me that he had been to a
    brothel where his genitals were examined to determine whether
    they were large enough and not diseased he also related how he
    played cow with a girl of his own age she consenting to
    perform fellatio upon him a darkskinned unwashed pimpled
    but fairly vigorous boy of 16 with an irritable domineering
    manner told me the delights of coitus with a girl in a
    bathhouse and i overheard his conversation with another old
    boy concerning the purchase of a girl in a big city for the sum
    of five dollars no details were given
    i will now pass to my third year when i was 13 years old a
    large wellsetup boy of 16 a became my idol his toleration
    of my presence in his room filled me with endless love when i
    lied about a matter in which he was concerned his denunciation
    of me brought me to a state of shuddering and weeping
    unspeakable when our relations were established again a
    allowed me to creep into his bed after the lights were out and
    there i passionately embraced him but without performing any
    definite act when i turned over on my side with my back to him
    he drew my prepuce back and forth until i experienced orgasm but
    not ejaculation i would return his favor by pumping his erect
    penis but with no ejaculation on his part he did not propose
    fellatio and i did not think of it one night when he was in
    my bed i began to masturbate very slightly whereupon he laughed
    saying so that is the way you amuse yourself as a matter of
    fact the habit was not fastened upon me he always laughed when
    the rubbing of his finger on my exposed glans caused me to
    shrink another boy h now began to show me his erect penis and
    we practiced mutual manipulations a laughingly told me how me
    had caught h in the act of masturbating as he stood in the
    bathtub a told me a number of sexual storieshow he enjoyed
    coitus in the bushes with a girl on the way home from
    entertainments how half a dozen boys and girls stripped in the
    basement of a church and performed coitus on the velvet chairs
    which stood behind the pulpit and how he and a younger boy who
    camped out together played with each others genitals f a boy
    of 11 was highly nervous subject to timidity and tears on the
    slightest provocation often morose and under treatment for
    kidney trouble his penis was erect whenever i saw him undress
    he told me that a partially idiotic man taught f and his
    companion how to masturbate the man invited the boys to his tent
    and there pumped his organ until some white stuff came out of
    it f also told me that an indian princess in his part of the
    country would permit coitus for fifty cents a sometimes slept
    with f and i could imagine their embraces s a secretive
    handsome boy of 13 wetted his bed with urine every night the
    only sign that he gave of an interest in sexuality was his
    laughing remark concerning the coupling of rosebugs of his
    chum my beloved c i will speak later my small roommate
    handled himself only slightly i never had a desire to lie with
    him since i disliked him nor with my first roommate a
    chunky fiery boy of 10 whose penis interested me merely
    because it was circumcised and almost always erect his
    masturbation was also so slight as not to attract any particular
    attention a lusty german boy b showed no signs of sexuality
    until his third year when he laughed about his newlyappearing
    pubic hair and told several of us openly of how he enjoyed to
    play a drumbeat on his penis before going to sleep i dont
    do it too much though he explained he showed a mild curiosity
    when i gave him the resum of a book on cohabitation which
    contained illustrations of the erect penis and the female organs
    i had found this book in the woods and i read it eagerly during
    my third year
    i came to the point of agreeing with a who said everyone is
    smutty indeed i lived in a lustful world and yet my mind was
    bent also on books and writing and the outdoor world i was
    overgrown and splendidly developed with a mediumsized penis and
    a scant growth of pubic hair my face wore a somewhat infantile
    expression my mouth was a perfect cupids bow my hair thin
    and light i was troubled about my snubnose which gave the boys
    a great deal of amusement as a matter of fact i exaggerated its
    upward tendency out of my morbid selfconsciousness and
    cowardice my imagination was extraordinarily intense as it had
    always been i was sensitive to smells and sounds and colors and
    personalities and to the subtle influence of the night i was
    timid and easily moved to tears but not from any physical
    weakness until after at the lower house there was the boy z
    famed for his large penis and the older g a boy of 15 who was
    the leader in sexuality at his dormitory z showed me his penis
    and exposed his glans often enough but we did not manipulate
    each other g told us to notice how large a space his penis
    occupied in his trousers and laughed over zs custom of
    masturbating by means of a narrow vase gs special lover was a
    nervous boy of ten it is remarkable that none of us mentioned
    fellatio or pdicatio these acts may have occurred at
    school but not to my knowledge we did not have much to say
    sexually about the girls we heard rumors of a 16yearold v
    who had been sent away from school for coitus and my first
    roommate was said to have obtained conjunctio with a girl
    under cover of the chapel shed once a and i pointed a telescope
    at the open windows of the girls dormitory but we saw nothing
    to interest us a dayscholar j a pale nervous bright boy of
    13 took me into the study of his unclephysician and together we
    gloated over pictures of the sexual organs a was with us on one
    occasion j told me how he liked to roll over and over in bed
    with his hand placed under his scrotum this act he said made
    him imagine that he was obtaining coitus he advised me to slide
    my penis back and forth in the vagina whenever i should actually
    obtain coitus in my room at school j once drew an imaginary map
    of a bagnio in which the watercloset was carefully displayed
    en suite with the bedrooms j and i never masturbated
    together indeed i cannot remember seeing his organ a hulking
    boy of 16 who lived opposite the schoolgrounds became intimate
    with j and we three went on a walk up the railroad track the
    big boy w tried to inflame my passions by telling me how he
    and j had had coitus with a handsome blackhaired widow in town
    but i remained cold
    during this year i fell in love with c a popular talkative
    witty boy of my own age or perhaps a year younger he fancied me
    and we slept together one night under the most innocent
    circumstances i never dreamed of having sexual relations with
    him and yet i fairly burned with love for him my stay at his
    beautiful home over sunday while his parents were away was one
    long delight we slept in each others arms but there was no
    sexuality en route to cs home he pointed with a glove to a
    little workinggirl saying he would like to have intercourse
    with her but this was the only remark of the kind that ever
    passed his lips in my presence when undressed save for his
    undershirt he laughingly held his unerect organ in his hand and
    made the motions of obtaining conjunction with an imaginary
    partner once we spoke of masturbation i could recite the
    information of my good physician with a marvelous show of
    virtue and c remarked yes doing that makes boys crazy c
    finally grew tired of my deceptive babyish nature and
    ultrainterest in books and puzzles but i cherished an
    undiminished affection for him and when he was detained at home
    for a fortnight with a broken arm i wrote him a passionate
    letter which i sobbed over and actually wetted with my tears
    but the fervor of my passion died at the close of the year i
    consider this unsullied friendship to be the only redeeming
    feature of my sensual days at school
    versed as i was in the warnings against masturbation i found
    pleasure one afternoon when i was alone in slipping my penis
    through the open handle of a pair of scissors and in violently
    flapping my partially erect organ until a strange sweet thrill
    crept over me from top to toe and a drop of clear liquid oozed
    from my member but i gave up the manipulation with scissors
    finding a greater satisfaction in masturbating while i was
    defecating or just after it i either pumped my organ by slipping
    the prepuce back and forth or i grasped the organ at its root
    and violently jerked it back and forth i soon began to
    masturbate not only every time that i defecated but also at
    night just before i went to sleep and sometimes early in the
    morning on the whole i preferred the jerking just described i
    always brought about ejaculation after perhaps five minutes of
    violent exertion
    my penis became chafed at the root but i did not especially
    care i remember the afternoon that i masturbated for the first
    time while i was defecating in the school watercloset i cannot
    recall that at first i thought of coitus while i masturbated on
    one occasion i masturbated over the vase de nuit after a
    delightful afternoon of tobogganing exploration up and down the
    mountain
    during this first year of abuse i felt no ill effects
    whatsoever although i realized in an unthinking way that i was
    doing wrong but sexuality had assumed the proportion of a
    regular feature of our school life it was difficult for me to
    place a universal view in its true perspective i used to smile
    at the glazed dull morning eye of poor h who was a stunted boy
    of 15 and thus could not endure his losses so well as i could
    endure them the qualms of conscience which i suffered were lost
    in my delight in my dawning sexual life sometimes i lay on my
    stomach in bed and by placing my hand under my scrotum
    according to the directions of j brought up a pretty girl to
    mind just before sunday school g our chief reprobate and the
    rest of us would hunt out what we considered to be nasty texts of
    scripture the chapter concerning the whoredoms of aholah and
    aholibah gave me an especial pleasure t mentioned the giggling
    that occurred at prayers in the lower dormitory when the details
    of esaus birth were read out a few days before g was
    expelledfor exactly what cause i do not knowhe told me of how
    greatly he enjoyed coitus on his grandmothers sofa with a girl
    of fifteen when i went home on the boat for holidays i noted the
    large blackhaired penis of the strong boy of our school he
    occupied a stateroom with me but made no sexual overtures
    since my twelfth year i had been wrapped up all summer long in a
    boy who was six months my senior we slept together constantly
    but not once did we think of obtaining mutual gratification on
    the contrary we held up high ideals to each other and frowned on
    masturbation i took delight in saying that i never had handled
    myself and never would do so even at the height of my
    autoerotic period i skillfully concealed my habits from all
    my boy friends a neurotic solo choir boy friend once spoke of
    obtaining ejaculation whereupon i expressed utter ignorance of
    such an act little hypocrite that i was this boy told how the
    house servants joked with him about coitus and made laughing
    lunges at his organs
    but much as i loved my chum my most passionate regard went out
    in my thirteenth year to n a chubby blueeyed choirboy of
    12 he was a pretty boy to any eye he was not gifted except in
    watersports and anything but popular either with girls or with
    boys yet i grew warm at the mention of his name he did not care
    a fig for me from first to last i had no consciousness of the
    sexual nature of my passion and the thought of doing more than
    embrace and kiss him in an innocent manner never crossed my mind
    for two summers i had nights of tossing on my bed although i
    almost never was sleepless for any cause when i would see his
    dear face and form in and out of the swimming pool or engaged
    perhaps in singing or in showing his beautiful teeth i seldom
    was smitten with little girls and i found myself embarrassed in
    their company after my ninth year yet i thought well enough of
    their looks and ways to enjoy their company at dances the girls
    liked me in a platonic way for i was accounted a good big
    kind blundering boy with a helping hand for the smallest fry
    during the summer after i was 13 i imagined myself in the early
    morning when i was half awake as persuading my wife to have
    coitus with me in the course of my spoken words i kept my hand
    under my scrotum
    a plump girlcousin of my own age was visiting at my uncles
    during the summer after i was 13 with her i greatly desired to
    satisfy myself but i could not be sure that my boy cousin 5
    years old might not find us out even though she should consent
    once when we three were in the hayloft a wave of lust rolled
    over me but i made no proposal night and gaslight greatly
    increased my libido on one occasion my aunt had gone to the
    village for icecream and l and i were left alone in the
    diningroom i took her on my lap and had a powerful erection i
    almost asked her to play sexually with me in the barn but
    instead i spoke of an imaginary girl the first letters of whose
    successive names spelled an indecent word for coitusa word
    known to almost every anglosaxon child i fear l laughed but
    gave no sign of assent for a neighboring girl of 15 i felt such
    a drawing that early in the morning i would roll on the floor
    with my erect organ in my hand in riotous imagining of coitus
    with her i walked with her in the woods and sat at her feet but
    although i felt instinctively that she would satisfy me without
    much persuasion yet i could not ask her one night i started
    to church in order to walk home with her and lead her if
    possible to a field where we might gratify ourselves i picked
    out the exact grassy spot where we might lie but when i was
    almost at the church door my moral sense if that is what it
    was rose and dragged me home again
    during the swimming hour i watched the genitals of the boys
    comparing them carefully in the most minute details circumcised
    organs affected me as being disagreeable and mens hairy coarse
    genitals i abhorred
    when 13 i became acquainted with the new mailboy at the inn he
    was a city streetboy and got me into smoking cigarettes
    occasionally i did not definitely take up smoking until i was
    16 he told me that a mason once offered him ten cents if he
    would masturbate the man in a cellar the boy said that he
    refused i slept a few times with an illfavored boy of fine
    parentage he was of my own age and i had played with him in a
    natural way for several years but my increasing sexual desires
    led me to mutually masturbate with him and even unsuccessfully
    to attempt with him mutual pdicatio on the morning after our
    nights of sensuality i felt gone and miserable but not
    repentant by afternoon i was myself again my relations with g
    were purely animal for i disliked his jealous disposition his
    horselaugh his features his form his withdrawn scrotum and
    his undersized penis at home in the evening i often found myself
    inflamed with a mental picture of active fellatio with him but
    i never performed this act so far as i remember
    one of my great sexual desires was to walk along a fence on which
    a girl was seated in order that i might feast my eyes on her
    pudenda she must not wear drawers
    when i turned 14 i had been from my unusual size in long
    trousers for several months i entered a private dayschool and
    progressed brilliantly in my studies i kept up masturbation
    almost daily sometimes twice a day both in the water closet and
    in bed i can remember ejaculating before urination in the school
    cabinet at night i often found myself longing for the return
    of my sister seven years my junior in order that i might
    embrace her in bed and fondle her genitals i had done these
    things during my christmas vacation of the year before i mildly
    reproached myself for such incestuous desires but they recurred
    continually i dreamed little and i cannot remember the
    character of my dreams my waking libido spent itself mostly in
    longings to embrace without lustful acts the forms of little
    boys of exquisite blonde beauty and thick hair narcissism may
    have been present for in my twelfth year i had been told that at
    the age of 5 and 6 i was an extraordinarily beautiful little
    creature with long lintwhite hair the preferable age was from
    6 to 9 my eye was alert on the streets for boys answering to
    this description and a street boy with long white hair so won
    my passion that i followed him to his home and asked his mother
    if he might call on me and play some games as i did not even
    know the boys name and had never seen him before i was
    wonderingly refused i sought in vain to find the whereabouts of
    another longhaired street boy whom i burned to embrace and load
    with benefits i had a boundless desire for such a boy as this to
    idolize meto look into my face out of big eyes and lose himself
    in love for meto call me by endearing pet namesof his own
    accord to throw his arms around my neck this second actual boy
    disappeared from my horizon by presumably moving away from the
    vast city neighborhood i took a fancy to a small boy at school
    who possessed the requisite delicacy timidity and sweetness if
    not the physical requisites of my beau ideal i walked with him
    in the park and planned to have him at the house but the matter
    was not arranged at boardingschool i had associated much with
    younger and weaker boys and had been ridiculed much for my
    cowardice in sports but at the city school i moved with my
    equals and won their recognition our gymnasium director was
    middleaged and of an indolent disposition he liked to recall
    his youthful erections and to answer my sexual queries too fully
    and cheerfully volunteered information on brothels yet i doubt
    whether he had an evil purpose in conversing with me i thought i
    should never dare or want to enter one i always conjured up the
    picture of a row of naked women from whom i could take my pick
    and the smell of the women i imagined to be identical with the
    smell of my big friend a at boardingschool when i was
    traveling down town on an elevated train one afternoon the
    brakeman asked me whether i had ever been in a brothel and told
    me that disorderly houses abounded in my neighborhood i have
    had connection with women said this redhaired young man
    waving his hand in greeting to a woman who nodded at him from a
    window since i was 15 years old not long ago a finelooking
    young woman in black offered to pay all my expenses if i would
    live with her and connect with her
    when a girl of perhaps 7 a distant cousin of mine visited us
    for a few days i gratified my lust by placing my hand under her
    genitals and swinging her to and fro she giggled with pleasure
    that summer i began to experience the evil effects of the
    masturbation which i had practiced daily for a year and a half
    pimples began to break out on my chin my complexion up to this
    time had been white and delicate the family ascribed my
    condition to digestive difficulties in playing with the boys and
    girls i found myself seized with a terrible shyness and a
    tendency to look down and weep i had lost all the courage i
    hadit had never been greatin the presence of a crowd of
    children i was fairly at ease with a single companion my
    selfconsciousness was something more painful to me than i can
    convey in words at home i wept in my room and cursed myself for
    a baby i little realized the cause of my nervous collapse yet i
    had too robust a frame not to be able to sleep and to play hard
    the sympathetic pleasure which i had found in swinging my
    girlcousin to and fro i now doubled by letting a 7yearold boy
    ride cockhorse on my feet i experienced an erection during the
    process and i almost induced ejaculation when i tickled the boy
    with my feet in the region of his genitals to see his shrinking
    giggling joy gave me an exquisite sexual thrill i longed to
    sleep with the boy but i was afraid of causing comment at the
    new and large boarding school which i entered in the fall my most
    lustful dreams and ejaculations were concerned with standing this
    little boy on the footboard of a bed taking down his
    knickerbockers and performing fellatio on him but i dreamed
    also of natural coitus i fell in love with the handsome
    12yearold son of the aged headmaster the boy o sat next me
    at the table and i never tired of gazing at him it gave me a
    special sense of pleasure to look at him when he wore a certain
    flowing scarlet fourinhand necktie but o was not attracted
    to mefor one thing i was in a disagreeably pimpled
    conditionand i could not induce him to linger in my room nor to
    sleep with me my passion for o did not diminish and it rose to
    its supremacy on the evening when he appeared in our hallway he
    roomed on the girls side of the house and hinted at the sexual
    sights that he saw in a costume of white satin lace and wings
    he was ready for a costume party
    i now masturbated less frequently for i was beginning to
    appreciate the horrible consequences of my indulgence i had
    frequent pollutions with dreams my day was one long agony of
    fear how i dreaded to go to sleep in the same bed with my older
    chum who never made any advances beyond embracing me passively
    cum erectione while he was asleep my day was one long agony of
    fear at meal time my feet constantly writhed in agony for fear
    that the headmasters grown up young ladies should make fun of
    me or that my lack of facial composure and my inability to look
    people in the eye might be commented upon i tingled with
    apprehension especially in the region of my stomach every nerve
    was taut in the effort i made to appear composed i masturbated
    with erections over nothing greek recitations were for me an
    auto da fe my heart beat like a triphammer at the thought of
    getting up to recite and once on my feet my voice shook and my
    mind wandered i hated the thought of people behind me looking at
    me i rarely summoned the courage to turn my head either one way
    or the other i vastly admired the bravery of the small
    15yearold boy who recited so calmly and so well i was too
    cowardly to play football and baseball and i dreaded even my
    favorite tennis because the spectators put me in a state of
    scared selfconsciousness knowing my own condition i was yet so
    blind to it most of the time and such a jekyllandhyde that i
    actually pitied a boy of 19 who was an eccentric and a scared
    victim of masturbation but in spite of my neuropathic condition
    i developed intellectually i do not touch upon this aspect of my
    life however because i am trying to limit myself strictly to
    sexual manifestations at the present time i have not the courage
    to continue the narrative
    history iiithe following narrative is written by a clergyman
    age 40 unmarried
    my childhood and early boyhood were unmarked by sexual phenomena
    beyond occasional erections which commenced when about 5 years
    of age without any exciting causes these were accompanied by
    some degree of excitement of the same nature as that which i
    experienced in later years i was absolutely ignorant of sexual
    matters but always had an idea that the essential difference
    between man and woman was to be found in the genital organs this
    was sometimes a matter for thought and curiosity
    being for many years an only child i saw little of other
    children and formed the habit of amusing myself with making
    thingsboats houses etcand acquired a taste for science
    when i could read i preferred biography history and poetry to
    anything else
    when i was 13 years old and at a large school i heard for the
    first time of coitus but very imperfectly for a few days it
    filled my thoughts and mind but feeling it was too engrossing a
    subject and one which took me off better things i put it out of
    my mind later another boy gave me a fuller description of the
    matter and i began to have a great desire to know more and to be
    old enough to practice it i also discovered that boys
    masturbated and about a year after tried the experiment for
    myself this vice was largely indulged in by my schoolfellows
    it never occurred to me that it was sinful until i was nearly
    16 when i came across a passage in kennss manual of
    schoolboys in which it was hinted such things were wrong
    morally and spiritually previously i had felt it was an
    indelicate and shameful thing and bad for health this last idea
    was held as a solemn fact by all my boy friends gradually
    religion began to exert an influence over my sexual nature
    obtaining as years passed a greater and greater restraining
    power it is simply impossible for me to write a history of my
    sexual development without also describing the action which
    christianity has had in determining its growth the two have been
    so intimately bound together that my life history would not be a
    faithful record of facts if i left religion out of it
    at school i took part with great keenness in cricket and
    football and was very ambitious to excel in everything in which
    i took an interest but i always had other tastes as well which
    were more precious to me for example the love for science
    history and poetry until i was past 16 years my desire was
    simply for coitus girls and women attracted me only as affording
    the means of gratifying this desire but when i was nearly 17 i
    began to regard girls as beautiful objects apart from this and
    to desire their love and companionship at the same time it
    dawned upon me that life held much of joy in the love of women
    and in domestic lifeso henceforth i regarded them in a higher
    and purer light and apart from sexual gratification in fact
    from this period till i was over 20 this idea so dominated my
    whole being that the lower side of my nature was entirely held in
    subjection and abeyance by it it was rather repulsive to think
    of girls as objects of lust this state of mind was not brought
    about by any romantic attachment or through any acquaintance or
    through circumstances i was living in great seclusion and had no
    girl friends after this period the lower side of my nature woke
    up as a giant refreshed with wine and i underwent for many years
    a constant struggle with my nature in which religion always
    triumphed in the end i never fell into fornication though
    sometimes into the vice of masturbation these outbursts of
    desire were periodic about ten or fourteen days apart and would
    last several days i must record also the fact that from the time
    this awakening took place my ideal views of woman no longer
    seemed incompatible with sexual relations i noticed that at
    about 27 there was a lessening of the desire but that may have
    been due to overwork and consequent nervous exhaustion i had a
    good deal of worry and studied daily for about eight hours in
    any case the impulse was strongest during the years above
    mentioned a little later in life for a time i became attached
    to a girl and eventually engaged i then observed greatly to my
    sorrow and annoyance that whenever i met this lady or even
    thought of her erections took place this was particularly
    painful to me as my thoughts were not of a lustful or impure
    character sometimes sitting by her at a religious service this
    would occur when certainly my mind was far away from anything of
    the kind that was the first woman ever kissed by me except of
    course members of my immediate family circle later on my
    thoughts turned to marriage and there was a great longing at
    times for this event to take place however as this attachment
    afterward became the great sorrow of my life for years it needs
    no more comment this closes one chapter of my history and at
    present i do not propose to add another as in a great measure it
    is only partly written it may be well here to state that there
    has never been in me the slightest homosexual desire in fact it
    has always appeared as a thing utterly inconceivable and
    disgustingly loathsome i am fond of the society of both men and
    women but on the whole prefer the latter i have had several
    warm and intimate though platonic friendships and get on
    exceedingly well with the other sex although not a goodlooking
    man i have always been attracted to women by their spiritual or
    mental qualities rather than by physical beauty and feel
    strongly that the latter alone would never cause me to desire
    coitus unless there was an attraction other than that of the
    flesh i should feel that i was following simply a brute
    instinct and it would jar with my higher nature and cause
    revulsion this was not the case in my earlier years to the same
    extent i have often wondered whether the sexual impulse was
    strong in me or not but if not there is nothing in my physical
    state or family history to account for it i am fairly cognizant
    with the lives of my ancestors being descended from two old
    families the sexual instinct was certainly not weak or abnormal
    in them personally i am tall and healthy well built but
    sensitive and highly strung smell has never played any part in
    my life as a stimulant of sexual desire and the mere thought of
    body odors would have a very decided effect in the opposite
    direction touch and sight appeal to me strongly and of the two
    the former most
    i am convinced after many years careful thought that sexual
    vice and perversion could be greatly reduced if the young were
    instructed in the elements of physiology as they bear on this
    question personally had i been thus enlightened much sin would
    have been avoided in my schoolboy days and a perverted view of
    sexual matters would never have arisen in my mind it took years
    to overcome the feeling that all such things were unclean and
    defiling eventually light came to me through reading a passage
    in a tractate on the creed by rufinus he was defending the
    doctrine of the incarnation against the pagan objection that it
    was an unclean and disgusting idea that god should enter the
    world through the womb of the blessed virgin mary and he meets
    it by showing that god created the sexual organs therefore the
    objection is invalidotherwise god would not be clean or pure
    having himself designed them and their functions this passage is
    slight in itself but gave birth to a line of thought which has
    influenced me profoundly i no longer regard sexual matters as
    disgusting and unholy but as intensely sacred being the outcome
    of the divine mind further the incarnation of the saviour has
    not only sanctioned motherhood and all that is implied by it but
    has eternally sanctified it as the means chosen for the
    manifestation of god to the world i should not obtrude my
    theological conceptions but for the fact that they have
    determined my lifehistory in that aspect
    history ivwhen i was 9 years old a boy at the preparatory
    school which i attended showed me the act of masturbation
    which he said he had practiced for a long time and which he
    urged me to imitate if i wished to become a father when i grew
    up and married boylike i believed him and tried but the
    sensation obtained was not a pleasant one i suppose that i was
    too rough with myself and i desisted
    when i was about 12 years old a schoolfellow told me that he had
    seen his nurse copulating with the groom and he and i used to
    haunt the woods in the hope that we might see an amorous couple
    so engaged but without success we often talked of the act as
    to how it was done neither he nor i had any clear ideas on the
    subject save as to the organs involved i was about 15 when a
    maidservant of the house in which i was a boarder came to my
    bedroom one night and taught me how to masturbate her she said
    that this was a good thing for me to do and warned me never to
    play with myself as it would kill me or drive me mad i told
    her that i had tried it but could not bring on a pleasurable
    feeling so she did it to me and although i did not have an
    emission i derived great pleasure from the act she told me that
    it never did a boy any harm to let a girl play with his parts
    and promised that if i would keep the secret she would often do
    this for me naturally i promised to say nothing and she often
    came up to my room later on she used to insert my penis into her
    vulva while she was rubbing it at the same time giving me a
    pigeon kiss this modus operandi was much appreciated by me
    one night after we had been together thus i dreamt of her and
    her maneuvers and had my first emission i was very proud of
    this as i considered that i had at last attained to mans
    estate and told her of it she never allowed me to insert my
    penis into her vulva after that alleging that she did not want
    to have a baby
    i was about 16 years old when i had my first real coitus my
    partner in the act being a girl some two years older than i who
    lived near us i enjoyed the act very much as she permitted nay
    insisted on emission intra vaginam and told her that this was
    much nicer than my amours with the maidservant which of course i
    had confided to her she laughed and said of course we often
    copulated as long as i was at home and then i lost sight of
    her of all the women with whom i have had to do save one she
    had the most copious secretion of mucus which in those days i
    believed was the womans semen her thighs used to be wet with
    it
    at the university i had regular relations with women of all
    sorts rarely missing a week two of them were married women one
    the wife of a solicitor the other of a doctor how proud i felt
    of my first intrigue with a married woman i felt that i was
    really a man of the world now
    but though my friends used to tell me all about their love
    affairs and i longed to confide in them i did not do so this
    was because when i went up to the university my uncle said that
    he would give me a word of advice and hoped that i would follow
    itnever to give away a woman and never to refuse to respond to
    a womans advances whoever she were to neglect this advice
    would he said be foolish and to break the rules damned
    ungentlemanly i wish i had always followed advice proffered as
    closely as i have followed this one night when i was somewhat
    disguised in liquor as our grandfathers would have put it i
    picked up a girl who was a private prostitute if the phrase be
    permissible she declined copulation and proposed other means of
    satisfaction i insisted being stubborn in my cups had i been
    sober i should have done as she suggested for i have always made
    it a point to allow the woman to choose the method of
    gratification and not to demand or even suggest anything
    myself i like to please women and i have always been curious as
    to their wants and desires as revealed without outside
    influence by themselves the result of my refusing all methods
    of gratification save the most ordinary was that the girl who
    must have known that she was not all right but shrank from
    saying so in so many words gave me a gonorrhoea which lasted
    nine weeks and much interfered with my amours as i naturally
    declined to run the risk of infecting my partner a risk which to
    my certain knowledge many a young fellow has run with disastrous
    consequence to the confiding woman as it was due to my tipsy
    obstinacy i could not blame the girl but resolved never to
    drink too much again a resolve which i have kept save once
    unbroken in those days we youngsters thought that it was manly
    to be able to carry ones liquor well and did all in our power
    to attain to the seasoned head but i considered that the risks
    entailed were too serious to be neglected
    i was well on in my 26th year when i met a widow with whom i fell
    in love with the result that i married her she is a most
    sensible woman and it was her intellectual gifts which were the
    attraction to me in my amours intellect has never played a part
    she has all along been cognizant of and lenient to my
    polygamous tendencies for she recognizes the fact that whatever
    fredaine i may have on hand makes not the slightest difference
    in my love and respect for her were she a more sensual woman
    perhaps things would be different
    in all i have had to do with 81 other women of whose special
    characteristics i kept a careful note at the time twentysix
    were normal women with whom my liasons have lasted long so i
    know more about them than i do about the other fiftyfive who
    were prostitutes and with some of whom my dealings were but for
    an afternoon
    the races represented have been these for i have seen a bit of
    the world english scotch irish welsh french german
    italian greek danish hungarian roumanian indian and
    japanese taking them all round the only difference that i found
    between old and young women is that the older ones are less
    selfish and more complaisant and less inclined to resent ones
    being unable to attain to the height of their desire for from
    time to time i have been unable to come up to the scratch after
    a heavy nights labor or when i was afraid of being caught in
    the act of coition a fear which in my experience acts as a
    stimulus to desire in women unlike its action in men of all the
    women with whom i have had to do the nicest in every way have
    been the french women the english women of the town drink too
    much and are far too keen on getting as much money as they can
    for as little as they can to please me were the london girls to
    recognize that men do not like a tipsy woman and that where
    there is so much competition the person who is most skillful and
    most polite gets the most custom the alien invasion in regent
    street would soon come to an end
    of the fiftyfive prostitutes eighteen informed me that they
    were in the habit of masturbating eight of their own free will
    without asking for reward did fellatio six asked me to do
    cunnilingus which i naturally declined to do three proposed
    anal coitus of those who did fellatio two one french and one
    german told me that they had taken to it because they had heard
    that human semen was an excellent remedy against consumption
    which disease had carried off some of their relatives and that
    they had gradually come to like doing it all who told me that
    they masturbated asked me whether i did so too and two desired
    me to show them the act one alleging that she liked to see a man
    do it she had been married late in life after a stormy youth
    and had had she said a large experience of the male sex they
    all seemed to think that however much the practice of
    selfexcitement might hurt a man and all thought that it would
    hurt him a woman might masturbate as often as she liked failing
    better means of satisfaction as she had no such loss of
    substance as a man
    of the twentysix normal women whom i knew more intimately than
    i did the fiftyfive prostitutes thirteen without being
    questioned by me blurted out the fact that they were habitual
    masturbators apparently all required to think of the loved
    person to obtain full satisfaction fellatio was proposed and
    fully performed by nine of whom three experienced the orgasm as
    soon as they perceived that i had attained to it all were more
    or less excited while doing it one proposed anal coitus just
    to see what it was like and three proposed cunnilingus one
    having been initiated by a girl friend and one by her husband
    the third had i believe evolved the act out of her own inner
    consciousness in her desire to experience pleasure with me my
    relations with one of the twentysix were confined to my
    masturbation of her the while she did fellatio as she said
    that she had no feeling inside down there
    with two exceptions my partings from these normal women have not
    been tragic and all whom i have met in after life seven have
    been very ready to resume relations with me four of them having
    made the proposal themselves
    one thing has struck me and that is the often great difference
    that exists between what a womans looks lead one to think she
    is and what she is when one becomes her lover the most sensual
    woman that i have met might have sat for her portrait as the
    madonna and she was the only one who took pleasure in hearing
    and relating smokingroom stories a form of amusement which
    perhaps from their want of appreciation of humor and wit women
    do not indulge inat least in my experience
    history va continuation of history iii in appendix b to the
    previous volume
    as i became better i commenced to dream of true love i wondered
    too if my horrible past really could be lived down and a young
    woman come to love me i took pleasure in reading love poems
    especially brownings and illustrated some with little
    watercolors
    i was sitting in the stalls one night seeing a performance by a
    company of english actors when one of them played so badly that i
    thought to myself why hang it i could play it better myself
    the next minute another thought followed why not try i came
    out of the stalls the proverbial stagestruck youth i was
    sitting in the same place another night when the young man next
    to me entered into conversation by a strange coincidence he knew
    a few young men amateurs who were going to form a company give
    up their situations and travel if they could induce a few more
    to join them and put a little money in i made an appointment for
    the following evening
    there were lots of meetings in bedrooms and rehearsals between
    the beds but ultimately i was told a schoolroom had been
    engaged and a professional actress af i went to the
    schoolroom and found all the boys there and a young woman with
    a pale ricepowder complexion on introduction she gazed at me
    as if struck dumb if she had been betterlooking i thought her
    vulgar and puffy i would have been flattered i was
    disappointed but rather frightened she had a stage presence of
    her professional ability especially when we commenced to
    rehearse i had to make love to her too which embarrassed me
    she had a good profile i noticed and would have been better
    looking i thought if she were in better condition for she was
    young about my own age twentythree or four we were all
    youngenjoyed our rehearsals and had lots of funbut i did not
    respond to the advances a was evidently making to me finally we
    started on our tour as the weeks went on af like the others
    improved wonderfully in health and appearance if we had had
    anything like houses it would have been a pleasant trip my
    strangeness did not escape the notice of the boys altogether for
    i was still a bit strange in mind and nervesand deeply
    religious bowing my head before each meal and reading my little
    bible and prayerbook at odd times i drank no alcohol i spent a
    good deal of time by myself of with my faithful companion a who
    was nearly always at my side she and her appealing eyes i was
    surprised to see how quickly she had improved she looked quite
    attractive and ladylike some evenings at meals but i only
    tolerated her i was selfish and conceited
    things had been going on like this for a weekalways playing to
    empty houses and our money lower and lowerwhen a said to our
    other lady mrs t on a train in my presence i shall have to
    give him up i suppose he will have nothing to do with me mrs
    t said you give him up do you and looked at me as if she
    were going to try her hand a said yes and looked at me
    smiling sadly i dont know what motive prompted mewhether my
    vanity was alarmed at her threatened desertion or that she had
    really made some impression on me by her love probably a little
    of bothbut i said no dont come and sit down here making
    way for her and she joyfully came and nestled against me from
    that time i ceased to treat her with ridicule and kissed her at
    other times than when on the stage i was subject still to black
    moods and would not speak to her for hours sometimes but she
    seemed content to walk with me and was infinitely patient i had
    heard she was living withif not married toan actor i asked
    her about him once and she said she did not love him she loved
    me and had never loved before her face had a touching sadness
    her life had been unhappy and stormy with no love and little
    rest in it her face when she had lost her dissipated look and
    unhealthy pallor was exquisite delicate as a cameo love had
    improved her manners too she was more gentle and refined i let
    things drift without thinking of the future when one night
    after the performancei was lying on the sofa and a was sitting
    at my side as usuali suddenly thought with the brutality that
    characterized me in these mattersi will ask her to let me
    sleep with her i still fought against any premonitory thought
    of selfabuse but here i thought to myself is a chance of
    something better that will do me no harm and perhaps good when
    she understood me she turned very red and walked away shaking
    her head but i let her understand that was the only way of
    retaining me and finally when they had all gone to bed she
    gave herself to me reluctantly and sadly for she too had been
    drifting on without thinking of anything of this sort she hated
    it at this time but just living for her love of me her first
    true love
    before this occurred i must tell you i had been so much better
    that i sometimes felt capable of doing anything a sense of power
    and grasp of intellect which was combined with delicacy of
    feeling and sensitiveness to beauty to skies and clouds and
    flowers i seemed to be awakening to true manhood to my true
    self and at meals it is worth recording i commenced to have a
    distaste for meat
    these glimpses of a better state of things left me on cohabiting
    with a and for a time my gloom and black religious mania came
    on me once more i now thought of my promise at confirmation and
    it seemed to me i had offended beyond pardon when we came to the
    next town however i openly slept with a all night leaving my
    own bed untouched when we returned to adelaide one of our party
    remarked the only man who had any success with the women on the
    tour was a biblereading praying and good pious confirmed
    christian
    as nascent beauty and delicacy and improvement were gradually
    impaired too my own conduct became so morose at times that
    besides increasing her misery i offended the others and
    bickerings ensued i heard the other actress say hes mad that
    whats the matter and i was so wrapped up in myself and my
    religious mania that i did not mind their thinking so
    after the tour was over a asked me to come and see her at her
    home and as i missed her very much i went one night to tea she
    had a room in her fathers house to herself a was dressed in
    her best and we had an affectionate meeting after tea i asked
    her if she were married to e she said no then i said who
    are you married to she commenced to cry then and told me
    something of her life the saddest i ever heard when only 17 she
    had been courted by a young man she did not care for but who
    prevailed on her parents by pretending he had seduced her but
    wished to marry her strange as it may seem a did not know what
    marriage meant her mother being one of those silly women who
    dont like talking of these things and let their daughters grow
    up in ignorance expecting they will learn from some one in nine
    cases out of ten this happens but a was an exception it was
    this and the fact that she had not a particle of love for her
    husband that gave her such a hatred of coition when her mother
    saw the sheets the morning after the marriage she burst out
    crying she did not like the young man and saw she had been
    deceived
    as husband soon showed his true character he was in reality a
    gaolbird he beat her drank and even wanted her to go on the
    streets to earn money for him she left him and went home it was
    then she began her theatrical career by entering the ballet at
    intervals her husband drunk and desperate would waylay and
    threaten her in the street one day after a rehearsal he
    attempted to stab her she got on in spite of all being a born
    actress and played small parts in traveling companies then e
    who had also gone on the stage courted her and she listened to
    him not because she cared for him but he protected her and
    offered her a home she joined him but his drunkenness and
    sensuality were so gross that he ruined his health and he
    attempted to maltreat a in a nameless way and whenever she was
    in the family way he would leave her alone and halfconscious in
    the cellar for days to add to her misery she had epileptic fits
    then sometimes they would be out of an engagement and starving
    they had been so hungry as to steal raw potatoes out of a sack
    and eat them thus having no fire she would often have had
    engagements but e was jealous and would not let her act without
    him and he beat her as her husband had done and her health
    became undermined it was just after one of the forced
    miscarriages that she joined our traveling company and that
    accounted for her yellow and puffy appearance e was now away
    upcountry with a circus but was expected down any time a told
    me a good deal of all this between her tears while sitting at
    my feet and her tone carried conviction when i ought to have
    gone home i persuaded her to let me stay all night we had been
    in bed some time when her mother knocked at the door and wanted
    to come in for something in a chest of drawers there why dont
    you open the door a who have you got there hasnt that fellow
    gone a was confused and told me to get under the bed but i
    refused and she covered me up with the bed clothes as well as
    she could and opened the door she had hid my clothes but missed
    one of my shoes and her mother saw it oh a was all she
    said youve got that fellow in bed and went out crying
    well fred my stage name youve got me into a nice row a
    said she gave me my breakfast in the morning and i walked out of
    the front door without being molested another night i entered
    her window by a ladder and stayed all night in the middle of the
    night e came home drunk she would not let him in and told him
    she would have nothing more to do with him he attempted to break
    in the door when a called to me and hearing a man in the room
    he went away saying as he went downstairs oh a oh a
    as if he thought she would not have done such a thing he never
    molested us after that night
    i think it was my intention at first to break off with a
    gradually i found however i could not keep away from her and
    it commenced to be evident to me that a bachelors life in
    lodgings again would be dreary and lonely and all this time the
    fear that i had offended god troubled me more than i have said
    and it occurred to me there may have been a touch of sophistry
    in this or not that if i were a true husband to her for the
    futurestuck to her and worked for her for the rest of my
    daysperhaps it would find favor in gods sight and be an
    atonement for my sin had she been free i would have married her
    i believe but she began to be harassed by her mother and
    bothered about my incessantly coming there and staying all night
    it ended in my telling her i would be a husband to her and she
    came and lived with me at my lodgings we had one room and our
    meals cost us sixpence each cheap as it was it was a struggle
    for me to earn money at all i remember feeling ill and anxious
    once and sustaining myself by the thought of my father wheeling
    the heavy truck up the street when he married my mother and i
    decided to wheel my truck too
    a seemed happy and her love increased if possible at first
    though she must have found me a trying lover for i made her
    kneel and pray with me two or three times a day which she did
    with such a queer expression of face sometimes her feelings got
    the better of her and she would say oh damn it fred you are
    always praying and then i would be shocked and she would be
    sorry coitus was frequent she commenced to like it now
    a was not looking well one evening when she came in and lay
    down on the bed presently she commenced to make a strange noise
    and i saw her eyes were closed and her hands clenched ah said
    the landlady who came in to help me she has epileptic fits
    when her convulsions were over she looked blankly at us knitting
    her brows and evidently puzzling her poor brain to remember who
    we were for many years it was my fate to see her looking at me
    thus at first stony and estranged like a dweller in another
    star then halfrecalling with extended hand then forgetting
    again with hand to mouth then the gradual dawn of memory and
    love and final full recognition its fred my fred i never
    got used to it it always moved me to tears it was not to be
    thought that we had no quarrels i still had fits of bad temper
    and sometimes they came into collision with as temper it hurt
    my vanity considerably to see how soon she relinquished the
    respectful patient spanielbearing she had when we were
    traveling i said some cruel things to her and she retorted one
    would have thought to hear us that all affection was over but
    when the mood of rage wore itself out we would both be sorry and
    make it up with tears and be very happy in spite of our poverty
    i think it was lust that prevented me from striving to fulfill my
    ambitions a let me do anything i liked at all times of day or
    night although she seemed surprised at my proceedings sometimes
    for it was becoming a fever of lubricity with me she still
    thought only of her love i remember her coming in one day
    tired pale perspiring and worriedwe had hardly anything in
    the house and she had been to the theater ineffectuallyand when
    her eyes lighted on me the whole expression of her face changed
    softened and brightened at once and she came and kissed me and
    said it is so strange i was thinking all sorts of nasty things
    coming along but as soon as i see my pets face i feel happyi
    dont care for anythingi would sooner share a crust with him
    than have all the money in the world
    i commenced to feel libidinous curiosity to examine herthis was
    mostly on sundaysand she let me blushing at first but
    laughing then i would try new positions in coitus i had heard
    of still she did not enter into my mood
    she was engaged at this time to play in a pantomime and i
    commenced to lead a miserable jealous existence i heard scandal
    about her baseless enough but in the diseased nervous anxious
    state i had brought myself to it nearly drove me mad i would go
    with her sometimes to visit her mother whom i began to like her
    brother i still saluted coldly it caused me horror and jealousy
    to see a kissing him and letting him tickle her in my rage
    when we came home i even said that perhaps she would let him do
    something else naming it brutally and coarsely i remember her
    shame astonishment indignation and tears if ever a man tried a
    womans love i did but she forgave me even that
    we went to live in a little cottage it was in this cottage that
    a first showed signs of lust and in the diseased state of my
    mind instead of regretting it i encouraged her she told me one
    day that the orgasm very often did not occur at the same time
    with her as with me and that it would not unless i put my little
    finger into the anus this her husband taught her and she would
    rather have died than confess it to me when we first met we
    would often devote our sundays to having a picnic as we termed
    our lustful bouts stimulating ourselves with wine her temper
    was not improved thereby though her fits entirely stopped for a
    twelvemonthwe had wordy warfares but we made it up again
    always with tears nor did i allow myself to deteriorate without
    reactions and excursions into better things i was always reading
    emerson it was he who rescued me from orthodox christianity and
    taught me to trust in myself and in nature i have never ceased
    this struggle towards better things to this day there in a
    nutshell is my life i have always been defeated when
    temptation came but i have never ceased to struggle i
    determined to be more abstemious in sexual indulgence and asked
    her to help me she agreed willingly for she was easily led
    whenever we fell back again into excess it was my fault
    at a theatrical performance we first met a miss t a young
    german who sang she was about 25 with modest quiet and
    engaging manners a and she became very friendly i liked her
    she was tall dark and lithe but had bad teeth
    i had been ill and at this time a and i had a quarrel my temper
    suddenly breaking out in murderous frenzy i called her names and
    finally put her outside the house telling her to go to her
    mother i suffered a very hell of remorse and misery everything
    in the quiet lonely house reminded me of her seemed fragrant of
    her my anguish became so keen i could not stop in the house
    though i was just as wretched walking about i kept this up for
    two days when i met her coming to look for me one look was
    enougha pet in broken sobsand in tears we kissed and
    made it up miss t was with her and i greeted her too with
    happy tears in my eyes another time when a was giving way to
    her temper and one would have thought all love was dead i
    said dont you love me then and the word alone was a talisman
    her face changed she held out her arms and began to sob
    quietly she accepted an offer to travel with a small
    theatrical company who were going upcountry she was not looking
    well when i left and after a time i received a telegram telling
    me to come to her at once as she was ill dreading all sorts of
    things i borrowed my fare and went to her i knew nothing of
    women of their point of view and different code of honor and
    was very far from the attitude of guy de maupassant who said he
    liked women all the better for their charmingly deceitful ways
    a wanted to see me and had taken the surest means to ensure my
    coming i was angry at first but she looked so well and was so
    loving that i could not be angry long
    one day when i was working the landlady came in and began talking
    about a and her conduct before i came she had gone into the
    actors rooms at all hours the woman said and drank and been as
    bad as the rest in her conversation it was the second time a
    married woman had run her down to me and i commenced to think
    there might be something in it and suffered all my mad jealousy
    over again not knowing the freedom actors and actresses allow
    themselves on tour without there being necessarily anything in
    it i worried till i thought i had nothing to do but die and
    then one of the great struggles of my life occurred walking the
    country roads i asked myself if it is true if she has been
    unfaithful will you forgive her and help her to arrive at her
    best for a long time the answer was no but perhaps my
    striving for unity with myself had done some good and the final
    resolution was for forgiveness i felt more peace of mind then
    and when i told a dying consumptive lodger in the house what the
    landlady had said he replied dont you believe a word of it i
    know she loves you
    after an absence i found myself one evening in a town where a
    was performing i went round to the back and they told me she had
    gone to a room in the hotel to change for another part i
    followed and entered the room with a glass of spirits i found
    that an effeminate young actor was bringing to her she was half
    undressed her beautiful arms and shoulders bare my arrival was
    unexpected and she looked at me surprised i thought coldly as i
    reproached her for not keeping a promise she had made to me to
    touch no alcohol during the tour but soon her arms were round my
    neck she cried like a child she was bigger and handsomer and
    healthier there was not only an increased strength and size but
    an increased delicacy and sweetness her eyes and brows were
    lovely there was an indescribable bloom and fragrance on her
    such as the sun leaves on a peach the traveling country air
    and freedom from coitus had i known it had enabled her to
    arrive at her true self not only a beautiful woman but a woman
    of fascination of wit vivacity and universal camaraderie her
    face was like the dawn all my fears and jealousy left me like a
    cloud that melts before the sun i remember the look on her face
    as she embraced me in bed that night it had just the very
    smallest touch of sensuality but was more like some beautiful
    childs who is being caressed by one she loves this divine
    drowsyeyed adorable look i had never seen on her face
    beforenor have i since
    we fell back into our old lustful ways later on a became ill
    and the black devil of epilepsy returned i became gloomy a
    restlessness and selfish brutality came over me our love and
    peace were gone i persuaded a to go to melbourne and look out
    for an engagement the day before she was to sail we went to
    glenelg for a trip the sea air as often happened precipitated
    as fits we had gone down to the pier and a said she felt bad
    i just managed to support her to the hotel before she became
    stiff and i made some impatient remark for she nearly dragged
    me down which she heard not being quite unconscious and said
    half incoherently and very pitiably be kind oh be kind
    repeating it after consciousness left her her heart had been
    breaking all day at the prospect of parting and also i expect
    because i was so ready to part with her that moment was a crisis
    in my life i was in a murderous humor but she looked so
    unutterably wretched that it seemed impossible to be anything but
    kind i made myself speak lovingly to her in moments of partial
    consciousness hired a room carried her up and nursed her and
    petted her all night the act of selfcontrol and forcing
    myself to be kind whatever i felt became a habit in time a sort
    of second nature
    in a few days she sailed when she had gone i was remorseful and
    mad with myself how could i let her go by herself i resolved to
    follow her as speedily as possible and did so
    if i remember rightly i came to the conclusion about this time
    that we ought not to have coition unless we felt great love for
    each other it seemed to corroborate this to a certain extent
    that a always seemed more electric and pleasant to the touch
    when we had connection for love and not for lust leave it to
    nature i would say to myself i began to feel how much my
    struggles efforts and temperate living had improved me i had
    more selfrespect though something of the old selfconsciousness
    was still left i did not get better continuously but in an
    upanddown zigzag i still had moods of rage approaching madness
    and periods of neurotic depression long walks decidedly helped
    to cure me and the sea sun wind clouds and trees colored my
    dreams at night very sweetly i frequently dreamed i was walking
    in orchards or forests and a deeper slightly melancholy but
    potent savor as of a diviner destiny was on my soul
    after a long absence during which she had frequently been ill
    a joined me i could see she was recovering from fits which i
    began to realize that she had more frequently in absence from me
    and also from drinking perhaps she was small and thin but
    fresh and sweet as honey and all signs of fits and tempers
    passed away from her face so wonderful in its changes i had
    become so healthy through my abstinence temperance and long
    walks that our meeting was a new revelation to me of how
    delicate fragrant and divine a convalescent woman may be she
    was glad and surprised to see me looking so well and if she put
    her hand on my arm i felt a joyous thrill i was certainly a
    better man for abstaining and she a better woman and i determined
    not to have connection unless we were carried away by our love
    as a matter of fact we did not give way to excess though we were
    very loving i tried to persuade myself that we had not gone back
    to our old ways but i could not do so long
    miss t put in an appearance every day she did not look so
    innocent but as it was no business of mine i did not trouble
    she seemed more attached to a than ever a was still very
    loving with me but it was an effort to me to keep up to her
    pitch and when a proposed to go to melbourne with miss t to
    sell off the furniture before settling in adelaide i was rather
    glad of the opportunity of abstaining from coitus and of watching
    myself to see if i again improved when a and miss t came to
    see me before going down to the steamer a was nearly crying and
    miss t changed from the old welcome friend was not only pale
    and anxious but looked guilty as if she had some treachery in
    her mind she could not meet my eye i thought less of it then
    than afterwards and once more i took long walks at night and
    rose early to catch the freshness of the mornings
    some time before this i had read a book advocating a vegetarian
    diet and at this time i chanced to read paters beautiful denys
    lauxerrois the imaginary portrait of a young vinedresser who
    was attractive beyond ordinary mortals and lived until his fall
    and deterioration on fruit and water the words a natural
    simplicity in living remained in my memory i resolved to read
    more carefully the book on scientific diet who can say i
    thought what changes for the better may come to me if i live on
    a strictly scientific and natural diet
    i fasted one whole day and then had a breakfast of cherries in
    the middle of the day a meal of fruit and walking in the
    afternoona gray rainy dayi felt so light so different and
    the gray sky looked so sweet and familiar that i was reminded of
    the luminous visions of my boyhood it was a distinct revelation
    this panlike almost bacchic feeling did not last however nor
    was i always able to maintain my new method of diet though i
    tried to do so i made the attempt however but i imagine i was
    more than usually run down i would walk miles in the hope of
    feeling less restless one holiday i walked down to glenelg
    having only had grapes for my dinner and lying on the beach i
    looked through a strong binocular glass i had borrowed at the
    girls bathing and the beauty of their faces in their frames of
    hair of their arms of their figures seen through their wet
    clinging dresses satisfied me and filled me with joy gave me
    for a short time that peace and contentin harmony with the
    strong sunlight on the waves and the rhythmic surf on the
    shorei was seeking the summer evenings on the pier or along
    the beach had a peculiar savor one felt the youth and beauty
    there even on dark nights the air was fragrant with them white
    dresses and summer hats disappearing down the beach or over the
    sand hills it was easydoubtless justifiable sometimesto put
    a lewd construction on these disappearances but i felt it need
    not have been so that it was not necessary that youth and
    beauty even the sexual act itself if led up to by love should
    be a subject of giggling and sniggering i always left the beach
    and its flitting summer dresses with a sigh
    a after writing once ceased writing at all and once more her
    mother and i were left in a state of anxiety and suspense at
    last i determined to go to melbourne to look for her the only
    clue i had being a remark in her letter that a certain actor was
    giving her an engagement in melbourne i could not find any
    traces of her for some days and what traces i did find of her
    were not calculated to allay my anxious fears one hotelkeeper
    told me that some one of as name had stayed there with another
    hussy giving miss ts stage name there were nice carryings on
    with the pair of them i thought of miss ts strange looks but
    could not imagine what hold she had on a for a loved me i
    knew i seemed to be in an inextricable maze i could settle to
    nothing and was thinking of applying to the police when i heard
    that the actor a had mentioned had taken his company to the
    gippsland lakes i followed to sale found the actor and was told
    that a was not there she slipped me at the last moment he
    said and remained in melbourne i returned to my lodgings
    with my anxiety and nervous restlessness increased tenfold but
    suddenly my fear and restlessness left me like a cloud i felt
    quiet young peaceful able to enjoy the country a was
    doubtless all right and would be able to explain her silence i
    undressed leisurely and happily thinking of the stars
    the next day sunday i awoke refreshed and still at peace after
    breakfast hearing childrens voices i went out into the garden
    and there was a collision of souls who somehow were affinities a
    young girl about twelve or younger with a fine presence and
    handsome face fixed her eyes on me for half a minute and then
    came and sat on my knee she was one of those children i am
    accustomed to call lovechildren because they are so much
    brighter healthier larger and more loving than others i always
    imagine more love went to their making we fell in love and she
    said stroking my beard oh you are pretty and i said and
    so are you we were so affectionate that the servant called the
    child away and i went for a walk finding my little sweetheart
    waiting for me on my return the touch of her hand was electric
    and her voice fresh and musical i kissed her but had become
    more selfconscious since the morning and wondered if her mother
    or the servant were looking or even of they would appear i was
    not so frank and natural as my little chum i have often thought
    of her since she had the breadth of forehead the strength and
    yet lightness of limb together with the hands and feet not too
    small that i always imagine the dwellers in paradise will have
    i returned to melbourne and continued trying to find a at the
    same time i commenced in earnest to live on fruit and brown bread
    only and enjoyed better tone and health every day so that it
    was a joy to walk down the street in the sun and exchange glances
    with passengers  la old walt one day in the botanical gardens
    veils seemed to be lifted off my eyes i could look straight at
    the sun and taking my note of color from that golden light i
    turned my eyes on the flowers the mown grass the trees and for
    the first time perceived what a heavenly color green is what
    divine companions flowers are and what a blue sky really means
    for half an hour i was in paradise and to complete my joy nature
    revealed to me a new and unexpected secret
    i was lying on a bench basking and my silk shirt coming open
    the strong sun made its way to my breast and presently i felt a
    totally new sensation there i had discovered the last joy of the
    skin my skin fed by healthy fruitmade blood must have
    functioned normally under the excitation of the sun just then
    for a brief space only alas i cannot describe the joy any
    more than i could describe the taste of a peach to one who has
    only eaten apples it was satisfying divine i opened my shirt
    wider but the feeling only spread faintly and indeed this
    halcyon sunny hour terminated in a restlessness that sent me
    walking into town to look for a
    at last i heard not of a but of miss t she was in a ballet i
    went round during rehearsal and while waiting entered into
    conversation with a little chorus girl with a good face who was
    sewing on my telling her whom i was seeking she stopped sewing
    and looked at me quickly oh are you her husband i know her
    i have seen them together she looked as if she were going to
    tell me something but merely shook her oldfashioned head in a
    mournful indescribable way saying why dont you keep your wife
    with you i went to the door and presently saw miss t she tried
    to avoid me i thought and looked more vicious than ever but
    after a minutes thought reluctantly told me where she and a
    were staying to hide my fears and suspicions i had assumed a
    careless demeanor but i think i should have strangled her had
    she refused to tell me i hastily went to the place indicated and
    going up the stairs to the astonishment of the people opened
    the door and found myself face to face with abut how changed
    she had the hard harlot loveless look i detested i felt for a
    few minutes that i did not love her and she regarded me coldly
    too but presently old habits reinstated themselves she put out
    her hands very pitiably and then was sobbing in my arms i
    could get nothing out of her but sobs and to this day do not
    know where she spent all these weeks nor why she did not write
    miss t came in after rehearsal pale and hardfaced i greeted
    her politely but was watching her trying to puzzle out why a
    did not look as she usually did after long absence from coition
    miss t took another room in the same house and was soon joined
    by another ballet girl young and very pretty who soon began to
    have fits a was always crying until miss t went away with her
    pretty friend i knew nothing could hardly be said to suspect
    anything definite and yet i pitied that pretty girl whose eyes
    looked so helpless and appealing
    i set to work again but i continued to live on fruit and bread
    and taking off my clothes i would stand up at the window in the
    sun a lot of prostitutes however who lived at the back saw me
    and were scandalized or shocked or thought me mad the landlady
    heard of it and spoke to a so i had to desist from my glorious
    sunbaths
    we slept on a single bed and though i did my best to avoid
    coitus i wanted to wait and think out some theory of it a
    who knew nothing of this wanted to resume our old habits and
    finally i surrendered but my sufferings next day were intense
    and i had the sense of having fallen from some high estate my
    thoughts were divided between two theories one that our misery
    was caused by our diet more or less the other that we had
    fallen into some error as regards coitus and this was becoming
    almost a certainty with me
    there is one incident i think worthy of note which happened
    before the fall just mentioned and when i was living on fruit
    and in splendid health at a performance i saw a girl on the
    stage with handsome legs in tights and once as she straightened
    her leg the kneecap going into position gave me such a strange
    and keen joyof that quality i call divine or musicalthat i
    was like one suddenly awakened to the divinity and beauty of the
    female form the joy was so keen and yet peaceful familiar and
    subjective that i could not help comparing it to a happy chemical
    change in the tissues of my own brain like the unexpected
    functioning of my skin in the sun it was a sign of a partial
    return to a normal condition another glimpse of paradise
    i stuck to my new diet and gained a fresh elation and joy in
    life gradually clothes became insupportable and i went down to
    the beach as often as possible to take them off and at nights
    beside the patient and astonished a i would lie naked one
    evening passing some grass i looked over the fence like a gipsy
    and felt a longing to take off my clothes and sleep in the grass
    all night it was of course impossible and a looked unhappily
    in my face she began to think her mother who now thought i was
    mad must be right
    that night i woke up and found myself having coition i was angry
    and felt i had been put back in my progress but a fever of lust
    now came over me i would sit under the tap and let the cold
    water run over me to conquer the fever but at the end of a week
    my hopes were frustrated and i even turned against my natural
    diet on which i had made flesh a as i expected went through
    her usual fits and slowly recovered if we had connection only
    once she in about three weeks had a mild attack of fits if we
    had coition more than once the fits were more severe i relapsed
    more than once and as a means of impressing my resolution for
    future abstinence i would walk for miles in the middle of
    pitchblack nights
    miss t came over to adelaide and as i knew nothing definite
    against her and heard that she was engaged i thought perhaps my
    suspicions were unfounded and was friendly but one day in town i
    saw her and a on a tram going out to our cottage even then my
    suspicions might not have been awakened but i saw miss t say
    something rapidly to a and a called out to me will you be
    coming home soon and i answered no when the tram had gone on
    i found myself vaguely wondering what miss t wanted to know that
    for for my perceptions were becoming acute enough to understand
    womens ways in another minute i was walking rapidly home when
    i came to the door it was locked i knocked and knocked and no
    one came i called out and threatened to kick in the door still
    no one came mad with rage i commenced to put my threat into
    execution when the door was opened by miss t halfnaked in
    her petticoats and pale as death but no longer defiant so
    ive caught you have i i looked but could not trust myself
    to speak wondering why a did not appear i went into the
    bedroom she was lying on the bed just as miss t had left her
    on the verge of a fit and on seeing me she held out her hands
    piteously and when i stooped over her she whispered send her
    away send her away then she became unconscious and going into
    the next room i ordered miss t who had managed to scramble on
    her dress out of the house i spoke scornfully as if addressing
    a dog and she slinked out with a malignant but cowed look i hope
    never to see on a womans face again what they had been doing
    with their clothes off i do not know women will rather die than
    confess when a had recovered from her fit she denied that there
    had been anything between them and stuck to it doggedly but
    with such a forlorn look i had not the heart to prosecute my
    inquiries
    for my part all the efforts i had been making for so long seemed
    for a time to be in vain for some weeks i sank into a sort of
    satyriasis and even my anger against miss t turned to a
    prurient curiosity at the same time i was not always able to
    adhere to my diet but both as regards coition and diet i was
    still fighting and on the whole successfully my fits of temper
    however were excessive and my ennui became gloomy despair one
    day i blasphemed on crossing the park and spoke contemptuously of
    god and his twopenny hapenny revolving balls referring to the
    planetary system but for long walks i should have gone mad a
    was drinking in the intervals of her fits i found halfempty
    bottles of wine hidden away this did not improve my temper and
    one daythis was when she was well and upi struck her a heavy
    blow on the face and she aimed a glass decanter at me she went
    home to her mother and i lived alone in the cottage i heard soon
    afterwards that her husband had come back and that they had made
    it up our parting was not however destined to be final
    even out of that months sufferings i made capital i was better
    after my tendency to lubricity my gloom rage restlessness and
    degradation they had been but the irritations of convalescence
