mental second wind
sidenote sticking to the job
are you an unusually persevering and persistent person or like most
of us do you sometimes find it difficult to stick to the job until it
is done what is your usual experience in this respect
is it not this that you work steadily along until of a sudden you
become conscious of a feeling of weariness crying enough for the
time being and that you then yield to the impulse to stop
sidenote the lagging brain
assuming that this is what generally happens does this feeling of
fatigue this impulse to rest mean that your mental energy is
exhausted
suppose that by a determined effort of the will you force your lagging
brain to take up the thread of work there will invariably come a new
supply of energy a second wind enabling you to forge ahead with a
freshness and vigor that is surprising after the previous lassitude
nor is this all the same process may be repeated a second time and a
third time each new effort of the will being followed by a renewal of
energy
sidenote reserve supplies of power
many a man will tell you that he does his best work in the wee watches
of the morning after tedious hours of persevering but fruitless
effort instead of being exhausted by its long hours of persistent
endeavor the mind seems now to rise to the acme of its power to
achieve its supreme accomplishments difficulties melt into thin air
profound problems find easy solution flights of genius manifest
themselves yet long before midnight such a one had perhaps felt
himself yield to fatigue and had tied a wet towel around his head or
had taken stimulants to keep himself awake
the existence of this reserve supply of energy is manifested in
physical as well as mental effort
men who work with their heads and men who work with their hands
scholars and marathon runners must alike testify to the existence of
reserve supplies of power not ordinarily drawn upon
sidenote blue mondays
if we do not always or habitually utilize this reserve power it is
simply because we have accustomed ourselves to yield at once to the
first strong feeling of fatigue
evidence of this same fact appears in our feelings on different days
how often does a man get up from his breakfasttable after a long
nights rest when he should be feeling fresh and invigorated and say
to himself i dont feel like working today and it may take him
until afternoon to get into his workaday stride if indeed he
reaches it at all
sidenote how to strike ones stride
you cannot yourself be immune from the feeling on certain days that
you are not at your best somehow or other your wits seem befogged
you hesitate to undertake important interviews your interest lags
and though crises arise in your business you feel weighted down and
unable to meet them with that shrewd discernment and decisiveness of
action of which you know yourself capable
but you realize in your inmost self that if you continue to exert
the will and persistently hold yourself to the business in hand
sooner or later you will warm to the work enthusiasm will come the
clouds will be dispelled the husks will fly yet you have had no
rest on the contrary you have by continued conscious effort
consumed more and more of your vital energy
sidenote the spur of desire
obviously it was not rest that you needed
what you required was the impulse of some strong desire that should
carry you over the threshold of that first inertia into the wide field
of reserve energy so rarely called upon and so rich in power
under the lashings of necessity or the spur of love or ambition men
accomplish feats of mental and physical endurance of which they would
have supposed themselves incapable here is what a certain lawyer says
of his early struggles
sidenote how to release storedup energies
when i was twentythree years old married and with a family to
support i entered the law course of a great university of the many
students in my class seven including me were making a living while
studying law
by special arrangement i was relieved from attendance at lectures
and simply required to pass examinations on the various subjects and
was thus enabled to retain my place as principal of a large public
school during the third and last year of my law course i was
principal of a public day school of two thousand children and an
alternate night school with an enrolment of seven hundred and fifty
and i worked at the law three nights in the week and all day sunday
sidenote the lawyer who overworks
after eight months of this the final examinations came around they
consumed a full weekfrom nine in the morning until five or six at
night i had no opportunity for review so i rented a room near the
law school to save the time going and coming and reviewed each night
the subjects of examination for the following day
i did not sleep more than two hours any night in that week on
thursday while bolting a bit of luncheon a fishbone stuck in my
throat fearful of losing the result of my years effort i returned
to my work suffering much pain and kept at it until saturday night
when the examinations were concluded the next day the surgeon who
removed the fishbone said there was no reason why i should not have
had a bad case of gangrene
when i look back on that years work i dont see how i stood it i
dont see how i kept myself at it day in day out month after month
without rest recreation or relief i am sure i could never go through
it again even if i had the courage to undertake it
i ranked second in a class of one hundred and eighty in my law
examinations won the second prize for the best graduating thesis
received a complimentary vote for class oratorship and much to my
surprise was soon after offered an assistant superintendency of the
public schools by the school board who knew nothing of my studies and
thought my work as a teacher worthy of promotion
it was not only the hardest years work but the best years work i
ever did it exemplifies my invariable experience that the more we
want to do the more we can do and the better we can do it
sidenote excitement and the hero
the following is an extract from a letter quoted by professor james as
written by colonel bairdsmith after the siege of delhi in 1857 to
the success of which he largely contributed
my poor wife had some reason to think that war and disease between
them had left very little of a husband to take under nursing when she
got him again an attack of scurvy had filled my mouth with sores
shaken every joint in my body and covered me all over with scars and
livid spots so that i was unlovely to look upon a smart knock on the
ankle joint from the splinter of a shell that burst in my face in
itself a mere bagatelle of a wound had been of necessity neglected
under the pressing and insistent calls upon me and had grown worse
and worse until the whole foot below the ankle became a black mass and
seemed to threaten mortification i insisted however on being
allowed to use it until the place was taken mortification or no and
though the pain was sometimes horrible i carried my point and kept up
to the last
on the day after the assault i had an unlucky fall on some bad
ground and it was an open question for a day or two whether i hadnt
broken my arm at the elbow fortunately it turned out to be only a
severe sprain but i am still conscious of the wrench it gave me to
crown the whole pleasant catalogue i was worn to a shadow by a
constant diarrhoea and consumed as much opium as would have done
credit to my fatherinlaw thomas de quincey
however thank god i have a good share of tapleyism in me and come
out strong under difficulties i think i may confidently say that no
man ever saw me out of heart or ever heard a complaining word from me
even when our prospects were gloomiest we were sadly crippled by
cholera and it was almost appalling to me to find that out of
twentyseven officers i could only muster fifteen for the operations
of the attack however it was doneand after it was done came the
collapse
sidenote enduring power of mind
dont be horrified when i tell you that for the whole of the actual
siege and in truth for some little time before i almost lived on
brandy appetite for food i had none but i forced myself to eat just
sufficient to sustain life and i had an incessant craving for brandy
as the strongest stimulant i could get strange to say i was quite
unconscious of its affecting me in the slightest degree
the excitement of the work was so great that no lesser one seemed to
have any chance against it and i certainly never found my intellect
clearer or my nerves stronger in my life
such is the profound resourcefulness and enduring power of the human
mind
chapter ii
reserves of power
sidenote mans potential and kinetic energies
storedup energy not in use has been given a name by scientific men
they call it potential energy in this way it is distinguished from
kinetic or circulating energy by which is meant energy that is at
work for example a ton of coal in the bin contains a certain amount
of potential energy which is capable of being converted into kinetic
energy by combustion
sidenote holding the top pace
you have a vast amount of potential energy over and above what you
actually use you have formed the habit of giving up trying a thing as
soon as you have spent the usual amount of effort on it and this
without regard to whether or not you have accomplished anything
while we all have the power of sustained mental activity not one in
ten thousand of us holds to the top pace
worse still even such mental energy as we do consume is dispersed and
scattered over a multitude of trivial interests instead of being
focused upon some one possessing aim
we intend to show you how you can lose yourself in your work with an
absorbing passion and how you can at any time make special requisition
upon your hidden stores of potential energy and draw new supplies of
power that will sweep you on to your goal
sidenote genius and the master man
more than anything else it is the ability to do this that lifts the
great men of the race above the common run of mortals
it is this that distinguishes genius from mediocrity the master man
transforms his vast stores of reserve or potential energy into
circulating or kinetic energy his work glows with living fire
yet for every such man there are a multitude of others equally
gifted in some respect but wanting that mysterious open sesame
which would discover their hidden mental riches arouse them from
their accustomed inferiority to their best selves and transform
potentiality into accomplishment so it comes about that most of us
are gems that shine but to illumine the dark unfathomed caves of
ocean flowers born to blush unseen
sidenote mental effect of city life
take an illustration of the way in which this reserve or potential
energy is transformed into circulating or kinetic energy suppose that
you are a countryman and come to live in a large city the speed with
which we do things our habits of quick decision the whirlwind of
activities of the busy man in town appal you you cannot see how we
live through it a day in the business district fills you with terror
the tumult and danger make it seem like a permanent earthquake
but settle down to work here and in a year you will have caught the
pulse beat you will vibrate to the citys rhythm and if you only
make good in your work you will enjoy the strain and hurry you
will keep pace with the best of us and you will get more out of
yourself in a day in the city than you ever did in a week on the farm
this change in degree of mental activity does not necessarily mean
that you are making more of a success of life
your activities may be illdirected your newfound powers may be
misspent and dissipated
but you are mentally more alert your mental forces have been
stimulated by the stirring environment
sidenote newfound energies explained
and mark this particularly a number of mental pictures will pass
across the screen of your consciousness today in the same time that
one mental image formerly required
now you have learned that with every idea catalogued in memory
there is wrapped up and stowed away an associated feeling tone and
an associated impulse to some particular muscular action
assuming this you must at once see that here is an explanation of
your newfound energy
your quickened step your newfound decisiveness of action your more
observant eye your clearcut speech instead of the former drawling
utterance your livelier manner your freshened enthusiasm and
enjoyment of lifeall of these are but manifestations of a quickened
intelligence
sidenote quickened mentality
they are the working out through the motor paths of mental impulses
to muscular action
and these impulses to muscular action come thronging into
consciousness because the livelier environment brings about a more
rapid reproduction of memory pictures
and here comes a particularly striking fact one would naturally
suppose that the more energy a man consumed and the faster he lived
the more quickly his vitality would be exhausted and the shorter his
life would be
as a matter of fact by the divine beneficence of providence your
organism is so ordered as to adapt itself within certain wide limits
to the demands made upon it
sidenote fast living and long living
you may call into play all the storedup resources of your being and
still not stake everything upon a single throw for the supply of
mental energy is as inexhaustible as the reservoir of all past
experience while the supply of physical energy involved in brain and
nerve activity is like the immortal liver of prometheus renewed as
fast as depleted
two sets of facts that have been established by elaborate scientific
experiment will convince you of the truth of these propositions
sidenote professor patricks experiments
professor patrick of the state university of iowa conducted some of
these experiments he caused three young men to remain awake for four
successive days and nights they were then allowed to go to sleep the
purpose of the experiment being to determine just how much time nature
required to recuperate from the long vigil they were allowed to sleep
themselves out and all woke up thoroughly rested yet the one who
slept the longest slept only onethird longer than his customary
nights sleep
you have doubtless had the same experience yourself many times it all
goes to show that if we are awake four times as long as usual we do
not make up for it by sleeping four times as long but four times as
soundly as customary the hardworking mechanic requires no more
hours of sleep than the corner loafer the active man of affairs no
more than the dawdler
sidenote ratio between repair and demand
the time of tissue repair is about the same with all men under all
conditions it is the rate of repair that varies with the demand that
has been put upon the body
again look at the same subject from the standpoint of food supply on
what you now eat and drink you have a certain average weight eat
digest and assimilate a larger quantity of food and your weight will
increase this increase will be greatest at the start and will
gradually slow up until you shall have reached the point beyond which
you can gain no more given the same hygienic conditions that you have
been accustomed to you will maintain yourself at the increased weight
on the increased supply of food
sidenote pygmies and giants
now all this involves clearly enough a greatly increased rate of
activity on the part of the bodily organs of assimilation and repair
it is a situation on all fours with that of the countryman whose rate
of brain activity has been stimulated by an increased mental demand
no man will maintain that better more nourishing and more liberal
food rations transformed into increased bodily tissue with a
consequent greater weight and greater muscular strength would result
in a loss of vitality or the shortening of a mans life
sidenote transforming inertness into alertness
pygmies cannot become giants physically or intellectually but as the
puny youth can by systematic exercise broaden his frame and develop
his muscles into at least a semblance of the athlete and can then
through his healthier appetite and his faster rate of repair
maintain himself without effort at the new standard so can the
mentally inert call forth their reserves of energy and maintain a
higher standard of activity and fruitfulness
few men live on the plane of their highest efficiency few search the
recesses of the wellsprings of power the lives of most of us are
passed among the shallows of the mind without thought of the
possibilities that lurk within the deeper pools
sidenote how the mind accumulates energy
this accumulation of potential subconscious reserve energy is a result
of the evolution of man and the growing complexity of his life
no man could if he would respond to all the impulses to muscular
action aroused in him by senseimpressions it would be still less
possible for him to respond to every impulse to muscular action
awakened from the past with the remembered thought with which it is
associated
desire interest attention and the selective will must pick and
choose among these multitudinous tendencies to action
here then is another fact that has immediate bearing upon your
ability to carry out any ambition you may have your every action is
the net result of selection among a number of impulses and inhibitory
forces or tendencies
sidenote the threshold of inhibition
as a general thing consciousness is made up of a number of
conflicting ideas each with its associated feeling and its impulse to
action just what you do in any particular case depends upon what
mental picture is strongest is most vivid in consciousness and thus
able to overcome all contrary tendencies
as life becomes more and more complex the number and variety of our
sensory experiences increase correspondingly and so it comes about
that we have untold millions of sensory experiences carrying with
them the impulses to muscular response none of which on account of
the multiplicity of conflicting ideas is ever allowed to find release
and actually take form in muscular activity
sidenote hidden strength
the consequence is that only an exceedingly small proportion of the
mental energy that is developed within us is ever actually displayed
the rest is somehow and somewhere locked up behind the inhibitory
threshold it is stored away in subconsciousness with the sensory
experiences of the past with which it is associated
sidenote giving a man scope
quoting mr waldo p warren much of the strength within men is
hidden awaiting an occasion to reveal it the head of a department in
a great manufacturing concern severed his connection with the firm
his work falling upon a young man of twentyfive years the young man
rose to the occasion and in a very short time was conceded to be the
stronger executive of the two he had been with the concern for
several years and was regarded as a bright fellow but his marked
success was a surprise to all who knew himeven to himself
the fact is the young man had that ability all the time and didnt
know it and his employers didnt know it he might have been doing
greater things all along if there had been the occasion to reveal his
strength
do you employers and superior officers in business realize how much
of this hidden strength there is in your men perhaps a word from you
giving certain men more scope would liberate that ability for the
development of both your business and your men
do you workers know your own strength are you working up to your
capacity or are you accepting the limits which the circumstances
place about you
chapter iii
the initiative energy of success
sidenote sources of persistence
in such instances as we have recounted men have found that persistent
effort along certain lines has had the effect of making presently
available what would otherwise be simply unused storage batteries of
reserve power what was the source and inspiration for this persistent
effort
you will say that it was ambition or patriotism or some similar
semiemotional influence and so it was but what is ambition what is
patriotism what is any desire but a picturing to the minds eye of
the things desired an awakening of a mental image of the result to
be attained the reward that is to follow certain efforts and these
mental pictures coming into consciousness have brought with them their
associated emotions and their associated impulses to muscular action
impulses appropriate to the picture and automatically tending to work
its realization
these impulses constitute the whole of mans achieving power they are
the initiative energy of all success
sidenote importance of the mental setting
when you are afflicted with doubt and fear timidity and lack of
confidence this means that your mental inhibitions are too numerous
too high or too strong remove them and access is had to the latent
energy of accumulated and creative thought complexes you will then
become buoyant cheerful overflowing with enthusiasm and ready for a
fresh definite active part in life
ideas then when latent may be considered as possessing an
energizing influence
the same idea does not necessarily have the same effect upon the same
persons at different times what its effect may be at any time or with
any individual depends upon the makeup of the consciousness in which
it finds itself
sidenote ideas all men respond to
the setting of consciousness may be entirely different upon the
present appearance of the particular idea from what it was on the
occasion when this same idea last appeared yesterday there may have
been present no conflicting tendencies and this particular idea may
therefore have been allowed free and joyous expression today other
thoughts may be in the ascendency so that we look upon the idea of
yesterday with a feeling of revulsion
the thought that aroused new energy in you yesterday may then sicken
you at your task today the thought that stirs the soul of a vigorous
man may shock the sensibilities of a delicate woman
sidenote how to exalt the personality
yet there are some ideas to which all men in varying degrees seem
alike to respond how often in battle have the failing spirits of an
army been revived by the appearance of the leader shouting his
battlecry and waving his shining sword how often have men been
roused to heights of heroic achievement by the strains of martial
music how often have troops spent with exhaustion responded to the
call of such simple phrases as the flag our country liberty
or such songs as the marseillaise god save the king dixie
these phrases are but the signs of ideas yet the sounding of these
phrases has summoned these ideas into consciousness and the summoning
of these ideas into consciousness has placed undreamedof and
immeasurable footpounds of energy on the hairtrigger of action
sidenote good starters and strong finishers
and so it is with you down deep in the inmost chambers of your soul
are untouched stores of energy that properly applied will exalt your
personality and illumine your career
but to find and claim these hidden riches you must persevere you must
endure
in a marathon race it is endurance that wins the graceful sprinter
who is off with a leap at the bark of the pistol soon falls by the
wayside
life is a marathon in which persistence triumphs
there are many good starters but few strong finishers that is
why the failures so outnumber the successes
sidenote steps in selfdevelopment
the man who travels fastest does more than he is told to do to merely
comply with a fixed routine is to fall short of ones duty the
progressive man adds to the work of today his preparation for the work
of tomorrow he delights in attempting more and more difficult tasks
because in every task he sets himself he sees a step forward in the
development of his own abilities he loves his work more than he loves
his pay and he delves deeper than the exigencies of the moment
require because he craves the power to do more
most men start with enthusiasm no hours are too long no task too
difficult but soon they tire and lacking willpower to persist they
succumb to the lure of distracting interests they become disheartened
and indifferent and so they fail
sidenote saving a thousand a year
a young man married he was proprietor of a flourishing general
store in princeton indiana he and his bride forthwith resolved that
they could and would lay aside out of their income a thousand dollars
a year for ten years by which time they would have ten thousand
dollars and accumulated interest and could go into business in a big
city at the end of the first year when they took stock of their
savings they decided that thereafter instead of trying to save a
thousand dollars a year for ten years they would undertake to save
ten dollars a year for a thousand years and would be more apt to
succeed today they are just where they began
you all know such menmen who are always starting and never
finishing
sidenote looking for a soft snap
ninetyfive per cent of the men who go into business are quitters
the very first disappointment sends them scurrying to cover they
begin to look for a soft snap away from the firing line is it any
wonder that so few reach any great success
that there is an enormous lack of appropriation of energy in most
mens lives is an undoubted fact just where this energy is stored
and just what its eternal significance may be is immaterial to our
purpose
it may be that this reserve is natures safeguard against our
extravagance
it may be as some philosophers contend that the subconscious with
its vast stores of energy is a higher more spiritual phase of man
sidenote drawing power from on high
it may be that the subconscious is for each one of us his individual
segment of the divine essencethat it marks our atonement with
god
it may be that to evoke these latent energies is to call upon those
resources of our being which are the embodiment within us of the
spirit of the creator of all things
it may be that this divine essence if adequately aroused may exert
an absolute transcendence over material things and lift humanity to a
godlike plane
what we call man wrote emerson the eating drinking planting
counting man does not as we know him represent himself but
misrepresents himself him we do not respect but the real soul whose
organ he is would he let it appear through his action would make our
knees bend i said ye are gods quoth the psalmist be ye
perfect even as your father was the injunction of the master
whatever the eternal significance of your latent energy may be the
fact remains that it is yours and yours to use
if you are to succeed if you are to do big things you must be a man
of doggedness you must keep your eyes trained everlastingly upon
the vision of the thing you want you must stay in the race until you
get your second wind you must be master of yourself and draw freely
on your storedup powers
sidenote the man who lasts
do as we shall tell you in this course and you will become a master
man the kind of man who lasts the kind of man who works his
imagination overtime the kind of man who can strain his energies to
the utmost and then finding himself still a failure can rise like
the glow of the sun to do bolder and bigger thingsthe kind of man
who wins
chapter iv
how to avoid wastes that drain the energy of success
sidenote speeding the bullet without aiming
we have shown you that you have within you the potentialities of
success in the form of latent mental energy we have shown you that
your ability to achieve depends upon your ability to utilize to the
full your underground mental resources
but success demands that you do more than merely use all your mental
energies you must use them intelligently
sidenote why most men fail
most men fail because they speed the bullet without aiming they fire
at random and so bag no game
your pentup mental energy is the powder in the cartridge its
usefulness depends upon the man behind the gun
to succeed in business you must intelligently control and direct
1 your own mental energies 2 the mental energies of others
the course of the average man through life is an aimless zigzag it
has neither direction nor purpose it represents wasted energy
capriciously expended
mental energy is like water it has a tendency to scatter it is
diffusive it seeks release in a thousand different directions at the
same time
as a boy first learning to write you were unable to prevent the
simultaneous squirming of tongue and legs all ludicrously irrelevant
to your purpose of writing so now as a business man unless you have
learned the secret of selfmastery you are unable to concentrate your
efforts your attention is easily distracted you exhaust yourself in
displays of passion you are forever doing things during business
hours that have no relation to your business you are forever doing
things in connection with your business that do not contribute to its
progress you expend just as much energy as the accomplished executive
or the successful hustler but you fritter it away in unprofitable
activities
sidenote the successful promoter
to correct this is to gain mastery and power
concentrate your mental energies on one thing at a time stop
spreading them around the promoter may have a dozen big enterprises
under way at once but he takes them up one at a time he transfers
his whole mind and thought from one to the next you cannot of course
be eternally doing the same thing but make no mistake about it the
only way to succeed at anything is to consciously control your mental
energies you may throw them now into this attack now into another
but you must always have a tight grip on yourself or you cannot
succeed
sidenote the human dynamo
you will often hear some livewire business man spoken of as a
human dynamo he has the faculty of turning out a stupendous amount
of work in a comparatively short time how he can carry in his mind
the details of so many large projects how he can accomplish so much
in actual tangible results in many directions how he can pull the
strings of so many enterprises without getting lost in the maze of
detail is the marvel of his associates and yet this man is never
hurried nor flurried nor worried but every word and every act is
straight to the point and productive of results worth while
sidenote cool brains and hot boxes
a cool brain is the reverse of a hot box it carries the business of
the day along with a steady drive and is invariably the mark of the
big man the man who dispatches his work quietly promptly and
efficiently with no trace of fuss and flurry is a big man it is not
the hurrying clattering and chattering individual who turns off the
most work he may imagine he is getting over a lot of track but he
wastes far more than the necessary amount of steam in doing it the
fable of the hare and the tortoise would not be a bad primer for a
number of us and the lesson relearned would not only be beneficial in
a businessproducing way but it would help us in the full enjoyment
of our work
sidenote marvelous increased efficiency handling pig
progress in mental efficiency must result from the application of
knowledge of the mental machine just as we watch the steamengine and
the electric motor to see that they are not overloaded so we must
watch the mental machine that no more power be turned on than can be
profitably employed
this principle has already been applied to physical labor by mr
frederick w taylor in his groundbreaking studies in scientific
management mr taylors celebrated experiments in the handling of
pigiron by which the quantity handled in a day by one man was
increased from twelve and onehalf tons to fortyseven and onehalf
tons showed that a man engaged in such extremely heavy work could
only be under load fortythree per cent of the working day and must
be entirely free from load for fiftyseven per cent to attain the
maximum efficiency
sidenote overloaded human engines
there is no reason why efficiency in mental effort should not be
gauged just as accurately as in muscular activity if there are times
when your wits are not as keen when you have not the same grasp of
fundamentals as at other times it is because you are mentally
overloaded it may be the result of a great variety of causes it
may be from too many hours of continuous mental effort but the
probabilities are that it is the result of vexation worry
dissipation or allowing the mind to be burdened with the strain of
vicious or at least irrelevant and distracting impulses and desires
and so efficiency is lost
sidenote scientific management of self
the human dynamo is a man who long ago learned the lesson of
scientific management of his own mental forces he does one thing at a
time and does it the best he knows how he directs the whole power of
his mentality to the one problem and solves it with accuracy and
dispatch there is no more of a load on his gray matter than there
is on that of the fretting fuming fingerbiting fritterer but every
pound of steam is spent in useful work
look at the victim of st vitus dance there you have an illustration
of wasted energy and it is mental energy for every muscular movement
represents the release of thought power the mental lives of most men
are equally aimless they are lives of ceaseless activity producing
nothing
sidenote psychological causes of waste
sometimes it happens that a man is not working to advantage because of
some defect in his physical makeup he may have defective vision or
some peculiarity of hearing that renders him unable to respond as
quickly as he should to the demands made upon him if these defects
are ascertained it is usually a simple matter to correct the defects
by mechanical means or readjust the relative duties of different
persons so that the defects will be minimized
sidenote tests for sensory defects
where large numbers of people are employed it is comparatively easy
to use tests for discovering defects of sight or hearing by simple
apparatus without requiring the services of a highpriced expert by
adopting these test methods any manager of a large industrial
establishment can satisfy himself whether his employees are up to
certain normal standards he can even apply the tests to himself
optical tests can be conducted by securing an ordinary letter chart
such as is used by oculists and opticians seat the subject twenty
feet away if he can read all the lines of letters from the largest
down to the smallest his eyesight is practically perfect in a large
percentage of cases the smaller lines of type are blurred and
invisible to detect the cause and degree of defects of the eyes it is
necessary to try out the eyes by using a trial spectacle frame and
inserting detached lenses before the right eye and the left eye
alternately one of the most common forms of defective vision is
astigmatism a chart has been designed with a series of circles and
straight lines radiating from the center if the subject is astigmatic
he will see some of the straight lines distinctly while others will be
blurred for instance one or two of the vertical lines may appear
very black and strong while all others will look like a hazy network
this defect due to unevenness of the spherical surface of the
eyeball is easily corrected with properly ground glasses
defects in hearing can be easily determined by means of an
acoumeter this little instrument measures the acuteness of the
hearing very accurately by means of shot dropped from varying heights
upon strips of glass copper and cardboard tests with this device
indicate whether the subjects hearing is above or below normal
sidenote mental friction and inner whirlwinds
stop wasting your energy
heretofore you have used your powers in a more or less haphazard way
with a vast amount of waste and no efficient direction from now on
you are to exercise more intelligence in this respect and make all
your energies contribute to your business progress and your personal
success
you are losing power in fruitless outward activities
you are losing power in the thinking of useless thoughts you cannot
stop the ceaseless activity of the mind but you can conserve its
forces by directing them into channels that are worth while
you are losing power in a turmoil of inward mental strains and
inharmonies catch yourself at some moment when you are forging ahead
in a crowded days work you will then see what an inner whirlwind of
excitement is in progress what stresses and strains are at work what
contrary impulses what frictions and obstacles are being overcome
now to the engineer every one of these wordsfriction obstacle
strainspells loss of efficiency and in this course we shall teach
you how you may do away with antagonistic impulses may bring your
combined mental forces to bear upon the common enemy and may hurl
yourself into the struggles of business and practical life with a
joyful and headlong impetuosity that no obstacle can withstand
sidenote prominent traits of great achievers
professor walter dill scott of northwestern university has said in
studying the lives of contemporary business men two facts stand out
preeminently the first is that their labors have brought about
results that to most of us would have seemed impossible such men
appear as giants in comparison with whom ordinary men sink to the size
of pygmies the second fact which a study of successful business men
or any class of successful men reveals is that they never seem
rushed for time
such men have time to devote to objects in no way connected with
their business it cannot be regarded as accidental that this
characteristic of mind is found so commonly among successful men
during the years of their most fruitful labor according to the
american ideal the man who is sure to succeed is the one who is
continuously keyed up to concert pitchwho is ever alert and is
always giving attention to his business or profession
and again it is not necessarily true that the greatest and most
constant display of energy accompanies the greatest presence of
energy the tugboat on the river is constantly blowing off steam and
making a tremendous display of energy while the ocean liner proceeds
on its way without noise and without commotion the man who frets and
fumes who is nervous and excited is strung up to such a pitch that
energy is being dissipated in all directions
many business men know they are going at a pace that kills and at the
same time they feel that they are accomplishing too little for such
the pertinent question is how may i reduce the expenditure of energy
without reducing the efficiency of my labor
one of the busiest and most efficient men in england is quoted as
having explained his own accomplishment of big results with the least
expenditure of effort by organizing myself to run smoothly as well
as my business by schooling myself to keep cool and to do what i
have to do without expending more nervous energy on the task than is
necessary by avoiding all needless friction in consequence when i
finish my days work i feel nearly as fresh as when i started
sidenote why a man breaks down
the late professor james of harvard university often referred to as
the founder of modern psychology spoke thus disparagingly of
untrained effort your convulsive worker breaks down and has bad
moods so often that you never know where he may be when you most need
his helphe may be having one of his bad days we say that so many
of our fellowcountrymen collapse and have to be sent abroad to rest
their nerves because they work so hard i suspect that this is an
immense mistake i suspect that neither the nature nor the amount of
our work is accountable for the frequency and the severity of our
breakdowns but that their cause lies rather in those absurd feelings
of hurry and having no time in the breathlessness and tension that
anxiety of feature and solicitude for results that lack of inner
harmony and ease in short by which with us the work is apt to be
accompanied
sidenote how to economize effort
the fact is that to be a truly busy man you must be never in a hurry
you must work systematically you must economize effort you must
permit no distractions and do your work leisurely you must take time
to think things over in a natural way you must waste no thoughts in
business hours on social or pleasurable pursuits that would dissipate
your mental capital you must work when you work and you may play
when you play but your business must be the most fascinating of games
and the only one you play during business hours
sidenote how your mental capital is dissipated
another thing you need is poise one trouble with you now is that
you waste your priceless powers in useless anxiety
the minute business falls off you begin to worry you fritter your
mental energies in fretting until you are incapable of real thought
and being unable to think your way out you get excited
remember it is all just a game and you are in it only for the fun of
the thing you will never win out if you persist in tearing your hair
before he crossed the rubicon julius csar was staggered at the
greatness of the undertaking before him the more he reflected and
took counsel of his friends the greater loomed the difficulties of
the attempt and the more appalling the calamities his passage of that
river would bring upon the roman world but when at last with the cry
the die is cast he plunged into the river there was an end for him
to mental dissension a freedom to plan and execute an expansion of
courage and power
sidenote conquering indecision
so it will be with you with doubt and uncertainty the pressure may be
high in the gauge but the engine does not move make up your mind
and you release energies previously wasted in conflicts between
opposing thought complexes struggling for supremacy
sidenote why christian science works
a fine illustration of this is shown in the religious experience known
as conversion to the convert conversion means the profound
acceptance of a mighty spiritual truth it means positive knowledge
taking the place of doubt or indifference conflicting ideas are no
longer present in his consciousness pentup energies are released he
wants to do things his soul is fired with overmastering impulses to
action he wants to go forth and preach the gospel of his faith he is
lifted to a high plane of exhilaration he experiences the peace that
passeth understanding
christian science truth the new thought and similar movements
all achieve their really marvelous results in much the same way all
proclaim doctrines of exuberant optimism having a tendency to banish
fearthoughts and selfconsciousness and selfdepreciation and to set
up in their stead ideas of courage and of achievement and of
individual power if these teachings are successfulthat is to say
if they inherently possess the right appeal for the particular
individualthey have the happy effect of begetting a stoical
indifference to petty physical disorders and social vexations and
bringing about a concentration upon the main business of life of the
mental energies thus previously wasted
sidenote how to release pentup power
decide the matter that is troubling you make an end of hesitation and
uncertainty and fear your very act of decision will release large
stores of pentup mental power and add immeasurably to your
effectiveness
so long as you are in doubt and perplexity conflicting ideas and
impulses balance each other you are not then a man of action you are
a wavering coward you are afflicted with paralysis of will and mental
stagnation
decide the matterthat is to say let one mental picture assume a
greater vividness than the other until it possesses your souland
forthwith the banked fires of your mental energy will burst into
flame
another thing stop wasting your time
how much time do you spend in rest and relaxation how much should
you spend can you answer these questions accurately
sidenote proper ratio between work and rest
thomas a edison has contended for years that four hours sleep a day
was sufficient for any man he has conducted experiments with a large
number of men giving careful attention to matters of diet and
exercise and the results have seemed in a measure to support his
theory
dr fred w eastman reports that owing to pressure of work he was
recently unable to get more than three or four hours sleep out of the
twentyfour during a period of many months and that so far from being
hurt by it he gained five pounds he says if restoration during
sleep is a task so relatively small the question arises whether in
order to complete restoration it is necessary for us to spend so much
time in sleep as we do perhaps on account of popular opinion and
personal habit we waste much time in this jellyfish condition that
could more profitably be spent in active pursuit of our ambitions the
answer of course depends upon the nature of our occupations if
there is muscular effort involved with a correspondingly large amount
of waste in the cells and blood eight hours or more are probably
necessary but if the work is of a sedentary nature and mainly of the
brain there is naturally a smaller quantity of accumulated waste and
less time is required for removal many are the instances of great
men past and present who have lived healthily and worked
unceasingly and strenuously on only four or five hours of sleep or
half the laborers portion surely we do not suppose that these men
were or are physically different from others but rather that by
inclination or necessity they have developed a habit of sleeping
intensely for a short period with resulting gain of time and
efficiency
sidenote determining your norm of efficiency
so far as this matter of relaxation rest and sleep is concerned the
rule to follow is obviously this determine accurately by experiment
the proper relation between periods of work and periods of rest in
your own case then increase your efficiency by maintaining this
relation
in denmark they feed cows scientifically day by day they increase
the allowance of milkproducing food day by day the yield of milk
increases at last there comes a day when measurement shows that there
is no longer any increase in the production of milk they then
decrease the food till the output of milk diminishes so they
determine the normal
so with you and your hours of work and leisure give more and more
time to your business each day until there comes an impairment in the
quality of your work stop short of this you have found your norm of
efficiency
chapter v
the secret of mental efficiency
sidenote where energy is stored
you are called upon to master and conserve the innate energies of your
mind this means that you must 1 find out where these energies are
stored and 2 learn the conditions that determine their activity
all past experiences are conserved within us in the form of
complexes these complexes consist of ideas emotions and impulses to
muscular activity by the primary law of association the recall to
consciousness of any one of these component elements of a complex
brings with it all the rest
sidenote bodily effects of ideas
for example the ideas pertaining to any terrifying experience when
recalled to consciousness bring with them the trembling the wildly
beating heart the shaking knees with which they were originally
accompanied the victim of stagefright feels his knees give way and
that he is sinking to the floor his heart beats tumultuously cold
perspiration covers his body he blushes his mouth is dry and his
voice sticks in his throat afterwards alone in his own room the
memory of that dreadful moment the thought of another appearance
before that audience will be accompanied by the same physiological
effects
sidenote impulses and inhibitions
every such bodily movement is an expression of energy the recall to
consciousness of the terrifying experience the recall of the picture
of the assembled audience these things automatically produce bodily
activities so we must conclude that every idea in memory has
associated with it the potential energy necessary for the production
of muscular movement
it does not necessarily follow that the recall to consciousness of a
given idea will be invariably followed by an outwardly visible
muscular activity expressive of its energy just as the mere presence
of an idea in consciousness tends to bring about a movement so the
presence of a contrary idea will tend to inhibit it
try to imagine that you are bending your forefinger at the same time
hold it straight your finger will actually tremble with the dammedup
energy of the repressed impulse but the finger will not actually
move because the idea of its not moving is just as much a part of
your consciousness as the idea of its moving put out of your
consciousness this thought of the fingers not moving and forthwith
the finger will bend
your conduct during your waking hours is thus always the result of
opposing forces some tending in one direction others tending to
counteract the first thus there comes about a great waste of mental
power and an appalling loss of individual efficiency
sidenote training for mental teamwork
in the language of sport you are suffering from a lack of mental
team work the effect is the same as if the members of a football
team instead of combining their forces against the opposing side
should spend their time in restraining one another
it requires but one step and not a difficult one at that to lead you
to the conclusion that the solution of this problem lies in having in
consciousness at any one moment only such ideas as harmonize let that
condition prevail and the potential energies of all ideas in
consciousness must flow together in a broad stream of useful and
exhilarating activity
sidenote rust and the daily grind
your work should be a source of pleasure to you if it is simply a
disagreeable task that has to be performed if it is a daily grind
if you have to hold yourself to it by unremitting effort of the will
you are no better than a rusty engine and all your workings will be
accompanied by jars frictions and complaining squeaks that bespeak a
positively wicked loss of power
hold the right thoughts persistently in mind and you cannot help
working steadily on toward the goal you are thinking of keep steadily
at work with the right thoughts persistently in mind and success is
sure to come
success then lies in the concentration of mental energies and this
concentration is to be brought about by holding in consciousness only
those ideas that harmonize
sidenote ideas that harmonize
there must be the greatest discrimination and care used in the
selection of these ideas that are to constitute such a coordinating
consciousness there must be a reimaging or imagination in a
literal and practical sense of those ideas only that carry with them
impulses to motion in the same general direction you must have a set
purpose in life and you must yield your powers without hindrance and
without reservation to the accomplishment of that set purpose
sidenote five rules for conserving energy
i you must exercise deliberate patient and persistent watchfulness
to detect and repress all useless bodily movements you have all
sorts of silly habits twitchings jerkings itchings winkings
shrugs frowns coughs snifflings and odd and meaningless gestures
watch yourself do these things no more save your eyes and ears and
hands and nerves all your mental energy for useful effort
ii you must give yourself mind and body to one thing at a time
disregarding all that would lure you from your chosen task
iii you must acquire a selfconscious sense of your own
selfmastery it will help you to acquire this feeling if you will
continually assert i can and will accomplish anything that i am
determined upon i have the power of will i will accomplish this
thing i will make these assertions with all the force and intensity
of your whole being until you are pervaded with a sense of your own
power do this faithfully and in time this courageous and manly
attitude will become an inherent part of your personality
iv you must have confidence and when we say confidence we do not
mean a purely intellectual conviction we mean a profoundly emotional
faith it will help you to cultivate this feeling of confidence if you
will affirm many times a day i have implicit confidence in myself i
have perfect faith in my own powers i am absolute master of myself
and of my career practice affirmations of this kind persistently
and in time your mind will have permanently acquired the habit of
facing the facts of life in the way essential to success
v you must exert a favorable influence upon the mental attitude of
those about you this is not so difficult as it would appear you
cannot yourself acquire willpower confidence and courage without
impressing others with your possession of these qualities
personalities are revealed one to another by faint and suggestive
activities all unconsciously perceived your concentration of energy
will inspire others you will radiate an atmosphere of success you
will subtly influence your associates you will be a force to reckon
with and the world will know it your air of success will draw others
to you will bring business and goodwill and men and money will seek
a share in your enterprises
master your mental energies train them concentrate themthus only
may you win riches with honor
thus broadly put there is or perhaps it would be more accurate to
say there seems to be nothing startlingly new about this proposition
the world has always realized that singleness of purpose
concentration of effort is essential to success
but in the past the world has possessed no formula by which these
qualities might be acquired
men have endeavored to create in themselves the necessary qualities
for success having no knowledge of the mental elements that went into
their composition
they have tried to run the mental engine knowing nothing of its
mechanism
sidenote business luck and bluesky theories
some few have been lucky but the path has been strewn with a thousand
failures to one that passed on to success
there are some business men who look upon psychology as bluesky
theorizing or new thought there are others who have a hazy idea
that it is a sort of unfathomable mystery intended to amuse
longhaired scientists the truth is that every one of these same
business men if he is getting ahead is unconsciously using
psychological principles to the profit of his own business every day
in the year
sidenote devices for commercial efficiency
in the books that are to follow we shall show you the immense
practical value of a truly scientific psychology you shall come into
the psychological laboratory with us and work out rational scientific
and exact methods by which without possibility of failure and with
but reasonable effort you can at any moment completely concentrate
your mental powers you shall be instructed in simple devices for

depressive moods and raising yourself to a far higher level of
