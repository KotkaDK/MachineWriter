the ball
the autumn of 18 was as uncomfortable and triste a season as i have
ever known commerce and crops alike looked downrespectable prophets
of tory tendencies shook their heads with redoubled vigor and gloomy
but intense satisfaction at the near approach of that total ruin
they had so often foretold and the unfortunate devils of starving
mechanics unable to solve the problem of depression were raising
shindies by way of relieving their minds under these circumstances
it pleased the horse guards in the plenitude of their power and
inhumanity to banish her majestys  regiment of light dragoons to
an infernal region of smoke and sansculottism situated in the west
of england and known to mortals as the wealthy and busy town of
carrington
here then were we hurried at the very beginning of grouse shooting
from firstrate quarters in north britain
terrible was the change which came oer all our spirits every thing
was against us i do not believe i ever saw such rain byron talks
about natures tear dropsshe gave us a shower bath the effect
of all this may be imagined i am certain it was that fatal quarter
confirmed our major in the deep rooted love for kingstons old port
which finally cut him off at 65 while pretty little mrs pemberton
the paymasters wife no longer guided in the way she should go by
fashion and the aristocracy fell from the right path into a meeting
house and eloped with the preacher but our rulers care little for our
morals
au commencement the rich manufacturers were very civil and gave
us some most enormous dinners their daughters pretty girls enough
we found tolerable as women must always be even under the most
distressing circumstances but we had nothing to talk of to them it
was so confounding to try conversation with girls who had not a single
subject in common with you who looked on sporting as loss of time and
to whom all ones allusions illustrations and even good stories were
an unknown tongue their brothers were very awful as sammy spectre
says and when we asked the fellows to mess they got so brutally
drunk and talked such stupid slang we were thoroughly disgusted so
when the first terror of burnt mills and broken windows was passed
and the respectable cotton spinners taking time to breathe collected
their scattered faculties and remembered their dislike to the
military we were most ready to dispense with their society and our
communications were soon almost totally cut off
such was our position towards the beginning of september when one
morning as i was forgetting my misfortunes in alisons account of the
vendean war which in all probability i should have never read but
for our unlucky change of quarters tom ashley broke into my room
exclaiming keep your books for a dernier ressort my dear fellow
come along and get your tickets
for what said i peevishly for i am capable of acknowledging an
authors magic sometimes
no humbug you do not mean to say you have not read the placards
announcing the festival in the new music hall grisi mario and all
the rest of them a grand mass in g and something still grander in z
no i know nothing about it
well know it now there are to be three days hard work sacred and
scientific in the morning profane and light in the evening to wind up
with a fancy and full dress ball on thursday
well it is something to do so i am  vos ordres mon cher said
i taking my hat
we found the town full of fresh looking country faces and after some
delay and crowding secured our tickets the oratorio was very like all
other oratorios the concert like all other concerts there were airs
in both that made one think some other world must exist besides this
one of duns and devilry and art and army agents but a glance at the
singers one thought of their characters was quite enough to dispel
any heavenly illusions i have since tasted the exquisite enjoyment of
hearing the lovely tones and words i know that my redeemer liveth
thrill from pure lips and then i knew what music meant but at the
time of which i write i felt that any better feeling roused in me was
false both in cause and effect
all our fellows liked music or were used to it but i think they were
glad enough to kick their heels at the ball i found myself there
about eleven oclock listening to a very inspiriting quadrille
and gazing at the pretty little plebs and their snobbish partners
wondering if they really could be satisfied to waste their sweetness
on such specimens of humanity for there is a natural refinement
about women and the brutes were so preoccupied with self so
divested of that profound attention i always thought every woman
expected otherwise there was little to distinguish the gathering
from a ball at lady ys or lady ls the lights music and
refreshments were first rate the dresses handsome many in good
taste the thing wanting was the spirit of easy enjoyment which only
people sufficiently well bred to be natural dare venture on occupied
in these philosophic reflections i stood among a group of my brother
officers who were mingling their critiques of the mornings concert
with strictures on the mob round us when my eye was caught by a pair
of fair graceful shoulders to the right in front of me there was
something indescribable in the proud deerlike carriage of the head
with its simple classic knot of chestnut brown hair which made me
almost involuntarily exclaim that is a gentlewoman whoever she is
and nervously anxious to see if a nez retrouss or un nez noble
adorned the countenance which was hidden from me i edged my way into
a commanding but unremarkable position it was neither but one that
harmonised well with her broad smooth forehead and short tremulous
upper lip the general expression of the face was a sort of proud
yet gentle sadness perhaps thoughtfulness is the best word above
middle height her easy rounded figure moved slightly and apparently
unconsciously to the music while her dress and this i always
consider a most important characteristic was very gauzy and white
and perfectly without ornament except indeed a bouquet of brilliant
flowers which seemed to fasten the folds over the bosom how little
does this miserable description convey the impression of grace and
harmony this fair girls countenance and figure stamped upon my mind
but i know were i to write for ever i should still be dissatisfied
there was a fiert so thorough bred and yet so soft in her air that
i could have imagined her at home in the most splendid court and
what rendered this perhaps more striking was the remarkable contrast
presented by her companions
she was leaning one arm on the back of a seat occupied by a little thin
woman like a respectable housekeeper with a fierce contrivance of
lace and flowers on her head beside her and also behind the chair
was a plump comfortable looking man past middle age whose round rosy
face was adorned with two little restless laughing twinkling black
eyes a large bunch of seals to a black ribbon appeared below his
waistcoat in bygone style held up in a sort of relief by the goodly
protuberance below as i glanced at these details this last individual
said something to his beautiful companion with a sort of gravity over
all his face except the eyes she bent her head gently to hear and
then her lips parted with such a smile that i wondered i could have
thought her countenance expressed pride thought anything but happy
merriment such a smile must come from the heart
    and where it most sparkled no glance could discover
    in eyes lip or cheek for she brightened all over
that finished me i must know her i must dance with her i exclaimed
yes but how said burton who had been watching me i was trying to
find out who she is before you came in and no one knows them
how very odd said ashley
she is so strangely unlike the people with her and all the others
said i
ah egerton has received a death blow
command yourself my dear fellow
she must be cinderella under the chaperonage of the cook and butler
i am determined said i to know her and selon les rgles for
that is no young lady to treat with scant ceremony
so saying i took burtons arm and moved off to try and catch one
of the stewards we succeeded but the savage would do nothing
didnt like and could not say so we left him and burton was
laughingly pouring forth consolations when i exclaimed i have
it i will pretend to recognise her as some acquaintanceprofound
deferencemany apologies c eh get up a little conversation it
requires nerve but you know i am half irish
it requires great tact and impudence i wish you well thro it said
burton gravely
this little conversation took place near a pillar of which there was a
row two and two across both ends of the room dividing it into three
compartments the centre and largest of which formed the ball room on
reentering it we missed the group of which we were in search and for
a moment i thought that my inexorable illluck had sent them home
but no i soon discovered the unmistakeable profile close to the very
pillar at the other side of which we had held our consultation done
by all thats unfortunate i exclaimed no no said burton it is
impossible they could have overheard us besides they may have only
just got there
well coute qui coute i will venture
and i will watch
the next moment i was bowing profoundly with all the grace i could
muster i fear i am too presumptuous in hoping that you do not quite
forget me
she gazed on me at first with such a puzzled but full and steady glance
from her dark clear grey eyes that i felt ashamed of myself then
again sparkling all over with a smile and look of recognition she held
out her hand saying quietlyi am very stupid not to know you at
once but the moustache alters you and it is a long time since i saw
you how is your brother
i was electrifiedthe most cutting declaration that my flimsy artifice
was seen thro could not have perplexed me more a momentary glance
showed me burton standing transfixed with mouth and eyes wide open
then rallying my scattered ideas i hastened to avail myself of this
happy mistake and answered that my brother was quite well and would
be delighted to hear i had met her she bowed but i had a brother
could she really know him her next words solved the problem how did
he like your leaving the regiment it was so pleasant to be always
together murmuring something of submission to necessity i begged
her to join the quadrille then forming to which after some slight
hesitation she assented saying to her friends shall i find you
here yes said he of the seals as g p r james would call him
i am glad you are going to dance the little woman gave her a smile
and a nod and we joined the quadrille longing to draw her from her
reminiscences which kept me in a frightful state of mind lest i should
make a false step not daring to start almost any topic lest it should
betray me i feel convinced i presented an illustration of the acme of
boobyism at length i ventured to remark that i was surprised not to
have seen her at any of the oratorios this was true at all events we
only came over for yesterdays performances she said and arriving
very early we got up near the orchestra how superb that double chorus
was i should like to have heard it in some huge dim cathedral the
theatric decorations of that concert room seemed to jar upon the eye
yes i quite agree with you i am certain had i heard it under those
circumstances i should have been ready to shave my head tie a cord
round my waist and join the franciscans sur linstant
i felt more at easeif i can avoid my brother and the old regiment i
am tolerably safe i thoughtif i could get the smallest glimpse of
who i am i should go ahead famously
a few more sentences broken by the movements of the dance when my
partner returning to me again threw me off my centre by suddenly
raising her eyes to mine with a sort of demure merriment sparkling in
them saying you have not enquired for any of your old friends but
military memories are proverbially short and yours is no exception
i fear passing over the dangerous commencement of this speech i
launched into a glowing defence of military memories in general and
my own in particular and wound up by entreating her to give me the
fullest intelligence of all my old friends she shook her head ah
those generalities speak but badly of the kindliness of recollection i
like good heavens i was getting deeper in the mire the rich soft
tones that could not be uttered by any one not possessed both of heart
and intellect seemed to sink into mine so hastily stammering that
she did me great injustice i reiterated my request for all the news
she could impart i suppose you know all about the
i cannot remember the numbers of regiments said she looking to me
for the word
oh of course said i hastily a copious correspondence places me
pretty well au fond
yes but my cousin i know you will be glad to hear though you have
not the grace to ask is still abroad and i hear as beautiful as
ever and refusing all that princes and peers can offer to induce her
again to try the lottery of marriage
ah the loved are not always soon forgotten said i trying to chime
in with the tone of subdued feeling which seemed to pervade all my
fair companion said she looked at me with an air of disapprobation
and replied gravely notwithstanding their great disparity of years
my cousin did truly and deeply feel her husbands loss i had better
take care could i but draw her off from her confounded cousin at
that moment she dropped her fan i looked at it for a moment before
restoring it to her it was antique with gold sticks and of great
value the only part of her toilet that bespoke wealth you remember
that fan and lady desmonds grand ball said she smiling indeed i
do i exclaimed enraptured to have learned at one coup that dublin
was the scene of our acquaintance and that lady desmond was a mutual
friend here however the quadrille ended and accepting my arm my
unknown belle turned her steps and mine malgr moi in the direction
of the oft mentioned pillars near which we had left her chaperons
but those deserving individuals had with praiseworthy carelessness
disappeared and my companion after looking round in vain said in a
somewhat anxious tone they are certainly not here i shall never find
them again i suggested the probability of nature requiring support
and that the refreshment room would be the most likely place in which
to recover her lost guardians
assenting to this and to my proposal of an ice we were soon moving
en masse with the other dancers towards the tea rooms and now freed
pro tem from the incubus of cousins and brothers whom my partner
appeared to forget in her keen appreciation of the many ridiculous
points in the mob around her i felt my spirits rise to concert pitch
the embargo on my tongue removed and fancying myself most agreeable
the passage to the refreshment table seemed to me to be performed with
miraculous rapidityhere after a short inspection we discovered
the missing individuals and hastening towards them with speed i
thought rather ungracious this puzzling but fascinating girl with
an inclination of the head and a smile in which much suppressed mirth
seemed struggling dropped my arm and took her station beside her
incongruous companions but i was not to be so easily sent adrift i
had not served a twelve or thirteen years apprenticeship to ball rooms
to be thus dismissed if i choose to stay so with a deferential bow i
shall bring your ice here said i and rapidly securing one i had
the satisfaction of hearing her say as i approached with it as if in
continuation of something knew him slightly in dublin a long time
ago which in some measure placed me au dessous des cartes for if
only a slight acquaintance i could not be expected to have very many
subjects or reminiscences in common with her so resolutely determined
to stand my ground have another dance learn who she really was and
if possible lay the foundation of a future acquaintance i took up
a position beside the beautiful incognita and ventured to discuss
ireland in a guarded and general manner observing with perfect truth
that two of the pleasantest years of my life had been spent there i
could perceive a decided increase of cordiality in miss  what would
i not have given to know the name as i pronounced this eulogy on her
native countryfor i had soon guessed by the indescribable spirit
of frankness arch yet tempered with a certain dignity in its gay
abandon which pervaded her manner that she was irishand just as
she had turned laughingly to answer some playful charge against its
characteristics spoken apparently through a medium of mashed potatoes
in his throat by the man with the seals burton touched my arm
egerton dont keep all your luck to yourself introduce me
hold your tonguefor heavens sake my dear fellow i exclaimed in a
rapid asidedont breathe my name at this moment i have not the most
remote idea who i am and am constantly on the verge of an unpardonable
scrape be silent and begone i will tell you all afterwards silenced
and amazed poor burton retired and my unknown friend turning to me
as i stood elate at having conquered difficulties again showed me
my uncertain footing by observingbut you used to cherish the most
heretical opinions on these points and offend me not a little by their
open avowal what an illbred savage she must identify me with raw
boys are always odious and irrational you should not have deigned to
listen to me said i in despair
oh you were by no means a raw boy you looked quite as old as you do
now besides it is not half a century since we met she replied with
another distracting look and thenwith a merry burst of apparently
irrepressible laughter in which though i could not account for it
her friends and myself joinedit was so infectious addedyou
must forgive me but really your reminiscences seem to be in such
inextricable confusion i cannot help laughing in an agony lest all
should be discoveredwith the respectable couple beforementioned for
umpires i urged in defence that my memory was like the background
of a picture from which one figure alone stood out clear and well
defined then observing that she was beating time to the sound of a
most delicious waltz just begun am i too unreasonable to ask for a
waltz as well as a quadrille i said she half shook her head then
smiling to her companions observedit is so long since i had a
waltz i cannot resist it shall i keep you too late caro maestro
no no said the lady with the cap we will go and watch you in
a few moments i was whirling my fair incognita round to the inspiring
strains of the elfin waltz then new and unhacknied
what a delicious waltz that was my partner seemed endowed with the
very spirit of the dance her light pliant form seemed to respond to
every tone of the music and not an unpractised valseur myself i
felt that i was at all events no encumbrance to her movements i have
never heard that waltz sincewhether ground on the most deplorable of
barrel organs or blown in uncertain blasts from the watery instruments
of a temperance bandwithout seeing as in a magic mirror the whole
scene conjured up before my eyes the intense enjoyment of my partner
which beamed so eloquently from her soft grey eyes and spoke volumes
of the nature it expressed the childlike simplicity with which when
at length wearied she stopped and said turning to meyou dance
very well how i have enjoyed that waltz
many a stray sixpence those reminiscences have cost me but she
continued it must be late and i cannot keep my friends any longer
let us find them as soon as possible this was soon done and to my
infinite chagrin my partner declared herself quite ready to depart
pronouncing a glowing eulogium on my dancing you must have taken
lessons since i had the pleasure of meeting you for formerly there
she stopped for the philanthropic little cavalier she had called caro
maestro interrupted her wrapped a shawl round her begging she would
hold it to her mouth and keep that feature closed during her passage to
the carriage and led the way with his i supposed wife leaving me
still in possession of the little hand which had rested on my shoulder
during the waltz now or never i thought
i fear i have induced you to prolong that waltz beyond your strength
for i felt her arm still trembling with the exertion you must allow
me to assure myself tomorrow that you have felt no ill effects
we are not staying here she said with some hesitation we only came
in for the festival and leave tomorrow
here we reached the passage and il caro maestro proceeding to
discover their carriage i felt myself of course bound to divide my
attentions with the lady of the cap and not choosing to prosecute my
enquiries within range of her ears i remained some time in a state of
internal frying till he returned and i was again ttette for a
moment with their charge
but do you not reside in the neighbourhood we were close at the
door smiling with her eyes she shook her head pointed to the shawl
which she held to her mouth in obedience to the injunction she had
received and remained silent i was distracted forgive me i
exclaimed and pray speak i must see you again
come my dear cried my tormentor youll catch cold make haste
her foot was on the stepshe was in her guardian opposite herthe
glass drawn up move on said the policeman one glance as she bowed
full of arch drollery and i was left on the door step repeating over
and over no 756756 while my brain was in a whirl of excitement
my beautiful vision gone and my only clue to discover her the number
of a cab
chapter ii
the search
with a confused sensation of annoyance and ill temper i opened my eyes
at the reveill next morning and for some moments experienced that
most painful puzzle of which few in this troublesome world of ours
are quite ignorant and which is one of the accompaniments of a great
grief videlicet a perfect certainty that you are in the middle of
something disagreeable but what you are not sufficiently wide awake to
discover the process of shaving at all times a reflective one soon
cleared up to me the mystery and placed in full array the pros and
cons of my chance of ever meeting my beautiful incognita again even
my decidedly sanguine disposition was compelled to acknowledge that the
pros were few indeed still as i am not without a certain degree
of resolution especially when the matter to be decided on touches my
fancy or my affections i determined pretty firmly not to relinquish
the effort to discover and renew my acquaintance with the belle of last
night
i had hardly commenced an attack upon my eggs and broiled ham when
burton walked in brimful of curiosity as i had anticipated and to
avoid the bore of being questioned i at once opened my budget and
told him the whole history down to my present resolution the more
readily as he was a sufficiently highminded gentlemanlike fellow to
talk to about a woman you respected no blab and a great chum of mine
into the bargain
i regret to say he laughed most unsympathisingly at my dilemma and
acknowledged that he had spent the greater part of the evening watching
my proceedings and speculating as to alternate expressions of triumph
and defeat which swept across my countenance
i never heard of a more curious rencontre the fair unknown must
have had a very slight acquaintance with your prototype and then your
unequalled luck sending you to the right quarter for discovering the
scene of the original acquaintance and being sufficiently au fait
at its habits and inhabitants she could never have dreamt of having
mistaken you but how do you think of setting about her recovery
ah theres the rub an advertisement in the carrington
chronicleif the young lady with the antique fan c who danced
the elfin waltz with an officer of hms  light dragoons at the ball
last night will send her address to the cavalry barracks she will
hear of something to her advantage would hardly do eh besides the
admiration however respectful of a younger son a landless captain
would not i fear come under the denomination of an advantage
and suppose you discover her perhaps enshrined in some lordly old
manor house surrounded with all the prestige of position what will
you say for yourself as an excuse for your bold attempt to see her
again
if i met her in one of her native mud cabins the difficulty if it
existed at all would exist all the same for me i feel that she is in
herself equal to a ring fence of nobility but i continued walking
up and down the room with folded arms the approved method of showing
that stern determination that i can easily manage i suffered too
much and felt my natural powers whatever they are under too great a
cloud from my false position last night ever to submit myself to the
same again no i shall boldly say that i had called to relieve my
conscience by apologising for the audacity with which i had encouraged
her mistake last night but that i really had not sufficient strength
of mind to deny myself the pleasure of dancing and conversing with
her and that in reward of my present endeavour to do right i hoped
she would not deny me the honour of her acquaintance surely the very
effort to see her will be in my favour
granted et puis said burton coolly
for gods sake my dear fellow dont ask me to begin thinking of
consequences now for the first time in my life
it strikes me egerton that you are decidedly done for
not exactly yet i confess i would attempt and brave a good deal to
hear the low tones of my nameless belles rather remarkable voice once
more there was so much feeling in them i am sure she sings i fear
the wish to see her is scarcely reciprocated for i had at times a
dread sensation from the bright laugh in her eye that somehow or other
she was selling me probably she confounded me with some fool she had
known formerly flattering association yet i am not without what are
generally considered elements of success in the eyes of the fair sex
imprimis one dark brown curly pow as our friends in the north
say two eyes ditto in tint six feet high and an air distingu eh
burton what do you say
that youre an insufferable coxcomb but the inventory is tolerably
correct
dont imagine that i consider the items of much value none but
inexperienced boys think that mere good looks are a passport to the
heart of any woman thats worth having we love beauty exclusively but
there is not a woman with an ounce of truth in herself that will not be
instinctively attracted to a manly straightforward fellow be he ever
so plain and if he show her devotion give him her whole heart as
readily as if he was apollo and adonis all in one
hum said burton perhaps so but to business how do you intend to
proceed
first to discover cab 756 and from its interesting charioteer
learn at what hotel the objects of my search put up there they will
know their names
suppose they were at a private house with friends
pshaw suppose they had lodgings in the moon did i not tell you the
young lady expressly said they were perfect strangers
that might be faon
burton another objection and you may look out for squalls it is my
only plan so be silent
when do you set out upon the search
this morning while the memory of jehu may be fresh the moment parade
is over
shall we hunt in couples
no my dear fellow in such a pursuit you would founder at the first
fence
i confess my heart and soul are not in the business so i might be an
obstacle besidesbut theres the trumpet adieu may success attend
you and the spirit of a thousand detectives inspire you
parade over i hastened to doff my uniform and with a delightful
sensation of excitement which i never imagined i could experience in
the depressed atmosphere of carrington i sallied forth on my quest
with a spirit of perseverance which if there be any truth in ancient
proverbs augured well for the accomplishment of my object as usual in
that horrid locality the weather was dimmed dimp and disagreeable
as mantilini says and not more than three or four cabs on the first
stands i passed none of these sported the magic figures while the
innumerable ones which were in motion seemed by some perverse and
unaccustomed freak to drive with such unprecedented rapidity that
though keen of sight i could not distinguish their numbers after
perambulating the town in all its intricacies visiting every cab stand
extant within its compass standing numerous charges from the vehicles
themselves and a terrific amount of slang with the steadiness of the
42nd at waterloo i found myself towards five oclock much in the same
position as at starting what if my beautiful unknown should really
have vanished from my sight for ever and no 756 a modernised edition
of cinderellas magic coach be disenchanted into its original form
of a vegetable marrow the nearest approach i believe we have to a
pumpkin and burton toohe must be put down here a very dissipated
looking cab crawled slowly by drawn by a groggy horse his bones
showing in sharp angles through the oil cloth thrown over his back
with a mockery of care and driven by a small man with a face like a
crumpled crab apple and a hat in a galloping consumption 755 come
i thought thats within one of my number 755 ought to know something
about 756 i elevated my cane here you are sir the door was
opened stop said i you look intelligent for an immense amount
of knowingness twinkled or rather floated in his watery red eyes and
will perhaps assist me in a search i am making can you tell me where
i shall find cab number 756 i have been looking on the cab stands all
day and about the streets and cannot see it any where every other
number almost have i seen but 756 is invisible
756 said jehu reflectively and gazing sharply at me knows no such
number no such cab cos why sir 756 was done for four months ago
and has he was unfortnate no one liked to take the cabso its hoff
the stans
good heavens then was it a phantom conveyance in deep disappointment
i stepped in saying to the cavalry barracks instead of clapping
the door with the usual jerk the crumpled driver stood there his
face going through a perfect series of expressive wrinklings at last
with an effort and a knock of his forefinger against the brim of his
decaying hat praps youre a hofficer a sojer officer sir
yes said i rather surprised my regiment is quartered here
ho very good sir i thought as you were a detective hofficer sir
no offence sir
certainly not said i highly flattered at the mistake but why
cos sir you wanted so hard to get 756 i thinks he as summat
against him only you asked questions too straight forrard like i know
nothink about 756 we dont know much of each other less were on the
same stan only of course if you was a detective i wouldnt peach
i assure you said i i only wanted some information from 756 for
which i would have rewarded him and if you will help me
i know sir why you see if youve been a looking for him all day and
asked on all the stans
i did said i
and could hear nothink hell not be on the drive a good many numbers
blong to the otels sir
a glorious idea by jove of course they were at an hotel you shall
drive me round to them all said i till we find him
and if that wont do said my inimitable mentor you can summons
him the police will soon get him
he slammed the door with a triumphant wink that beggars description
and off we went at a wonderful pace
many were the hostelries we visited but in vain red blue and white
lions hen and chickens boars bears bulls and even nags heads the
entire animal creation ignored the existence of 756
least ways sir said my invaluable assistant between whom and
myself a great degree of confidence had sprung up as he prepared for
the fiftieth time to mount the box least ways sir weve done our
best youve been to all the otels as is good enough to keep cabs
cept two the cat and garters thats a poor un and the hangel
thats nearly as good as the adelphi
to the angel first then
arrived there i went into the bar and in the politest manner asked
its presiding goddess if 756 was enrolled amongst the cabs of
the establishment cant say sir here enrythe waiter came
forward756sir yes sir said the man unmovedly little imagining
the delight with which i heard his reply i looked at my watch seven
oclock let me have dinner in a private room said i and after
fully satisfying my most admirable jehu i returned to the charge
within
this way sir said the waiter with a waive of the handi followed
light a fire it is very damp
yes sir
in a few moments a rosy cheeked chambermaid came in with a coal box
and et ceteras for a fire this was what i wantedi drew a chair
near and after some observations on the weather passed on to the
probable numbers putting up at the house for last nights ball lots
of pretty girls from the country i concluded
yes sir we are still very full though a good many left this
morning
indeed i danced with a young lady last night who was staying here
but i cannot remember her name i want very much to find it outdo
you think if i were to describe her to you you could tell me
praps i might sir though often we dont know the names of the
people who stop here occasionally
well this young lady was tall and very fair with brown hair and a
very pleasant smile
i scarcely think i know any particular young lady like that sir
theres miss jones and miss mary peters and miss majoribanks squire
majoribanks daughter all just like that sir
confound it my description would have suited threefifths of the young
ladies of great britain
yes yes but the lady i mean was with an old fattish man black eyes
and thick voice and a little elderly woman who
oh i think i know sir she had a little brown mole on her cheek
near the chin a beautiful young lady
exactly i exclaimed in delight
they were only here two nights and i dont know the name at all they
were quite strangers
how intensely annoying but is there no one in the house has an idea
well i cant say sir you see we have been so busy if it is any one
it will be bill one of the cabmen sir he took them somewhere this
morning and i think they come from a but im not sure
here she began to gather her sticks and coals and the waiter entered
to lay the cloth
is bill in said iif so send him up without fail immediately
after dinner he is out just now sir well the moment he comes
in whether i have finished dinner or not
yes sir said both in chorus and excited
i had dined and was languidly examining the interior of a tart when
the waiter entered again announcing that bill was there if i wanted
him show him in by all means and bill made his appearance hat in
hand and stroking down his hair
oh good evening your name is bill i understand and i fancy you
can tell me something i want to find outyou drove a party from this
hotel somewhere this morning and i want to know their names there
was a little old lady and a tall young one with a short fat man
twinkling black eyes eh do you remember them
yes i think i does said bill slowly as if confused by my rapid
description fat short genlman spoke thickish i remember called my
horse a rough sketchnot filled up
precisely thats him i am sure what was the name
cant say sir i tuck em to the railway station they was agoin to
a
how do you know why as i was aputting of the luggage into a truck
at the station a porter turns one of em up and saysthis is for
a not manchester and puts it all into another truck and then i
just see a name beginning with a w and that was all as id to come
back direct for theres been a sight of work this week
then none of you can tell me the name of that gentleman
no sir they was quite strangers
sorry to have troubled you there
no trouble sir thank you sir
well thought i this is small success still it is better than
nothing and is a beginning ill keep up my courage and take an early
train to a tomorrow i have often heard it is worth seeing so
first for my bill and then for burton
the first was soon settled and a short drive placed me in the
barracks where not a little wearied with the days tramp i speedily
luxuriated in dressinggown and slippers and detailed to burton the
wonderful perseverance and sagacity with which i had hunted up the
track at all events old fellow ive got the locale the opening
is decidedly propitious and tomorrow i start for a you shall
hear the result on my return for as i am on duty i must i suppose
be back the same night i cant ask you to take it again after today
but sedley or some one will well said burton you deserve
success but what will you do when you get to a go to every house
and describe your incognitaor ask for a list of the inhabitants and
hunt up every name that begins with w certainly the commanderinchief
has a great deal to answer for in exposing hms officers to the
dangers of such a quarter where the dearth of all natural occupations
and amusements drives them to fouchism i would offer to go with you
but that i promised sedley to go over to  just to have a look at
ms mare for after all he has entered diana for the cup and i rather
have a fancy to back her
oh never mind you know old boy in a hunt of this kind i think
that safety or success does not consist in numbers ill take my
sketch book though ive almost forgotten how to hold a pencil since
we came to this infer but i hear a row on the stairs oblige me
my dear burton by not mentioning my search nor its object to any of
our fellows if youve not done so already they are accustomed to my
occasional artistic fits when i cut you all and
im dumb said burton only dont have one in reality for you grow
too philosophic to be companionable
as he spoke the door opened and half a dozen noisy subs burst in to
carry us off to sedleys room where devilled kidneys and roman punch
finished the evening
chapter iii
the rencontre
the quaint old cathedral town of a is some twentyfive miles from
carrington and often an excursionpoint to the inhabitants of the
latter as an excellent hotel rendered them tolerably secure of a good
dinner i had often threatened a sketching visit to it which bad
weather and a strict routine of duty in consequence of the expected
disturbances had hitherto prevented my fulfilling it was therefore
with no common alacrity i started on my expedition armed with a
large sketch book which bid defiance to the suspicion of my brother
officers the weather though gloomy was no longer wet and a walk of
about half a mile brought me from the railway to the walls of the
old city rough red and weather beaten they at the first glance
showed many a point equally available to a draughtsman or an enemy
once considered almost impregnable they are now chiefly valued as a
dry and pleasant promenade for the citizens i am no great antiquarian
but i believe those splendid old romans who have supplied all europe
with interesting relics are accountable for the original foundation of
a various princes and potentates have added their endeavours and
at present it is perhaps the most picturesque old town in england
at each step i took some delicious carved gable or galleried front
overhung the street mingled with modernised shops it is true yet
as a whole charming to my eye of late accustomed only to the
unmitigated squareness of modern brick and modern iron accompanied
as they are at carrington by all the abominations of soi disant
civilisation without one of its beauties
over all rose with a grave paternal air the abbey towers which seemed
to infect the atmosphere of the place with a calm ecclesiastical repose
well suited to its aspect these general views i took in while pursuing
my way towards the principal hotel where i intended to put up more as
an excuse for pushing my enquiries than for any other reason during
my way thither diverted by the various sketchable points i constantly
passed the immense difficulties of my search did not so strikingly
present themselves till entering the hotel i called for the landlord
and the cart and endeavoured to describe the man with the seals
as a most agreeable individual whose acquaintance i wished to renew
but could only remember the first letter of his name mine host was
impenetrable he knew many who answered to my description but none
i was likely to have met there was wilkins the first butcher in the
city wiggins the tobacconist dr worthington a highly respectable
chemist mr white the methodist parson no no it could be none of
these what my beautiful incognita under the chaperonage of a butcher
a tobacconist or a chemist the landlord was departing when a sudden
spasm of memory seemed to seize him could it be winter there was
a very pleasant gentleman of that name lived in the abbey garden he
painted pictures grand pictures and had a nice farm in right of his
wife was he a gentleman oh yes he used often to dine at the
deans and sometimes with the bishop mr winter was thought a deal
of
perhaps winter was the name well i will try let me have dinner at
six and now for the abbey
i spent two or three hours very agreeably in exploring the aisles and
passages and beautiful choir of this irregular but impressive old
pile feeling the deep effect which may be produced by the simple
sense of weight and size the town hall quaint enough a subterranean
chapel the remains of the castle and a roman bath made up the sum of
sight seeing and still i pondered on the chances of winter turning
out to be the veritable man with the seals i walked on the walls and
saw prince ruperts and king charles towers and finally asked my way
to the abbey garden it was a good sized square near the cathedral
full of substantial houses and walking round i saw the name of j
winter on the hall door of one of them should i knock no for that
beautiful girl was not their daughter indeed she seemed to exercise
more authority over them than they over her and i should only land
myself in a scrape perhaps lose by precipitancy no i will not
knock but like the sage captain in ali baba or the forty thieves i
will mark the house and next week being off duty take up my abode
sketch book and all in the old city for a few days and the devils
in the dice as poor obrien of the 88th used to say if i do not
make the plump little artists acquaintance before they are over thus
resolving i again turned to the walls which here approached a river
sufficiently broad and winding for beauty though not for grandeur
this was the only side at which the town appeared to overflow the
limits of its walls but here a straggling and inconsiderable suburb
stretched for a short distance and even one unusually large church
with a lofty detached tower seemed to have burst bounds and sought the
vicinity of the river towards which the ground sloped rather abruptly
and was altogether lower than that within the walls from which a
flight of rude steps led to the road beneath a few remarkably fine old
trees a broken rocky red bank scarcely high enough to be dignified
with the name of cliff at the other side of the river with undulating
meadows and a distant line of blue hills beyond made up a scene of
much unpretending beauty i gazed at it long with quiet pleasure
anticipating my sjour among its attractions and trying to persuade
myself i had much better give up the pursuit i had embarked in with
such ardour one throw more said i half aloud and if this winter
does not turn out to be my man of the seals ill give it up though by
all the saints that adorn that old gateway it would be for the good
of my soul to see those eyes and hear that voice again but pshaw
ive been in love before and found it not insurmountable and now i
am not in love only curious and with this wise conclusion i ate my
dinner and returned to carrington where i was met by burtons rather
anxious well what success why not much but iam going over next
weekhe smiled
a few days after i fulfilled my intention and installed myself and
a formidable array of sketching materials at the royal and about
noon the following day sallied forth to revisit the walls where they
command the view which had so much pleased me proceeding leisurely
along the thinly peopled streets my eye was caught by a figure in
strong contrast to all that had hitherto passed me it was that of an
old gentleman tall erect and still vigorous the greatest symptom of
his age being the perfect whiteness of the profuse hair which curled
or rather waved under his hat the old fashioned buff waistcoat blue
coat and gilt buttons together with his colored cravat and frilled
shirt had an air of perfect freshness making a tout ensemble
thoroughbred and remarkable an expression of easy benevolence sat on
his aquiline and aristocratic features and his bright blue eyes had
an eagle look not unmingled with humour while i gazed unobservedly
for he was at the opposite side of the street the countenance grew
strangely familiar to me and in a moment a curtain seemed as it were
raised from my memory and scenes in which we had both been actors
stood before me with all the startling vividness that sometimes invests
circumstances which the rush of life jostle for a while into hidden
nooks of memory where they are preserved as it were by darkness
from loss of their pristine colors
some ten years before a raw stripling i joined my regiment when
quartered in a singularly remote and beautiful district in the west
of ireland where still though much diminished some remnants of the
old national custom of duelling remained chiefly among the inferior
gentry at a large gathering of the magnates and smaller fry too some
anniversary dinner it was my illfate to get into an absurd dispute
which a little manly selfcommand would have soon concluded but
which the impetuosity and inexperience of boyhood rapidly fanned into
a promising quarrel my antagonist a man sufficiently qualified by
birth to associate with gentlemen had not as yet by character quite
forfeited the claim so that affairs soon wore an unpleasant aspect
with heightened complexion and quickening pulse stung by his insolent
assumption of superior experience i was imperiously reiterating some
not very amiable opinion when a gentleman of striking appearance
begged with polished courtesy to know the subject in dispute a
mere trifle the folly of which struck me as i explained it then in
few words and with the consummate tact of a man of feeling as well
as of the world backed by a tone of kindly authority his dignified
appearance fully warranted he stilled our dispute without one scratch
to the amour propre of either party presenting himself as colonel
darcy vernon he begged to have the pleasure of knowing me adding
with a few laughing words on my impetuosity there is something in
your spirit i can well sympathise with and i hope you will do me the
favour to accompany your brother officers captain dashwood and mr
hauton whom i expect next week for a little shooting at dungar
i readily accepted and often while the regiment remained in that
part of the world enjoyed the hospitality of dungar and the real
pleasure of colonel vernons society
of a high family which formerly possessed an immense territory now
sadly dwindled he had only just retired from the command of the
county militia having never held higher rank than that of captain
in the army when i last saw him though no longer keeping hounds
his house was a model of all that was most agreeable and luxurious
notwithstanding unpleasant remarks as to the incumbrances of his
estates rife almost at his own table
to return from this long digression colonel vernon had always held an
indisputable place in my memory not only for the kindness and pleasure
i had received from him but as a model of chivalrous courtesy with
the utmost amazement i now recognised him and determined to renew
an acquaintance crossing the street with this intention just as i
reached him a passing workman jostled him rudely and shook his gold
headed cane from his grasp seizing this opportunity for accosting
him i stooped for the cane and restored it to him raising his hat
and bowing with sauve grace he said sir you are very good i am
extremely obliged to you
i bowed smiled and still standing in front of him said i fear sir
you have forgotten my name as well as my face nevertheless fred
egerton of the  dragoons is most happy to see colonel vernon
looking as well as he did ten years ago
egerton god bless my soul so it is my dear boy i am truly glad to
see you i remember you perfectly and gad it takes ten years from my
life to see you again
and we were shaking hands with a fortyhorse power of cordiality then
turning with me he took my arm
but what lucky wind has blown you here egerton
why we are quartered at carrington and i am here on a sketching
expedition imagine my surprise and pleasure at recognising you in
about the last place in the world i should have anticipated such a
rencontre but tell me how goes the world at beautiful dungar
i felt a sudden pressure on my arm ah my dear egerton i really do
not know poor dungar has not been mine for several years in short
i am living very quietly here and having led the usual life of an
irish proprietor short and sweet i am now atoning for it though god
forgive the word i am very happy and you must come and dine with
me in my crib small as it is for by gad i am very glad to see you
though till you spoke i did not recognise you you have grown so dark
and i fancy taller
and your little granddaughter was there not one with you in ireland
a pretty fairhaired child who was always in mischief yes yes
said he with a pleasant sparkle of the eye ill introduce you to
her talking copiously of past times and people sometimes laughing
at some droll reminiscence sometimes glancing off from topics i could
see made my companion wince he directed my steps towards an old
gateway passing through which we pursued a narrow lane between two
rows of ancient red stone houses opening on a road which i recognized
by a flight of steps descending from the city wall and the large old
church in front to be the same i had observed on my first visit
a low wall surrounded the church yard in which were few graves a
great deal of grass and several venerable yew trees altogether a
good sized enclosure we entered it through a wroughtiron gate of
curiously ancient workmanship standing between two large yew trees
and wide open opposite to which a low deep arch of vast thickness
showed the church door within a square and lofty tower rose beside
the church independently from the ground at the western extremity
where we entered and the edifice itself ponderous looking and most
picturesquely irregular stretched out for a considerable distance
following my companion by the path along the side of the church and
listening to and answering his observations my eye took in without
an effort these details and reaching the east end i perceived
that much of this portion of the building was in ruins although the
exterior walls were still in tolerable preservation several branches
of trees waved over them and here was a small but perfect round arch
surmounted by some old gothic inscription i had not time to decipher
and filled up by a green wicket clenched with nails which my kind old
friend pushed open and shaking me by the hand welcomed me to his new
but diminutive territory with true irish warmth and yet with a tinge
of melancholy i could only return his pressure in silence as i stood
enchanted with the beauty of the spot into which i was ushered
this end of the building had as i have said fallen into decay and
the present east window was some fifty yards within the old one and
peeped out through the feathery foliage of a splendid ash and several
acacias which grew almost against it while the rugged red wall was
covered with ivy and other creepers the little enclosure formed by
the ruined walls was divided in two by a row of three low ornamented
arches somewhat broken and beyond these rose clear against the sky
the lacelike tracery of the old window much of which remained
together with the remnant of a round tower
at the side where we entered a magnificent spreading elm filled the
inner enclosure with grace and shade and both were carpeted with
the greenest softest grass a few red and white roses mixed with
evergreens adorning the larger of the two enclosures and a straight
neatly gravelled walk led to a door opposite half glass the entrance
to a red stone cottage forming one side of the quadrangle a timeworn
madonna and child and a quaintlooking and rather plump saint saying
his prayers stood sentry right and left of this humble portal
advancing to which the colonel rung the bell observing you admire
this kate will be enchanted it was the vicars residence but the
present man is too great for so small a place and lets me rent it
this is not a common church but managed i do not quite know how they
call it st augustines priory and this cottage is known as the priory
house
as the door opened walk in is miss kate at home nelly
this question was addressed to the servant a fat dignified old lady
in black with an apron and cap of irreproachable whiteness there
was a volume of character in her rather wide mouth slightly drawn at
the corners and the decided nez retrouss bespoke a somewhat sharp
temper
no sir she tuck a roll of music and cormac went with her i dare
say shell be in soon
well well wait for her said vernon but by the bye nelly dont
you remember this gentleman at all he used to be often at dungar
why now she returned with a keen glance i disremember sure
there was thousands of them all with hair on their faces just like
his honour but at all ivints yere heartily welcome sir for its
seldom i see a gentleman barring the masther bowing and thanking
her for the compliment i followed colonel vernon across a little
square arched hall its only light derived from the glass door to one
opposite leading into a pretty modern room to which a bow window
occupying one entire side gave light and space it looked into a small
pleasure ground where towered an ancient and gigantic oak beyond which
the bank sloped steeply to the river winding blue and peaceful at its
foot the room was redolent of heliotrope and mignionette and gay with
brilliant dahlias fuchsias and though late in the season roses a
pianoforte some worked chairs and a print of john anderson my joe
then not quite so common as now over the mantlepiece were the only
articles in the room at all removed from the simplest and commonest
style of furniture yet a spirit of grace and refinement pervaded all
its arrangements and breathed i know not what of purity and peace
into its atmosphere all this time i was expressing my admiration of
his domicile to my friend the colonel who was evidently delighted
by my encomiums yes he said quiet and snug this and the dining
room were additions by a wealthy rector some thirty years ago but
the little hall was formerly an entrance into a large confessional or
penitentiary and so was the outer gate leading to it kate can tell
the whole story i know it very imperfectly by the way what has
become of that curious fellow with the stutter that used always to
forget the most essential part of every story
and we again plunged into reminiscences half an hour must have
elapsed and i was just meditating some enquiries as to the existence
in a of a party such as i had met at carrington when something
scratched at the door the handle turned it opened and in walked in
shawl and bonnet but in unmistakeable propri person my beautiful
incognita my nameless partner the object of my search followed by a
huge majestic looking dog shaggy and stern i had risen as the door
opened and now stood transfixed while the lady started and blushed
to the eyes
kate my love said her grandfather let me present captain egerton
an old acquaintance of mine
and of mine too grandpapa she replied with a smile indescribably
arch and recovering herself completely i had the pleasure of meeting
captain egerton last week at carrington and it appears we had known
each other long ago
oh was this the gentleman how extraordinary and he laughed most
heartily
recovering my selfpossession i said i have been most anxious to
apologise for encouraging your mistake the other evening and came to
a in the vague hope of discovering you for that purpose but since
colonel vernon is i see acquainted with the affair he will i am
certain admit the temptation was irresistible
faith i do boy but there was no mistake at all
how i asked again plunged in bewilderment
speak for yourself miss kate said the old gentleman
indeed captain egerton began kate with a bright blush and merry
laugh i scarce know how to excuse my escapade first you must know
it was rather a sudden thought of my kind chaperons to go to the
ball and knowing no one we merely meant to look at the proceedings
and return we were standing near a pillar and i was thinking how
i would like to dance when my attention was attracted by some one
exclaiming rather loudly i have it ill pretend to recognise an
acquaintanceprofound deference get up a little conversation eh
i could not help smiling at the scheme and wishing to witness its
dnouement you may imagine my surprise when a few minutes after
you addressed me i knew your voice and as you spoke it glanced
across my mind that it would be pleasant to dance and better still
to punish you with your own device by pretending to remember you i
was fully satisfied for though a little nervous at first i soon
gathered confidence from your frequent confusion how i wish dear
grandpapa you could have heard our conversation i do not think i ever
was more amused but captain egerton you certainly played your part
with infinite tact and sometimes grandpapa whenever he grew too
much at his ease i used to throw him into confusion by some question
or allusion that utterly puzzled him then turning to me you must
promise to forgive and not think me very wild but the temptation to
retaliate was irresistible
forgive you oh miss vernon what an uncalled for request it is i
that should pray for forgiveness for my presumption i deserved a great
deal more severity and while i must compliment you for your inimitable
acting thank you for your forbearance and the delightful hour i passed
in your society
oh i had the game in my own hands it was you who played your part
well
we are then quite reconciled i hope said i
perfectly she replied but how did grandpapa find you out
vernon explained i spoke warmly of the happy days i spent with him in
ireland
dear dungar said miss vernon softly with her eyes bent down she
sat silent for a few moments then looking up with something that
glistened like a tear she looked at me steadily and said then i do
remember captain egerton he let me win the race on my pony midge
the same said colonel vernon indeed i am very glad to see you at
the priory she continued in her peculiarly frank manner so cordial
and so well bred and you are staying here for a few days
yes replied the colonel and will dine with us today will you not
egerton
i accepted most readily scarcely believing that my oft reviled luck
was about to make me so ample a return for past disagreeables as
to place me at once on a footing of intimacy with the muchadmired
incognita now incognita no more
chapter iv
the dinner
the old colonel continued for some time to engross the largest share of
the conversation pouring forth innumerable questions about the various
members of our corps of whom he appeared to have a remarkably clear
recollection interspersing his reminiscences with many a well told
anecdote while i answered his questions and his granddaughter sat
quite still apparently lost in thought her bonnet and shawl thrown
carelessly off one little hand twisting the ear of the solemn old
dog who sat upright beside her the deep blush which had sprung to
her cheek on her first perceiving me had left a warm tinge behind
and although i did my best to bestow that profound attention on her
respected progenitor which is so essential a sign of good breeding i
could not prevent my eyes from constantly turning to assure myself that
the graceful figure so unconsciously attracting them was real not a
pleasing dream of fancy
suddenly colonel vernon ended something he was saying i do not know
what with you were too young to remember all this kate but i think
you said just now you remembered captain egerton
no grandpapa with a clear calm look in my face not the slightest
recollection of captain egerton i only remember a very merry and young
gentleman whom a long time ago i used to think not too old for a
playfellow at dear dungar but i should never in the least recognise
him and i had quite forgotten the name till you mentioned it
well really miss vernon my memory is a little better than yours
colonel vernon will bear me witness that one of my first enquiries
this morning was for yourself
quite true said the old gentleman but i must own kate twas
evidently prompted by a most confused recollection
nimporte said kate rising with one of her bright smiles the
least little bit of recollection ever so tangled is precious in my
eyes and grandpapa as poor dear mrs winter has scarcely got over
her horror of my conduct the other night let me calm her nerves by
introducing captain egerton to her as a real orthodox acquaintance i
shall ask my little chaperon and her caro sposo to tea shall i
she tied on her bonnet and threw her shawl around her without waiting
for an answer come cormac au revoir captain egerton and
departed followed by her canine squire
yes said colonel vernon they are really a very kind pair of
oddities and kate has formed the warmest friendship for both winter
is a painter of some talent and a gentleman in the true meaning of the
word if not exactly in the conventional acceptation of it and i am
glad to secure such companionship for my dear child who has but little
to amuse her
poor vernon seemed quite to cling to me and insisted on walking me
round the walls to the cathedral the castle c scarcely leaving
me time to dress as the dinner hour approached i confess it was
with a feeling of delightful excitement i performed my rapid toilet
it seemed to me that fortune having satisfied her conscience by her
recent frowns was now yielding to her natural inclination to favour
the brave and ready in the present sunny tone of my mind to accept
anything as a happy omen i looked forward to long bright days in what
i was pleased to consider a prophetic mood
i soon found myself coasting the old priory and pausing for a few
moments again to admire the beautiful and singular little pleasure
ground looked about for the bell as there was no knocker when the
door was opened by the watchful nelly who had espied my approach
from some private loophole she received me with a curtsey the
depth of which was calculated to impress my mind more with a sense
of her own dignified position than any peculiar respect for myself
under its influence and her guidance i crossed the little gloomy
hall in a subdued manner repressing a strong inclination to laugh as
she opened the door announcing in audible tones selon la regle
the honourable mr egerton colonel vernon was standing by the
window opening on the garden and through it i could perceive his
granddaughter gathering flowers or some such things she bowed and
smiled as she perceived me and a moment after stepping into the room
stood waiting until her grandfather had finished his account of our
morning rambles and arranged some halfblown damask roses in her
dress which by the way was gathered under a band that marked out her
round and pliant figure to perfection instead of terminating in an
acute angle as is the general fashion why i cannot imagine a more
unnatural finale could scarcely be invented although it must be a more
daring spirit than mine that would venture to fix any limit to the
creative genius of millinery i suppose it is my taste for drawing that
has made me so keen an observer of womans dress nor have i ever found
my conclusions thereon false
miss vernon too had the good taste to wear a great deal of soft lace
which set off her round white throat making it look fairer still and
yet i have known some women turn from lace to linen but these usually
presided at dorcas committees
yes said miss vernon as her grandfather paused you must be tired
do you know captain egerton you seem to have infused new life into
grandpapa he has not walked so much for months and yet he is quite
fresh i hope nurse will let us have dinner soon
how did that very dignified person find out i was chronicled in
debrett i asked i was amused and surprised at hearing myself so
solemnly announced
nelly seemed troubled in her mind with some indistinct recollections
of you and asked me if your brother was not a great lord but i could
not resolve her doubts so
yes broke in the colonel she made the same enquiry of me and
i told her her surmises were correct to the best of my belief she
piques herself on her knowledge of rank and precedence
what a relief it must be to her to think there is at last some good to
counterbalance the crying evil of poor mr and mrs winters degrading
society people like nurse are such strange mixturesshe would respect
a gentleman in rags if he had a highsounding name and excuse his
unpardonable extravagancewhile she utterly despises a man of talent
and respectability because he earns money instead of wasting it
not a word against my sheet anchor nelly exclaimed the colonel
oh said his granddaughter i am her warmest admirer and
here nurse appeared in propri person and announced dinner give
kate your arm egerton i wish i had a fair lady to escort myself
did you communicate your fears for my brothers health when your
nurse enquired for him i asked as we crossed the hall to the dining
room
de grce said miss vernon let that rest we have little to
reproach each other with we both behaved very badly
at least i had temptation to plead in excuse but your motive was
sheer mischief
and you call that no temptation do you
the dining room looked on a different view of the river and fields
and gave a peep of a wood on the opposite bank which i had not yet
seen its furniture bespoke the absence of wealth the only approach
to ornament was a gracefully shaped basket filled with bright flowers
which did duty as an epergne while the wellpolished plate bright
glass and snowy table linen were admirable substitutes for more
costly addenda and equally refreshing was the simple dinner of trout
from the river welch mutton and fresh fruit to my palate wearied
with the hacknied entres of our regimental chef
nurse performed the part of butler with much empressement and
occasionally in reply to any question from her master joined with
much ease and selfpossession in the conversation
there was something deliciously new to me in the whole entertainment
my experience of dinners had been confined to the olla podrida of
the mess table and the equally long full dress affairs at which i had
assisted both in town and country with an occasional scramble at an
hotel or restaurant but here there were grace and order that did not
convey the idea of employing a host of attendants and consuming a
small fortune in its production in short it appeared to possess the
charm of home which nothing costly or studied ever conveys
you have a different view here i observed looking up from my plate
to the prospect before me and i fancy it will afford some sketchable
points
then you sketch how pleasant said miss vernon
it was a search for the picturesque brought him here replied the
colonel
for the beautiful and picturesque colonel i added
well well they are generally united
certainly in this case said i
i am glad i asked the winters this evening
my dear master will give you a carte du pays he has great genius
though i tell him he is too fond of bread and cheese subjects
observed miss vernon
bread and cheese subjects i asked
he made an admirable picture of two boys eating bread and cheese and
is rather fond of that style of subjects which i call after his first
attempt she replied
i prefer bread and cheese to gods and goddesses myself but kate has
nurse on her side the jellythank you nurse how do you like mr
winters pictures youve seen them said the colonel
deed then i have sir its the scum of the earth he paints a
gentleman painther should be above such raff sure little billy
mckeogh in killeash would never put a brush to anything ondher
jupither or vanius with crowns on their heads and whin me uncle
wanted a coach and horses for a sign me bould billy sis sis he i
dont like thim low subjects sis he an he only a bit of a boy was
the fish right sir this conclusion was sotto voce and addressed
with a confidential bend to her masters ear but reached mine
also miss vernon however replied aloud and without a shadow of
embarrassment at this domestic query
the fish was very nice dear nurse
it was a chef doeuvre colonel i exclaimed we must try to win
nurse over to us brougire our chef can do nothing like it
a few lessons from mrs otoole suggested nurse modestly
ah yes mrs otoole would be invaluable
see that now said nurse with a triumphant look as she retired
thats a great character i remarked
and a good one i do love nurse returned miss vernon
she is thoroughly irish an englishman seldom appreciates such a
character said her grandfather
but i may do so i am half irish my mother was a de burgh i
exclaimed eagerly
indeed said miss vernon
oh i remember something of that observed colonel vernon
besides miss vernon did i not serve an apprenticeship to all that is
pleasantest in irish life at dungar i continued
bravo cried the colonel
we admit you are half a compatriot said miss vernon
it is curious kates distinct remembrance of you when you used
to play so good naturedly with her at dungar and her total
unconsciousness of your identity at the ball
it is too provoking i returned to think my stratagem was in fact
unnecessary could i have discovered your name i am certain dungar
would have immediately presented itself to my memory miss vernon looks
like an irish woman and
it is well you have so clearly made out your perfect familiarity with
irish life the english ideal of an irish woman generally presents a
broad face wide mouth and torn petticoat said she laughing
i had sufficient tact not to reply save by a look which i was glad to
perceive possessed sufficient eloquence to call up the soupon of a
blush into the speakers cheek
believe me i tried hard for some legitimate introduction before i
ventured on my bold attempt
yes said the colonel laughing you were i remember remarkable
for your timidity
you certainly did look a little amazed when i pretended to recognize
you remarked miss vernon but only for a moment there was a mr
harcourt i used to meet at lady desmonds a very fine gentleman
something like you with whom for the sake of consistency i chose to
identify you you see grandpapa i could not have danced but for some
such ruse and when i proposed merely looking on i did not calculate
how the sounds and sights of a ballroom would rouse the old leaven
within me
my good star was in the ascendant but for your admirable treatment
of my audacity i should have been still ignorant that i had old friends
within reach
you would have stumbled on me in some of your sketching expeditions
observed the colonel
i exclaimed hastily yes but and stopping my imprudent revelations
rose to open the door for miss vernon who left us saying she had
outstaid the proper interval for ladies we soon followed her and
stood gazing at a fine harvest moon which was gradually silvering the
rocks and the river as daylight disappeared until the arrival of miss
vernons guests speedily broke in upon our pleasant reminiscent chat
and i was formally introduced
mrs winter looked rather puzzled i thought my dear it was all a
mistake your dancing with this gentleman
well mrs winter the whole affair is now in such an entanglement
of mistakes that i advise you not to attempt unravelling it rest
content with the assurance that captain egerton is a bon fide old
acquaintance fully recognised by grandpapa and myself
i am sure i never meant i doubted it said kates exchaperon with a
little twittering embarrassed laugh but
i am going to make tea and you had better make your peace with
captain egerton whom you evidently doubt returned miss vernon
i seated myself beside mrs winter and drew her into conversation
by praising the old town and its locale with very genuine warmth
it was her native place and my appreciation of it seemed to open
her heart we then in some imperceptible manner glided into natural
history and i was listening with every appearance of thrilling
interest to a circumstantial account of the habits and customs of a
pug dog called fan when miss vernon approached with a cup of tea
whereupon my informant rose saying she would go to the tea table
around which we all now assembled
captain egerton is a brother of the brush mr winter said miss
vernon
indeed he replied with a sharp keen glance whats your style
sir
oh i merely sketch sometimes in water colours but generally in
chalks very rude attempts i assure you
its a glorious gift any portion of power to transfer living nature
to dead canvass or paper miss vernon tells me that she would give
worlds to be a painter and yet she will not even try to draw
i do try she exclaimed i feel my eyesight failing fast in the
effort but you cannot force nature and she did not intend me for a
proficient in your noble art
pooh pooh cried winter dont tell me that with your eye for the
beautiful for colors for grace look at the arrangement of those
flowers captain egerton that you have no genius for painting you
have been shamefully neglected and all your talents forced into
another species of harmony more fashionable but infinitely inferior
and he puffed wiped his forehead and swallowed his cup of tea at a
gulp
mr winter i will not allow you to misrepresent yourself said miss
vernon you love music in your very soul do not pretend to think it
inferior for the sake of argument
it is inferior painting appertains more to the intellect than
music rejoined winter stoutly
we know that angels sing in heaven but we never heard of their
sketching replied miss vernon
mr winter the colonel and i laughed heartily at miss vernons novel
argument and winter recovered from the momentary shock with a hasty
pooh pooh heaven indeed look at the lives of eminent painters and
then look at the lives of musicians
i would rather not said his antagonist
yes it is strange i observed but painters seem to be a less
dissipated set of fellows than musicians yet surely there is something
of heaven in music and
captain egerton cried miss vernon holding up a menacing finger
are you taking that renegades part
far from it miss vernon no art can surpass music in my estimation
but as to the lives of its professors there is alas no mistake
i was a member of the beefsteak club in dublin said the colonel we
used to begin our evenings with the most divine duets and trios glees
and choruses c but towards the end earth assumed the ascendant
and so great was its attraction that by far the greater number of us
were generally floored before the finale
but said winter with a slightly contemptuous look i do not speak
of mere performers i mean composers creators men of genius
they surely were men of good report at least began miss vernon
miss kate if you please said nurse looking in little mr gilpin
wants to spake to you
oh show him in nurse say grandpapa particularly wishes to speak to
him
the colonel rose and advanced a step or two towards the door through
which entered a little man deformed and slightly lame with the pale
angular face usual in deformed persons a pair of deep set vivid dark
eyes and a certain mild sad expression which conveyed itself to you
at oncethough it could not be said to strike youand saved him from
the appearance of utter ugliness he came forward with an uncertain
timid manner holding a broad duskylooking book the colonel shook
his hand with an air of extreme cordiality and highbred respect
exclaiming we had almost given you up miss vernon who had also
risen now greeted him did you not get my message mr gilpin i
called at your house today to beg you would join us this evening
no said a remarkably rich soft voice none was given to me i came
here to show you a treasure i lately discovered in an old chest in the
chapter house and he handed her the book
miss vernon opened it with looks and exclamations of delight and
winter joined the group
i was left seated with his wife the only member of the party who had
not risen to greet the new comer i turned an enquiring glance towards
her to which she answered in a low tone mr gilpin the organist of
the priory church he is an excellent musician and a great favorite
with the colonel and miss vernon
here miss vernon interrupting her examination of the book and laying
it on the piano said but i am forgetting to offer you any tea
mr gilpinand placing a chair beside her own returned to the
tea table while colonel vernon with a wave of the hand towards me
exclaimed there is the reason we particularly wished you to join us
this evening my dear sir in order to make our old and new friends
acquainted let me introduce captain egerton to you mr gilpin
captain egerton an old dungar friend of ours whom i picked up very
curiously this morning
mr gilpin returned my salute and looking at me somewhat keenly
drank his tea continuing to converse in a low tone with miss
vernon who turned on him from time to time such beaming looks of
kindliness that it required all my consciousness of his great personal
disadvantages and grey hair to boot to prevent the greeneyed
monster from taking possession of me
the colonel devoted himself to mrs winter sometimes joining in miss
vernons conversation while mr winter turning to me with much
civility placed himself at my service so far as directing me to the
antiquities and scenery best worth viewing went further would be
useless for every eye sees its own beauty and its own sketch
fully assenting to this we glided into pleasant conversation on the
respective merits of ancient and modern painters till at last miss
vernon rang the bell to dismiss the tea apparatus and order lights
although it is almost sacrilege to shut out that lovely moon she
added smiling
no said winter a soliloquy or a tte  tte is best by
moonlight but for a social party large or small it is too bold and
pure a light wed find our spirits flag under its influence
then let us shut it out speedily said the colonel drawing the
curtains and opening the piano i suppose egerton we may include you
among the lovers of music
assenting to this readily i moved to where miss vernon was again
inspecting the dusky book may i see the treasure you have found
oh yes you see it is an old book of chants how curious the
squareheaded notes are i suppose they are genuine gregorian have you
tried any of them yet mr gilpin
almost all some are very rude but many of them are beautiful i long
to try their effect with several voices and with your assistance
as you say you will be so good i hope soon to have the children in
training
if you think i am capable
kate said her grandfather winter has brought his violin give us
that german duet i like so much
after a little tuning they began and kept most perfectly together
i have seldom heard a more charming performance both evidently
understood not only the music but each others feeling of it while
miss vernons round white fingers seemed to make a living feeling
creature of the inanimate instrument
well that is well done you improve i heard the organist say in
tones of great satisfaction while we were more noisily applauding
and kate looked up in his face with such complete reliance on his
judgment and delight in his approbation that i felt a strange thrill
of vexation to think how dubious it was that such would ever be called
forth by me
mr gilpin now taking miss vernons place at the piano poured forth a
beautiful sinfonia i think they call it and miss vernon accepting
the seat i vacated for her sat listening and abstracted her full eyes
gazing on some imaginary object unconscious of all around her a
slight tremor sometimes passing over her curved upper lip
rousing herself with an almost imperceptible sigh she turned her
eyes full on me interrupting abruptly the long gaze in which i had
indulged how beautiful what a story that music seems to tell at
this moment the music slow and of touching sadness had glided by a
succession of sweeping chords into a bolder and more martial strain
you have a great deal of imagination miss vernon
that is a polite way of saying you are a visionary
no no there is nothing visionary about you but i respect
imagination
then you are a rare specimen of your sex captain egerton
yes we have less imagination but then our life is much more
practical
has yours been a very practical life
mine do not ask me to look at it
she laughed low but merrily
this has been a delightful evening to me i have to thank you for a
peep into a new world miss vernon
oh you like it because it is new you would soon tire of our quiet
world and i do not see why i am to be thanked for it grandpapa
what was it brought me to a solely my wish to see and apologise
to you
captain egerton you cannot suppose i will credit such a conte
besides it is not necessary you see how welcome an old dungar friend
is why seek to render assurance doubly sure by trying to persuade me
you came here in search of a person to whose address neither you nor
any one had the slightest clue
doubt my word if you will miss vernon i can only say that not many
hours after you left the angel hotel i there discovered traces
certainly faint enough which were the cause of my visit here
at the name of the angel miss vernon started colored slightly and
then with a smile said
well i can say nothing more what a pity such energies as yours
should be lost in hm light dragoons
then you have no very high opinion of my profession
far otherwise it is necessary and what is necessary
kate my dear give us that serenade i like so much said her
grandfather
many a year is past since first those rich soft tones swelled on my
ear as miss vernon sang the following words but they come back as
vividly to my memory as if they had been heard but an hour ago
    sleep oh beloved while with angel guard
      i watch oer thy soft repose
    may the silent sense of my sleepless love
      tinge thy dreams as thine eye lids close
                  sleep oh beloved one sleep
    breathe oer her hushed and slumbering soul
      spirit of truth and peace
    whisper of heaven and love and faith
      bid doubt and dread to cease
                  sleep oh sleep
    then wake with dewy rosy lips
      and eyes of deep calm bliss
    to greet the heart that yearns for thee
      with mornings loving kiss
                  sleep oh beloved sleep
the music was peculiar and the last note of each verse sustained
and dying away with an expression of unutterable tenderness made an
indelible impression on me what a heart that girl must have was my
only clear idea as i stood silent with folded arms utterly unable to
say a word of the exquisite pleasure she had afforded me
after that said winter at the end of a chorus of applause not
another word or note good night colonel you nightingale la vostra
bocca sana qual che tocca
i joined the others in making my adieus heard something about mr
winter calling on me the next day and walked to my hotel through
the moonlit streets in a state of trance lulled by the music and
indescribable effect of the whole evening into a delicious calm which
raised me pro tem far above all sublunary interests
chapter v
sketchers and sketches
how well i remember the philosophic contempt for wealth with which i
awoke the following morning here i thought is grace refinement
and good breeding in unpretending guise the very simplicity that
surrounds them seems to give additional force to their effectnothing
appears out of place no london bred cook or butler ever turned out
a more delicious or better served repast than vernons dinner
yesterday what is the magic of all this winter is a curious specimen
of humanity yet he filled up his niche in the little party as no one
else could nor can i fancy him out of his element in any society
what an extraordinary contrast between kate and that little deformed
organist unfortunate creature and yet he appears perfectly happy
with what empressement the old colonel and his sweet granddaughter
welcome him and kate herself there is so much happiness in the
calm repose of her countenance and her brilliant smile one would
imagine her to be of fortunes favourites the most favoured yet
what a life of complete retirement she must lead she said she had
not worn an evening dress for two years till at that lucky ball is
her society made up of a brace and a half of oddities and a big dog
i wonder how my sister mary or lady georgina lorton or fifty others
of my acquaintance would stand such a life they talk of a couple
of months at the family seat as if it was a lifelong banishment on
some desolate island yes it must be a terrible life for her cut off
from all the biensances of societybut where could i have spent so
pleasant an evening where else have been so little bored by hacknied
conversation thus i wandered through the vast field of speculation
opened up to my imagination by my yesterdays adventure i could not
bring myself to compassionate vernon for his evident change of fortune
such a companionship and such a cottage must be well worth dungar with
all its beauties though to be sure he would have had kate there her
manner too so unlike that of most women i had met it never appeared
to challenge admiration or to expect les petits soins all was frank
cordial kindly real yet monstrously unflattering to ones amour
propre though at times there was a tinge of coquetry in her way of
evading or turning into ridicule any attempt at a compliment she
certainly is charming and i must make the best of my time while i am
here i suppose i must return tomorrow so
mr wintersaid the waiter
good morning captain egerton said that worthy personage apparently
through a thicker stratum of mashed potatoes than ever i thought id
catch you before you started on any explorations
you are very good i am particularly fortunate in securing such a
cicerone
i am very happy to be of any use to you sketching i fancy is not a
common taste among men of your profession
i have encountered a good many draughtsmen among my brothers in arms
and it is always a useful accomplishment for military men but i do not
think it is a common taste in my profession
no the learned professions have no room for beauty in their crowded
life and the idleness of yours is generally too strenuous forbut i
am blunt
you say but the truth mr winter yet we are not on the whole
as black as we are painted who is this old town seems rich in
antiquities
yes there is nothing in england like it and as miss vernon says
its solemn rugged towers and churches give the idea of a calm but stern
old age after a stormy impetuous youth
how agreeable colonel vernon is i was very glad to meet him again
yes he is a perfect specimen of a style fast disappearing i always
wish to see him at the head of some noble establishment because i am a
foolmuch better for him as it is
this was uttered with great impatience of manner and i listened to it
with no small amazement
better i echoed
yes sir reiterated winter sharply it takes a severer bit to break
a high mettled steed into useful paces than your half breeds require
but do you feel inclined for a stroll this morning
i replied in the affirmative and we sallied forth together
i walked on silently revolving my companions last sentence and
voting it terribly harsh yet not liking to draw him into any
discussion of it as i felt instinctively that we viewed life through
different media
he led the way through a narrow gloomy street overhung by the upper
stories of the houses and garnished with a species of gallery to
which these projections served as a roof
there said he pausing is the old residence of the bishops of
 and a very curious building it is
i looked with great interest at the heavy carved gables adorned with
royal and episcopal arms and divided into compartments containing
carved representations of adam and eve a tree and a serpent all of
equal dimensions cain and abel balaam and his ass abraham in trunk
hose about to sacrifice isaac on a small reading desk with various
other specimens of carving the wooden pillars supporting the fabric
over the gallery i have mentioned were carved and twisted into the most
grotesque and awsome shapes which only some tortured spirit could have
imagined
this alone is worth a visit said i after a long and curious gaze
what may be the age of this building
that is not easy to say the initials on that centre scutcheon j
r you see would lead us to suppose it was not older than the
beginning of the seventeenth century but it has always appeared to me
that these letters and the coat of arms they surmount are of a more
modern date than the other ornaments on the building or the building
itself but though i have searched some old chronicles i cannot satisfy
myself on the subject
at all events it shall be no 1 of my sketches have you no favourite
theory as to its date i asked
no i always endeavour to curb imagination
and you an artist said i
yes he replied in my studio imagination is a welcome guest but
even there she must submit to the bridle she may create materials for
a subject but should never be allowed to tamper with those already in
existence
i do not like your view on this point surely imagination is the
source of much exquisite and innocent pleasure
i see said winter you will side with my fair antagonist miss
vernon she talks whole volumes of the prettiest fantasies on this
subject and never has patience to hear my solemn assurance that
imagination though a grand and glorious gift requires strong
coercion but then we never agree although we are fast friends
my dear sir i exclaimed with some warmth you and i may require
to rein up ours occasionally but i do not suppose miss vernons
imagination ever presents any but the holiest images
ha ha laughed winter ha ha kate is a more than commonly good
girl but shes not an angeli would not love her half so well if
she was and take my advice do not tell her your opinion of her
or in spite of her having nearly as brilliant a fancy as your own
shell make you laugh at yourself i had too much savoir faire not
to receive this sally with a smiling acknowledgment of its wisdom
although it grated on my feelings and in my heart i experienced a
sensation approximating to a lively hatred to my intelligent cicerone
who continuedi have made several sketches of this old house but
i find that carved front does not tell well in a picture large
proportions plenty of light and shade are what we want for effect
from this point a neighbouring flight of steps conducted us to the
walls from which we gazed on many a lovely picture winter expatiating
on their peculiar beauties as a connoisseur dwells on the excellences
of some oftstudied chef doeuvre of art
as for the legends said he in which every inch of this ground is
rich you must get miss vernon to tell them to you i would make a sad
olla podrida of them were i to try but she is perfect in it and
with gilpins assistance has acquired some large additions lately
that mr gilpin seems an oddity i observed
yes poor fellow and yet if his form was as straight as his heart
you would find few as beautiful it would be impossible to tell all
the good he does and that with the miserable stipend of an organist
carambo he might put our pampered priests to the blush if such a
thing were possible
he seems to be a great favourite with the colonel and miss vernon
said i
yes returned winter there is no one ranks so high in miss vernons
estimation what between his music and misfortunes he has got the
entre of her heart completely his father was a clergyman of a
respectable north country race blessed of course with small means
and a large family i fancy poor gilpins must have been a sorry lot
among a number of rough northumberland lads his deformity shut him
out from arms church bar and every profession so he draws an
indifferent existence from the art he so much loves an invalid sister
lived here with him it seems their bettertodo brothers remembered to
forget their unaspiring relatives and the quiet neglected organist and
his sister were all in all to each other until about a year after the
vernons settled here when after a long and steady decline she died
in the same gentle unobtrusive manner she had lived and poor gilpin
has been a lonely man since
it is impossible continued winter striking his stick against
the ground and speaking more thickly which i began to perceive he
usually did when excited it is impossible to describe kate vernons
thoughtful delicate kindness to the poor forlorn creature faith sir
it makes me ready to admit she is an angel when i think of it
i mentally retracted my previous conclusions touching the speaker
humph ha said mr winter wiping his forehead i wonder what
induced me to prose away about an unfortunate humpbacked organist to a
moustached man of fashion i am a great fool
mr winter said i gravely you must think moustaches and fashion
terrible petrifiers of the heart if you imagine such a tale as you
have just sketched could excite no interest or sympathy in mine
believe me there are few so thoroughly good for nothing and i trust i
am not in the minority
cospetto exclaimed the impetuous little man i dont think you
are and captain egerton do not set me down as a gruff uncourteous
dog you see what i am when i let out am i not right to keep both bit
and bridle on my imagination now i must leave you as i have some
business to attendrather an unusual thing for me ill trot you out
tomorrow or any time you like but i think i have put you on the best
track for the present
thanks to your judicious guidance yes i have enjoyed the ramble i
assure you
well resumed he in disavowal of fashion and petrifaction will you
drink tea with mrs winter and myself at halfpast six this evening
ill make the vernons come i have lived so much on the continent that
i cannot get into the absurdity of fashionable english dinner hours
but take mine when my stomach cries cupboard which is generally at two
oclock
i shall be most happy said i
well good morning be diligent by the way look in early shew me the
result of your labours and take a peep at my studio
a thousand thanks yes
it was still early too early i thought for a visit to the priory
house so arming myself with sketch book and pencil i returned to an
old tumble down carriers inn which had struck my eye while rambling
with winter and commenced transferring it to paper while my mind
was filled with another picture that drawn by winter of the lonely
deformed organist and the angelic kindness of kate vernon
what a fate i exclaimed aloud but with the sounds of my own voice
came the recollection of the peculiarly peaceful expression of his
face there was no misery of look none of that restlessness which
the perpetual mortification of such a life might well be expected to
produce no he is happy happier perhaps than i am with youth and
health and this straight strong frame and my rightful place among
the nobles of the land and wealthhalte la have i wealth yes
compared with him but by no means sufficient to marry then i never
dreamt of marrying no i have every thing and this poor fellow
nothing and yet would he change with me by jove id take the long
odds he has not a dunning tailor thats an item in my haves and his
has nots i forgot to enumerate but its must now be time to call on
kate
    to greet the heart that yearns for thee
i cannot get that air out of my head
the sun which had all the morning been obscured by heavy clouds shone
out with the brilliancy and warmth of june rather than september as
i entered the little garden before colonel vernons cottage i paused
a moment in the vain endeavour to decipher the inscription over the
gateway a b a c and a very faint d were all i could make out
the masthers out but miss kates within sir was nurses reply to
my queries
and i hope you are quite well yourself mrs otoole said i in a
state of beatitude
indeed an i am sir glory be to god and she opened the door
saying familiarly heres the captin miss kate
miss vernon was seated at a writing table in the window copying out
of the large dusky book the organist had given her the window was
open and the light breeze gently stirred the white muslin curtains
and brought a thousand delicious odours from the garden and fields
while beyond it river and rocks and swelling upland and woods and the
distant spire of a village church lay bathed in a flood of glowing
golden light which seemed to endue every object with beauty by the
sole agency of colour
kate rose to receive me with her sparkling smile dispelling the gentle
gravity which always characterised her countenance when in repose and
made it so strangely different according as her mood changed
then you have missed grandpapa said she giving me her hand i told
him i thought you would be out from what i heard you say to mr winter
last night
a quick impulse of vanity suggestedcould she have remained at home
in expectation of my advent but a glance at her bonnet and shawl as
if just thrown off and the slight disorder in the rich masses of her
hair completed my conviction that she had but just come in
how sorry i am to have missed colonel vernon said i hypocritically
i have been all the morning rambling about with your friend mr
winter and have to thank you for introducing me to so admirable a
guide
i knew you would like him but sit down i am sure grandpapa will
return soon i see he did not intend to go farther than your hotel or
he would have taken cormac
and she pointed to the grave old hound who lay stretched in the
sunshine before the window and had partly risen on my appearance
i drew a chair opposite miss vernon who resumed her occupation
i am writing out the parts of some chants separately said she not
a very absorbing employment mr gilpin wishes his choir to get them
up and i volunteered my services
rather troublesome said i absently
oh no said she i have nothing particular to do just now and it is
so dull to be idle
i fancy a delightful as it is in our antiquarian or picturesque
point of view must be rather too tranquil a sojourn for so
accomplished a valseuse as yourself
i should have quite as little society anywhere else and not half so
many real agrmens i never find it dull
how does the colonel amuse himself
ah cried miss vernon with great earnestness i often think of
that it is such a change for him such a total breakup of all his
accustomed ways i am often at my wits end to amuse him yet he bears
it wonderfully how do you think him looking
wonderfully well never better but in this sweet place with you he
cannot be unhappy
god forbid he shoulda little sad sometimes
she was silent for a few moments and then resumed her pen i cannot
describe how charming this visit was to me miss vernons little white
hand wrote on busily all the time while sometimes glancing up at me
but generally looking at her work i felt none of the gne of a
formal tte  tte where the visitor and visited sit both upright
compelled to stare at each other but leaning back in my chair i
talked and gazed at my ease
i can hardly believe the evidence of my senses that i am in calm
conversation with the incognita who so puzzled me i resumed after a
pause
yes it is very curious but still more so that the discovery of our
mutual acquaintance with lady desmond led to no dnouement said my
companion
i knew her no further than meeting her frequently in society in
dublin where i was about four years ago with a cousin of mine who
was on the staff
she is a second cousin of grandpapas and i was a good deal with her
just before we came here not long i fancy after you had known her
and knowing how general her parties and invitations were i really
at one time imagined i might have met you at some of them i little
thought what a much older acquaintance i was dancing with
she is a handsome woman i observed and i fancy not unlike
colonel vernon
how brilliant and how kind she is she exclaimed i often wonder the
hurried life she leads gives her space to breathe i doubt if she has
time to be happy
happy miss vernon do you think happiness is to be found in the
stagnation that some dignify with the name of tranquillity my
least distinct idea of happiness is the hopeful exertion of every
facultymental and physicalin search of what we never find but
inaction is misery
there is some truth in what you say replied she but all my
ideas of happiness here and hereafter are concentrated in the word
peaceand she paused and gazed out into the sunshine with such
an expression of calmof harmony if i may so term itthat i felt
tempted to ask her what spell had stilled her heart into such deep
repose
did you make any sketches this morning she asked rousing herself
from her thoughts
one or two rough outlines but i think i could make a very good
picture from this spot said i rising to look through the window
then said miss vernon eagerly pray pray do captain egerton and
give it to me it will be an inexpressible pleasure to me to have some
memento of this quiet happy spot when i am perhaps far away
i will set about it tomorrow but have you any notion of leaving
a i asked
oh noi only spoke from a presentiment i often feel that we will
not always rest calmly in this quiet nook the waters of life will
rise some day and sweep us out again into the noise and tumult of the
world
here the old dog disturbed by my movement slowly raised himself and
entering by the window laid his large stern head with a sort of sigh
on his mistresss arm
ah cormac good old friend said she putting her arm caressingly
round him no tumult however rough shall separate us you and i
and grandpapa and nurse a goodly company nest ce pas
captain egerton said she rallying and laughing dont quiz my
presentiments but sketch me this scene
with the greatest pleasure and now i remember i have some old
drawings of dungar somewhere ill look out for them and bring them
over here the next time i come
oh thanks a thousand hearty thanks they will be treasures to me
indeed and to grandpapa when will you come again
i can hardly hope for a repetition of my delightful visit for ten days
or a fortnight but on the first possibility of leave i will return
do you know i took a long walk with nurse this morning we had some
business in that wood i showed you from the dining room and i saw so
many beautiful pictures en route i must show you the walk i do not
think mr winter knows it very well we cross a delightful ferry to
get to it and
the door opened and the colonel entered
ah egerton i have just been to your hotel they told me you had
gone out only a few minutes before and i thought it likely you would
make your way over here i met winter kate and he dragged me off
to pass sentence on a pony he wants to buy which he described as a
quiet gentle animal mrs winter might herself drive but i saw at a
glance that the creature was blind of one eye at least and i strongly
suspect he is broken winded however i rather fancy winter has set
his heart on the purchase for the pony has a shaggy picturesque
appearance and would look charmingly in a sketch with a few autumnal
trees oh i feel a little faggedand have you done much in the way
of sketching this morning egerton
no indeed colonel i do not feel sufficiently at home here yet i
have not got my eye familiarised to the style of the place i intend
to make great progress tomorrow i cannot tell you how charmed i am
with this old town it is so utterly dissimilar to carrington and its
abominations
ah said the colonel the tone of society is not very thoroughbred
there i suppose but are you quite just in judging the worthy
citizens by a standard they were never intended either by nature or
art to reach
that is a question i have never asked myself and probably never
shall
good breeding continued colonel vernon must be innate often
theres winter you see he has evidently risen from the ranks yet one
feels at ease in his society and free from all chance of his rubbing
you up the wrong way as parvenus are apt to do
winter belongs to a class distinct from and superior to class
distinctions
we are allies from this moment captain egerton said miss vernon
by the way kate mrs winter wants you to drink tea with her this
evening i have promised for you and myself observed her grandfather
of course i like to drink tea at the abbey gardens everything is so
pleasant and friendly are you to be of our party captain egerton
i am happy to say yes
then you had better join our early dinner for winter piques himself
on keeping continental hours and i believe his tea is considerably
earlier than a london dejeunr said the colonel
many thanks my dear sir but i have already eaten a substantial
luncheon and intend acquitting myself with credit at mrs winters tea
table
oh said miss vernon laughing some prophetic vision must have
warned you that she is famous for hot cakes
new style of life this eh egerton
i enjoy it extremely and you colonel i cannot fancy any thing more
opposite to your life in ireland
true true he replied yet i am very happy then at my age
a placid routine unexciting and calm is naturally congenial i
sometimes wish for a little more fellowfeeling on particular points
than winter or even gilpin can offer me kate is generally a great
sympathiser but i confess my dear egerton that a little chat with
you on old times and topics does me infinite good
captain egerton says he will come back soon again grandpapa and
bring me some sketches he has of dear dungar
a treasure trove kate but must you leave us so immediately
i regret to say my leave expires tomorrow evening i must return to
carrington but will take the last train halfpast eight i think and
now i will say goodbye until this evening colonel i want to get a
few more outlines into my portfolio before mrs winters hot cakes are
ready au revoir miss vernon
the colonel and cormac accompanied me to the door which nurse opened
with a gracious smile not a step further colonel vernon you are
fatigued mrs otoole i commend the colonel to your care adieu
and as i walked away i heard confused and glowing eulogiums pronounced
by mrs otoole on some person or persons unknown in which she seemed
to dwell particularly on the facility of distinguishing between the
rale ould ancient stock and yer musherooms terms of approbation my
vanity somehow or other appropriated though the connection was by no
means clear
with military punctuality i was raising the well burnished brass
knocker which adorned winters door as the cathedral clock chimed six
a trim little damsel answered the summons and informed me with a
rather frightened air that missis was in she ushered me up stairs
to a large handsomely furnished room where sat mrs winter in the
identical cap she had worn at the ball i could have sworn to it in any
court in the kingdom
she received me with the slight nervousness of manner i had before
observed but we had hardly exchanged salutations when winter appeared
and carried me off to his studio while there was any light he
said it was well worth a visit studies of trees in every season
architectural drawings of great beauty rugged old men and women rosy
chubby children some few strong deep subjectsa mine of pictorial
wealth and the grand characteristic of each and all was truth nothing
seemed beneath his pencil nor a single object misplaced on his canvas
i felt that a glance at his studio revealed the man more than the most
elaborate description of his character could have done i began to
understand his views of imagination
mr winter had just pronounced it becoming too dark to judge fairly his
productions when the little maid entered and informed him that tea and
the company were waiting we returned to the drawing room where we
found the colonel and miss vernon gilpin and a tall dried up looking
woman in a yellow turban assembled round a large table which groaned
or ought to have groaned under piles of delicately brown hot cakes
multitudes of little round pats of butter each adorned with a cowslip
in bas relief and a massive tea equipage there was a cheerful buzz of
conversation with a pleasant accompaniment of hissing from a portly
tea urn that sent forth volumes of steam
the gentlemen rose to greet us and winter passing to the turbanned
lady expressed his pleasure at seeing her adding
i do not think you know miss cox captain egerton the honourable
captain egerton miss araminta cox
somewhat to my surprise the lady gave herself the trouble of rising to
make me a profound curtsey i secured a seat between mrs winter and
kate and joined in the general conversation which took a very merry
turn on our appearance in consequence of winter having discovered
that kate and gilpin had been wofully taken in about some old stone
inscribed with saxon or runic characters they had raved of for a
week and which turned out to be frightfully modern kate however
retaliated by quizzing him on his intended purchase of a pony more
fit for a picture than a phaeton and clapped her hands in triumph
when winter disclosed the fact that contrary to the colonels warning
he had absolutely completed the purchase much laughter and ingenuity
were called forth by these rival charges but we all found the gravity
and earnestness with which winter repelled kates attacks upon his new
steed irresistible
at all events mr winter it is not half so disgraceful to be cheated
by an almost obliterated inscription on a stone as to be taken in
by a horsedealer we deceived ourselves but you have not even that
consolation you fell a victim to the devices of a groom concluded
kate pushing her chair from the teatable and rising
per di bacco exclaimed winter thickly and with the greatest
energy the colonel is mistaken i tested the eyes i tied a
handkerchief over the best looking of the two and led him up and down
and he walked sir without the slightest hesitation tell me he is
minus an eye after that
we received this conclusive evidence with a roar of laughter that
disturbed the murmured conference mrs winter and miss cox had
maintained during our argument fragments of which had reached my
ears occasionally indicating strong disapprobation of some unhappy
individuals
do you play whist captain egerton enquired our hostess as the trim
damsel was removing the goodly array which had suffered considerably
under our united efforts
hardly ever mrs winter and when i do i get so rowed by my partners
that i am glad to abandon the attempt altogether
we generally make up a whist table the colonel and mr winter like a
rubber
do you play miss vernon
yes with a degree of science seldom equalled therefore i rarely
honour mrs winters whist table
well have that trio first miss vernon rejoined mr winter gilpin
get the flute ready
during the little bustle of bringing flute and violin into tune with
the piano i approached the performers
how did you like the hot cakes asked kate
i think i gave ocular demonstration of my opinion i replied
laughing
what are you going to play
prendi lanell ti dono
i thought that was a duet
so it is the flute and violin take first and second the piano is a
mere accompaniment you will be pleased with it
how droll winter is his experiment on the pony was truly original
yes and his habit of pointing his discourse with foreign
exclamations he acquired the habit abroad and complains he cannot do
without expletives to express his feelings but that english oaths are
too blasphemous while all the people in a are firmly convinced
that his strange outbursts are far too bad to be translated
now then miss vernon said mr winter if you have finished that
conference with captain egerton
maestro mio i am ready
winter gave a flourish of his bow and stamped his foot miss vernon
played a brilliant prelude and they began
i sat in a pleasant dreamy state listening to the music and
indistinctly observing there was something wanting in mr winters
handsome drawing room that kate vernons had as if neatness was there
kept in her proper position of handmaid to the graces but here she
appeared to have risen up against her mistresses and driven them out
of doors with a duster i was disturbed from this placid state of mind
by the nodding of miss araminta coxs yellow turban most distractingly
out of tune and finding it insupportable i was about to change my
position when the performance came to a conclusion
the whist party now arranged themselves leaving the piano to kate
gilpin and myself and after a little desultory conversation miss
vernon acceded to our request for a song
the serenade i petitioned
you will be tired of that i will give you a newer song and she sung
us a little sparkling neapolitan air full of expression and piquancy
winter had brought it from italy she said and then we talked of his
studio and his whims and then we glanced at national characteristics
and a hundred pleasant general topics i felt surprised at the current
of deep thought that flowed through all the organist said there
was much originality too in his observations altogether our talk
insensibly assumed a grave tone yet it was interesting for we were
not making conversation the conviction that my companions viewed life
differently from myself somewhat inclined me to silence they seemed
to possess in themselves some source of internal satisfaction of
constant interest unaccountable to me and utterly dissimilar to the
alternations of feverish excitement and profound ennui in which my days
and those of almost all my companions were passed
meanwhile the whist party progressed with an occasional outburst from
and overhauling of the tricks by winter and divers complimentary
remarks from the colonel to the ladies finally a tray of sandwiches
and wine and water ended the entertainment
what is the name of the white pony mr winter said kate
whatever you like
spatter the dew suggested the colonel
that is quite poetical grandpapa
my father had a horse called toby said miss araminta cox in a
mincing voice
cyclops they say had only one eye i observed
i tell you he has the use of two said winter hastily
that is not quite clear and cyclops is a fine sounding name said
kate i vote for cyclops and i shall drink his health in a glass of
your gooseberry wine mr winter
cyclops be it then sighed winter resignedly captain egerton
you must drink miss vernons toast but not in her beverage heres
some port wine ill answer for i bought it myself in oporto we all
drank success to cyclops and bidding our kind host and hostess good
night strolled home by moonlight ah a delicious walk gilpin took
the colonels arm and kate accepted mine the glorious moon not yet
risen to her highest altitude threw out the lacelike tracery of the
cathedral towers into strong reliefsilvering the walls here and
there leaving large masses of deep shadow while the old gateways and
arches looked like openings into an abyss of darkness a few light
clouds floated in the deep blue sky we walked on for some moments in
silence
the last time your hand rested on my arm miss vernon i little
thought i should so soon discover what you would not reveal
how
do you not remember how perversely you kept silence when i wanted to
find out your abode
oh yes with a laugh i was so afraid you would have found out
my trick that i took care to obey poor mrs winters commands how
strangely it all turned out
not much more passed between us until we passed the old church yard
where the organist left us
scarcely late enough for ghosts said the colonel with a smile but
kate would rather like to meet one
not i said miss vernon anything troubled as ghosts always are
would be terribly out of place this calm heavenly night though to be
sure we have a black monk who walks up and down our garden from sunset
till cock crow
there is something strangely attractive in the romantic antiquity
of your domicile i fancy it must exercise some influence on ones
spirits said i smiling
indeed captain egerton i often tell grandpapa that i am sure we are
influenced by locality as well as everything else
we paused at the wicket gate
i was endeavouring to make out that inscription this morning colonel
said i
you can almost read it now the moon shines so full upon it observed
kate if you knew the text you would have made it out at once see at
this side there is the beati mundo corde quite plain and round here
can you not trace deum videbunt
ah yes of course now you point it out
this is the proper light to read it by said miss vernon
thoughtfully and do you know i sometimes like to think the
entrance to our house is as it were sanctified by that beautiful
sentenceblessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god
ah enthusiast said her grandfather laughing and shaking his head
dragoons do not quite comprehend such fancies
i could see the soft colour mount into her cheek as if she had betrayed
herself
do you believe him miss vernon i asked eagerly
i do not know good night
good night egerton you dine with us tomorrow you can take the train
to carrington afterwards you know
thank you colonel with pleasure good night
the wicket closed on them and i remained for some minutes in the
full clear calm light gazing at the halfdefaced letters and
recalling the tones of miss vernons expressive and musical voice as
she pronounced the as i thought appropriate words which formed the
inscription and then i strolled on slowly to my hotel thinking more
seriously than is usual to me and finally fell asleep and dreamt i was
riding across the sea to dungar on winters white pony which did not
strike me as anything uncommon
chapter vi
reaction
another day of calm and deep enjoyment
i took my way to the priory house at a very early hour in order to
make the sketch i had promised miss vernon she was reading to her
grandfather when i arrived and welcomed me joyously entering with
eager interest into my preparations for drawing and the various
questions which arose as to the objects to be taken in c in a
way too which showed some knowledge of the art and hour after
hour slipped by as i sat before the window sometimes laying down my
pencil to talk with the colonel sometimes caressing his fine old
dog who appeared to have established a species of guard over me
while kate constantly watchful of my progress flitted backwards and
forwards between me and the open window often pointing with her rosy
forefinger to some shading she wished deepened or some light brought
into stronger relief branching off from discussions on the effects
of distance c into all sorts of irrelevant subjects then blaming
herself for interrupting me and exhorting me to renewed diligence
and all this so naturally so earnestly showing openly her pleasure
at having me to talk to but without one shadow of that indescribable
consciousness by which so many women seem to say to themselves now i
know he is going to make love to me no strongly as i felt tempted
to do so there was a frankness and repose in miss vernons manner i
would not for worlds have disturbed by even a whisper of the profound
admiration she inspired
something of the high principled and unselfish tone pervading the
society into which i had fallen appeared to influence me with more of
thought for future consequences than was my usual habit besides there
is nothing so blighting to sentimentalism as the friendly cordiality i
have described nevertheless though i do not believe i was ever before
so long in the society of a beautiful girl without getting up some
degree of flirtation the morning flew rapidly and delightfully away
the colonel had letters to write and his granddaughters visits to
my impromptu studio if fewer were more confidential she told me
of the long visits she had paid to lady desmond both in london and
dublin and of the delightful singing lessons she had taken in the
former place adding that she owed her first and last peep at the great
and gay world to her cousin it appeared that lady desmond had been
displeased with her for returning to dungar and had not written to
her for a long time but you know said kate grandpapa was about
to leave dungar then and i could not let him do so alone nor go away
without a last look at my old happy home all this was told in a low
tone as if she did not wish the colonel to overhear it and in a
confidential manner inexpressibly delightful to me she had knelt down
to caress cormac and after remaining for some seconds rolling up his
long ear thoughtfully looked up suddenly in my face and added i did
not intend to bore you with such a long prose about my difficulties
with georgina the reason i mentioned the subject at all was because
i heard you tell grandpapa you had a sister at naples lady desmond
was there i heard about a month ago and i wish you would ask your
sister when you write if she knows anything of her i cannot bear to
lose sight of her so completely i promised very readily to do as she
desired though i warned her it might be months before i would get any
reply as my sister was but a careless correspondent
thanks and i will not interrupt you any more
you do not interrupt me in the least i assure you but if you are
determined to go perhaps you will sing i see colonel vernon shutting
his writing desk
with pleasure would you like an irish melody
beyond every thing
and the next minute her rich voice was pouring forth in a full tide of
sweetness has sorrow thy young days shaded
i soon dropped my pencil and even after the last notes had died away
remained listening for their renewal then collecting my drawing
materials i rose and promising miss vernon to finish the sketch from
memory i invited the colonel to accompany me on a visit of ceremony
to mrs winter it was succeeded by another peep at the studio a walk
with the colonel and then came the pleasant friendly dinner the
frank cheerful interchange of thought the afterdinner cup of coffee
and stroll in the pleasure ground to look at the moon reflected in
the river while miss vernon courteously anxious to give me what she
prized herself gathered a bouquet of her choicest autumnal flowers
to make me forget that horrid carrington at least in my own room
she said her grandfather laughing at the idea of her expecting i
should care for such things
how delightfully homelike it all was
finally she sang me the serenade that had so enchanted me and before
the last notes were well hushed nurse announced the cab i had ordered
to convey me to the railway
i rose reluctantly the colonel nurse and cormac and even kate
coming out in the fresh night air all perfumed with the clematis and
heliotropes that adorned the front of the cottage to see me off
good bye captain egerton said kate be sure to come back soon
and do not forget the drawings have you got your flowers
it would be a bold man that would attempt to take them from me miss
vernon good night
a thousand thanks colonel for my very pleasant visit to a
god bless you take care of yourself he replied
a then the saints go wid ye said nurse
good bye mrs otoole ill never taste an eatable trout until i
return
good night once more and i threw myself into the cab with a feeling
of extraordinary regret and affection for the old colonel for mrs
otoole aye even for cormac but for katecaramba as winter would
say
a short hour of hissing and clattering and i was back again amongst
the bustling crowded glaring gas exhaling streets of carrington
amidst the confusion of noisy omnibuses and uncouth cries of drunken
mechanics and wretched beggar women with their imps of children
it was after ten oclock before i entered the mess room to report my
return having first placed my precious flowers in safety i found
the apartment redolent of the savoury odours of dinner and cigars
and occupied by a larger party than usual all of whom were in loud
and eager debate on the respective merits of the favourites for the
approaching doncaster meeting as soon as they perceived me through the
cloudy atmosphere i was greeted with a perfect hurricane of queries
exclamations and offers of fifty and a hundred to one against divers
and sundry horses colts and fillies
where in the name of mystery have you been skulking
hullo egerton youre the very man i wanted give me the long odds
against ms mare youre sure to win and it will just square my
book
i say fred ive backed tearaway would you have me hedge off
what has become of you you have missed such a spread at the mayors
and such speeches as would have driven murray to suicide
a hundred to five you dont name the winner
ha egerton just come back
keep cool my dear fellows and give me some claret
i sat down endeavouring in vain to enter clearly into the several
subjects they were so eagerly discussing and perfectly bewildered
by the strong contrast the whole scene presented to my life for the
last few days then followed long weary debates on the coming event
interspersed with anecdotes of the villainy of certain trainers and
the intense knowingness of the jockies finally i began to take
some interest in the details the result partly of habit and partly
of an effort to do so lest any appearance of preoccupation might
set my brother officers on the scent to discover its course i was
successfulfor sedley exclaimed i never saw egerton return from one
of his philosophic expeditions with his wits so much about him
by the way youve been over to that tumble down old place a is
it worth seeing said another
yes to a lover of the picturesque and antique but it has nothing
else to attract
ah that will do i do not care for the picturesque
were you successful in your search asked burton imprudently
for what called out half a dozen
for the picturesque of course he replied i breathed again
yes particularly successful he smiled and shrinking from the
thought of my companions getting the slightest clue to his real
meaning especially in their present mood i rose and bid them all
goodnight having endured their babel for more than two hours
and you will not sport even a pony on the leger
no not a sixpence i was bitten too severely at ascot last spring
never say die youre not going to knock under to your luck that way
i am though and i wish i could persuade you to do the same
vavasour said i laughing and laying my hand on the shoulder of an
aristocratic looking stripling who had joined about six months before
and who coloured to the eyes at the idea of advice on prudence
egerton is about to abjure the pomps and vanities of this wicked
world said one
he has been en retrait with grabemall the field preacher said
another
i laughed perhaps it was as pleasant as yours with levi solomons and
co last march said i
he reddened but laughing good humouredly shook his hand at me
go your own way old fellow
it has always been my habit and i intend to continue it said i
coolly and made my exit
refusing burtons offer of a visit to my room on the plea of fatigue
i threw myself in an arm chair i called my study as i generally sat
in it when disposed for thought and tried to arrange my entangled
ideas into something like order the attempt however was not very
successful
sundry rough calculations as to my chances of clearing off certain
debts and my probable amount of income a perfect conviction that kate
vernon was the loveliest girl and her grandfather the most perfect
old gentleman i had ever met a vivid recollection of my past visit
and an indistinct intention of doing or saying something remarkably
distinguished on my next a vague haunting wish for some truer and
more real interest than my life had ever hitherto known such were a
few of the elements in my reverie and round them all floated a dim
consciousness of mrs winters cap and miss araminta coxs yellow
turban i felt the strength of old habits returning in the levity which
mingled even with my better aspirations and fell asleep feeling i
had got a glimpse of happiness such as nature had endowed me with
capabilities of enjoying but between which and myself circumstances
had fixed a great gulf
of course i told burton all my proceedings and to do him justice he
really seemed to take an interest in them but he laughed a little at
the arcadian style of early tea and hot cakes burton though still a
sub was my senior in age by at least a couple of years he had not
been in the regiment long and knew nothing of the vernons indeed
the only officers still among us who had experienced the hospitality
of dungar were dashwood now our colonel hauton and myself i felt
i ought to mention having met our old and popular acquaintance yet
i did not quite like doing so our colonel was a fine highminded
gentlemanlike fellow who never forgot a kindness or remembered a
spite i would rather have wished him to know vernon was within reach
but hauton i always disliked him he was a coldhearted rou and i
would almost rather have been accessory to the introduction of satan
to our first mother than let hauton get the entre of kate vernons
refined and tranquil home at the thought a vision of it and the
inscription over its entrance rose up before me however as it would
have a strange effect if colonel dashwood was by any chance to meet
vernon and find i had concealed my rencontre with him i determined to
mention it but in a casual way hinting at the same time his change
of fortune which i knew would prevent hauton from taking any vivid
interest in his former hospitable entertainer
it was not easy to get a quiet half hour in the barracks especially
at the present exciting periodthe approaching doncaster meeting
so in order to enjoy an uninterrupted conference burton and i
mounted our horses and took the least frightful of the roads round
carrington i endeavoured to convey to my companion some idea of the
impression stamped on my mind by the few days i had spent at a
its peace and simplicity its freedom from monotony and ennui but
it would not do burton was as i think i have said a kindhearted
high minded fellow but singularly free from imagination i fancy he
had met a few harder rubs in his contact with the world than i had
not that he ever talked of his own circumstances but it was evident
he was not rich
all this is very fine said he at the end of my elaborate
description and you might like the novelty of the thing for a week
or so but take my word for it at the end of a fortnight you would be
drawing comparisons between your philosophic society of painters and
musicians and that of your discarded regiment anything but favourable
to the former
no i do not believe it i have for a long time felt a weariness and
distaste for the life i am leading without a notion or a hope of
anything better i do not know why except that at thirty one begins to
tire of the eternal sameness of the mess table country quarters slow
promotion and no very particular occupation up to five and twenty
military life may have its charms but then it begins to lose its soi
disant attractions i suppose it was the dearth of variety and the
vain hope of getting up something like excitement that induced me to
make a fool of myself by plunging into various extravagances of late
they will cost me dear enough i wish they had put me to a desk instead
of buying me a commission its too bad to think that at my age i am no
further on in the world than i was at eighteen and unfit for anything
except leading a charge or riding a steeple chase and the brute that
gave us a great dinner the other day and bored sedley about his ock
what was his name mogg ay mogg how old do you think the savage
fiftyfive perhaps
not more than twentyfive years my senior and began life as an
errand boy i should like to know what and where i shall be at
fiftyfive a wretched old halfpay speculating how long i can make
a tenandsixpenny hat last with a bedroom in leicester square and
my address at the senior united service club and mine was a boyhood of
bon bons bowing tutors and shetland ponies
why egerton you are quite eloquent i think your excursion to a
has only served to open your eyes to the miseries you were before
unconscious of id prefer happy ignorance i conclude the english
of all this is that miss vernons angelic voice and beautiful eyes
incline you to matrimony while common sense warns you off eh
pshaw nonsense i am not going to declare miss vernon is essential to
my existence i dare say i shall have to scramble through life without
such companionship but i do not hesitate to say i would be a happier
man if i thought i had a chance of it ay and a better one i added
after a pause i might have some pretension to think of matrimony but
for my own confounded folly in incumbering my younger sons portion
as i have done and i stuck the spurs into my unfortunate horses
sides who resented the injustice by a series of wild plunges and
gave me some trouble to reduce him to order
after walking our horses on for a few paces in silence burton said
gravely i see this is more serious than i at first thought but
whatever your feelings may be for gods sake do not rush into any
imprudent marriage it is the most fatal mistake any man ever made
theres not one in a thousand who has the stuff in him to stand its
accompaniments unflinchingly a hundred to one but the consciousness
of having dragged himself and the woman he loved into such a scrape
sours his temper and makes him a brute to his wife and a tyrant to
his children i have seen such examples that i do believe the best
proof of affection a poor man can give is to fly at the first fire
from cupids battery and my advice to you is to avoid a and its
attractions do not go on looking and insinuating a thousand things
you can never accomplish but which in spite of all we say of their
inconstancy live in a girls memory for many a day after we have
forgotten all about it
by jove i must be a more conceited fellow than any in england if
i could for a moment imagine that miss vernon would waste a thought
on me when i was out of her sight i wish you could just hear her
easy unembarrassed way of begging me to be sure to return it was the
coolest address i ever received from a young lady her heart and mind
seem too well filled to be easily accessible yetbut i dare not try
you speak truly burton about imprudent marriages still i think it
would be worth a struggle to get my affairs into training i would not
ask any woman to marry into poverty but one might be satisfied with
competence and
just the way all men argue when they want to do a foolish act what
would be competence to a man of your habits
nevertheless ill think about it and look up egerton he ought
to have bowels of compassion for his brother as well as for every
benighted blackamoor under the sun and his expenses are i believe
limited to subscribing to all kinds of evangelical missions
do you mean then seriously to contemplate 
burton pray do not look so dismal i tell you its a long look out i
do not know what i shall do
youll go over to a in spite of my warning
oh i must i promised miss vernon believe me i am the only one
likely to suffer from my imprudence and then i will return no more
till i have seen egerton orin short let us just cross the country
here the corn seems all cut and it will break in the horses for the
hunting
in accordance with my determination i seized the first interval in a
rather professional conversation between colonel dashwood and a retired
general he had invited to dinner to tell him of my accidental meeting
with his old acquaintance sinking the fact however of his having a
granddaughter
what old darcy vernon of dungar he exclaimed how curious and
so he is living there is he i am sorry to hear it he must have left
dungar then in toto
or dungar left him sneered hauton it was en route if i am not
much mistaken when we were there
the first day i can ill go over to a and bring back the
old colonel with me said our good natured commander i owe him
a vast amount of hospitality and shall be too glad to show him i
have not forgotten it poor fellow at his age he must be more than
seventyfive
he looks remarkably well i said just the same as ever
the irish have such happy temperaments said dashwood turning to the
general
yes they are like the niggers in many respects said hauton the
more you beat them the better they be
i restrained my inclination to shy a decanter at his head with great
difficulty
the ten succeeding days went over wonderfully well i found the
promised drawings of dungar for kate and worked up the sketch i had
taken of the priory to the very best of my abilities i took long
rides with burton and often without him not finding him so congenial
as i wished i wrote a long letter to my sister and made all proper
enquiries for lady desmond without however explaining the cause of
my curiosity it was so long since i had seen mary i did not know how
her heart had stood the wear and tear of four years dissipation how
fond we were of each other as children
finally i wrote to colonel vernon telling him about dashwood and all
the gossip i could think would amuse him sending a message to kate as
to the drawings and promising to be over with them in the course of
the following week
altogether i was much too busy to look into my own affairs but
promised myself to overhaul them completely on my return from a i
secured a weeks leave and determined to throw care to the dogs and
enjoy myself thoroughly i started before almost any one except burton
whose habits were quiet and regular was visible he joined me as
i stood on the steps while my servant was placing my carpet bag and
portfolio in the cab which was to convey me to the railway
so youre going are you
    whatever skies above
    heres a heart for any fate
said i laughing and too much elated at the weeks freedom and
enjoyment before me to be damped by his lugubrious tone we shook
hands and i left him whistling with a reflective air
i little thought where we would meet again
chapter vii
man proposes god disposes
though i loitered about at the hotel as much as possible i found i had
made the usual mistake of impatient people wasted as much time by too
rapid as by too slow a movement and it still wanted some minutes to
twelve oclock when i took the now familiar path to the priory smiling
to myself at the natural homelike feeling with which i looked forward
to seeing them all again it is extraordinary what rapid strides to
intimacy sympathy enables one to make all was profoundly still in the
churchyard as i opened the wicket and bent my head to enter the low
arch all looked as neat and well kept as ever
nurse answered my ring in bonnet and cloak and welcomed me with a
joyous ah captin jewl is it yerself thats in it
her loud exclamations brought miss vernon to the drawingroom door she
paused for a moment and then advancing seconded nurses greeting
very warmly
we did not expect you quite so soon and grandpapa has gone with mr
winter to look at a farm of his a little way out of the town i hope
cyclops will not upset them she added laughing i am so glad you
are come
and i have been counting the hours till i escaped from carrington to
the ecclesiastical repose of your retreat said i following her into
the the drawing room as usual redolent of flowers
you are the most tranquilly disposed dragoon i ever met she
returned but i see you have got your portfolio
yes i have brought you the sketches you wished for
oh thank you captain egerton it is so good of you you do not know
what pleasure you give me let me look at them
here is a view of the house from the east
oh yes yes how like that was my school room window and the flower
garden down here nurse must see this come here nurse
mrs otoole came at the call
did you ever see any place like that asked her young mistress
musha then it makes me heart sore to look at it there an the rale
place so far away said nurse crossing herself och god be with
ould times the blessin of heaven rest on ye dungar manys the
bright day i seen in ye och miss kate avourneen look at the little
garden gate where we used to go listen to paddy doolans fairy tales
an the crather so dirty i darnt let him up into the house an the
captin dhrew it himself
here mrs otoole ceased her comments perceiving from her young ladys
silence and glistening eyes that her memory was even more vividly
awakened
there is the old church yard where the people were so fond of burying
their relatives with a peep at the round tower said i substituting
a less home scene to assist her in recovering herself do you
recognise this view the cliffs near the shore and the broad atlantic
with the cruakmore hills in the distance
oh yes yes and this one look nurse the dingle and andy the
fisherman
the lord save us isnt the very moral of andy the ould thief to
have a right honourable drawing him
very rude sketches miss vernon i was then even a greater tyro than
now
they are worth whole galleries of raphaels and titians to me said
she with a sigh
my sketch of the view from the window was much admired miss vernon
pronounced it excellent quite worthy of mr winters approval after
a few more remarks i observed that i would not detain her as i
perceived she was in walking costume
we were going across the river she replied on an errand i should
like to accomplish what are you going to do grandpapa and mr winter
both away you had better come with us
to this frank invitation i replied most willingly wherever you
choose to lead me
a message being left with mrs otooles sub for colonel vernon
informing him of my arrival in case his return should precede ours
and nurse having crammed some additional articles into a basket already
overflowing miss vernon stepped through the open window calling
cormac who soon made his appearance noticing me in a grave and
dignified manner mrs otoole and i followed our fair conductress
down the sloping pleasure ground now gay with many coloured dahlias
at the bottom of which a small door led into a road by the river side
nurse produced a ponderous key and carefully locked it after us we
turned to the left and i walked between mrs otoole and her nursling
who looked charmingly in her cotton morning dress and her cottage straw
bonnet with its white ribbon her luxuriant brown hair doing away with
all necessity for the curious floral exhibitions ladies usually display
under theirs
nothing new or strange has occurred here since you went said miss
vernon in a quiet confidential tone grandpapa has been very well
and quite looked forward to seeing you again mr winter has been very
busy driving cyclops hither and thither and twice got into a ditch
and miss araminta cox and mrs winter agree in saying you are not at
all the sort of person they expected a cavalry officer to be
errah what do the likes of thim know about cavalry officers
exclaimed nurse en parenthse
what did they expect said i laughing something very terrific in
the raw head and bloody bones style i suppose
i told them i had always found dragoons very harmless inoffensive
people replied miss vernon an arch glance displacing the pensive
depth of expression her eyes had assumed when gazing at the sketches of
her old home
indeed said i with some pique well meaning creatures useful
about a house
miss vernon laughed i see you would prefer being dreaded by miss
araminta cox so ill not take your part any more
we had by this time reached a sort of rude pier shaded by a few old
thorn trees limes and horse chesnuts an irregular rugged red stone
wall which sometimes retiring sometimes advancing followed the
course of the road formed a very suitable back ground and just here
an arch of heavy stone work sheltered a clear and deep well beside
the little landing place lay a large flatbottomed boat and at its
bow sat a huge rough grizzled boatman in a hairy cap and horn
spectacles looking coeval with the priory tower which was visible
above the trees intently reading a well thumbed book
elijah called out mrs otoole i started at the scriptural
appellation elijah the onfortunate ould sinner is making his sowl
hes as deaf as a stone elijah bush i say
ho cormac said miss vernon
the old man looked up as the hound stepped on the gunnel and shook the
boat and raising his cap came forward apologising respectfully for
his preoccupation
it baint so often i get a sight of the ward said he in a broad
cumberland accent but im main glad to see you
miss vernon replied courteously
elijah honey is there eer a throut to be got to day said nurse
not as i knows on marm i did see davy jones passing on here sure
enough with the rods but he hadnt took nothink then
athen just look out for him like a good christian and tell him if
hes caught even the ghost of one to have it up at the house mind
now
ay sure said elijah
ah whatll i do at all at all said mrs otoole to miss vernon in
accents of great concern if i cant get a throut for the captin
i dare say he will kindly endeavour to dine without one she replied
then i am to have the pleasure of dining with you said i
of course said kate opening her eyes where else would you dine
i handed her into the boat and after carefully assisting mrs otoole
who accepted my petits soins with a musha but im well attinded
took my seat beside her
a few vigorous strokes from elijahs oars brought us across and we
were standing at the foot of the broken rocky bank visible from the
windows of the cottage
is there much custom at your ferry now asked miss vernon as we paid
him
not much to speak of but i gets my crust and at all events the lord
will provide he said raising his cap
holy vargin listen to that now said mrs otoole with much fervour
youre a mighty religious man entirely elijah faith father
macdermott couldnt hould a candle to you tho he laid the divil at
innishogue
good bye said her young lady we will be back in about an hour
elijah
climbing the steep bank we stood for a few moments at the top to look
at the cottage peeping prettily out from between the ivygrown old
church and the spreading oak i have before described then following
the path across the meadow where they were cutting the after grass we
fell into marching order mrs otoole at one side of kate and i at
the other cormac walking soberly between us
it was a regular autumnal dayclear calm and grey with a slight
crispness in the air an avant courier of frost the wood through
which the path soon led us brilliant with all the variegated tints
peculiar to the season and fragrant with the odour of the gums exuding
from the fir trees and young larches seemed of tolerable extent and
now and then a pheasant would rise suddenly with a whirr through
the air almost from our feet a few withered leaves already strewed
the ground and nature appeared in her fullest beauty though it was
evident she was on the turning point occasionally we caught a glimpse
of the river and frequently heard it fretting against the rocks which
here and there opposed its progress
miss vernon often paused to draw my attention to any picture as she
termed it that struck her fancy sometimes it was a long glade almost
overarched with leafy boughs still retaining in their sheltered
position the freshness of early summer with a line of blue country
beyond sometimes it was a single tree of peculiar beauty now a few
old mossgrown trunks forgotten by the woodcutter now a peep at a
cottage chimney with blue curling smoke at the other side of the
river every thing from the rich green grass and the endless variety
of wild creepers to the dry exhilarating atmosphere seemed to be a
source of joyous grateful pleasure to her happy nature gifted as it
appeared to be with so deep a power of enjoyment i found something
contagious in her airy gaiety and the extraordinarily keen sense of
natures beauty with which she was endowed and asked her why it was
she did not pursue drawing more steadily
i do not know she replied it does not seem to come so naturally to
me as music though no one revels in scenery more delightedly than i
do are you not obliged to me for this walk
indeed i am i shall not soon forget it
what strange mixtures we are said miss vernon i felt so sad after
looking at those drawings of dungar and now it seems to me as if the
mere sense of existence is happiness enough ah there is a great
deal that is delightful in this life of ours let poets and popular
preachers say of it what they will
its only hearts like yours avourneen that draw the sunshine round
them said mrs otoole
true miss vernon i observed but what long intervals of much that
is unpleasantwhat bitter mortifications
yes she replied but there is no life so sad that it has not
something sweet also
when the curse of poverty falls on you and holds you back from the
accomplishment of all your soul most longs for i said
ah that would be terrible indeed said she a little startled at my
vehemence but do you know poverty is not so dreadful
och then god help you miss kate what do you know about poverty
sure givin up a fine house an horses an carriages an grandeur is
bad enough but for poverty wait till the crathers ye love call to ye
for bread an ye havnt the screed of a pitaty to give themthats
poverty isnt that dreadful the blessed saver shield ye from it
darlint any how
and to think that your own folly had placed you in such i observed
not minding nurse
then i am quite sure said miss vernon that a steadfast resignation
to what you brought on yourself an unmurmuring struggle to retrieve
would work its own cure there is so much strength in perfect
submission
ay for woman
and for man too how can your boldness and wisdom guard against the
future any more than our dependence we can only use the present to the
best of our abilities and leave the rest to god
i remained silently pondering over her words while she turned to
nursedear nurse i forgot indeed what real poverty was as i
spoke many a one is sinking in such a struggle as you describe i
fear still theres rest before them
thrue for ye the heavens be their bed amen
how did we come to scare ourselves with such gloomy thoughts captain
egerton let us enjoy this lovely day and leave the sorrows we cannot
remove in better hands there is the keepers cottage will you sit
here until we have spoken to his daughter we will not be long
a young woman supporting a sicklylooking child appeared in the
porch a tolerably long conference ensued nurse opened the basket
the contents of which were received with great pleasure and the pale
boy tried to climb into kates arms she sat down and spoke to him
with a smile to which he responded as if glad to be with her cormac
sat gravely by me making some advances towards greater intimacy in a
dignified way
i see the whole picture before me even now the keepers pretty
cottage with the rich back ground of autumnal trees the rustic porch
nurse and the girl emptying the basket and miss vernon her shawl
falling off one shoulder bending over the child who looked up at her
with a sort of half wondering half pleased expression
at length the visit was over kate put down the child and followed for
a few steps by its curtseying attendant rejoined me cormac rose as if
his responsibility was at an end and we turned towards home
dismissing all the gloomy forebodings miss vernons words had conjured
up i determined to do away with any evil impression my observations
might have created and our walk back was a right merrie one mrs
otoole throwing in from time to time her shrewd caustic remarks and
kates sweet joyous laugh rousing the echoes from their slumbers many
a half forgotten incident of our former acquaintance was recalled and
nurses reminiscences of our exploits when i used occasionally to join
her nursling in a game of romps called up many a smile on my side and
a few blushes on that of miss vernon
we could perceive the colonel on the look out for us when we reached
the top of the bank mrs otoole having satisfied herself that david
jones had taken more than the ghost of a throut hurried forward to
exercise her skill on the fruit of his labours leaving the garden gate
open for our more tardy approach the colonel received me with his
accustomed polished kindness nurse surpassed herself in the exquisite
dressing of the trout gilpin dropped in to tea joined in praising my
sketches sang a duet with kate and played some beautiful airs while
the colonel was beating me in three consecutive games of chess the
three succeeding days winged themselves away with wonderful rapidity i
sketched and argued with winter prescribed for his wifes pug dog who
was affected with the snuffles and lounged in and out of the priory
as if i was one of its rightful inmates what pleasant mornings they
were sometimes reading aloud to the colonel and his granddaughter
sometimes assisting the latter in the garden occasionally learning
the second in a duet and getting a scolding for inattention while
miss vernon pursued her usual avocations of work or writing or obeyed
nurses summons to disentangle accounts or consult about dinner
in the same easy unembarrassed manner i have before endeavoured to
describe always real always earnest her every occupation seemed
graceful and suitable and the calm continuance of her usual routine
completely removed the uncomfortable idea of being in the way which
more ceremonious attention would have conveyed
how dangerous all this how thoroughly i felt my heart imbued with
the sweet homelike influence of this every day companionship yet i
was astonishingly prudent not altogether in consequence of burtons
admonitions i dreaded to break the repose of our intercourse
and more than all the frankness and friendliness of miss vernons
manner opposed a stronger barrier to the least approach to love
making than the stiffest prudery that ever was inculcated in a
firstrate establishment for young ladies once and only once when
some expression of the irrepressible tenderness and admiration i felt
growing on me escaped my lips almost unconsciously miss vernon
blushed and started as if some sudden revelation had flashed across
her mind and for a moment looked grave almost displeased but the
next instant apparently dismissing whatever thought had disturbed her
she was her own unembarrassed self again
the saturday after my return to a was miss vernons birthday and
winter surprised her with an admirably painted and lifelike likeness
of her grandfather
the delight of kate the exclamations of nurse the enjoyment of
winter may be imagined the whole party including gilpin assisted
at its formal induction in the place of honour over the mantelpiece
vice john anderson transferred to a position at the end of the room
kate professing a great regard for the print i distinguished myself on
the occasion by my skilful picturehanging mrs otoole holding the
ladder on which i mounted to perform the service
we had a very merry party at dinner and drank miss vernons health
and everybodys health
i proposed mrs otooles in an eloquent oration to which she having
been called in to honour the toast of the evening replied success to
ye captin musha but yer a grate spaker entirely heres your health
miss kate and blessins on ye me darlin more power to the masther
and long may he reign over us i pray god
before we separated winter proposed a sketching expedition to a ruin
of much beauty and some interest about eight miles from a and
miss vernon suggested a pic nic to include the party there assembled
we can hire edwards phaeton and mr winter is independent of livery
stables cyclops will no doubt leave us far behind but we will
endeavour to come in for the fragments of the feast
if you promise to behave yourself replied he ill give you a seat
in my buggy
suppose my dear said mrs winter we were to take tea at the farm
on our return it is about half way
thank you my dear an excellent idea
a delightful suggestion mrs winter said miss vernon
then the programme is said winter an early drive over to mowbray
castle a good mornings work there dinner at two oclock and tea at
five and syllabubs at the farm
an admirable plan observed the colonel
there is nothing i like better than a real impromptu pic nic i
observed
and mrs winter the gentlemen must not be too exigeants said
miss vernon but be content with what our larders afford there will
be no time for preparation
content cried i
oh we all know you would rather prefer a few herbs with water from
the neighbouring spring said miss vernon archly
a few more words as to the hour of starting and place of rendezvous
which was to be at the priory as it was on the road to the ruins and
we exchanged good nights
what a contrast sunday at a presented to almost every other sunday
i had ever spent the grey old church with its exquisitely carved
screen and pulpit black polished oak its heavy massive pillars and
quaint scanty congregation how distinguished the colonel and miss
vernon looked amongst them gilpins almost inspired strains on the
organ contrasted rather forcibly with the drowsiness of the service
doled out by a little mummy in spectacles evidently minus several
teeth essential to a clear enunciation we all sat in winters pew
and miss araminta cox was there in a yellow bonnet the turban i
suppose done up in a different shape
after church we had an early dinner luncheon rather then a stroll
along the river where we found elijah bush preaching to a mob of boys
and girls it seemed curious too not having any dinner at the regular
hour
the old church looked dim and solemn at evening service its only
lights were those partially illuminating the little mummy in his task
of deciphering his own hieroglyphics then came a social cup of coffee
a parting injunction to be punctual and we separated for the night
monday rose clear and bright a warm sun and cool bracing air i
reached the priory in good time for their early breakfast and found
colonel vernon and his granddaughter in high spirits the latter
looking lovely her colour heightened by the clear morning air and her
whole countenance beaming with a joyous expression the reflection of
her pure happy heart
soon after ten oclock the unwonted sound of carriages in the
churchyard announced the arrival of the rest of the party and we all
assembled at the entrance gate to arrange the order of proceeding
cyclops already showed symptoms of improved feeding but was as rough
and shaggy as ever as he stood whisking his tail at the flies and
occasionally giving a short cough
the other phaeton was drawn by a tall bony brown horse that looked as
if he had seen better days and could boast a little blood
the colonel politely invited mrs winter to accompany him and kate
most provokingly took her place with mr winter when some discussion
arose in consequence of winters protesting he must take his boy to
look after cyclops this left us minus a seat but i obviated the
difficulty by offering to drive the brown horse leaving the original
jehu behind and sharing the driving seat with gilpin kate rewarded me
with a bright smile as i handed her into winters phaeton
a dashing turnout egerton said the colonel what would your
friend colonel dashwood say to it
that im in great luck to be included in so pleasant a party on any
terms i wish i could persuade you you would be safer on the driving
seat with me miss vernon
she shook her head
do not let cyclops go tom till i have got the reins settled said
winter who had armed himself with a pair of green goggles to keep off
the dust
arrah there yer the awkerdest crather i ever seen exclaimed
nurse as the rejected jehu was endeavouring to arrange a large basket
of provisions in the colonels phaeton dye want to have the captins
knees in his mouth ye omadhaun cant ye put it in this away
i dont think it will fix no ways
now then are we to start or not said winter here put that basket
in my buggy we are lighter than you tom a piece of cord give it to
mrs otoole you neednt let cyclops off yet
cyclops coughed approvingly
athere look at me bould shyclops cockin his tail miss kate
honey have ye yer strong boots on
all right mr winter cried i
let him go tom
god speed yez
i held in my steed who notwithstanding his low condition was still
eager and after a few energetic lashes which only entangled the whip
in the traces winter led the way as he wished and after traversing
some very narrow crooked streets and lanes apparently paved with a
view to dislocate all travellers we emerged upon a fine broad road
where i took the liberty of making the brown horse keep neck and neck
with cyclops winters was certainly a curious turn out with a huge
basket tied on the back seat leaving a narrow ledge for tom to perch
on winter himself in a broad brimmd straw hat the expression of his
features completely changed by the total eclipse of his eyes under
green goggles into one of preternatural gravity and preoccupation
sitting bolt upright and considerably in the middle of the carriage
leaving small space for miss vernon and terribly embarrassed with the
reins
our own was not much better the cane work doing duty for panels broken
in several places and the brown horse leaning against the collar and
pulling with all his might how burton would have laughed at the whole
concern yet never did i enjoy a pic nic so much
the road leading through a fine rich though rather flat country its
chief ornament an abundance of splendid timber at one place crossed
a marshy common where the organist informed me the royalists had
been routed in the civil wars many a sally from kate upholding
the superiority of their steed to ours enlivened our journey while
winters attention was a good deal engrossed by a tendency of the
reins to get under cyclops tail
our progress was not rapid but at length we reached our destination
mowbray castle stands close to the modern house of the earl of
they were generally absentees and kindly permitted the vulgar public
to enjoy the beauties they did not value a civil gate keeper admitted
us into an unpretending avenue and shouted a warning after us that
one side of the ruins was unsafe but which no one seemed to heed
winter said that was a matter of course hint given to every visitor
and that he would undertake to guide us
we entered a quadrangular court yard bare and blazing with sunshine
where we left the carriages and i secured miss vernon as my companion
while winter gave some directions to tom as to the arrangements of
dinner all agreeing to leave the selection of our banqueting hall to
him
push open this gate for me captain egerton said kate after a vain
attempt to move a pair of heavy wooden doors to the left i obeyed
and we stepped at once from the glare of the paved court yard into the
cool shade of grand old trees feathering to the ground with gleams
of sunshine breaking through upon the rich soft mossy turf beneath
a broad straight gravelled walk led up a steep hill before us under
a perfect arch of luxuriant foliage the modern house lying a little
distance to the left
here we were joined by winter who had discarded the green specs his
hat in one hand and a handkerchief in the other reaching the hill
and emerging from the shade of the trees we found ourselves upon
the edge of what was formerly the moat of the castle now a gravel
walk with steeply sloping grassy sides studded with evergreens and
flowering shrubs beyond the ruins rose majestic in their decay and
crowning the sudden hill we had partially ascended a narrow stone
arch allowing of one passenger only at a time was here thrown over
the moat the ivy and other creepers hanging from it in graceful
streamers and festoons it had no parapet or rail kate walked over
it fearlessly and at once but mrs winter hesitated and accepted my
hand to lead her across a good deal of climbing ensued up and down
dilapidated spiral staircases and among yawning chasms leading to
torture chambers and oubliettes as miss vernon suggested some of
the views from the elevated position on which we stood over the rich
flat country with its winding river and the distant towers of a
were fine but i agreed with kate in preferring the opposite side of
the castle where the hill was more precipitous and you looked down
into a sea of foliage with an undulating ferny deer park beyond and
a background of blue mountains in the distance winter was already
arranging his drawing materials in front of a round tower with an
arched door half hidden by a graceful ash tree
after looking at his preparations i should like a sketch of the
castle as we first came upon it a little to the right to take in that
pretty bridge what subject are you going to select captain egerton
asked kate
if you will show me the spot you speak of i will endeavour to carry
out your idea
that is delightful follow me
i saw in a moment she had selected an admirable point of view and i
was soon hard at work miss vernon bending over my drawing offering
suggestions as i proceeded now leaning back against the dbris of an
old tower cutting my pencils and telling me legends of the castle now
wandering away with gilpin to inspect winters sketch and returning
with a report of his progress to stimulate my energies while mrs
winter and the colonel seated themselves on a rustic bench occupying
an elevated position in what was once the keep from which the rival
sketchers were both visible and the latter producing a newspaper
from his pocket sometimes holding his glasses to his eyes sometimes
tapping them on the paper seemed to read aloud for his companions
amusement a couple of hours glided pleasantly away and kate was
congratulating me on my faithful delineation of the ruins when we
perceived winter join his wife and the colonel he waved his straw hat
and making a speaking trumpet of a roll of paper shouted dinner
very audibly
in a minute said miss vernon forgetting he could not hear her
just finish that bit of shading captain egerton mr gilpin and i
will put up all your things
are you coming shouted winter once more
i put my portfolio under my arm shouldered my camp stool and we
soon joined the impatient and hungry artist who led the way to a
wellchosen site for dinner a bastion to the east of the castle
commanding a totally different view both north and south which the
remains of a grey watch tower at one angle served to divide into
two distinct pictures close under it our banquet was spread some
mossgrown stones and our camp stools supplying us with seats gaily
and laughingly we attacked the viands winter presided eating and
talking with great energy seated on a high stone which compelled
him to keep his feet on tiptoe to prevent his wellfilled plate from
gliding off his knees kneeling down every now and then to dive into
the interior of a partridge pie his own contribution to the feast
i must trouble you again winter said the colonel no paste thank
you but teniers himself never gave a better interior
i made it myself colonel said mrs winter triumphantly
my dear madam fair hands make fair work
bel parlare poco costa ejaculated winter
you ought to be ashamed of yourself to say such things in an unknown
tongue said miss vernon
what was it my dear enquired his wife indeed john those wicked
words are very sinful
ha ha miss vernon you are a mischievous little witch ah sue
youve an old reprobate of a husband
let us fill a bumper to the memory of those glorious old normans who
left us so charming a banqueting hall said i
you do not express yourself properly let us drain a cup is more
appropriate interrupted miss vernon
a set of unmitigated robbers without a spark of humanity said the
artist
you must admit they were often splendidly generous interposed miss
vernon
ay by fits and starts
as much as could be expected from ignorant uncivilised warriors said
i they were rude and cruel enough so were all nations at the time
while few possessed their generosity energy and abstemiousness they
were a race of gentlemen
yes abstemiousness has always continued to be a characteristic of
their gentlemanlike descendants sneered winter
quite as much as of the all imbibing saxons i like the normans
replied kate
was it not here miss vernon that geraldine mowbray mounted guard
with her waiting woman to give the warders time for repose enquired
gilpin
yes it was during an insurrection of the saxon serfs and was not
unlike the lady evelyn berengers watch in the betrothed she had a
brave heart
it is wonderful what heroic acts women were capable of in those days
observed the colonel
it was the peculiar position they were placed in called forth
faculties which still exist ready to spring into action whenever there
is a call for self devotion said i
which are exercised every day and a thousand times more painfully in
silent unregarded sacrifices observed the organist
and a thousand times more gloriously said miss vernon it was
i am sure comparatively easy to act heroically when the tone of
every thing round you was heroic applauded and worshipped by noble
and gallant knights celebrated by minstrels through all the world of
chivalry i have not much courage to boast of but i think i could
mount guard on an emergency and under those circumstances ah dare i
say i have that loftier courage that would enable me to bear up under
trials the depth of which my own heart alone knew
she stopped suddenly blushing as if ashamed of her own enthusiasm
my dear kate what makes you think such dreadful things whined mrs
winter
why miss vernon you are in a moralising vein cried her mate
i have no doubt kate you would lead a forlorn hope gallantly said
her grandfather
take me as your lieutenant miss vernon and trust me ill support my
chief
when the occasion comes youll find strength said gilpin
basta in nome di dio leave off moralising and give us a song
the organist and kate sang a duet and even winter joined in a catch
their notes floated sweetly on the air and woke up the echoes of the
deserted castle tom gathered up the fragments of the feast and mr
winter hinted it was time for us to start for the farm
we all accordingly rose and gilpin who was a little of a botanist
climbed to get some wild plant that caught his eye a little way up
the remnant of a watchtower i have already mentioned i wonder said
kate if this is the dangerous part of the ruins i think that wall
looks tottering and she remained standing beside me watching the
organist as she spoke i fancied i heard something fall among the
thick leafy boughs at the other side then one of the stones by which
gilpin had ascended rolled slowly away christo benedetto shouted
winter down down all of you it will fall they rushed rapidly
away kate paused for an instant to say poor mr gilpin help him
he is lame i immediately flew to assist his descent and almost
lifted him to the ground he turned quickly to the right down a broken
flight of steps and i was following him when there was a crash a
blinding dust a scream of dismay from the lookers on i felt a heavy
blow a sense of acute pain and then all was darkness
chapter viii
convalescence
i will not dwell on the wearisome details of a sick room my escape
from death was almost miraculous still the injuries i received were
dangerous and my recovery retarded by the fever consequent on my slow
and painful transit from the scene of the accident to winters house
where he insisted on establishing me on the plea that he was partly
the cause of my sufferings here all that kindness and skill could
accomplish was done to alleviate them poor gilpin watching over me
with the affection of a brother and the tenderness of woman mrs
otoole too seemed a fixture by my bedside and when in the delirium
of fever no voice had so much influence over me i was told as the
rich tones of her mellifluous brogue
burton and colonel dashwood came over from carrington on receiving
despatches announcing the accident and the former finding me in such
good hands gave up his intention of remaining with me notwithstanding
all the care and watchfulness expended on me october was well nigh
past before the spectacled shovelhatted galen of a pronounced
a visit to the drawing room feasible and my utter exhaustion when
the transit from my room was effected proved the correctness of his
judgment
there i lay stretched on the sofa strength and energy alike vanished
finding a sufficient exercise for all my faculties in watching the
twinkling of mrs winters knitting needles and enjoying a delicious
languor partly the result of weakness partly of freedom from pain
where was the resolution with which i was to disentangle my affairs
rouse my brother to a sense of duty and try my chance of winning kate
vernon buried in the ruins of the ladys tower as it was called
while i was utterly unable to move without assistance and indebted to
mrs winters unceasing attention for the conveyance of every spoonful
of jelly that reached my lips yet in spite of all i was almost glad
to be thus compelled to postpone for the present my intentions
it was so delightful to feel that no exertion could be expected from
me and that i was chained within the magic circle of kate vernons
influence without the possibility of burton or any one else caviling
at the cause yet such is the miserable vanity of our petty nature i
rather delayed seeing her even after the doctor had declared visitors
admissible the colonel had from the first seen me almost daily
and now no morning passed without a visit from him to tell me the
newswhat the troops in india were about what the times said of
the ministry and of the enquiries made for me by colonel dashwood and
my brother officers in short i was an occupation to him and always
welcomed his appearance with a warmth too genuine not to touch his
benevolent heart
winter had received one or two notes of inquiry from my brother
finally a formal letter of thanks for his attention to me and egerton
appeared to relapse into his usual forgetfulness of my existence
my days generally passed in a sort of routine order each person of our
little society giving me a portion of their time in turn the colonel
in the morning when winter was out and his wife in the subterranean
regions devoted to gastronomy then gilpin used to look in between
the intervals of his music lessons after this came a dreary pause
before mrs winter was sufficiently at liberty to take up her strangely
soothing work and winter still in his studio
i was unequal to the effort of perusing a book and longed for some one
to read to me so i generally lay chewing the cud of sweet and bitter
fancy from one to two oclock and curious enough as my strength
slowly returned the bitter predominated my mind seemed to gather
force enough to feel the weight of responsibilities from which the
weakness it shared with its closely linked associate the body had
freed it for a while is it not thus that spirits and forms of slighter
make and less comprehensive faculties manage to cast away sorrows and
sicknesses that would shatter more robust and powerful frames
woe to him whose deep and sensitive feelings are not linked with a
nature strong enough to direct and support them and for those from
whose lighthearted buoyancy care and regret seem to glance away as if
from polished armour why should we dare to sneer at their apparent
frivolity shall not nature which has furnished every living thing with
its own peculiar weapon provide the spirit with a fitting defence
against the deadly foes that beset it maraviglia as winter would
say what profound reflections for a captain of light dragoons
the interval i have described was dragging its dreary length slowly
over one determined wet day dark and misty the clouds having
apparently come down to earth in a fit of hysterics the trees in the
abbey garden visible from my sofa had a thoroughly drenched saturated
look as if nothing could ever dry them once or twice the tramp tramp
of a pair of heavy hobnailed shoes echoed through the square and the
wearer trudged by in glistening oilskin cap a sack thrown over his
shoulders and a shivering dripping dog at his heels but beyond this
no living creature showed out of shelter it was too much i fancied
even for the most aquatically inclined duck i felt the want of
companionship deplorably what could winter mean by pretending business
with the dean this morning if he was at home i would have some one to
speak to it is too dark to paint
there was a low knock at the door and mrs otooles broad pleasant
face appeared beaming on me over a tray which she carried
ah nurse i exclaimed how delighted i am to see you hereshake
hands i got quite affectionate at the idea of a pleasant chat with
mrs otoole
och jewel now be asy dont be strivin to sit up sure ill settle
the pillas for ye before yd say thrap stick if youd have patience
there now take a sup of it i made ye a nice drop of jelly meeself

captin so much as what you make dear knows its the tunderin wet
day an how are ye agrah
i may observe en passant that mrs otoole had treated me more like
a pet child than a respected right honourable since my illness and
rather ruled me with a rod of iron
i replied to her kind enquiries and asked for miss vernon
is it miss kate shes singin like a lark ses she nurse be sure
you ask captin egerton when i may go see him im sure ses she hes
angry with me for making him go back to help mr gilpin ses she or

danger and i could not rescue her your voice used invariably to break
the spell but did any one else hear me except you
i couldnt take upon me to say but mr gilpin an meeself was wid ye
most times
hum and miss vernon you did not mention my delusions to her
in course i did
and what did she say
mrs otoole just thought for a moment and then looking up in my face
said is it miss kate ses sheisnt it odd dear nurse how people
rave about those they never think of when sane ses she sane or
sinsible was the word but i dis remember which
not much tenderness or recognition of my feelings there i thought
tant mieux you may put away the cup nurse it was so good i quite
enjoyed it and tell me did you see colonel dashwood when he was over

thoroughbred colonel prefacing his speech with arrah thin

oh nurse dear nurse do not go tell me something more
i havnt a hapoth more to tell ye an its time for me to be going
the blessin of christ be wid ye yer lookin ten stone bether glory
be to god
the next day in consequence of nurses report miss vernon came with
her grandfather i almost expected her yet her advent made me feel
strangely nervous it seemed strange to me too being unable to rise
that she should come over and place her hand in mine when i could not
stir to receive her she sat down near me and began talking in a gentle
subdued tone as if half afraid of disturbing me
you look much better than i expected captain egerton what a
wonderful recovery but why would you not let me come here before
i was afraid my ghastly looks would frighten you
you look all eyes now
in a whisper i am
i do not think you look so well to day egerton you have a feverish
excited air and your voice is decidedly weaker observed the colonel
perhaps we ought not to stay said miss vernon
i beg you will not leave me i gasped
after a little more conversation a message from mr winter called the
colonel out of the room and kate and i were ttette
nurse gave rather a melancholy account of you yesterday said miss
vernon she said you were all alone and dissolute by yourself
have you no books
i do not feel up to reading but if i had any one to read out to
megilpin has not time
i would be delighted i will come here and read to you and mrs winter
every day
you are most kind
the excitement of her visit was too much for me and i felt a faintness
stealing over me miss vernon observing the deadly pallor of my face
with an expression of alarm felt my pulse let me call some one
she said i feebly grasped her hand dreading that an interview so
delightful to me should be curtailed
it is nothingair air i articulated with much difficulty still
leaving her hand in mine she stretched the other to a screen and
fanned me silently for a few moments then perceiving the returning
colour are you better now she said softly with such an expression
of tenderness in her dark eyes i could have thrown myself at her feet
if you will let go my hand i will get you a little of that bottle i
see restorative on it she added without a shade of embarrassment
evidently considering my desire to retain it some sickly fancy i
reluctantly relinquished my hold and turning to the table she gave me
the medicine and then arranged my pillows in such a homelike manner
from that interview the sort of unsettled but ardent admiration i
had before entertained for her seemed to deepen into something purer
higher more devoted and unselfish than i had ever felt before i
looked forward to the possibility of calling her my wife not with
the rash eagerness to possess a new toy or to give life a new charm
but with a deep rooted conviction that with her at my side come weal
or woe i would have love and truth and strength there always and
unchangeably
from this time she came over constantly after my hosts early dinner
and read aloud while mrs winter pursued her occupation of knitting
and i lay on my sofa all eye and ear winter and the colonel often
joined our party but the former was too fond of raising questions in
opposition to the opinions of whatever author we were perusing
miss vernon generally chose the books she was to read and i could not
help thinking she had some design in her selection they were generally
thoughtful high toned works not coming under the denomination
of religious literature but yet setting forth in a strong though
unobtrusive manner the necessity of faith the healing power of
resignation
i hinted one day that i could see she intended to convert me she
disclaimed such an intention very eagerly concluding why should i
pretend to do so i am sure you are as good as i am i consulted mr
gilpin about the books and took what he advised and i like them too
for i feel they do me good but i will bring you a novel tomorrow
she did so and chose zanoni excluding winter from the lecture i did
thoroughly enjoy it
miss vernon seemed to identify herself with its noble thoughts its
wild imaginings its grand philosophy and highsouled spirit of
selfsacrifice her musical voice varying with every sentiment it
expressed and often laying down the book to discuss its character
with an interest and affection that invested them with lifelike
reality i had glanced over the work before and put it down with an
acknowledgment certainly of the authors great genius but with an
idea that it was beyond the scope of my imagination to enjoy kates
readings and remarks on it revealed me to myself and showed me i had
aspirations and capabilities for better things yet it was merely the
outpouring of her own heart and she would have raised her darkly
fringed eyelids in astonishment had any one told her she was making a
silent revolution in mine
poor mrs winter used to listen to our animated debates on viola and
glyndon c in perfect amazement and when appealed to by kate for
an opinion replied with a smile indeed my dear i dont know its
a very curious book and quite impossible to believe any man could see
and know everything the way that mr zanoni did
longfellows poems then attracting notice for the first time in
england were great favourites with miss vernon and here she and
winter perfectly agreed for a wonder these were hours of intense
happiness the exterior world all forgotten i lived in a fairylike
dream with just sufficient of earth around me to prove it real my
strength was now rapidly returning and i began to feel this delicious
breathing space from lifes ruder joys and ruder cares had lasted long
enough once or twice i had caught winter watching kate and myself as
we sat apart rather from the othersshe pouring forth her opinions on
some favourite author with all her accustomed enthusiasmi wrapped
in contemplation of her and thinking but little of the subject which
engrossed her thoughts
winter i repeat would sometimes glance uneasily at us as we sat thus
but i always observed serenity return to his countenance as his eye
rested on miss vernon
it soon grew into a habit that the vernons and gilpin should come in
every evening kate and the organist taking it by turns to cut into the
rubber or talk with me as i showed a decided disinclination for the
society of miss araminta cox who usually made up the whist table
we had a good deal of music too my favourite songs were all duly
remembered and all my whims so kindly attended to i almost regretted
that soon no excuse would remain for prolonging my sojourn amongst
them the first day i ventured to walk out burton came over from
carrington with a packet of letters arrived during my illness there
were some pleasant reminders from my solicitors that messrs levi and
cos bill would soon be due and that they kindly offered to renew on
exorbitant terms one or two missives of the same nature an epistle
from egerton congratulating me on my escape from the infernal regions
which he seemed clearly of opinion would have been my destination had
not nature or the doctor been too strong for grim death and concluding
with an exhortation to read the 25th chapter of st matthew he is
worse than ever was my reflection as i finished the perusal what a
herculean labour i have before me in the attempt to soften the heart
of such a thoroughgoing evangelical they always manage to convince
themselves that it is for the good of their souls that their pockets
should be hermetically sealed against the wants of their brothers but
i must get out of messrs levis clutches at any cost
lastly a long rambling but affectionate letter from my sister telling
me more of english gossip than i could imagine the dolce far niente
of neapolitan life had left her energy enough to collect
i feel rather distressed dear fred she said after giving me an
amusing sketch of the society about her at the profoundly moral tone
of your letter and fear you must be in debt not far out there for
you never were very serious about any love affair tell me what is the
matter you know we are rich and harry always liked you i have been
so bored about some absurd speech of egertons at exeter hall they
tell me for i never read such things he said the ministry had
delivered the nation bound hand and foot to beelzebub where they sent
an ambassador to antichrist meaning the pope do find out if this
is true for the people here have discovered he is my brother and the
women always cross themselves when i enter a room which is so absurd
and disagreeable the men only laugh i am much better and we think of
returning to england next spring i wish you would get leave of absence
and run over to us for the winter it is too dreadful to think of
your being condemned to remain at that horrible place would it not be
better to live altogether at a if you must be near your regiment
talking of you the other night to count alphonso di montibello he said
there was a famous painter a great ally of his who used to study
here now living at a do you know any thing of him
now dear fred good bye write soon again to me ever your
affectionate sister
      mary f wentworth
psharry desires his remembrances i had almost forgotten lady
desmond of course i know her every one does she is a most charming
person and creates a perfect furore here such taste and certainly
the most ladylike irishwoman i ever met she has refused a perfect army
of counts and marquises cela va sans dire but if report speaks
true that nice creature sir charles seyton shared the same fate they
say adolphus somerset one of our attachs got sick leave after
offering his little diplomatic self for her acceptance and receiving
one fixed look from her dark eyes i have a theory of my own that lady
desmond calm proud and cold as she seems has a tendresse for a
certain blas peer at present among our most prominent notorieties
he piques himself on his cynicism and is rather in the satanic style
very ridiculous i think they tell me dreadful stories of him lady
desmond talks of travelling with us as far as florence next spring
if you have any engouement for her get rid of it i would advise
you for she had some trouble to recall your memory to hers and seemed
quite astonished when i told her you had made any enquiries about her
adieu once more
how thoroughly characteristic her letter is of the life she leads
kindly and polished but trifling and selfabsorbed i must ask winter
about this count alphonso di  what is it
and is your business so urgent that you cannot put it off till you are
stronger said the old colonel to me about a week after the receipt of
the above when i announced my intention of starting for allerton my
brothers place in hampshire
it is indeed i replied so gloomily that my kind old friend asked
nothing disagreeable i hope
nothing very pleasant said i forcing a laugh i will tell you all
when i come back do not look so gravely at me miss vernon
did i i was not aware of it but are you not very rash to travel so
soon
no i would get a fever if i remained
chapter ix
struggles
allerton court has been in our family since the days of the tudors how
the careless scapegrace egertons kept it so long i cannot imagine
chiefly i believe by the sacrifice of larger and more valuable
estates elsewhere its present possessor my half brother was a
very different person from his predecessors my father succeeded to
an impoverished title at an early age and soon after attaining his
majority married a wealthy city heiress who finding herself uneasy
and misplaced in fashionable life imagined she was disgusted with the
world and its frivolities and gave herself up for the remainder of her
sojourn here below to quacks spiritual and medical poor woman i
believe she sincerely wished to do right and with this view brought
up her son under an amount of religious pressure that reduced him to
the adamantine condition i have before hinted at no doubt the various
patent pills and powders she was in the habit of administering to him
had their share in producing the curious dormant state of his physical
and mental powers altogether egerton was a problem i never dreamt of
solving and now that he had suddenly acquired interest in my eyes i
blushed at the thought of asking his brotherly assistance to settle my
affairs into marriageable shape almost as deeply as at the idea of
begging from a stranger
my father remained unmarried for nearly two years after the death
of his first wife and their son must have been nineteen when the
bright eyes and graceful manners of lady mary de burgh captivated the
disconsolate widower still young and handsome enough to please the
fancy and interest the heart of a girl only some few months older
than his heir i have but slight recollection of my mother i was the
youngest and she did not survive my birth more than three years both
my sister and myself were extremely like her and adored by my father
who never could even in his childhood caress so rigidly orthodox
a young gentleman as his eldest son egerton was a thing apart and
belonged to his country and the peerage but we were the darlings of
his heart spoiled children reared in luxury and indulgence how well
i remember the bitter and passionate grief with which i received the
intelligence of his death and the choking sobs that interrupted my
reproaches to egerton for not sending for me in time to let me hear
his voice once more feeling that every unconscious game of cricket in
which i had joined while he lay struggling between life and death was
an unnatural piece of levity unpardonable
all this passed over soon and my life was happy enough but mary used
often to look sad and was very glad to marry wentworth though he was
a good deal older than herself the large fortune my fathers first
wife brought him was of course settled on her children so mary and i
had but the slender portions usually allotted to the younger egertons
but mine was doubled by her husbands refusal to accept hers
this is more than i meant to have stated about myself but it was
necessary to show my position
a cold raw damp november day with occasional dashes of heavy rain the
leafless trees bending before the sudden gusts of wind that accompanied
them and every object ten yards off shrouded in a dark fog that seemed
to blend heaven and earth in one equable gloom i shivered as i drew up
the windows of the cab into which i had thrown myself at the railway
station near allerton observing how strongly the conveyance appeared
to partake of the general humidity the avenue seemed interminable and
when at length my humble vehicle drew up before the portico i received
the pleasing intelligence my lord is not at home captain egerton
but will you please to walk in
why yes i intend stopping here for the night and barnard get me
some mulled port will you lots of spice and hot as the devil
yes sir said the butler with a slight shudder at the profanity
by the time i had roused the slumbering fire into a blaze the house
steward an old retainer entered with the wine and respectfully
congratulated me on my recovery a few mutual enquiries followed
during which i could not help smiling to myself at the formal tone i
felt compelled to adopt towards the grave old man who had known my
boyhood nothing would be too familiar with mrs otoole but the stern
saxon nature demands a degree of reserve in their superiors and would
resent any freedom as something derogatory to both the coldness
between english masters and servants is quite as much the fault of the
latter as the former and so it must be while the anglosaxon race
exists anything demonstrative is terribly out of place with them
il ne faut jamais faire agir un homme dans un sens different de son
caractre
my lord takes the chair at a meeting of the society for converting
the jews at  today sir but he will return to dinner said my
informant as he made his parting bow and retired
heaven send my worthy brother may follow up the object of the meeting
by converting messrs levi and co from creditors into nonclaimants
as well as all the other errors of their ways was my mental
ejaculation as i betook myself to the record and its advertisements
for pious footmen and not sober but serious cooks as an escape from
my own thoughts
egerton returned to dinner bringing with him two sleek white
neckclothd straighthaired gentlemen the deputation he informed
me from the parent society
my brother received me very graciously and remarking that i still
looked indifferent after my illness regretted i was not in time to
attend the meeting to hear the reverend somebody hold forth captain
egerton said he during one of the pauses in our repast noticing
perhaps something of carnal impatience in the glances of the reverend
j e black towards the door for the appearance of the next entre
captain egerton has been and is quartered at carrington did you not
reside there or in its neighbourhood
yes my lord replied the son of the parent society i had for
some time a wide field of labour at a
this individual was a tall man inclined to embonpoint with heavy
features a large hooked nose a thick sensual under lip and a tuft of
straight coarse hair at each side of his face
at a said i glad to exchange a word with any one about a
place so endeared to me i was there two days ago did you know a mr
winter of abbey gardens i am indebted to the kindness and care of him
and his wife for my existence
under providence he suggested in a mild sugary voice which with a
perpetual placid smile characterised the revd gentleman his manner
too was extremely courteous almost wellbred though one could not
help perceiving a something lurking below like the odour of cigars
when you endeavour to overpower it with mille fleurs or eau de miel
of course of course said i
i was not personally acquainted with him he observed but from his
repute i fear he is not a christian
well at least he is a good samaritan i replied
my brother is a military man you know my dear sir observed lord
egerton and he sighed
come egerton said i although we may not be as good as we ought
we are not so bad after all
indeed my lord there is a little more light in the army than
formerly said his revd friend when i was a soldier their state of
darkness was awful
pray sir may i ask you how you managed to grope your way out of it
i enquired
thoughtless as i then was i felt shocked at the profane familiarity
with sacred things evinced by his reply nor will i record it i
noticed merely his hint of having been a soldier and made a few
languid enquiries as to his regiment c but egerton and the
other clerico soon plunged into discussion of things and people
incomprehensible and unknown to me their occasional awkward attempts
to change or rather descend to topics more congenial to their
unregenerate companion conveying the pleasant notion that they
looked upon me as a hawk in a dove cot a wolf among lambs but that
they would endeavour to let me see they were not too proud of their
superiority mr black indeed frequently turned to me endeavouring
to suit his conversation to my depraved taste by repeating wretched
anecdotes of various london notorieties by the way i generally
observe your parvenu always appears to think a familiarity with
steward and housekeepers room on dits the most certain proof he can
adduce of his own fitness for good society i took a most unconquerable
dislike to this blessed babe of the parent society especially when
i heard him descanting to egerton as we sipped our coffee on the
sinfulness of dancing and the necessity of faith unadorned by works
nor was i the least surprised on hearing afterwards from winter that
he fully carried out his principles in his practice by leaving every
thing to his faith and dispensing with those more commonplace duties
less privileged individuals consider binding his poor wife neglected
and abused sought safety in separation and his sons ground down
by tyranny and injustice being left to the unassisted care of that
providence with whose dispensation he was too pious to let parental
anxieties interfere but i am giving too much time to a man who annoyed
me through a whole evening there are not many like him i should hope
his companion although tiresome seemed a simple straightforward
person
never shall i forget that wretched evening oppressed by the
anticipation of the unpleasant conference before me and feeling the
difficulty of my task with egerton more strongly as every moment
showed me the spirit of selfsatisfied devoteeism with which my brother
and his allies seemed to shut out the nonelect from all sympathy or
affection
there was a great deal of babble about the missionary cause and
advanced christian and evangelical views and many more of the
technical terms which made up their stockintrade while my thoughts
flew back to the real prayer i had heard poor gilpin pour out when
i lay to all appearance insensible and hovering between life and
death
i felt disgusted to observe that sleek shiny black trying to catch
egerton with a dun religious hackle while he baited a small hook
with a red one of what he would call fashionable small talk for me
of the two i preferred the latter for although far from what i ought
to be nothing is so revolting to my taste as the attempt to force
solemn subjects into the trivialities of commonplace conversation
the longest and dreariest evening and digression too must come to
an end i pleaded the excuse of recent illness and made my retreat
intimating to egerton my wish for a private interview in the morning
to which he very readily assented
i sat musing over my fire until my candle was nearly burnt out
contrasting in my mind the dreary trio i had just left with the
pleasant warmhearted unaffected little circle amongst whom i had so
lately mingled a favoured and indulged memberthese people live
and are happy they lead no useless unemployed existence either but
if egertons is the road to heaven dieu men preserve oh what a
strange perversity of fate to make me the younger brother egerton
would have made such an admirable curate and married the best dowered
of his congregation he looks upon the accessories of his position
as so many hindrances to his advance in holiness while ihow well
my poor mothers diamond tiara would look on kate vernons rich brown
hair
i never thought i should feel so like a poltroon as i did when the
library door closed on egerton and myself never in the course of our
lives had i asked or received a favour from him not that any unkind
feeling existed between us but we had always been blanks to each
other and now to ask this frigid pharisaical being who so evidently
thought there was a great gulf fixed between himself and the great
mass of his fellowcreatures to help me out of a scrape i ought never
to have got intoto sympathise with my passionate admiration of a
penniless girl
you wished to speak to me frederic
i may observe egerton was the only one i was ever intimate with who
troubled himself to give me more than one syllable to my name
yes i have a great deal to accuse myself of egerton but in short
i am in a scrape and i want you to do a brotherly act and help me out
of it
this bold plunge seemed to startle my companion not a little and
he moved rather restlessly on his seat as he replied indeed if
in my power to assist you i trust i shall not be deficient in the
performance of my duty but remember i cannot countenance the godless
waste of means entrusted
god knows i do not want to continue any useless expenditure said i
it is with the wish to become free from debt to live cleanly and
like a gentleman that i come to bore you with my affairs
every one smarting under the effects of their folly is ready to
abjure it but when the sting is removed you can hardly answer for
yourself said his lordship
no but really i have not a single dissipated or extravagant taste
the more unpardonable you will say my getting ahead of my income
granted yet you living here in unbroken quiet can hardly judge the
force that habit acquires when your only companions are a set of men
whose occupation is spending whose excitement is prodigality it
was the want of some better and deeper interest that threw me into
expensive follies which i now regret but egerton i have some more
certain guarantee to give for my permanent reformation than a mere
desire to get rid of difficulties ithere is a missthat is i want
to marry and settle
that alters the face of affairs i shall be happy to do anything i can
to forward this favourable arrangement have you proposed in form or
ascertained the amount of the ladys fortune
i replied laughing yes and no i have not proposed and her fortune
is like my owna blank
really frederic there are no limits to the imprudence into which
the impetuosity of a worldly and unchastened spirit hurry those lost
to the knowledge of better things i do not see how your marriage
with a penniless girl is to better your position in any point of view
temporal or spiritual
there is such a thing as awakening to better and purer affections i
replied more settled convictions or
it is our duty to curb our affections which are all depraved and
sinful interrupted lord egerton but to return to the point we
started from what is the scrape as you term it substituting no
doubt a delusive jest to disguise the real colour of the transaction
why really nothing more dreadful than is done every day and i told
him of my bets and horses of raising the wind through the means of
his proteges the jews of their renewal of bills at enormous
interest and the whole bloodsucking system that my great object was
to get free from their fangs to cut the army marry and settle down
somewhere as something i did not know exactly what but i had an idea
of farming this last was a happy stroke i thought for if egerton
really wants to make a good boy of me now is his time let him offer
me one of his devonshire farms for i know that he purchased property
there some years ago he sat playing with his seals and chain and
looking confoundedly sour longer than i could wait with any degree of
patience at last he said in a discontented tone i suppose you want
me to join you in raising money on your younger sons portion but
even if i were to consent to so great an inconvenience it will not i
should think forward your matrimonial scheme which youll excuse me
for designating as peculiarly absurd under the circumstances
you may call it what you like i replied though i am not aware i
asked your opinion about it of course if i must give it up i must
for i would not drag any girl into an abyss of poverty but it will be
a blow more severe than you think
i am no judge and you can of course decide as you think fit but
i must say i see no reason why i should be suddenly called on to
inconvenience myself to pay for the extravagance and gratify the
caprice of my half brother
you have given your opinion on my conduct quite often enough i did
not come here merely to bow before your animadversions nor am i aware
you have any right to call me to account the question is this i have
a certain charge on your estates which will more than cover my debts
and i want you to decide whether you will aid me in getting it into my
own hands or leave me to incur the expenses and difficulty of raising
it indirectly come egerton you cannot be such a cold hearted fellow
and a son of my poor fathers pitch calculations to the devil who
invented them and hold out a hand to help me on terra firma
well frederic i am not cold hearted but my principles are opposed
to yielding to impulses which prompted by our fallen nature must
always be evil you certainly have a right to a sum of 10000 the
interest of which i have hitherto paid you and could as certainly put
difficulties in the way of your getting possession of it i do not
intend however to do so my observations were merely to show that it
was not such an easy matter for me to give you 10000 at a moments
warning i will however write to harris about it at once let me see
you say your debt to these jews is between six and seven thousand and
your smaller debts something under two thousand well that will leave
you say fifteen hundred to begin afresh with i am endeavouring to
serve you at my own inconvenience i repeat that property i purchased
in devonshire cost me more than it is worth and situated as providence
has seen fit to place me at the head of a strong evangelical
movement it is my lot to contribute largely towards the spread of the
gospel and heaven forbid that i should permit the extravagance of a
young wordling to curtail my means of advancing the missionary cause
therefore remember frederic that this is the last time i can yield
to the weakness of my disposition and furnish you with the means of
clearing yourself from debt you are old enough to judge for yourself
and if you choose to commit the folly of marrying on 1500 or 2000
and a commission in one of the most expensive regiments in the service
our besotted rulers ever embodied you must bear the consequences i
have told you my final decision
it is just what i might have expected but i say egerton though
i am perfectly aware i have no claims on you do you mean to say you
will not give me a helping hand to settle and lead a new life as
you call it i have been brought up in luxury and expensive habits
i am incapacitated by education and association from pushing my own
fortune and now when these seeds have brought forth their fruit i am
to be cut adrift on a raft of 1500 i would not ask you to injure or
cramp yourself in the slightest degree but is there nothing to which
you can assist me if you look about you in a brotherly spirit
really captain egerton i am at a loss to imagine what more you can
expect from me unless you wish me to resign allerton into your own
hands i am ready to place your fortune in your own hands at once and
now you seem to think i have not done enough am i to supply you with
the means of gratifying your whims out of my own pocket at the expense
of far higher claims
enough enough cried i by heavens i would rather accept a
settlement in the parochial workhouse than from you or any one
that would give it reluctantly i do not know how you interpret the
bible egerton but i remember a verse in it that used to strike my
fancy when the plate was being handed round after a charity sermon
something about compassionating a needy brother and the concluding
question how dwelleth the love of god in him i suppose your
universal brotherhood with believers leaves but a scanty remnant for
the one nature provided you with however you say truly i have no
right to expect you will inconvenience yourself for me pray forget
that i ever lowered myself so much as to hint at such a proceeding i
shall content myself with what i am rigidly entitled to and equally
free from debt and obligation try to find in india a wider field for
ambition or as you would term it of usefulness let us see which of
us will reap most honours
i am well accustomed to bear the sneers a christian must meet in his
conflict with the world i endeavour to act up to my principles and i
hope you may see the error of your ways before it is too late
oh pious martyr i wish it was my lot to encounter persecutions on
the same terms though by jove i am not sure whether in my darkened
intellect i might not consider smithfield almost counterbalanced
by a couple of hours exhortation from some rev holdforth dont look
shocked egerton but you and your dogmas have sent me three steps
lower down at least since i came here religion you conspire against
its prevalence but i need not excruciate you any longerany commands
for town i intend taking that particular road to ruin this evening
i never use strong language said his lordship it is opposed to all
my principles but i confess frederic you have infinitely disgusted
me i wish you a safe journey and as i have promised to show the rev
mr black my model schools the fame of which he says reached him
even at a i shall now bid you good morning he bowed formally
egerton good bye and not for all the wealth and influence you
possess nor even for the privilege of clerical toadeaters would i
change with you
so it was all up with me in a few minutes all my plans for getting
inside the shell of my brothers heart vainor rather there was
nothing inside to get at good bye to peace and love but i will have
action where were my wits that i did not go to india long ago instead
of loitering away the best years of my life in aimless frivolity oh
the irremediable past
in the bitterness of selfreproach i forgot egerton why should i
be angry with him he acted according to the dictates of his cold
nature quietness was torment and a couple of hours after the above
conversation i was steaming to london en route to my agent
breathless to be doing somethinganything
chapter x
adieu
london at the close of november can the force of human imagination
conceive anything half so gloomy and dispiriting and certainly the
dreary weeks i spent there at this period have ever ranked first in
my remembrance of wretchedness the damp drizzling foggy condition
of animate and inanimate naturethe deserted streets haunted by long
strings of decrepid placard bearers whose rheumatic forms seemed
bowed under the huge capitals setting forth mons julliens concerts
dhiver c my days were pretty equally divided between my lawyer
and army agent varied by a good deal of letter writing and a solitary
dinner at the desolate club towards the middle of this purgatorial
period the regiment i was soon to call mine no more got the route for
canterbury and burton like a trump as he was came up to town to
hear a fuller account of my troubles than a letter could give and to
see the most he could of me before i started to the land of military
promise he was a truehearted fellow and the sincere unpretending
interest with which he entered into my plansi will not say hopes
for god knows i felt little thendid me more real good and drew me
more out of myself than the most elaborate efforts at consolation could
have effected finally when just about to leave me one night after a
long talk over my affairs and half out of the room he observed you
know old fellow i have always been prudent and if a few hundred
pounds would be of any use to you i would be glad of a little higher
interestthey only pay two and a half at presentand the whole thing
might lie over until you get some prize money in india when i will be
down on you inexorably for the compound interest principal and all
now do not stir i know my way down we will talk it over tomorrow
he was away before i could say a word
come thought i as i turned to the fire it is worth while to bear
the crosses of this world of ours when it contains even one such
fellow as that to leaven the whole lump
yet not even to burton could i bear to talk of the bitter struggle
it cost me to part with kate vernon as little more than a common
acquaintance it was weakness in me to think of it and i am glad i
can record so much good of myself it was a source of sincere rejoicing
to me when i reflected that miss vernon at all events could not
suffer from the painful regret i felt gnawing my troubled spirit
i wrote to colonel vernon from london telling him shortly of
the reasons which rendered my exchange into a regiment in india
indispensable opening my mind to him as to a father concluding by
begging him to let me spend my last few days in england under his roof
as i wished to keep the visit to be a parting impression of home to
winter i also wrote less fully and lastly to gilpin this little
primitive group scarce five months known to me had wound itself into
my sympathies and now with the exception of burton from them alone
of all the variety of my acquaintance was it hard to part
i was beginning to feel puzzled at your long silence wrote the
colonel in reply you have fully explained and if the assurance of
an old soldiers perfect approbation has any value in your eyes accept
mine you will be truly welcome here whenever you can come give us a
days notice and if you have no objection to a diminutive crib and a
haunted chamber mrs otoole says we can keep you altogether under
our roof kate desires her kind remembrances she was delighted with
your letter which i hope i was not indiscreet in letting her see c
the kindly tone of this letter soothed me and made me long to be once
more among the quiet circle with whom my previous life had so little
fitted me to sympathise i hurried my preparations and stirred up my
agent so effectually that early in december the gazette announced
captain the hon boscawen egerton from the  light dragoons to be
captain in the  lancers vice john thomas robinson brown who
exchanges
the regiment had not been long in india and was stationed in the north
western provinces where i could have the best chance of seeing a
little service
a few final interviews with the military tailor a parting visit to
and dinner from my old corps who really seemed sorry to lose me my
heavy baggage dismissed to southampton to await the sailing of the
ship in which i was to go out and i was free to give my last week in
england to a and its attractions
i had reserved a curious old picture the painter unknown which
had been praised by judges and a louis quatorze snuffbox with an
exquisite miniature of la valliere in enamel from the general disposal
of my miscellaneous effects they were destined for winter and the
colonel tuppers proverbial philosophy i thought would not be
unacceptable to kate together with all the prettiest new music i could
collect and several oratorios in moyen age binding for gilpin and
mrs otoole could she be forgotten no i ransacked regent street
for the brightest of scarlet shawls while mindful of the occupation i
had so often watched mrs winter engaged in howel and james furnished
a handsome buhl knitting case with a turquoise button for her
acceptance
my preparations finished though not without a certain aching of the
heart i took my way for the last time to the old city of a yet
pleasure predominated over pain as i thought of a whole week with kate
vernon i had despatched a line to say i would be with them to dinner
on the following day and the speed of an express train did not suffice
for the impatience with which i longed to be once more surrounded with
the familiar faces now so endeared to me i felt jealous of every
moment curtailed from the short space of happiness i had so looked
forward to and i believe the driver of the cab that conveyed me from
the railway to the priory thought me insane so reiterated were my
injunctions to drive faster faster it was near six oclock when i
drove up to the wellknown arched gate a sharp clear evening the
breath of the panting horse showing like light smoke in the transparent
air i sprang out while the cabman was stamping his feet after
ringing and pushing the gate open with the familiarity of an old
friend nearly rushed into the arms of mrs otoole who was advancing
to open it
i could see the colonels venerable figure in the hall which was
lighted by a pretty antique lamp and behind him the drawingroom
door stood open showing the curtains snugly drawn and a ruddy glow
pervading the atmosphere of the room which bespoke a noble fire
somewhere
musha but yer welcome captin an are ye shut of the sickness
entirely theres the masther longing to spake to ye never mind the
portmanty give me a hoult of that carpet bag
welcome a thousand welcomes my dear egerton cried colonel vernon
you are in excellent time yet we were beginning to watch for you
we shook hands with intense cordiality and mine was scarcely released
when something cold and damp was thrust into it it was the fine old
hound seconding his masters greeting
from the moment i started to the present i have ceaselessly abused
railways stokers enginedrivers and all for not going the pace
more rapidly i really thought i should never be with you soon enough
it seems such an age since we met and i have done so much in the
interim said i as i followed him into the drawingroom there stood
kate in a distracting demitoilette of white muslin with some scarlet
ribbons admirably disposed and lighted up by the blaze of a noble fire
that looked welcome like every thing else
ah how glad i am to see you are come i thought you would go away
without paying us your promised visit it was so long delayed and
once more i held her fair soft hand once more i gazed into her clear
truthful eyes that looked up to mine with so much gladness through
their long sweeping lashes
go without paying my promised visit miss vernon was my only reply
but i suppose the tone in which it was spoken expressed how impossible
such an omission was to me for she said with a smile as she drew away
her hand i suppose then you would not have liked to leave us sans
adieu but grandpapa captain egerton has barely time to make his
toilet it is just six oclock
the colonel with old fashioned empressement lighted me to my
chamber a little darkpanelled cell with some rude remnants of carving
here and there and one small window sunk deep in the wall a cheerful
fire blazed in what had once been a wide chimney but which was now
walled up into reasonable dimensions
this is the oldest part of the house said my host we used it as
a sort of lumber room till kate and nurse decided on trying to make
it habitable for you we none of us liked the idea of despatching you
every night to an hotel at this time of the year particularly have
you every thing you want
i thought the priory cottage never looked so delightfully homelike
as in its winter aspect and the pleasant candlelight dinner
to the agreeability of which mrs otoole added largely joining
in the conversation with greater ease than ever pressing any
particularly well cooked dish as earnestly on me as if i too had
been her nursling cormac sat gravely by kate accepting the bits she
occasionally offered him with dignified condescension
on sundays and a few great occasions such as the present she said
with a smile cormac was admitted to the dining room but the drawing
room was forbidden ground to him he knew it quite well
we soon adjourned to the drawing room and as i stood on the hearth rug
sipping my tea and looking at kate and her grandfather sitting at
opposite sides of the table both so distinguished in their looks and
manners yet both so unlike the common herd of mere well bred people i
kept down the bitter sighs that oppressed my heart as the thought you
must leave them and for ever seemed to burn and fix itself indelibly
on my brain
after some enquiries about the winters and gilpin who i was sorry to
hear had not been so well miss vernon observed i still looked pale
and thin
you certainly suffered for your generous effort to save our poor
friend she added i can never forget your rushing back under the
tottering ruins and that awful crash she shuddered
yes indeed egerton you look a little haggard dont you feel
strong enquired the colonel
why you see colonel i have been a good deal cut up about all this
business and to say the truth i do not like leaving england
that must be because you are still suffering from the debility of
indisposition said miss vernon or such a lover of excitement as you
are would be enchanted at the idea of india and its tiger hunts and
cave temples with a possibility of shooting or being shot
so i would four or five months ago now i am paying dearly for
extravagance
do not be so severe on yourself few young men can quite resist
temptation said the colonel kindly
i wonder what is the pleasure of betting it seems very absurd said
miss vernon
how could you know anything about it enquired her grandfather
ah thin its the divils own divirsion observed mrs otoole who
was removing the tea things
our conversation on my affairs continued in the same friendly and
confidential tone for some time then the colonel dozed and i
approaching nearer to kates work table described my evening at
allerton with the deputation from the parent society she laughed a
good deal at my sketch of the rev mr black and said she thought she
remembered him at a then she told me how mr winter had painted
a chef doeuvrethe little landing place with its trees
elijah bush in his hairy cap cyclops and cormac and that mrs winter
and miss araminta cox had had a quarrel but that she had happily
reconciled them and lastly with much earnestness in her manner and
tenderness in her tones she spoke of gilpins failing health and
loneliness
i cannot tell you captain egerton how very fond he appears to be
of you more so even than gratitude can account for as if you had
many sympathies in common yet you are as unlike in character as in
appearance i am glad he likes you she concluded simply
all this gossip of her little world was told in a subdued tone not
to disturb her grandfather and so added to the sort of confidence
apparently existing between us
what an extraordinary mlange of feelings i experienced i was
within sight of paradise as it werei could almost grasp it but an
invisible though iron barrier held me back so i talked on quietly
wondering at my own selfcommand and sometimes when restoring the
scissors or a skein of worsted i had unconsciously abstracted from her
basket my hand would touch hers once on one of these occasions she
looked up and saidhow very cold you are do stir the fire and warm
yourself i do not know what i should have said or done had not the
colonel at that moment awoke up shocked at his want of politeness
then kate went to the piano and sang song after song in her rich
soft thrilling notes and depth of expression until i felt in a sort
of painful ecstasy which must in some way have been traceable on
my countenance for the colonel suddenly stopped his granddaughter
observing how fagged i looked
you must go to your bed egerton and dont hurry in the morning
yes said kate looking at me kindly as she rang for candles you
look quite knocked up im afraid i have kept you too long from your
rest
maybe he ought to have wather for his feet he looks like a ghost
said mrs otoole in an audible aside to her young lady
perhaps it might refresh you said the latter
oh i am as strong as a giant now said i thanks to your good care
mrs otoole and if i look like a ghost it will fit me the better for
the society in which you know i am to pass the night
holy mary captin agrah dont spake that away of the dead
good night said kate
    from the weird and woeful power
    of midnights awful hour
    may the holy cross preserve thee
    at thy need may heaven serve thee
after your benediction miss vernon i am equal to any ghostly
encounter good night
my first waking thought was the delightful certainty of meeting kate at
breakfast and my second that one day of my sojourn had already flown
with what terrible rapidity these precious last days made themselves
wings and fled away into the past i cannot dwell upon the memory of
them
i examined with great delight and loud eulogiums the really admirable
picture on which winter was now engaged and acknowledged that cyclops
was a firstrate subject
i have another here not quite finished either said he which
you may perhaps think equally interesting and he turned round a
watercolour drawing i started as it met my sight it was kate vernon
sitting as was her custom at the open window of the cottage her cheek
resting on her left hand showing the graceful contour of her throat
and her right playing as she was wont to do when lost in thought with
cormacs ear while the old hound sat gazing at her as though he would
fain ask what vision engrossed her fancy it was a most lovely picture
the lovelier for its admirable likeness to the original how well i
knew that pensive and abstracted air the large eyes gazing dreamily
into some imaginary world the delicate but rosy lips slightly apart
you almost expected to hear them breathe the gentle sigh with which
she used to rouse herself from her reverie and turn to tell you its
subject so truthfully and naturally oh winter i exclaimed can
love or money induce you to let me take the faintest sketch of this
most exquisite picture
he looked sharply at me no no most noble captain it was a labour
of love and ill not have my beautiful pupils lofty brow decking the
wall of a barrack room keep the portrait in your own heart it may
prove a talisman but i fear the colours will fade as fast as one of
turners most glowing pictures
i hardly heard him as i stood my eyes fixed on the face i was so soon
to lose as if i would stamp its lineaments indelibly on my memory he
went onwhat business would you have with miss vernons likeness
true true oh hard of heart yet with me it would be a sacred thing
no do not put it away yet oh skill in portrait painting is the only
talent really worth cultivating i wish to heaven i had it winter
in the whole category of human ills is there one can surpass the
wretchedness of saying good bye
yes regret when too late that you did not say it capitano mio 
meglio sdrucciolar co piedi che colla lingua
the kind little artist was enchanted with the picture i brought him it
was a monk kneeling before an altar on which the candles were burning
and the light and shade were skilfully disposed he shook my hand
repeatedly and plunged into a learned disquisition as to the probable
master by whom it was painted he immediately invited the whole party
at the priory to dine with him in order to discuss fully the important
question of placing my gift which he designated by the name of the
giver rather incongruously
i waited to give kate proverbial philosophy till i could find her
alone and returning one morning from a visit to gilpin i found the
colonel had disappeared on some behest and miss vernon in solitary
possession of the drawingroom she was working something in a frame
but the open piano proved she had been engaged in her favourite pursuit
i threw myself into the colonels chair and answered her enquiries for
gilpin then after a pause stood up and leaning against the mantel
piece said miss vernon i met with a book in london i thought would
suit you proverbial philosophy have you seen it i thought you
would like it
she stretched out her hand to receive the volume
is it for me oh thank you i have so much wished to have it i shall
read it with pleasure i am sure and give many a grateful thought to
the donor
that is more than i would presume to expect and i suspect the pains
or pleasures of memory will fall to my share
no it is those who stay at home who remember best new scenes bring
new thoughts but i wish captain egerton we could see you start with
better spirits on your travels
higher spirits how can you suppose i do not grudge every moment that
brings the hour of separation nearer
she looked up at me as i stood leaning moodily against the mantelpiece
but all men must some time or other go forth amongst strangers and
few seem to regret it as you do
not when they leave behind all they covet on earthnot when they must
go in silence and say good bye with a calm face and a breaking heart
oh cried miss vernon clasping her hands that is terrible god
comfort such a sorrow but at your age there is always hope you will
return and what are a few years to a true heart
i may return too late and
the door opened and most opportunely the colonel came in for kate was
beginning to look at me with a certain startled expression as if the
truth was dawning on her when accident not my own selfcommand saved
me from breaking through the line of conduct i had myself laid down
the next day was christmas day and i knelt once more beside kate
vernon in the old church and heard her rich sweet notes as she joined
in responses or breathed the amen and i felt the quiet absorbed
attention with which she joined in the service communicate something of
its earnestness to myself
mrs otoole came in after we returned from church to show herself in
her scarlet shawl
its a grand colour entirely said she as warm as your own heart
captin jewil an its the hard word to say good bye to ye sorra one
of me but the salt tears is in me eyes when i think iv it
gilpin and the winters dined with us that day we had a pleasant
cheerful dinner i was determined to enjoy myself if possible but it
would not do i was but seeming after all i felt each passing moment
was deepening the lines of my character no wonder that the strongest
exertion of my self command only sufficed to silence any expression
that might damp my companions mirth but could not enable me to add my
quota to the general stock my only consolation was to look at kates
smooth calm brow and thank heaven i had never attempted to raise any
feeling in her breast that could have resulted in the aching sadness
which oppressed my own she might have loved me for hers was too
loving a nature to be insensible of affection and a true and earnest
heart is always worth any womans acceptance and as i met her ready
unconcealed and sympathising glance that often and openly sought
mine i breathed a silent ejaculation god preserve her from sorrow
and suffering
we had a good deal of music much of it sacred and appropriate to the
day but before we separated kate sang the land of the stranger
it is little more than recitative but the expression with which she
sang it and her full clear honied notesoh how impossible to write
down in so many measured words the strong tide of mingled emotions
and passionate wishes which swept across my soul as i listened to that
voice
but i will not dwell any longer on these last sweet painful days now
even now writing in all the sobered calm of older years i find my pen
hurrying on in the vain effort to depict what language cannot convey
winter invited us to spend my last evening with him i would have
preferred far to have spent it uninterruptedly at the priory but
it was not so at the little supper which as usual closed the
entertainment our good host proposed my health as follows
i know youll agree that the toast im about to give is one we can all
drink with unalloyed satisfaction i give you the health of one who has
passed through the fire of fashion and frivolity and yet kept a corner
of his heart for truth and reality and preserved enough of good taste
to turn from a clique of which i may fairly say o t ha ingannato o
ingannar ti vuole to the more tangible world of action one to whom
we owe the existence of a valued friend carramba gilpin it would
have been all over with you but for him in a word i give you fred
egerton
the toast was most enthusiastically received even miss vernon clapped
her hands approvingly i made an appropriate acknowledgment and soon
after apropos to my new regiment kate turned to me and said by
the bye i always forgot to tell you nurse has a son in the 26th
lancers pray do not forget to give denis otoole opportunities of
distinguishing himself i have written a letter for her to him which i
will give you tomorrow
and the parting moment came fast too fast
well good bye my dear egerton said the colonel grasping my hand
in both of his which shook a little in all human probability i shall
never see you more take an old mans blessing with you
i can never forget the happy days i have spent with you my dear sir
i will write from bombayif i have time from alexandria do not let
me quite escape your memory
i took kates hand i ventured to hold it in both of minei could
utter no word but gazed long and silently into her sweet calm eyes
she looked pale but seemed perfectly composed
god bless you captain egerton and make you happy she said in a
somewhat unsteady voice
i turned and left the room without a word
christ shield ye from harm captin jewil sobbed mrs otoole dont
be downhearted entirely sure theres many a prayer goes wid ye an
the coldest hour is the hour before daydawn holy mary keep ye an
dont forget the letther for me poor boy
nurse dear nurse goodbye ill take care of your son
and my last glimpse of the priory gate showed me mrs otoole with her
apron to her eyes and cormac looking uneasily after me
another day and i stood at the stern of the steamer which was rapidly
cleaving the smooth waters straining my eyes after the quickly
vanishing land my arms folded tightly on my chest as if to press
down the bitterness that swelled my heart into the stern stillness
of manful endurance all the events of the last four months even to
their minuti stood clear before me and as the distant outline of
the land i was leavingprobably for everfaded from my sight and i
felt the keen pang that in leaving it i left my all which has rent
many a heart kate vernons words flashed back upon my memoryi am
quite sure that a stedfast resignation to what you have brought upon
yourself an unmurmuring struggle to retrieve will work its own cure
and i slowly turned to go below feeling how great was the change
wrought in me since life presented no deeper ill than an unlucky change
of quarters
