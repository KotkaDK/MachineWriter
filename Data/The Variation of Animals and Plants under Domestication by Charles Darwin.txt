charles darwin wrote on the origin of species in a hurry he had it
was true been formulating his ideas and arguments for several
decadessince his roundtheworld beagle voyage of 18311836 these
ideas and arguments had been slow to take definitive shape darwin had
nurtured and reworked them amassing evidence for what he projected to
be a weighty magnum opus although he had shared his developing
evolutionary speculations with his closest professional colleagues
darwin was reluctant to publish them on several grounds he was aware
that his theory of evolution by natural selection or descent with
modification was complex that it rested on vast but not
incontrovertible evidence and that the chain of his reasoning was not
uniformly strong further his conclusions challenged not only the
scientific assumptions of many fellow specialists but also the
theological convictions of a much wider circle of fellow citizens
in 1859 darwin did not feel quite ready to expose his cherished theory
to the harsh light of public scrutiny in the introduction to the
origin he confessed that although his work on evolution by natural
selection was nearly finished he would need two or three more years
to complete it the  origin was he suggested merely a stopgap a
schematic abstract of a much longer and more fully supported treatise
yet to come he had been moved to preview his labors in this way he
explained because his health was far from strong and perhaps more
importantly because alfred russel wallace a younger naturalist
working in isolation in southeast asia had sent a paper to the linnean
society of london in which he arrived at almost exactly the same
general conclusions that i have on the origin of species if darwin
had not gone public with his theory at this point he would have risked
losing credit for the work of many years
as its reception showed immediately and has continued to show the
origin benefited from the succinctness imposed by circumstances
darwin himself may have appreciated this point at any rate he never
produced the massive treatise although he repeatedly issued revised
editions of the  origin but he did not abandon his intention to
buttress his initial schematic presentation with additional evidence
in the course of the next two decades he published several fulllength
elaborations of topics summarily discussed in the origin the
variation of animals and plants under domestication the descent of
man and selection in relation to sex and the expression of the
emotions in man and animals in addition to fleshing out the origin
these subsequent studies bolstered its arguments and responded to
questions raised by critical readers especially pragmatic questions
about the way that descent with modification actually operated
in the variation of animals and plants under domestication which
appeared first in 1868 and in a revised edition in 1875 darwin
developed a theme to which he had accorded great rhetorical and
evidentiary significance he had begun the  origin with a description
of artificial selection as practiced by farmers stock breeders and
pet fanciers thus using a reassuringly homely exampleone recognizable
by the general public as well as by members of the scientific
communityto introduce the most innovative component of his
evolutionary theory in addition domesticated animals and plants
because they were numerous and available for constant observation
provided a readily available body of evidence
reassuring as it was the analogy between natural and artificial
selection was far from perfect the point of darwins analogy was to
make the idea of natural selection seem plausible by characterizing it
as a grander version of a wellknown process while emphasizing its
efficiency and shaping power he noted for example that some of the
prize birds bred by london pigeon fanciers diverged so strikingly in
size plumage beak shape flying technique vocalizations bone
structure and many other attributes that if they had been presented
to an ornithologist as wild specimens they would unquestionably have
been considered to represent distinct species perhaps even distinct
genera darwin argued that if the relatively brief and constrained
selective efforts of human breeders had produced such impressive
results it was likely that the more protracted and thoroughgoing
efforts of nature would work still more efficaciously
but as darwin acknowledged there were some fairly obvious reasons why
the two processes might diverge the superior power of natural
selectionman can act only on external and visible characters nature
   can act on    the whole machinery of life man selects only
for his own good nature only for that of the being which she tends
origin chap 5might constitute a difference of kind rather than
of degree as might the much greater stretches of time available for
natural selection further although the mechanism of the two processes
appeared superficially similar their outcomes tended to be rather
different natural selection produced a constantly increasing and
diversifying variety of forms it never reversed or exactly repeated
itself anyone familiar with artificial selection would have realized
that although new breeds were constantly being developed and although
neither improved wheat nor improved cattle showed any tendency to
revert to the condition of their aboriginal wild ancestors the strains
produced by human selection were neither as prolific nor as durable as
those produced by nature indeed the animals and plants celebrated as
the noblest achievements of the breeders art were especially liable to
delicacy and infertility highly bred strains long isolated from
others of their species to preserve their genealogical purity far from
serving as a springboard for further variation often had to be
revivified with infusions of lessrarefied blood yet any relaxation of
reproductive boundaries threatened subsidence into the common run of
conspecifics
darwin firmly connected variation to the origin by devoting its
introduction to an overview of his theory of evolution by natural
selection in particular the two volumes of variation cumbersomely
organized and packed with zoological and botanical detail addressed
some of the difficulties inherent in the attractive but paradoxical
analogy between natural selection and artificial selection for
selection of any sort to operate diversity already had to exist with
wild populations living under natural conditions however diversity
was difficult to discern it was widely believed that a heightened
propensity to vary at least in ways obvious to human observers was
one of the few general characteristics that differentiated domestic
animals as a group from their wild relatives this point was
conventionally illustrated with reference to coat color and design
american bison for example were on the whole brown and all
burchells zebras shared similar black and white stripes a single herd
of either bos tauras or equus caballus domestic cattle or horses
on the other hand could display colors ranging from white through
yellow red and brown to black as well as a variety of spotted and
blotched patterns
in order to demonstrate that such populations spontaneously produced
sufficient variation to support artificial selection darwin devoted
most of the first volume of  variation to a speciesbyspecies survey
of domesticated plants and animals he began with the dog the breeds
of which differed so greatly in size shape disposition talents and
every other characteristic that darwin attributed its exemplary
plasticity to its derivation from several different species of wild
canines domestic cats on the other hand differed relatively little
from one another at least their variation tended to be individual
rather than consolidated into breeds darwin attributed this to the
minimal influence exerted by cat owners over the mating behavior of
their animals so that alone among fully domesticated animals cats
could not be said to have undergone a genuine process of artificial
selection
farmyard ungulates however had all proved more susceptible to human
manipulation whether through the gradual enhancement of inherent
tendencies such as the relatively early maturation that distinguished
shorthorn cattle or through the preservation of spontaneously arising
monstrosities such as the short broad foreheads and protruding lower
jaws of the niata cattle of south america the bulldogs of the bovine
world among animals fancy pigeons with their short generations
devoted breeders and lack of any pragmatic constraints on their
extravagant deformations provided darwin with his most abundant
material he allotted less space to his survey of domesticated plants
although with the exception of trees they tended to he much shorter
lived and more variable even than pigeons for example as darwin
pointed out a single longcultivated speciesbrassica oleracea the
ordinary cabbagehad given rise to strains as distinctive as brussels
sprouts cauliflower broccoli and kohlrabi
darwin crammed in so much information of this sort that in order to
confine variation to two volumes of manageable size less crucial
evidence was relegated to a smaller typeface and so compendious was
his survey of domesticates that he felt constrained to deny that it was
intended to he an exhaustive catalog after all many such catalogs
devoted merely to the accumulation of species or breedspecific data
existed already darwin cited them generously in his footnotes the
material included in variation had been chosen to fulfill a more
focused argumentative purpose darwins theory of descent with
modification required something further than the simple demonstration
that abundant variation existed among domesticated animals and plants
the accumulated experience of naturalists and breeders offered no clear
explanation of the causes of variation indeed no consensus existed on
this issue variation under domestication was frequently attributed to
accidental external influences especially climate and food but
environmentally induced variation was not of much use to darwin
instead he sought evidence not only that the tendency to vary was
inherent in domesticated animals and plants but also that specific
variations were inherited
as a result darwins wealth of detail in  variation
disproportionately featured strongas well as puzzling problematic or
even questionableversions of inheritance in addition to the
unsurprising if still not completely understood likelihood that
children would resemble their parents for example he devoted an
entire chapter to what he termed atavism or reversionthat is the
tendency for offspring to manifest traits apparently derived from their
grandparents collateral relations or even remote ancestors rather
than from their mothers or their fathers the existence of this
tendency in the lineages of individuals he argued incontrovertibly
demonstrated the fact of heritability and in an extended or
exaggerated version it also demonstrated evolutionary relations between
species thus many breeds of domesticated chickens revealed their
ultimate ancestry by producing occasional sports with the red and
orange plumage of the original callus bankiva or jungle fowl
like many other naturalists of his time darwin was receptive to the
idea of telegony also known as the influence of the previous sire
he retailed the famous story of lord mortons mare a chestnut of
seveneighths arabian blood whose first foal had been sired by a
quagga a nowextinct relative of the zebra her owner was attempting
to domesticate it was not surprising that the young hybrid faintly
echoed his fathers stripes but the fact that her next two foals both
sired by a black arabian horse also seemed to resemble the quagga in
this regard was more remarkable darwin pointed out that atavism
offered one possible explanation of this phenomenoninfant horses and
donkeys often showed evanescent striping which might indicate the
pattern of their ancient shared progenitorbut he was also drawn to the
notion that the first male to impregnate a female left some permanent
heritable trace of himself behind he offered analogous examples from
the vegetable kingdom where the pollen of related varieties of apples
corn or orchids could not only produce hybrid offspring but
occasionally also physically alter the reproductive tract of the
female plants also and more regularly demonstrated a kind of
variability that could arise independently of sexual reproduction such
as bud variation whereby what darwin called a monstrosity might
appear on a single branch or flower and then be transmitted sexually
or asexually to future generations
as he documented the profusion of variation among domesticated animals
and plants and the tendency of organisms to transmit these variations
down the generations darwin did more than demonstrate that there was
ample grist for the mill of natural selection he also addressed the
most serious weakness in the argument of the origin despite the
incompleteness of the fossil record plenty of evidence suggested that
evolution had taken place indeed the idea of evolution had been
current in one form or another for a century before 1859 darwins
explanation of the way that natural selection should operate was also
widely persuasive the competitive metaphors with which he
characterized it especially the struggle for life prominently
featured in the origins subtitle fit well with victorian
understandings about how things worked in the human arenas of industry
commerce and geopolitics there was however a problem that troubled
those inclined to sympathize with darwins reasoning as well as those
inclined to reject it the efficacy of natural selection like that of
artificial selection depended on the inheritance of particular traits
but before the modern understanding of genetics became available no
satisfactory mechanism had been adduced to explain this phenomenon no
consensus yet existed about the way that sexual reproduction worked so
there was also disagreement about which characteristics were inherited
and which were the result of environment and what could he contributed
by the male as opposed to the female parent let alone why offspring
sometimes resembled a grandparent or some more distant relative rather
than their parents the special difficulty of accounting for the sudden
emergence of monstrosities or even less dramatically novel traits led
darwin in later editions of the origin as well as in variation to
become increasingly receptive to the notion that characteristics
acquired by one generation might he inherited by the next
in the penultimate chapter of variation darwin attempted to
strengthen the weak link in his chain of argument by proposing a
mechanism for inheritance he called his theory pangenesis and he
claimed that it explained not only ordinary inheritancethe influence
of parents on their childrenbut also reversion telegony the
regeneration of amputated limbs in some kinds of animals the
inheritance of acquired characteristics and the relationship between
sexual and asexual modes of reproduction and inheritance the operation
of pangenesis depended on the posited existence of unobservable units
that darwin called gemmules tiny granules that were thrown off by
individual cells and then circulated through the body they had
however an affinity for each other which led to their aggregation in
the reproductive organs or in parthenogenetic buds they could remain
latent for years until an organism reached a certain stage of
development or for generations until they encountered other gemmules
to which they bore some special relationship in this way a
longdormant greatgrandparental gemmule might suddenly manifest itself
in a child since gemmules could he altered by environmental
influences they could convert acquired characteristics into the stuff
of heredity and since they were vulnerable to error they could
occasionally make mistakes causing organs such as limbs or tails or
even heads to develop in inappropriate numbers or in the wrong places
it has doubtless been fortunate for darwins reputation that his theory
of pangenesis is not as well remembered as his theory of evolution by
natural selection as vague in detail as it was ambitious and
comprehensive in scope it was unpersuasive at the time and has since
been proven completely wrong but like variation as a whole which
similarly illustrated the limitations of its author as well as his
strengths pangenesis does not therefore lack interest or significance
despite recent excellent and wellappreciated studies of his entire
life and extended oeuvre janet browne charles darwin voyaging
new york knopf 1995 and adrian desmond and james moore darwin
london michael joseph 1991 darwin is known primarily as the author
of the origin which is unrepresentative in its economy of structure
argument and evidence as well as on account of its historical
notoriety its enforced streamlining has helped to preserve the
origins accessibility but its relative paucity of examples was
particularly uncharacteristic of darwin variation with its
accumulation of evidence about everything from the webbing between
dogs toes to the weight of gooseberries was much more typical in
addition it placed darwin firmlyindeed irretrievablywithin his
time rather than in an achronological limbo reserved for intellectual
heroes as a graduate student from the peoples republic of china told
me several years ago after having participated in a seminar that read
excerpts from variation and the expression of the emotions if the
leaders of his government knew that darwin had written such books he
would not be officially admired
in science as in politics the victors tend to write the history books
as a result the record of the past is edited intentionally or
unintentionally so that it focuses mainly on the precursors of
contemporary orthodoxy such a focus may accurately represent the
genealogy of modem ideas but it almost inevitably misrepresents the
historical experience of their progenitors viewed without the benefit
of hindsight the marketplace of victorian ideas seemed much more
competitive than it does to us even the powerful persuasive and
ultimately triumphant theory of evolution by natural selection required
not only defense but repeated buttressing and revision  variation
showed darwin hard at work on this rearguard action using the
materials he had at handfor the most part homely details about the
domesticated animals and plants with which his audience was most
familiar his information was gleaned from the observations of
fanciers breeders and amateur naturalists as well as from the
treatises of those on the cutting edge of zoology and botany as
hindsight narrows the historical spotlight it imposes its own sense of
hierarchy on the preoccupations of the past but darwin was interested
in all of these topics valued all of these sources and belonged to a
greater or lesser extent to all of these communities
the author of variation was a victorian country gentleman a lover of
dogs and horses a breeder of pigeons and peas he was also and
equally the author of on the origin of species
preface to the second edition
during the seven years which have elapsed since the publication in 1868
of the first edition of this work i have continued to attend to the
same subjects as far as lay in my power and i have thus accumulated a
large body of additional facts chiefly through the kindness of many
correspondents of these facts i have been able here to use only those
which seemed to me the more important i have omitted some statements
and corrected some errors the discovery of which i owe to my
reviewers many additional references have been given the eleventh
chapter and that on pangenesis are those which have been most
altered parts having been remodelled but i will give a list of the
more important alterations for the sake of those who may possess the

introduction
the object of this work is not to describe all the many races of
animals which have been domesticated by man and of the plants which
have been cultivated by him even if i possessed the requisite
knowledge so gigantic an undertaking would be here superfluous it is
my intention to give under the head of each species only such facts as
i have been able to collect or observe showing the amount and nature
of the changes which animals and plants have undergone whilst under
mans dominion or which bear on the general principles of variation
in one case alone namely in that of the domestic pigeon i will
describe fully all the chief races their history the amount and
nature of their differences and the probable steps by which they have
been formed i have selected this case because as we shall hereafter
see the materials are better than in any other and one case fully
described will in fact illustrate all others but i shall also describe
domesticated rabbits fowls and ducks with considerable fulness
the subjects discussed in this volume are so connected that it is not a
little difficult to decide how they can be best arranged i have
determined in the first part to give under the heads of the various
animals and plants a large body of facts some of which may at first
appear but little related to our subject and to devote the latter part
to general discussions whenever i have found it necessary to give
numerous details in support of any proposition or conclusion small
type has been used the reader will i think find this plan a
convenience for if he does not doubt the conclusion or care about the
details he can easily pass them over yet i may be permitted to say
that some of the discussions thus printed deserve attention at least
from the professed naturalist
it may be useful to those who have read nothing about natural
selection if i here give a brief sketch of the whole subject and of
its bearing on the origin of species1 this is the more desirable as
it is impossible in the present work to avoid many allusions to
questions which will be fully discussed in future volumes
from a remote period in all parts of the world man has subjected many
animals and plants to domestication or culture man has no power of
altering the absolute conditions of life he cannot change the climate
of any country he adds no new element to the soil but he can remove
an animal or plant from one climate or soil to another and give it
food on which it did not subsist in its natural state it is an error
to speak of man tampering with nature and causing variability if a
man drops a piece of iron into sulphuric acid it cannot be said
strictly that he makes the sulphate of iron he only allows their
elective affinities to come into play if organic beings had not
possessed an inherent tendency to vary man could have done nothing2
he unintentionally exposes his animals and plants to various conditions
of life and variability supervenes which he cannot even prevent or
check consider the simple case of a plant which has been cultivated
during a long time in its native country and which consequently has
not been subjected to any change of climate it has been protected to a
certain extent from the competing roots of plants of other kinds it
has generally been grown in manured soil but probably not richer than
that of many an alluvial flat and lastly it has been exposed to
changes in its conditions being grown sometimes in one district and
sometimes in another in different soils under such circumstances
scarcely a plant can be named though cultivated in the rudest manner
which has not given birth to several varieties it can hardly be
maintained that during the many changes which this earth has undergone
and during the natural migrations of plants from one land or island to
another tenanted by different species that such plants will not often
have been subjected to changes in their conditions analogous to those
which almost inevitably cause cultivated plants to vary no doubt man
selects varying individuals sows their seeds and again selects their
varying offspring but the initial variation on which man works and
without which he can do nothing is caused by slight changes in the
conditions of life which must often have occurred under nature man
therefore may be said to have been trying an experiment on a gigantic
scale and it is an experiment which nature during the long lapse of
time has incessantly tried hence it follows that the principles of
domestication are important for us the main result is that organic
beings thus treated have varied largely and the variations have been
inherited this has apparently been one chief cause of the belief long
held by some few naturalists that species in a state of nature undergo
change
i shall in this volume treat as fully as my materials permit the
whole subject of variation under domestication we may thus hope to
obtain some light little though it be on the causes of
variabilityon the laws which govern it such as the direct action of
climate and food the effects of use and disuse and of correlation of
growthand on the amount of change to which domesticated organisms are
liable we shall learn something of the laws of inheritance of the
effects of crossing different breeds and on that sterility which often
supervenes when organic beings are removed from their natural
conditions of life and likewise when they are too closely interbred
during this investigation we shall see that the principle of selection
is highly important although man does not cause variability and cannot
even prevent it he can select preserve and accumulate the variations
given to him by the hand of nature almost in any way which he chooses
and thus he can certainly produce a great result selection may be
followed either methodically and intentionally or unconsciously and
unintentionally man may select and preserve each successive variation
with the distinct intention of improving and altering a breed in
accordance with a preconceived idea and by thus adding up variations
often so slight as to be imperceptible by an uneducated eye he has
effected wonderful changes and improvements it can also be clearly
shown that man without any intention or thought of improving the
breed by preserving in each successive generation the individuals
which he prizes most and by destroying the worthless individuals
slowly though surely induces great changes as the will of man thus
comes into play we can understand how it is that domesticated breeds
show adaptation to his wants and pleasures we can further understand
how it is that domestic races of animals and cultivated races of plants
often exhibit an abnormal character as compared with natural species
for they have been modified not for their own benefit but for that of
man
in another work i shall discuss if time and health permit the
variability of organic beings in a state of nature namely the
individual differences presented by animals and plants and those
slightly greater and generally inherited differences which are ranked
by naturalists as varieties or geographical races we shall see how
difficult or rather how impossible it often is to distinguish between
races and subspecies as the less wellmarked forms have sometimes
been denominated and again between subspecies and true species i
shall further attempt to show that it is the common and widely ranging
or as they may be called the dominant species which most frequently
vary and that it is the large and flourishing genera which include the
greatest number of varying species varieties as we shall see may
justly be called incipient species
but it may be urged granting that organic beings in a state of nature
present some varietiesthat their organisation is in some slight
degree plastic granting that many animals and plants have varied
greatly under domestication and that man by his power of selection has
gone on accumulating such variations until he has made strongly marked
and firmly inherited races granting all this how it may be asked
have species arisen in a state of nature the differences between
natural varieties are slight whereas the differences are considerable
between the species of the same genus and great between the species of
distinct genera how do these lesser differences become augmented into
the greater difference how do varieties or as i have called them
incipient species become converted into true and welldefined species
how has each new species been adapted to the surrounding physical
conditions and to the other forms of life on which it in any way
depends we see on every side of us innumerable adaptations and
contrivances which have justly excited the highest admiration of every
observer there is for instance a fly cecidomyia3 which deposits
its eggs within the stamens of a scrophularia and secretes a poison
which produces a gall on which the larva feeds but there is another
insect misocampus which deposits its eggs within the body of the
larva within the gall and is thus nourished by its living prey so
that here a hymenopterous insect depends on a dipterous insect and
this depends on its power of producing a monstrous growth in a
particular organ of a particular plant so it is in a more or less
plainly marked manner in thousands and tens of thousands of cases
with the lowest as well as with the highest productions of nature
this problem of the conversion of varieties into speciesthat is the
augmentation of the slight differences characteristic of varieties into
the greater differences characteristic of species and genera including
the admirable adaptations of each being to its complex organic and
inorganic conditions of lifehas been briefly treated in my origin of
species it was there shown that all organic beings without
exception tend to increase at so high a ratio that no district no
station not even the whole surface of the land or the whole ocean
would hold the progeny of a single pair after a certain number of
generations the inevitable result is an everrecurrent struggle for
existence it has truly been said that all nature is at war the
strongest ultimately prevail the weakest fail and we well know that
myriads of forms have disappeared from the face of the earth if then
organic beings in a state of nature vary even in a slight degree owing
to changes in the surrounding conditions of which we have abundant
geological evidence or from any other cause if in the long course of
ages inheritable variations ever arise in any way advantageous to any
being under its excessively complex and changing relations of life and
it would be a strange fact if beneficial variations did never arise
seeing how many have arisen which man has taken advantage of for his
own profit or pleasure if then these contingencies ever occur and i
do not see how the probability of their occurrence can be doubted then
the severe and oftenrecurrent struggle for existence will determine
that those variations however slight which are favourable shall be
preserved or selected and those which are unfavourable shall be
destroyed
this preservation during the battle for life of varieties which
possess any advantage in structure constitution or instinct i have
called natural selection and mr herbert spencer has well expressed
the same idea by the survival of the fittest the term natural
selection is in some respects a bad one as it seems to imply
conscious choice but this will be disregarded after a little
familiarity no one objects to chemists speaking of elective
affinity and certainly an acid has no more choice in combining with a
base than the conditions of life have in determining whether or not a
new form be selected or preserved the term is so far a good one as it
brings into connection the production of domestic races by mans power
of selection and the natural preservation of varieties and species in
a state of nature for brevity sake i sometimes speak of natural
selection as an intelligent powerin the same way as astronomers speak
of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets or
as agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of
selection in the one case as in the other selection does nothing
without variability and this depends in some manner on the action of
the surrounding circumstances on the organism i have also often
personified the word nature for i have found it difficult to avoid
this ambiguity but i mean by nature only the aggregate action and
product of many natural lawsand by laws only the ascertained sequence
of events
it has been shown from many facts that the largest amount of life can
be supported on each area by great diversification or divergence in
the structure and constitution of its inhabitants we have also seen
that the continued production of new forms through natural selection
which implies that each new variety has some advantage over others
inevitably leads to the extermination of the older and less improved
forms these latter are almost necessarily intermediate in structure
as well as in descent between the lastproduced forms and their
original parentspecies now if we suppose a species to produce two or
more varieties and these in the course of time to produce other
varieties the principal of good being derived from diversification of
structure will generally lead to the preservation of the most divergent
varieties thus the lesser differences characteristic of varieties come
to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species
and by the extermination of the older intermediate forms new species
end by being distinctly defined objects thus also we shall see how
it is that organic beings can be classed by what is called a natural
method in distinct groupsspecies under genera and genera under
families
as all the inhabitants of each country may be said owing to their high
rate of reproduction to be striving to increase in numbers as each
form comes into competition with many other forms in the struggle for
lifefor destroy any one and its place will be seized by others as
every part of the organisation occasionally varies in some slight
degree and as natural selection acts exclusively by the preservation
of variations which are advantageous under the excessively complex
conditions to which each being is exposed no limit exists to the
number singularity and perfection of the contrivances and
coadaptations which may thus be produced an animal or a plant may
thus slowly become related in its structure and habits in the most
intricate manner to many other animals and plants and to the physical
conditions of its home variations in the organisation will in some
cases be aided by habit or by the use and disuse of parts and they
will be governed by the direct action of the surrounding physical
conditions and by correlation of growth
on the principles here briefly sketched out there is no innate or
necessary tendency in each being to its own advancement in the scale of
organisation we are almost compelled to look at the specialisation or
differentiation of parts or organs for different functions as the best
or even sole standard of advancement for by such division of labour
each function of body and mind is better performed and as natural
selection acts exclusively through the preservation of profitable
modifications of structure and as the conditions of life in each area
generally become more and more complex from the increasing number of
different forms which inhabit it and from most of these forms acquiring
a more and more perfect structure we may confidently believe that on
the whole organisation advances nevertheless a very simple form
fitted for very simple conditions of life might remain for indefinite
ages unaltered or unimproved for what would it profit an infusorial
animalcule for instance or an intestinal worm to become highly
organised members of a high group might even become and this
apparently has often occurred fitted for simpler conditions of life
and in this case natural selection would tend to simplify or degrade
the organisation for complicated mechanism for simple actions would be
useless or even disadvantageous
the arguments opposed to the theory of natural selection have been
discussed in my origin of species as far as the size of that work
permitted under the following heads the difficulty in understanding
how very simple organs have been converted by small and graduated steps
into highly perfect and complex organs the marvellous facts of
instinct the whole question of hybridity and lastly the absence in
our known geological formations of innumerable links connecting all
allied species although some of these difficulties are of great
weight we shall see that many of them are explicable on the theory of
natural selection and are otherwise inexplicable
in scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypothesis
and if it explains various large and independent classes of facts it
rises to the rank of a wellgrounded theory the undulations of the
ether and even its existence are hypothetical yet every one now admits
the undulatory theory of light the principle of natural selection may
be looked at as a mere hypothesis but rendered in some degree probable
by what we positively know of the variability of organic beings in a
state of natureby what we positively know of the struggle for
existence and the consequent almost inevitable preservation of
favourable variationsand from the analogical formation of domestic
races now this hypothesis may be testedand this seems to me the only
fair and legitimate manner of considering the whole questionby trying
whether it explains several large and independent classes of facts
such as the geological succession of organic beings their distribution
in past and present times and their mutual affinities and homologies
if the principle of natural selection does explain these and other
large bodies of facts it ought to be received on the ordinary view of
each species having been independently created we gain no scientific
explanation of any one of these facts we can only say that it has so
pleased the creator to command that the past and present inhabitants of
the world should appear in a certain order and in certain areas that
he has impressed on them the most extraordinary resemblances and has
classed them in groups subordinate to groups but by such statements we
gain no new knowledge we do not connect together facts and laws we
explain nothing
it was the consideration of such large groups of facts as these which
first led me to take up the present subject when i visited during the
voyage of hms beagle the galapagos archipelago situated in the
pacific ocean about 500 miles from south america i found myself
surrounded by peculiar species of birds reptiles and plants existing
nowhere else in the world yet they nearly all bore an american stamp
in the song of the mockingthrush in the harsh cry of the
carrionhawk in the great candlesticklike opuntias i clearly
perceived the neighbourhood of america though the islands were
separated by so many miles of ocean from the mainland and differed
much in their geological constitution and climate still more
surprising was the fact that most of the inhabitants of each separate
island in this small archipelago were specifically different though
most closely related to each other the archipelago with its
innumerable craters and bare streams of lava appeared to be of recent
origin and thus i fancied myself brought near to the very act of
creation i often asked myself how these many peculiar animals and
plants had been produced the simplest answer seemed to be that the
inhabitants of the several islands had descended from each other
undergoing modification in the course of their descent and that all
the inhabitants of the archipelago were descended from those of the
nearest land namely america whence colonists would naturally have
been derived but it long remained to me an inexplicable problem how
the necessary degree of modification could have been effected and it
would have thus remained for ever had i not studied domestic
productions and thus acquired a just idea of the power of selection
as soon as i had fully realised this idea i saw on reading malthus on
population that natural selection was the inevitable result of the
rapid increase of all organic beings for i was prepared to appreciate
the struggle for existence by having long studied the habits of
animals
before visiting the galapagos i had collected many animals whilst
travelling from north to south on both sides of america and
everywhere under conditions of life as different as it is possible to
conceive american forms were met withspecies replacing species of the
same peculiar genera thus it was when the cordilleras were ascended
or the thick tropical forests penetrated or the fresh waters of
america searched subsequently i visited other countries which in all
their conditions of life were incomparably more like parts of south
america than the different parts of that continent are to each other
yet in these countries as in australia or southern africa the
traveller cannot fail to be struck with the entire difference of their
productions again the reflection was forced on me that community of
descent from the early inhabitants of south america would alone explain
the wide prevalence of american types throughout that immense area
to exhume with ones own hands the bones of extinct and gigantic
quadrupeds brings the whole question of the succession of species
vividly before ones mind and i found in south america great pieces of
tesselated armour exactly like but on a magnificent scale that
covering the pigmy armadillo i had found great teeth like those of the
living sloth and bones like those of the cavy an analogous succession
of allied forms had been previously observed in australia here then we
see the prevalence as if by descent in time as in space of the same
types in the same areas and in neither the case does the similarity of
the conditions by any means seem sufficient to account for the
similarity of the forms of life it is notorious that the fossil
remains of closely consecutive formations are closely allied in
structure and we can at once understand the fact if they are closely
allied by descent the succession of the many distinct species of the
same genus throughout the long series of geological formations seems to
have been unbroken or continuous new species come in gradually one by
one ancient and extinct forms of life are often intermediate in
character like the words of a dead language with respect to its
several offshoots or living tongues all these facts seemed to me to
point to descent with modification as the means of production of new
species
the innumerable past and present inhabitants of the world are connected
together by the most singular and complex affinities and can be
classed in groups under groups in the same manner as varieties can be
classed under species and subvarieties under varieties but with much
higher grades of difference these complex affinities and the rules for
classification receive a rational explanation on the theory of
descent combined with the principle of natural selection which
entails divergence of character and the extinction of intermediate
forms how inexplicable is the similar pattern of the hand of a man
the foot of a dog the wing of a bat the flipper of a seal on the
doctrine of independent acts of creation how simply explained on the
principle of the natural selection of successive slight variations in
the diverging descendants from a single progenitor so it is with
certain parts or organs in the same individual animal or plant for
instance the jaws and legs of a crab or the petals stamens and
pistils of a flower during the many changes to which in the course of
time organic beings have been subjected certain organs or parts have
occasionally become at first of little use and ultimately superfluous
and the retention of such parts in a rudimentary and useless condition
is intelligible on the theory of descent it can be shown that
modifications of structure are generally inherited by the offspring at
the same age at which each successive variation appeared in the
parents it can further be shown that variations do not commonly
supervene at a very early period of embryonic growth and on these two
principles we can understand that most wonderful fact in the whole
circuit of natural history namely the close similarity of the embryos
within the same great classfor instance those of mammals birds
reptiles and fish
it is the consideration and explanation of such facts as these which
has convinced me that the theory of descent with modification by means
of natural selection is in the main true these facts have as yet
received no explanation on the theory of independent creation they
cannot be grouped together under one point of view but each has to be
considered as an ultimate fact as the first origin of life on this
earth as well as the continued life of each individual is at present
quite beyond the scope of science i do not wish to lay much stress on
the greater simplicity of the view of a few forms or of only one form
having been originally created instead of innumerable miraculous
creations having been necessary at innumerable periods though this
more simple view accords well with maupertuiss philosophical axiom of
least action
in considering how far the theory of natural selection may be extended
that is in determining from how many progenitors the inhabitants of
the world have descendedwe may conclude that at least all the members
of the same class have descended from a single ancestor a number of
organic beings are included in the same class because they present
independently of their habits of life the same fundamental type of
structure and because they graduate into each other moreover members
of the same class can in most cases be shown to be closely alike at an
early embryonic age these facts can be explained on the belief of
their descent from a common form therefore it may be safely admitted
that all the members of the same class are descended from one
progenitor but as the members of quite distinct classes have something
in common in structure and much in common in constitution analogy
would lead us one step further and to infer as probable that all
living creatures are descended from a single prototype
i hope that the reader will pause before coming to any final and
hostile conclusion on the theory of natural selection the reader may
consult my origin of species for a general sketch of the whole
subject but in that work he has to take many statements on trust in
considering the theory of natural selection he will assuredly meet
with weighty difficulties but these difficulties relate chiefly to
subjectssuch as the degree of perfection of the geological record the
means of distribution the possibility of transitions in organs
etcon which we are confessedly ignorant nor do we know how ignorant
we are if we are much more ignorant than is generally supposed most
of these difficulties wholly disappear let the reader reflect on the
difficulty of looking at whole classes of facts from a new point of
view let him observe how slowly but surely the noble views of lyell
on the gradual changes now in progress on the earths surface have been
accepted as sufficient to account for all that we see in its past
history the present action of natural selection may seem more or less
probable but i believe in the truth of the theory because it
collects under one point of view and gives a rational explanation of
many apparently independent classes of facts4

    the first and chief point of interest in this chapter is whether
    the numerous domesticated varieties of the dog have descended from
    a single wild species or from several some authors believe that
    all have descended from the wolf or from the jackal or from an
    unknown and extinct species others again believe and this of late
    has been the favourite tenet that they have descended from several
    species extinct and recent more or less commingled together we
    shall probably never be able to ascertain their origin with
    certainty palontology1 does not throw much light on the
    question owing on the one hand to the close similarity of the
    skulls of extinct as well as living wolves and jackals and owing
    on the other hand to the great dissimilarity of the skulls of the
    several breeds of the domestic dogs it seems however that
    remains have been found in the later tertiary deposits more like
    those of a large dog than of a wolf which favours the belief of de
    blainville that our dogs are the descendants of a single extinct
    species on the other hand some authors go so far as to assert
    that every chief domestic breed must have had its wild prototype
    this latter view is extremely improbable it allows nothing for
    variation it passes over the almost monstrous character of some of
    the breeds and it almost necessarily assumes that a large number
    of species have become extinct since man domesticated the dog
    whereas we plainly see that wild members of the dogfamily are
    extirpated by human agency with much difficulty even so recently
    as 1710 the wolf existed in so small an island as ireland
    the reasons which have led various authors to infer that our dogs
    have descended from more than one wild species are as follows2
    firstly the great difference between the several breeds but this
    will appear of comparatively little weight after we shall have
    seen how great are the differences between the several races of
    various domesticated animals which certainly have descended from a
    single parentform secondly the more important fact that at the
    most anciently known historical periods several breeds of the dog
    existed very unlike each other and closely resembling or
    identical with breeds still alive
    we will briefly run back through the historical records the
    materials are remarkably deficient between the fourteenth century
    and the roman classical period3 at this latter period various
    breeds namely hounds housedogs lapdogs etc existed but as
    dr walther has remarked it is impossible to recognise the greater
    number with any certainty youatt however gives a drawing of a
    beautiful sculpture of two greyhound puppies from the villa of
    antoninus on an assyrian monument about 640 bc an enormous
    mastiff4 is figured and according to sir h rawlinson as i was
    informed at the british museum similar dogs are still imported
    into this same country i have looked through the magnificent works
    of lepsius and rosellini and on the egyptian monuments from the
    fourth to the twelfth dynasties ie from about 3400 bc to 2100 
    bc several varieties of the dog are represented most of them
    are allied to greyhounds at the later of these periods a dog
    resembling a hound is figured with drooping ears but with a
    longer back and more pointed head than in our hounds there is
    also a turnspit with short and crooked legs closely resembling
    the existing variety but this kind of monstrosity is so common
    with various animals as with the ancon sheep and even according
    to rengger with jaguars in paraguay that it would be rash to look
    at the monumental animal as the parent of all our turnspits
    colonel sykes5 also has described an indian pariah dog as
    presenting the same monstrous character the most ancient dog
    represented on the egyptian monuments is one of the most singular
    it resembles a greyhound but has long pointed ears and a short
    curled tail a closely allied variety still exists in northern
    africa for mr e vernon harcourt6 states that the arab
    boarhound is an eccentric hieroglyphic animal such as cheops
    once hunted with somewhat resembling the rough scotch deerhound
    their tails are curled tight round on their backs and their ears
    stick out at right angles with this most ancient variety a
    pariahlike dog coexisted
    we thus see that at a period between four and five thousand years
    ago various breeds viz pariah dogs greyhounds common hounds
    mastiffs housedogs lapdogs and turnspits existed more or less
    closely resembling our present breeds but there is not sufficient
    evidence that any of these ancient dogs belonged to the same
    identical subvarieties with our present dogs7 as long as man
    was believed to have existed on this earth only about 6000 years
    this fact of the great diversity of the breeds at so early a period
    was an argument of much weight that they had proceeded from several
    wild sources for there would not have been sufficient time for
    their divergence and modification but now that we know from the
    discovery of flint tools embedded with the remains of extinct
    animals in districts which have since undergone great geographical
    changes that man has existed for an incomparably longer period
    and bearing in mind that the most barbarous nations possess
    domestic dogs the argument from insufficient time falls away
    greatly in value
    long before the period of any historical record the dog was
    domesticated in europe in the danish middens of the neolithic or
    newer stone period bones of a canine animal are embedded and
    steenstrup ingeniously argues that these belonged to a domestic
    dog for a very large proportion of the bones of birds preserved in
    the refuse consists of long bones which it was found on trial dogs
    cannot devour8 this ancient dog was succeeded in denmark during
    the bronze period by a larger kind presenting certain differences
    and this again during the iron period by a still larger kind in
    switzerland we hear from prof rtimeyer9 that during the
    neolithic period a domesticated dog of middle size existed which
    in its skull was about equally remote from the wolf and jackal and
    partook of the characters of our hounds and setters or spaniels
    jagdhund und wachtelhund rtimeyer insists strongly on the
    constancy of form during a very long period of time of this the
    most ancient known dog during the bronze period a larger dog
    appeared and this closely resembled in its jaw a dog of the same
    age in denmark remains of two notably distinct varieties of the
    dog were found by schmerling in a cave10 but their age cannot be
    positively determined
    the existence of a single race remarkably constant in form during
    the whole neolithic period is an interesting fact in contrast with
    what we see of the changes which the races underwent during the
    period of the successive egyptian monuments and in contrast with
    our existing dogs the character of this animal during the
    neolithic period as given by rtimeyer supports de blainvilles
    view that our varieties have descended from an unknown and extinct
    form but we should not forget that we know nothing with respect to
    the antiquity of man in the warmer parts of the world the
    succession of the different kinds of dogs in switzerland and
    denmark is thought to be due to the immigration of conquering
    tribes bringing with them their dogs and this view accords with
    the belief that different wild canine animals were domesticated in
    different regions independently of the immigration of new races of
    man we know from the widespread presence of bronze composed of
    an alloy of tin how much commerce there must have been throughout
    europe at an extremely remote period and dogs would then probably
    have been bartered at the present time amongst the savages of the
    interior of guiana the taruma indians are considered the best
    trainers of dogs and possess a large breed which they barter at a
    high price with other tribes11
    the main argument in favour of the several breeds of the dog being
    the descendants of distinct wild stocks is their resemblance in
    various countries to distinct species still existing there it
    must however be admitted that the comparison between the wild and
    domesticated animal has been made but in few cases with sufficient
    exactness before entering on details it will be well to show that
    there is no a priori difficulty in the belief that several canine
    species have been domesticated members of the dog family inhabit
    nearly the whole world and several species agree pretty closely in
    habits and structure with our several domesticated dogs mr galton
    has shown12 how fond savages are of keeping and taming animals of
    all kinds social animals are the most easily subjugated by man
    and several species of canid hunt in packs it deserves notice as
    bearing on other animals as well as on the dog that at an
    extremely ancient period when man first entered any country the
    animals living there would have felt no instinctive or inherited
    fear of him and would consequently have been tamed far more easily
    than at present for instance when the falkland islands were first
    visited by man the large wolflike dog canis antarcticus
    fearlessly came to meet byrons sailors who mistaking this
    ignorant curiosity for ferocity ran into the water to avoid them
    even recently a man by holding a piece of meat in one hand and a
    knife in the other could sometimes stick them at night on a
    island in the sea of aral when first discovered by butakoff the
    saigak antelopes which are generally very timid and watchful did
    not fly from us but on the contrary looked at us with a sort of
    curiosity so again on the shores of the mauritius the manatee
    was not at first in the least afraid of man and thus it has been
    in several quarters of the world with seals and the morse i have
    elsewhere shown13 how slowly the native birds of several islands
    have acquired and inherited a salutary dread of man at the
    galapagos archipelago i pushed with the muzzle of my gun hawks from
    a branch and held out a pitcher of water for other birds to alight
    on and drink quadrupeds and birds which have seldom been disturbed
    by man dread him no more than do our english birds the cows or
    horses grazing in the fields
it is a more important consideration that several canine species evince
as will be shown in a future chapter no strong repugnance or
inability to breed under confinement and the incapacity to breed under
confinement is one of the commonest bars to domestication lastly
savages set the highest value as we shall see in the chapter on
selection on dogs even halftamed animals are highly useful to them
the indians of north america cross their halfwild dogs with wolves
and thus render them even wilder than before but bolder the savages
of guiana catch and partially tame and use the whelps of two wild
species of canis as do the savages of australia those of the wild
dingo mr philip king informs me that he once trained a wild dingo
puppy to drive cattle and found it very useful from these several
considerations we see that there is no difficulty in believing that man
might have domesticated various canine species in different countries
it would indeed have been a strange fact if one species alone had been
domesticated throughout the world
    we will now enter into details the accurate and sagacious
    richardson says the resemblance between the northern american
    wolves canis lupus var occidentalis and the domestic dogs
    of the indians is so great that the size and strength of the wolf
    seems to be the only difference i have more than once mistaken a
    band of wolves for the dogs of a party of indians and the howl of
    the animals of both species is prolonged so exactly in the same key
    that even the practised ear of the indian fails at times to
    discriminate them he adds that the more northern esquimaux dogs
    are not only extremely like the grey wolves of the arctic circle in
    form and colour but also nearly equal them in size dr kane has
    often seen in his teams of sledgedogs the oblique eye a character
    on which some naturalists lay great stress the drooping tail and
    scared look of the wolf in disposition the esquimaux dogs differ
    little from wolves and according to dr hayes they are capable
    of no attachment to man and are so savage that when hungry they
    will attack even their masters according to kane they readily
    become feral their affinity is so close with wolves that they
    frequently cross with them and the indians take the whelps of
    wolves to improve the breed of their dogs the halfbred wolves
    sometimes lamarepicquot cannot be tamed though this case is
    rare but they do not become thoroughly well broken in till the
    second or third generation these facts show that there can be but
    little if any sterility between the esquimaux dog and the wolf
    for otherwise they would not be used to improve the breed as dr
    hayes says of these dogs reclaimed wolves they doubtless
    are14
    north america is inhabited by a second kind of wolf the
    prairiewolf canis latrans which is now looked at by all
    naturalists as specifically distinct from the common wolf and is
    according to mr jk lord in some respects intermediate in habits
    between a wolf and a fox sir j richardson after describing the
    hare indian dog which differs in many respects from the esquimaux
    dog says it bears the same relation to the prairiewolf that the
    esquimaux dog does to the great grey wolf he could in fact
    detect no marked difference between them and messrs nott and
    gliddon give additional details showing their close resemblance
    the dogs derived from the above two aboriginal sources cross
    together and with the wild wolves at least with the c
    occidentalis and with european dogs in florida according to
    bartram the black wolfdog of the indians differs in nothing from
    the wolves of that country except in barking15
    turning to the southern parts of the new world columbus found two
    kinds of dogs in the west indies and fernandez16 describes three
    in mexico some of these native dogs were dumbthat is did not
    bark in guiana it has been known since the time of buffon that the
    natives cross their dogs with an aboriginal species apparently the
    canis cancrivorus sir r schomburgk who has so carefully
    explored these regions writes to me i have been repeatedly told
    by the arawaak indians who reside near the coast that they cross
    their dogs with a wild species to improve the breed and individual
    dogs have been shown to me which certainly resembled the c
    cancrivorus much more than the common breed it is but seldom that
    the indians keep the c cancrivorus for domestic purposes nor is
    the ai another species of wild dog and which i consider to be
    identical with the dusicyon silvestris of h smith now much used
    by the arecunas for the purpose of hunting the dogs of the taruma
    indians are quite distinct and resemble buffons st domingo
    greyhound it thus appears that the natives of guiana have
    partially domesticated two aboriginal species and still cross
    their dogs with them these two species belong to a quite different
    type from the north american and european wolves a careful
    observer rengger17 gives reasons for believing that a hairless
    dog was domesticated when america was first visited by europeans
    some of these dogs in paraguay are still dumb and tschudi18
    states that they suffer from cold in the cordillera this naked dog
    is however quite distinct from that found preserved in the ancient
    peruvian burialplaces and described by tschudi under the name of
    canis ing as withstanding cold well and as barking it is not
    known whether these two distinct kinds of dog are the descendants
    of native species and it might be argued that when man first
    migrated into america he brought with him from the asiatic
    continent dogs which had not learned to bark but this view does
    not seem probable as the natives along the line of their march
    from the north reclaimed as we have seen at least two n american
    species of canid
    turning to the old world some european dogs closely resemble the
    wolf thus the shepherd dog of the plains of hungary is white or
    reddishbrown has a sharp nose short erect ears shaggy coat
    and bushy tail and so much resembles a wolf that mr pt who
    gives this description says he has known a hungarian mistake a
    wolf for one of his own dogs jeitteles also remarks on the close
    similarity of the hungarian dog and wolf shepherd dogs in italy
    must anciently have closely resembled wolves for columella vii
    12 advises that white dogs be kept adding pastor album probat
    ne pro lupo canem feriat several accounts have been given of dogs
    and wolves crossing naturally and pliny asserts that the gauls
    tied their female dogs in the woods that they might cross with
    wolves19 the european wolf differs slightly from that of north
    america and has been ranked by many naturalists as a distinct
    species the common wolf of india is also by some esteemed as a
    third species and here again we find a marked resemblance between
    the pariah dogs of certain districts of india and the indian
    wolf20
    with respect to jackals isidore geoffroy sainthilaire21 says
    that not one constant difference can be pointed out between their
    structure and that of the smaller races of dogs they agree closely
    in habits jackals when tamed and called by their master wag
    their tails lick his hands crouch and throw themselves on their
    backs they smell at the tails of other dogs and void their urine
    sideways they roll on carrion or on animals which they have
    killed and lastly when in high spirits they run round in
    circles or in a figure of eight with their tails between their
    legs22 a number of excellent naturalists from the time of
    gldenstdt to that of ehrenberg hemprich and cretzschmar have
    expressed themselves in the strongest terms with respect to the
    resemblance of the halfdomestic dogs of asia and egypt to jackals
    m nordmann for instance says les chiens dawhasie ressemblent
    tonnamment  des chacals ehrenberg23 asserts that the domestic
    dogs of lower egypt and certain mummied dogs have for their wild
    type a species of wolf c lupaster of the country whereas the
    domestic dogs of nubia and certain other mummied dogs have the
    closest relation to a wild species of the same country viz c
    sabbar which is only a form of the common jackal pallas asserts
    that jackals and dogs sometimes naturally cross in the east and a
    case is on record in algeria24 the greater number of naturalists
    divide the jackals of asia and africa into several species but
    some few rank them all as one
    i may add that the domestic dogs on the coast of guinea are
    foxlike animals and are dumb25 on the east coast of africa
    between latitude 4 and 6 south and about ten days journey in
    the interior a semidomestic dog as the rev s erhardt informs
    me is kept which the natives assert is derived from a similar
    wild animal lichtenstein26 says that the dogs of the bosjemans
    present a striking resemblance even in colour excepting the black
    stripe down the back with the c mesomelas of south africa mr
    e layard informs me that he has seen a caffre dog which closely
    resembled an esquimaux dog in australia the dingo is both
    domesticated and wild though this animal may have been introduced
    aboriginally by man yet it must be considered as almost an endemic
    form for its remains have been found in a similar state of
    preservation and associated with extinct mammals so that its
    introduction must have been ancient27
    from this resemblance of the halfdomesticated dogs in several
    countries to the wild species still living therefrom the facility
    with which they can often be crossed togetherfrom even halftamed
    animals being so much valued by savagesand from the other
    circumstances previously remarked on which favour their
    domestication it is highly probable that the domestic dogs of the
    world are descended from two welldefined species of wolf viz c
    lupus and c latrans and from two or three other doubtful
    species namely the european indian and north african wolves
    from at least one or two south american canine species from
    several races or species of jackal and perhaps from one or more
    extinct species although it is possible or even probable that
    domesticated dogs introduced into any country and bred there for
    many generations might acquire some of the characters proper to
    the aboriginal canid of the country we can hardly thus account
    for introduced dogs having given rise to two breeds in the same
    country resembling two of its aboriginal species as in the
    abovegiven cases of guiana and of north america28
    it cannot be objected to the view of several canine species having
    been anciently domesticated that these animals are tamed with
    difficulty facts have been already given on this head but i may
    add that the young of the canis primvus of india were tamed by
    mr hodgson29 and became as sensible of caresses and manifested
    as much intelligence as any sporting dog of the same age there is
    not much difference as we have already shown and shall further
    see in habits between the domestic dogs of the north american
    indians and the wolves of that country or between the eastern
    pariah dogs and jackals or between the dogs which have run wild in
    various countries and the several natural species of the family
    the habit of barking however which is almost universal with
    domesticated dogs forms an exception as it does not characterise
    a single natural species of the family though i am assured that
    the canis latrans of north america utters a noise which closely
    approaches a bark but this habit is soon lost by dogs when they
    become feral and is soon reacquired when they are again
    domesticated the case of the wild dogs on the island of juan
    fernandez having become dumb has often been quoted and there is
    reason to believe30 that the dumbness ensued in the course of
    thirtythree years on the other hand dogs taken from this island
    by ulloa slowly reacquired the habit of barking the
    mackenzieriver dogs of the canis latrans type when brought to
    england never learned to bark properly but one born in the
    zoological gardens31 made his voice sound as loudly as any other
    dog of the same age and size according to professor nillson32
    a wolfwhelp reared by a bitch barks i geoffroy sainthilaire
    exhibited a jackal which barked with the same tone as any common
    dog33 an interesting account has been given by mr g clarke34
    of some dogs run wild on juan de nova in the indian ocean they
    had entirely lost the faculty of barking they had no inclination
    for the company of other dogs nor did they acquire their voice
    during a captivity of several months on the island they
    congregate in vast packs and catch seabirds with as much address
    as foxes could display the feral dogs of la plata have not become
    dumb they are of large size hunt singly or in packs and burrow
    holes for their young35 in these habits the feral dogs of la
    plata resemble wolves and jackals both of which hunt either singly
    or in packs and burrow holes36 these feral dogs have not become
    uniform in colour on juan fernandez juan de nova or la plata37
    in cuba the feral dogs are described by poeppig as nearly all
    mousecoloured with short ears and lightblue eyes in st
    domingo col ham smith says38 that the feral dogs are very
    large like greyhounds of a uniform pale blueash with small
    ears and large lightbrown eyes even the wild dingo though so
    anciently naturalised in australia varies considerably in
    colour as i am informed by mr pp king a halfbred dingo
    reared in england39 showed signs of wishing to burrow
    from the several foregoing facts we see that reversion in the feral
    state gives no indication of the colour or size of the aboriginal
    parentspecies one fact however with respect to the colouring of
    domestic dogs i at one time hoped might have thrown some light on
    their origin and it is worth giving as showing how colouring
    follows laws even in so anciently and thoroughly domesticated an
    animal as the dog black dogs with tancoloured feet whatever
    breed they may belong to almost invariably have a tancoloured
    spot on the upper and inner corners of each eye and their lips are
    generally thus coloured i have seen only two exceptions to this
    rule namely in a spaniel and terrier dogs of a lightbrown
    colour often have a lighter yellowishbrown spot over the eyes
    sometimes the spot is white and in a mongrel terrier the spot was
    black mr waring kindly examined for me a stud of fifteen
    greyhounds in suffolk eleven of them were black or black and
    white or brindled and these had no eyespots but three were red
    and one slatyblue and these four had darkcoloured spots over
    their eyes although the spots thus sometimes differ in colour
    they strongly tend to be tancoloured this is proved by my having
    seen four spaniels a setter two yorkshire shepherd dogs a large
    mongrel and some foxhounds coloured black and white with not a
    trace of tancolour excepting the spots over the eyes and
    sometimes a little on the feet these latter cases and many
    others show plainly that the colour of the feet and the eyespots
    are in some way correlated i have noticed in various breeds
    every gradation from the whole face being tancoloured to a
    complete ring round the eyes to a minute spot over the inner and
    upper corners the spots occur in various subbreeds of terriers
    and spaniels in setters in hounds of various kinds including the
    turnspitlike german badgerhound in shepherd dogs in a mongrel
    of which neither parent had the spots in one pure bulldog though
    the spots were in this case almost white and in greyhoundsbut
    true blackandtan greyhounds are excessively rare nevertheless i
    have been assured by mr warwick that one ran at the caledonian
    champion meeting of april 1860 and was marked precisely like a
    blackandtan terrier this dog or another exactly the same
    colour ran at the scottish national club on the 21st of march
    1865 and i hear from mr c m browne that there was no reason
    either on the sire or dam side for the appearance of this unusual
    colour mr swinhoe at my request looked at the dogs in china at
    amoy and he soon noticed a brown dog with yellow spots over the
    eyes colonel h smith40 figures the magnificent black mastiff of
    thibet with a tancoloured stripe over the eyes feet and chaps
    and what is more singular he figures the alco or native domestic
    dog of mexico as black and white with narrow tancoloured rings
    round the eyes at the exhibition of dogs in london may 1863 a
    socalled forest dog from northwest mexico was shown which had
    pale tancoloured spots over the eyes the occurrence of these
    tancoloured spots in dogs of such extremely different breeds
    living in various parts of the world makes the fact highly
    remarkable
    we shall hereafter see especially in the chapter on pigeons that
    coloured marks are strongly inherited and that they often aid us
    in discovering the primitive forms of our domestic races hence if
    any wild canine species had distinctly exhibited the tancoloured
    spots over the eyes it might have been argued that this was the
    parentform of nearly all our domestic races but after looking at
    many coloured plates and through the whole collection of skins in
    the british museum i can find no species thus marked it is no
    doubt possible that some extinct species was thus coloured on the
    other hand in looking at the various species there seems to be a
    tolerably plain correlation between tancoloured legs and face and
    less frequently between black legs and a black face and this
    general rule of colouring explains to a certain extent the
    abovegiven cases of correlation between the eyespots and the
    colour of the feet moreover some jackals and foxes have a trace
    of a white ring round their eyes as in c mesomelas c aureus
    and judging from colonel h smiths drawing in c alopex and
    c thaleb other species have a trace of a black line over the
    corners of the eyes as in c variegatus cinereovariegatus and
    fulvus and the wild dingo hence i am inclined to conclude that
    a tendency for tancoloured spots to appear over the eyes in the
    various breeds of dogs is analogous to the case observed by
    desmarest namely that when any white appears on a dog the tip of
    the tail is always white de manire  rappeler la tache terminale
    de mme couleur qui caractrise la plupart des canids
    sauvages41 this rule however as i am assured by mr jesse
    does not invariably hold good
    it has been objected that our domestic dogs cannot be descended
    from wolves or jackals because their periods of gestation are
    different the supposed difference rests on statements made by
    buffon gilibert bechstein and others but these are now known to
    be erroneous and the period is found to agree in the wolf jackal
    and dog as closely as could be expected for it is often in some
    degree variable42 tessier who has closely attended to this
    subject allows a difference of four days in the gestation of the
    dog the rev w d fox has given me three carefully recorded cases
    of retrievers in which the bitch was put only once to the dog and
    not counting this day but counting that of parturition the
    periods were fiftynine sixtytwo and sixtyseven days the
    average period is sixtythree days but bellingeri states that this
    applies only to large dogs and that for small races it is from
    sixty to sixtythree days mr eyton of eyton who has had much
    experience with dogs also informs me that the time is apt to be
    longer with large than with small dogs
    f cuvier has objected that the jackal would not have been
    domesticated on account of its offensive smell but savages are not
    sensitive in this respect the degree of odour also differs in
    the different kinds of jackal43 and colonel h smith makes a
    sectional division of the group with one character dependent on not
    being offensive on the other hand dogs for instance rough and
    smooth terriersdiffer much in this respect and m godron states
    that the hairless socalled turkish dog is more odoriferous than
    other dogs isidore geoffroy44 gave to a dog the same odour as
    that from a jackal by feeding it on raw flesh
    the belief that our dogs are descended from wolves jackals south
    american canid and other species suggests a far more important
    difficulty these animals in their undomesticated state judging
    from a widelyspread analogy would have been in some degree
    sterile if intercrossed and such sterility will be admitted as
    almost certain by all those who believe that the lessened fertility
    of crossed forms is an infallible criterion of specific
    distinctness anyhow these animals keep distinct in the countries
    which they inhabit in common on the other hand all domestic dogs
    which are here supposed to be descended from several distinct
    species are as far as is known mutually fertile together but
    as broca has well remarked45 the fertility of successive
    generations of mongrel dogs has never been scrutinised with that
    care which is thought indispensable when species are crossed the
    few facts leading to the conclusion that the sexual feelings and
    reproductive powers differ in the several races of the dog when
    crossed are passing over mere size as rendering propagation
    difficult as follows the mexican alco46 apparently dislikes
    dogs of other kinds but this perhaps is not strictly a sexual
    feeling the hairless endemic dog of paraguay according to
    rengger mixes less with the european races than these do with each
    other the spitz dog in germany is said to receive the fox more
    readily than do other breeds and dr hodgkin states that a female
    dingo in england attracted the male wild foxes if these latter
    statements can be trusted they prove some degree of sexual
    difference in the breeds of the dog but the fact remains that our
    domestic dogs differing so widely as they do in external
    structure are far more fertile together than we have reason to
    believe their supposed wild parents would have been pallas
    assumes47 that a long course of domestication eliminates that
    sterility which the parentspecies would have exhibited if only
    lately captured no distinct facts are recorded in support of this
    hypothesis but the evidence seems to me so strong independently
    of the evidence derived from other domesticated animals in favour
    of our domestic dogs having descended from several wild stocks
    that i am inclined to admit the truth of this hypothesis
    there is another and closely allied difficulty consequent on the
    doctrine of the descent of our domestic dogs from several wild
    species namely that they do not seem to be perfectly fertile with
    their supposed parents but the experiment has not been quite
    fairly tried the hungarian dog for instance which in external
    appearance so closely resembles the european wolf ought to be
    crossed with this wolf and the pariah dogs of india with indian
    wolves and jackals and so in other cases that the sterility is
    very slight between certain dogs and wolves and other canid is
    shown by savages taking the trouble to cross them buffon got four
    successive generations from the wolf and dog and the mongrels were
    perfectly fertile together48 but more lately m flourens states
    positively as the result of his numerous experiments that hybrids
    from the wolf and dog crossed inter se become sterile at the
    third generation and those from the jackal and dog at the fourth
    generation49 but these animals were closely confined and many
    wild animals as we shall see in a future chapter are rendered by
    confinement in some degree or even utterly sterile the dingo
    which breeds freely in australia with our imported dogs would not
    breed though repeatedly crossed in the jardin des plantes50 some
    hounds from central africa brought home by major denham never
    bred in the town of london51 and a similar tendency to sterility
    might be transmitted to the hybrid offspring of a wild animal
    moreover it appears that in m flourens experiments the hybrids
    were closely bred in and in for three or four generations and this
    circumstance would most certainly increase the tendency to
    sterility several years ago i saw confined in the zoological
    gardens of london a female hybrid from an english dog and jackal
    which even in this the first generation was so sterile that as i
    was assured by her keeper she did not fully exhibit her proper
    periods but this case was certainly exceptional as numerous
    instances have occurred of fertile hybrids from these two animals
    in almost all experiments on the crossing of animals there are so
    many causes of doubt that it is extremely difficult to come to any
    positive conclusion it would however appear that those who
    believe that our dogs are descended from several species will have
    not only to admit that their offspring after a long course of
    domestication generally lose all tendency to sterility when crossed
    together but that between certain breeds of dogs and some of their
    supposed aboriginal parents a certain degree of sterility has been
    retained or possibly even acquired
notwithstanding the difficulties in regard to fertility given in the
last two paragraphs when we reflect on the inherent improbability of
man having domesticated throughout the world one single species alone
of so widely distributed so easily tamed and so useful a group as the
canid when we reflect on the extreme antiquity of the different
breeds and especially when we reflect on the close similarity both in
external structure and habits between the domestic dogs of various
countries and the wild species still inhabiting these same countries
the balance of evidence is strongly in favour of the multiple origin of
our dogs
    differences between the several breeds of the dogif the several
    breeds have descended from several wild stocks their difference
    can obviously in part be explained by that of their parent species
    for instance the form of the greyhound may be partly accounted for
    by descent from some such animal as the slim abyssinian canis
    simensis52 with its elongated muzzle that of the larger dogs
    from the larger wolves and the smaller and slighter dogs from the
    jackals and thus perhaps we may account for certain constitutional
    and climatal differences but it would be a great error to suppose
    that there has not been in addition53 a large amount of
    variation the intercrossing of the several aboriginal wild stocks
    and of the subsequently formed races has probably increased the
    total number of breeds and as we shall presently see has greatly
    modified some of them but we cannot explain by crossing the origin
    of such extreme forms as thoroughbred greyhounds bloodhounds
    bulldogs blenheim spaniels terriers pugs etc unless we
    believe that forms equally or more strongly characterised in these
    different respects once existed in nature but hardly any one has
    been bold enough to suppose that such unnatural forms ever did or
    could exist in a wild state when compared with all known members
    of the family of canid they betray a distinct and abnormal origin
    no instance is on record of such dogs as bloodhounds spaniels
    true greyhounds having been kept by savages they are the product
    of longcontinued civilisation
    the number of breeds and subbreeds of the dog is great youatt for
    instance describes twelve kinds of greyhounds i will not attempt
    to enumerate or describe the varieties for we cannot discriminate
    how much of their difference is due to variation and how much to
    descent from different aboriginal stocks but it may be worth while
    briefly to mention some points commencing with the skull cuvier
    has admitted54 that in form the differences are plus fortes que
    celles daucunes espces sauvages dun mme genre naturel the
    proportions of the different bones the curvature of the lower jaw
    the position of the condyles with respect to the plane of the teeth
    on which f cuvier founded his classification and in mastiffs
    the shape of its posterior branch the shape of the zygomatic arch
    and of the temporal fossae the position of the occiputall vary
    considerably55 the difference in size between the brains of dogs
    belonging to large and small breeds is something prodigious
    some dogs brains are high and rounded while others are low
    long and narrow in front in the latter the olfactory lobes are
    visible for about half their extent when the brain is seen from
    above but they are wholly concealed by the hemispheres in other
    breeds56 the dog has properly six pairs of molar teeth in the
    upper jaw and seven in the lower but several naturalists have
    seen not rarely an additional pair in the upper jaw57 and
    professor gervais says that there are dogs qui ont sept paires de
    dents suprieures et huit infrieures de blainville58 has given
    full particulars on the frequency of these deviations in the number
    of the teeth and has shown that it is not always the same tooth
    which is supernumerary in shortmuzzled races according to h
    mller59 the molar teeth stand obliquely whilst in longmuzzled
    races they are placed longitudinally with open spaces between
    them the naked socalled egyptian or turkish dog is extremely
    deficient in its teeth60 sometimes having none except one molar
    on each side but this though characteristic of the breed must be
    considered as a monstrosity m girard61 who seems to have
    attended closely to the subject says that the period of the
    appearance of the permanent teeth differs in different dogs being
    earlier in large dogs thus the mastiff assumes its adult teeth in
    four or five months whilst in the spaniel the period is sometimes
    more than seven or eight months on the other hand small dogs are
    mature and the females have arrived at the best age for breeding
    when one year old whereas large dogs are still in their puppyhood
    at this time and take fully twice as long to develop their
    proportions62
    with respect to minor differences little need be said isidore
    geoffroy has shown63 that in size some dogs are six times as long
    the tail being excluded as others and that the height relatively
    to the length of the body varies from between one to two and one
    to nearly four in the scotch deerhound there is a striking and
    remarkable difference in the size of the male and female64 every
    one knows how the ears vary in size in different breeds and with
    their great development their muscles become atrophied certain
    breeds of dogs are described as having a deep furrow between the
    nostrils and lips the caudal vertebrae according to f cuvier on
    whose authority the two last statements rest vary in number and
    the tail in english cattle and some shepherd dogs is almost absent
    the mammae vary from seven to ten in number daubenton having
    examined twentyone dogs found eight with five mammae on each
    side eight with four on each side and the others with an unequal
    number on the two sides65 dogs have properly five toes in front
    and four behind but a fifth toe is often added and f cuvier
    states that when a fifth toe is present a fourth cuneiform bone
    is developed and in this case sometimes the great cuneiform bone
    is raised and gives on its inner side a large articular surface to
    the astragalus so that even the relative connection of the bones
    the most constant of all characters varies these modifications
    however in the feet of dogs are not important because they ought
    to be ranked as de blainville has shown66 as monstrosities
    nevertheless they are interesting from being correlated with the
    size of the body for they occur much more frequently with mastiffs
    and other large breeds than with small dogs closely allied
    varieties however sometimes differ in this respect thus mr
    hodgson states that the blackandtan lassa variety of the thibet
    mastiff has the fifth digit whilst the mustang subvariety is not
    thus characterised the extent to which the skin is developed
    between the toes varies much but we shall return to this point
    the degree to which the various breeds differ in the perfection of
    their senses dispositions and inherited habits is notorious to
    every one the breeds present some constitutional differences the
    pulse says youatt67 varies materially according to the breed
    as well as to the size of the animal different breeds of dogs are
    subject in different degrees to various diseases they certainly
    become adapted to different climates under which they have long
    existed it is notorious that most of our best european breeds
    deteriorate in india68 the rev r everest69 believes that no
    one has succeeded in keeping the newfoundland dog long alive in
    india so it is according to lichtenstein70 even at the cape of
    good hope the thibet mastiff degenerates on the plains of india
    and can live only on the mountains71 lloyd72 asserts that our
    bloodhounds and bulldogs have been tried and cannot withstand the
    cold of the northern european forests
    seeing in how many characters the races of the dog differ from each
    other and remembering cuviers admission that their skulls differ
    more than do those of the species of any natural genus and bearing
    in mind how closely the bones of wolves jackals foxes and other
    canid agree it is remarkable that we meet with the statement
    repeated over and over again that the races of the dog differ in
    no important characters a highly competent judge prof
    gervais73 admits si lon prenait sans contrle les alterations
    dont chacun de ces organes est susceptible on pourrait croire
    quil y a entre les chiens domestiques des diffrences plus grandes
    que celles qui sparent ailleurs les espces quelquefois mme les
    genres some of the differences above enumerated are in one
    respect of comparatively little value for they are not
    characteristic of distinct breeds no one pretends that such is the
    case with the additional molar teeth or with the number of mammae
    the additional digit is generally present with mastiffs and some
    of the more important differences in the skull and lower jaw are
    more or less characteristic of various breeds but we must not
    forget that the predominant power of selection has not been applied
    in any of these cases we have variability in important parts but
    the differences have not been fixed by selection man cares for the
    form and fleetness of his greyhounds for the size of his mastiffs
    and formerly for the strength of the jaw in his bulldogs etc but
    he cares nothing about the number of their molar teeth or mammae or
    digits nor do we know that differences in these organs are
    correlated with or owe their development to differences in other
    parts of the body about which man does care those who have
    attended to the subject of selection will admit that nature having
    given variability man if he so chose could fix five toes to the
    hinder feet of certain breeds of dogs as certainly as to the feet
    of his dorking fowls he could probably fix but with much more
    difficulty an additional pair of molar teeth in either jaw in the
    same way as he has given additional horns to certain breeds of
    sheep if he wished to produce a toothless breed of dogs having
    the socalled turkish dog with its imperfect teeth to work on he
    could probably do so for he has succeeded in making hornless
    breeds of cattle and sheep
    with respect to the precise causes and steps by which the several
    races of dogs have come to differ so greatly from each other we
    are as in most other cases profoundly ignorant we may attribute
    part of the difference in external form and constitution to
    inheritance from distinct wild stocks that is to changes effected
    under nature before domestication we must attribute something to
    the crossing of the several domestic and natural races i shall
    however soon recur to the crossing of races we have already seen
    how often savages cross their dogs with wild native species and
    pennant gives a curious account74 of the manner in which
    fochabers in scotland was stocked with a multitude of curs of a
    most wolfish aspect from a single hybridwolf brought into that
    district
    it would appear that climate to a certain extent directly modifies
    the forms of dogs we have lately seen that several of our english
    breeds cannot live in india and it is positively asserted that
    when bred there for a few generations they degenerate not only in
    their mental faculties but in form captain williamson75 who
    carefully attended to this subject states that hounds are the
    most rapid in their decline greyhounds and pointers also
    rapidly decline but spaniels after eight or nine generations
    and without a cross from europe are as good as their ancestors
    dr falconer informs me that bulldogs which have been known when
    first brought into the country to pin down even an elephant by its
    trunk not only fall off after two or three generations in pluck
    and ferocity but lose the underhung character of their lower
    jaws their muzzles become finer and their bodies lighter english
    dogs imported into india are so valuable that probably due care has
    been taken to prevent their crossing with native dogs so that the
    deterioration cannot be thus accounted for the rev r everest
    informs me that he obtained a pair of setters born in india which
    perfectly resembled their scotch parents he raised several litters
    from them in delhi taking the most stringent precautions to
    prevent a cross but he never succeeded though this was only the
    second generation in india in obtaining a single young dog like
    its parents in size or make their nostrils were more contracted
    their noses more pointed their size inferior and their limbs more
    slender so again on the coast of guinea dogs according to
    bosman alter strangely their ears grow long and stiff like those
    of foxes to which colour they also incline so that in three or
    four years they degenerate into very ugly creatures and in three
    or four broods their barking turns into a howl76 this
    remarkable tendency to rapid deterioration in european dogs
    subjected to the climate of india and africa may be largely
    accounted for by reversion to a primordial condition which many
    animals exhibit as we shall hereafter see when their
    constitutions are in any way disturbed
    some of the peculiarities characteristic of the several breeds of
    the dog have probably arisen suddenly and though strictly
    inherited may be called monstrosities for instance the shape of
    the legs and body in the turnspit of europe and india the shape of
    the head and the underhanging jaw in the bulland pugdog so
    alike in this one respect and so unlike in all others a
    peculiarity suddenly arising and therefore in one sense deserving
    to be called a monstrosity may however be increased and fixed by
    mans selection we can hardly doubt that longcontinued training
    as with the greyhound in coursing hares as with waterdogs in
    swimmingand the want of exercise in the case of lapdogsmust have
    produced some direct effect on their structure and instincts but
    we shall immediately see that the most potent cause of change has
    probably been the selection both methodical and unconscious of
    slight individual differencesthe latter kind of selection
    resulting from the occasional preservation during hundreds of
    generations of those individual dogs which were the most useful to
    man for certain purposes and under certain conditions of life in a
    future chapter on selection i shall show that even barbarians
    attend closely to the qualities of their dogs this unconscious
    selection by man would be aided by a kind of natural selection for
    the dogs of savages have partly to gain their own subsistence for
    instance in australia as we hear from mr nind77 the dogs are
    sometimes compelled by want to leave their masters and provide for
    themselves but in a few days they generally return and we may
    infer that dogs of different shapes sizes and habits would have
    the best chance of surviving under different circumstanceson open
    sterile plains where they have to run down their own preyon
    rocky coasts where they have to feed on crabs and fish left in the
    tidal pools as in the case of new guinea and tierra del fuego in
    this latter country as i am informed by mr bridges the catechist
    to the mission the dogs turn over the stones on the shore to catch
    the crustaceans which lie beneath and they are clever enough to
    knock off the shellfish at a first blow for if this be not done
    shellfish are wellknown to have an almost invincible power of
    adhesion
    it has already been remarked that dogs differ in the degree to
    which their feet are webbed in dogs of the newfoundland breed
    which are eminently aquatic in their habits the skin according to
    isidore geoffroy78 extends to the third phalanges whilst in
    ordinary dogs it extends only to the second in two newfoundland
    dogs which i examined when the toes were stretched apart and
    viewed on the under side the skin extended in a nearly straight
    line between the outer margins of the balls of the toes whereas
    in two terriers of distinct subbreeds the skin viewed in the same
    manner was deeply scooped out in canada there is a dog which is
    peculiar to the country and common there and this has halfwebbed
    feet and is fond of the water79 english otterhounds are said
    to have webbed feet a friend examined for me the feet of two in
    comparison with the feet of some harriers and bloodhounds he found
    the skin variable in extent in all but more developed in the
    otterhounds than in the others80 as aquatic animals which
    belong to quite different orders have webbed feet there can be no
    doubt that this structure would be serviceable to dogs that
    frequent the water we may confidently infer that no man ever
    selected his waterdogs by the extent to which the skin was
    developed between their toes but what he does is to preserve and
    breed from those individuals which hunt best in the water or best
    retrieve wounded game and thus he unconsciously selects dogs with
    feet slightly better webbed the effects of use from the frequent
    stretching apart of the toes will likewise aid in the result man
    thus closely imitates natural selection we have an excellent
    illustration of this same process in north america where
    according to sir j richardson81 all the wolves foxes and
    aboriginal domestic dogs have their feet broader than in the
    corresponding species of the old world and well calculated for
    running on the snow now in these arctic regions the life or
    death of every animal will often depend on its success in hunting
    over the snow when soft and this will in part depend on the feet
    being broad yet they must not be so broad as to interfere with the
    activity of the animal when the ground is sticky or with its power
    of burrowing holes or with other necessary habits of life
    as changes in domestic breeds which take place so slowly are not to
    be noticed at any one period whether due to the selection of
    individual variations or of differences resulting from crosses are
    most important in understanding the origin of our domestic
    productions and likewise in throwing indirect light on the changes
    effected under nature i will give in detail such cases as i have
    been able to collect lawrence82 who paid particular attention
    to the history of the foxhound writing in 1829 says that between
    eighty and ninety years before an entirely new foxhound was raised
    through the breeders art the ears of the old southern hound
    being reduced the bone and bulk lightened the waist increased in
    length and the stature somewhat added to it is believed that this
    was effected by a cross with a greyhound with respect to this
    latter dog youatt83 who is generally cautious in his
    statements says that the greyhound within the last fifty years
    that is before the commencement of the present century assumed a
    somewhat different character from that which he once possessed he
    is now distinguished by a beautiful symmetry of form of which he
    could not once boast and he has even superior speed to that which
    he formerly exhibited he is no longer used to struggle with deer
    but contends with his fellows over a shorter and speedier course
    an able writer84 believes that our english greyhounds are the
    descendants progressively improved of the large rough
    greyhounds which existed in scotland so early as the third century
    a cross at some former period with the italian greyhound has been
    suspected but this seems hardly probable considering the
    feebleness of this latter breed lord orford as is wellknown
    crossed his famous greyhounds which failed in courage with a
    bulldogthis breed being chosen from being erroneously supposed to
    be deficient in the power of scent after the sixth or seventh
    generation says youatt there was not a vestige left of the form
    of the bulldog but his courage and indomitable perseverance
    remained
    youatt infers from a comparison of an old picture of king
    charless spaniels with the living dog that the breed of the
    present day is materially altered for the worse the muzzle has
    become shorter the forehead more prominent and the eyes larger
    the changes in this case have probably been due to simple
    selection the setter as this author remarks in another place is
    evidently the large spaniel improved to his present peculiar size
    and beauty and taught another way of marking his game if the form
    of the dog were not sufficiently satisfactory on this point we
    might have recourse to history he then refers to a document dated
    1685 bearing on this subject and adds that the pure irish setter
    shows no signs of a cross with the pointer which some authors
    suspect has been the case with the english setter the bulldog is
    an english breed and as i hear from mr g r jesse85 seems to
    have originated from the mastiff since the time of shakspeare but
    certainly existed in 1631 as shown by prestwick eatons letters
    there can be no doubt that the fancy bulldogs of the present day
    now that they are not used for bullbaiting have become greatly
    reduced in size without any express intention on the part of the
    breeder our pointers are certainly descended from a spanish breed
    as even their present names don ponto carlos etc show it is
    said that they were not known in england before the revolution in
    168886 but the breed since its introduction has been much
    modified for mr borrow who is a sportsman and knows spain
    intimately well informs me that he has not seen in that country
    any breed corresponding in figure with the english pointer but
    there are genuine pointers near xeres which have been imported by
    english gentlemen a nearly parallel case is offered by the
    newfoundland dog which was certainly brought into england from
    that country but which has since been so much modified that as
    several writers have observed it does not now closely resemble any
    existing native dog in newfoundland87
these several cases of slow and gradual changes in our english dogs
possess some interest for though the changes have generally but not
invariably been caused by one or two crosses with a distinct breed
yet we may feel sure from the wellknown extreme variability of
crossed breeds that rigorous and longcontinued selection must have
been practised in order to improve them in a definite manner as soon
as any strain or family became slightly improved or better adapted to
alter circumstances it would tend to supplant the older and less
improved strains for instance as soon as the old foxhound was
improved by a cross with the greyhound or by simple selection and
assumed its present characterand the change was probably desired owing
to the increased fleetness of our huntersit rapidly spread throughout
the country and is now everywhere nearly uniform but the process of
improvement is still going on for every one tries to improve his strain
by occasionally procuring dogs from the best kennels through this
process of gradual substitution the old english hound has been lost
and so it has been with the irish wolfdog the old english bulldog
and several other breeds such as the alaunt as i am informed by mr
jesse but the extinction of former breeds is apparently aided by
another cause for whenever a breed is kept in scanty numbers as at
present with the bloodhound it is reared with some difficulty
apparently from the evil effects of longcontinued close interbreeding
as several breeds of the dog have been slightly but sensibly modified
within so short a period as the last one or two centuries by the
selection of the best individuals modified in many cases by crosses
with other breeds and as we shall hereafter see that the breeding of
dogs was attended to in ancient times as it still is by savages we
may conclude that we have in selection even if only occasionally
practised a potent means of modification
domestic cats
    cats have been domesticated in the east from an ancient period mr
    blyth informs me that they are mentioned in a sanskrit writing 2000
    years old and in egypt their antiquity is known to be even
    greater as shown by monumental drawings and their mummied bodies
    these mummies according to de blainville88 who has particularly
    studied the subject belong to no less than three species namely
    f caligulata bubastes and chaus the two former species are
    said to be still found both wild and domesticated in parts of
    egypt f caligulata presents a difference in the first inferior
    milk molar tooth as compared with the domestic cats of europe
    which makes de blainville conclude that it is not one of the
    parentforms of our cats several naturalists as pallas temminck
    blyth believe that domestic cats are the descendants of several
    species commingled it is certain that cats cross readily with
    various wild species and it would appear that the character of the
    domestic breeds has at least in some cases been thus affected
    sir w jardine has no doubt that in the north of scotland there
    has been occasional crossing with our native species f
    sylvestris and that the result of these crosses has been kept in
    our houses i have seen he adds many cats very closely
    resembling the wild cat and one or two that could scarcely be
    distinguished from it mr blyth89 remarks on this passage but
    such cats are never seen in the southern parts of england still
    as compared with any indian tame cat the affinity of the ordinary
    british cat to f sylvestris is manifest and due i suspect to
    frequent intermixture at a time when the tame cat was first
    introduced into britain and continued rare while the wild species
    was far more abundant than at present in hungary jeitteles90
    was assured on trustworthy authority that a wild male cat crossed
    with a female domestic cat and that the hybrids long lived in a
    domesticated state in algiers the domestic cat has crossed with
    the wild cat f lybica of that country91 in south africa as
    mr e layard informs me the domestic cat intermingles freely with
    the wild f caffra he has seen a pair of hybrids which were
    quite tame and particularly attached to the lady who brought them
    up and mr fry has found that these hybrids are fertile in india
    the domestic cat according to mr blyth has crossed with four
    indian species with respect to one of these species f chaus
    an excellent observer sir w elliot informs me that he once
    killed near madras a wild brood which were evidently hybrids
    from the domestic cat these young animals had a thick lynxlike
    tail and the broad brown bar on the inside of the forearm
    characteristic of f chaus sir w elliot adds that he has often
    observed this same mark on the forearms of domestic cats in india
    mr blyth states that domestic cats coloured nearly like  f
    chaus but not resembling that species in shape abound in bengal
    he adds such a colouration is utterly unknown in european cats
    and the proper tabby markings pale streaks on a black ground
    peculiarly and symmetrically disposed so common in english cats
    are never seen in those of india dr d short has assured mr
    blyth92 that at hansi hybrids between the common cat and f
    ornata or  torquata occur and that many of the domestic cats
    of that part of india were undistinguishable from the wild f
    ornata azara states but only on the authority of the
    inhabitants that in paraguay the cat has crossed with two native
    species from these several cases we see that in europe asia
    africa and america the common cat which lives a freer life than
    most other domesticated animals has crossed with various wild
    species and that in some instances the crossing has been
    sufficiently frequent to affect the character of the breed
whether domestic cats have descended from several distinct species or
have only been modified by occasional crosses their fertility as far
as is known is unimpaired the large angora or persian cat is the most
distinct in structure and habits of all the domestic breeds and is
believed by pallas but on no distinct evidence to be descended from
the f manul of middle asia and i am assured by mr blyth that the
angora cat breeds freely with indian cats which as we have already
seen have apparently been much crossed with f chaus in england
halfbred angora cats are perfectly fertile with one another
    within the same country we do not meet with distinct races of the
    cat as we do of dogs and of most other domestic animals though
    the cats of the same country present a considerable amount of
    fluctuating variability the explanation obviously is that from
    their nocturnal and rambling habits indiscriminate crossing cannot
    without much trouble be prevented selection cannot be brought into
    play to produce distinct breeds or to keep those distinct which
    have been imported from foreign lands on the other hand in
    islands and in countries completely separated from each other we
    meet with breeds more or less distinct and these cases are worth
    giving showing that the scarcity of distinct races in the same
    country is not caused by a deficiency of variability in the animal
    the tailless cats of the isle of man are said to differ from common
    cats not only in the want of a tail but in the greater length of
    their hind legs in the size of their heads and in habits the
    creole cat of antigua as i am informed by mr nicholson is
    smaller and has a more elongated head than the british cat in
    ceylon as mr thwaites writes to me every one at first notices
    the different appearance of the native cat from the english animal
    it is of small size with closely lying hairs its head is small
    with a receding forehead but the ears are large and sharp
    altogether it has what is there called a lowcaste appearance
    rengger93 says that the domestic cat which has been bred for 300
    years in paraguay presents a striking difference from the european
    cat it is smaller by a fourth has a more lanky body its hair is
    short shining scanty and lies close especially on the tail he
    adds that the change has been less at ascension the capital of
    paraguay owing to the continual crossing with newly imported cats
    and this fact well illustrates the importance of separation the
    conditions of life in paraguay appear not to be highly favourable
    to the cat for though they have run halfwild they do not become
    thoroughly feral like so many other european animals in another
    part of south america according to roulin94 the introduced cat
    has lost the habit of uttering its hideous nocturnal howl the rev
    wd fox purchased a cat in portsmouth which he was told came from
    the coast of guinea its skin was black and wrinkled fur
    bluishgrey and short its ears rather bare legs long and whole
    aspect peculiar this negro cat was fertile with common cats on
    the opposite coast of africa at mombas captain owen  rn95
    states that all the cats are covered with short stiff hair instead
    of fur he gives a curious account of a cat from algoa bay which
    had been kept for some time on board and could be identified with
    certainty this animal was left for only eight weeks at mombas but
    during that short period it underwent a complete metamorphosis
    having parted with its sandycoloured fur a cat from the cape of
    good hope has been described by desmarest as remarkable from a red
    stripe extending along the whole length of its back throughout an
    immense area namely the malayan archipelago siam pegu and
    burmah all the cats have truncated tails about half the proper
    length96 often with a sort of knot at the end in the caroline
    archipelago the cats have very long legs and are of a
    reddishyellow colour97 in china a breed has drooping ears at
    tobolsk according to gmelin there is a redcoloured breed in
    asia also we find the wellknown angora or persian breed
    the domestic cat has run wild in several countries and everywhere
    assumes as far as can be judged by the short recorded
    descriptions a uniform character near maldonado in la plata i
    shot one which seemed perfectly wild it was carefully examined by
    mr waterhouse98 who found nothing remarkable in it excepting
    its great size in new zealand according to dieffenbach the feral
    cats assume a streaky grey colour like that of wild cats and this
    is the case with the halfwild cats of the scotch highlands
we have seen that distant countries possess distinct domestic races of
the cat the differences may be in part due to descent from several
aboriginal species or at least to crosses with them in some cases as
in paraguay mombas and antigua the differences seem due to the
direct action of different conditions of life in other cases some
slight effect may possibly be attributed to natural selection as cats
in many cases have largely to support themselves and to escape diverse
dangers but man owing to the difficulty of pairing cats has done
nothing by methodical selection and probably very little by
unintentional selection though in each litter he generally saves the
prettiest and values most a good breed of mouse or ratcatchers
those cats which have a strong tendency to prowl after game generally
get destroyed by traps as cats are so much petted a breed bearing the
same relation to other cats that lapdogs bear to larger dogs would
have been much valued and if selection could have been applied we
should certainly have had many breeds in each longcivilised country
for there is plenty of variability to work upon
    we see in this country considerable diversity in size some in the
    proportions of the body and extreme variability in colouring i
    have only lately attended to this subject but have already heard
    of some singular cases of variation one of a cat born in the west
    indies toothless and remaining so all its life mr tegetmeier has
    shown me the skull of a female cat with its canines so much
    developed that they protruded uncovered beyond the lips the tooth
    with the fang being 95 and the part projecting from the gum 6 of
    an inch in length i have heard of several families of sixtoed
    cats in one of which the peculiarity had been transmitted for at
    least three generations the tail varies greatly in length i have
    seen a cat which always carried its tail flat on its back when
    pleased the ears vary in shape and certain strains in england
    inherit a pencillike tuft of hairs above a quarter of an inch in
    length on the tips of their ears and this same peculiarity
    according to mr blyth characterises some cats in india the great
    variability in the length of the tail and the lynxlike tufts of
    hairs on the ears are apparently analogous to differences in
    certain wild species of the genus a much more important
    difference according to daubenton99 is that the intestines of
    domestic cats are wider and a third longer than in wild cats of
    the same size and this apparently has been by their less strictly
    carnivorous diet

    the history of the horse is lost in antiquity remains of this
    animal in a domesticated condition have been found in the swiss
    lakedwellings belonging to the neolithic period1 at the
    present time the number of breeds is great as may be seen by
    consulting any treatise on the horse2 looking only to the native
    ponies of great britain those of the shetland isles wales the
    new forest and devonshire are distinguishable and so it is
    amongst other instances with each separate island in the great
    malay archipelago3 some of the breeds present great differences
    in size shape of ears length of mane proportions of the body
    form of the withers and hind quarters and especially in the head
    compare the racehorse drayhorse and a shetland pony in size
    configuration and disposition and see how much greater the
    difference is than between the seven or eight other living species
    of the genus equus
    of individual variations not known to characterise particular
    breeds and not great or injurious enough to be called
    monstrosities i have not collected many cases mr g brown of
    the cirencester agricultural college who has particularly attended
    to the dentition of our domestic animals writes to me that he has
    several times noticed eight permanent incisors instead of six in
    the jaw male horses only should have canines but they are
    occasionally found in the mare though a small size4 the number
    of ribs on each side is properly eighteen but youatt5 asserts
    that not unfrequently there are nineteen the additional one being
    always the posterior rib it is a remarkable fact that the ancient
    indian horse is said in the rigvda to have only seventeen ribs
    and m pitrement6 who has called attention to this subject
    gives various reasons for placing full trust in this statement
    more especially as during former times the hindoos carefully
    counted the bones of animals i have seen several notices of
    variations in the bones of the leg thus mr price7 speaks of an
    additional bone in the hock and of certain abnormal appearances
    between the tibia and astragalus as quite common in irish horses
    and not due to disease horses have often been observed according
    to m gaudry8 to possess a trapezium and a rudiment of a fifth
    metacarpal bone so that one sees appearing by monstrosity in the
    foot of the horse structures which normally exist in the foot of
    the hipparionan allied and extinct animal in various countries
    hornlike projections have been observed on the frontal bones of
    the horse in one case described by mr percival they arose about
    two inches above the orbital processes and were very like those
    in a calf from five to six months old being from half to
    threequarters of an inch in length9 azara has described two
    cases in south america in which the projections were between three
    and four inches in length other instances have occurred in spain
    that there has been much inherited variation in the horse cannot be
    doubted when we reflect on the number of the breeds existing
    throughout the world or even within the same country and when we
    know that they have largely increased in number since the earliest
    known records10 even in so fleeting a character as colour
    hofacker11 found that out of 216 cases in which horses of the
    same colour were paired only eleven pairs produced foals of a
    quite different colour as professor low12 has remarked the
    english racehorse offers the best possible evidence of
    inheritance the pedigree of a racehorse is of more value in
    judging of its probable success than its appearance king herod
    gained in prizes 201505 pounds sterling and begot 497 winners
    eclipse begot 334 winners
    whether the whole amount of difference between the various breeds
    has arisen under domestication is doubtful from the fertility of
    the most distinct breeds13 when crossed naturalists have
    generally looked at all the breeds as having descended from a
    single species few will agree with colonel h smith who believes
    that they have descended from no less than five primitive and
    differently coloured stocks14 but as several species and
    varieties of the horse existed15 during the later tertiary
    periods and as rutimeyer found differences in the size and form of
    the skull in the earliest known domesticated horses16 we ought
    not to feel sure that all our breeds are descended from a single
    species the savages of north and south america easily reclaim the
    feral horses so that there is no improbability in savages in
    various quarters of the world having domesticated more than one
    native species or natural race m sanson17 thinks that he has
    proved that two distinct species have been domesticated one in the
    east and one in north africa and that these differed in the
    number of their lumbar vertebra and in various other parts but m
    sanson seems to believe that osteological characters are subject to
    very little variation which is certainly a mistake at present no
    aboriginal or truly wild horse is positively known to exist for it
    is commonly believed that the wild horses of the east are escaped
    domestic animals18 if therefore our domestic breeds are
    descended from several species or natural races all have become
    extinct in the wild state
    with respect to the causes of the modifications which horses have
    undergone the conditions of life seem to produce a considerable
    direct effect mr d forbes who has had excellent opportunities
    of comparing the horses of spain with those of south america
    informs me that the horses of chile which have lived under nearly
    the same conditions as their progenitors in andalusia remain
    unaltered whilst the pampas horses and the puno horses are
    considerably modified there can be no doubt that horses become
    greatly reduced in size and altered in appearance by living on
    mountains and islands and this apparently is due to want of
    nutritious or varied food every one knows how small and rugged the
    ponies are on the northern islands and on the mountains of europe
    corsica and sardinia have their native ponies and there were19
    or still are on some islands on the coast of virginia ponies like
    those of the shetland islands which are believed to have
    originated through exposure to unfavourable conditions the puno
    ponies which inhabit the lofty regions of the cordillera are as
    i hear from mr d forbes strange little creatures very unlike
    their spanish progenitors further south in the falkland islands
    the offspring of the horses imported in 1764 have already so much
    deteriorated in size20 and strength that they are unfitted for
    catching wild cattle with the lasso so that fresh horses have to
    be brought for this purpose from la plata at a great expense the
    reduced size of the horses bred on both southern and northern
    islands and on several mountainchains can hardly have been
    caused by the cold as a similar reduction has occurred on the
    virginian and mediterranean islands the horse can withstand
    intense cold for wild troops live on the plains of siberia under
    lat 5621 and aboriginally the horses must have inhabited
    countries annually covered with snow for he long retains the
    instinct of scraping it away to get at the herbage beneath the
    wild tarpans in the east have this instinct and so it is as i am
    informed by admiral sulivan with the horses recently and formerly
    introduced into the falkland islands from la plata some of which
    have run wild this latter fact is remarkable as the progenitors
    of these horses could not have followed this instinct during many
    generations in la plata on the other hand the wild cattle of the
    falklands never scrape away the snow and perish when the ground is
    long covered in the northern parts of america the horses descended
    from those introduced by the spanish conquerors of mexico have the
    same habit as have the native bisons but not so the cattle
    introduced from europe22
    the horse can flourish under intense heat as well as under intense
    cold for he is known to come to the highest perfection though not
    attaining a large size in arabia and northern africa much
    humidity is apparently more injurious to the horse than heat or
    cold in the falkland islands horses suffer much from the
    dampness and this circumstance may perhaps partly account for the
    singular fact that to the eastward of the bay of bengal23 over
    an enormous and humid area in ava pegu siam the malayan
    archipelago the loo choo islands and a large part of china no
    fullsized horse is found when we advance as far eastward as
    japan the horse reacquires his full size24
    with most of our domesticated animals some breeds are kept on
    account of their curiosity or beauty but the horse is valued
    almost solely for its utility hence semimonstrous breeds are not
    preserved and probably all the existing breeds have been slowly
    formed either by the direct action of the conditions of life or
    through the selection of individual differences no doubt
    semimonstrous breeds might have been formed thus mr waterton
    records25 the case of a mare which produced successively three
    foals without tails so that a tailless race might have been formed
    like the tailless races of dogs and cats a russian breed of horses
    is said to have curled hair and azara26 relates that in paraguay
    horses are occasionally born but are generally destroyed with
    hair like that on the head of a negro and this peculiarity is
    transmitted even to halfbreeds it is a curious case of
    correlation that such horses have short manes and tails and their
    hoofs are of a peculiar shape like those of a mule
    it is scarcely possible to doubt that the longcontinued selection
    of qualities serviceable to man has been the chief agent in the
    formation of the several breeds of the horse look at a drayhorse
    and see how well adapted he is to draw heavy weights and how
    unlike in appearance to any allied wild animal the english
    racehorse is known to be derived from the commingled blood of
    arabs turks and barbs but selection which was carried on during
    very early times in england27 together with training have made
    him a very different animal from his parentstocks as a writer in
    india who evidently knows the pure arab well asks who now
    looking at our present breed of racehorses could have conceived
    that they were the result of the union of the arab horse and
    african mare the improvement is so marked that in running for the
    goodwood cup the first descendants of arabian turkish and persian
    horses are allowed a discount of 18 pounds weight and when both
    parents are of these countries a discount of 36 pounds28 it is
    notorious that the arabs have long been as careful about the
    pedigree of their horses as we are and this implies great and
    continued care in breeding seeing what has been done in england by
    careful breeding can we doubt that the arabs must likewise have
    produced during the course of centuries a marked effect on the
    qualities of their horses but we may go much farther back in time
    for in the bible we hear of studs carefully kept for breeding and
    of horses imported at high prices from various countries29 we
    may therefore conclude that whether or not the various existing
    breeds of the horse have proceeded from one or more aboriginal
    stocks yet that a great amount of change has resulted from the
    direct action of the conditions of life and probably a still
    greater amount from the longcontinued selection by man of slight
    individual differences
    with several domesticated quadrupeds and birds certain coloured
    marks are either strongly inherited or tend to reappear after
    having been lost for a long time as this subject will hereafter be
    seen to be of importance i will give a full account of the
    colouring of horses all english breeds however unlike in size and
    appearance and several of those in india and the malay
    archipelago present a similar range and diversity of colour the
    english racehorse however is said30 never to be duncoloured
    but as dun and creamcoloured horses are considered by the arabs as
    worthless and fit only for jews to ride31 these tints may
    have been removed by longcontinued selection horses of every
    colour and of such widely different kinds as drayhorses cobs
    and ponies are all occasionally dappled32 in the same manner as
    is so conspicuous with grey horses this fact does not throw any
    clear light on the colouring of the aboriginal horse but is a case
    of analogous variation for even asses are sometimes dappled and i
    have seen in the british museum a hybrid from the ass and zebra
    dappled on its hinder quarters by the expression analogous
    variation and it is one that i shall often have occasion to use i
    mean a variation occurring in a species or variety which resembles
    a normal character in another and distinct species or variety
    analogous variations may arise as will be explained in a future
    chapter from two or more forms with a similar constitution having
    been exposed to similar conditionsor from one of two forms having
    reacquired through reversion a character inherited by the other
    form from their common progenitoror from both forms having
    reverted to the same ancestral character we shall immediately see
    that horses occasionally exhibit a tendency to become striped over
    a large part of their bodies and as we know that in the varieties
    of the domestic cat and in several feline species stripes readily
    pass into spots and cloudy markseven the cubs of the
    uniformlycoloured lion being spotted with dark marks on a lighter
    groundwe may suspect that the dappling of the horse which has
    been noticed by some authors with surprise is a modification or
    vestige of a tendency to become striped
illustration fig 1dun devonshire pony with shoulder spinal and
leg stripes
    this tendency in the horse to become striped is in several respects
    an interesting fact horses of all colours of the most diverse
    breeds in various parts of the world often have a dark stripe
    extending along the spine from the mane to the tail but this is
    so common that i need enter into no particulars33 occasionally
    horses are transversely barred on the legs chiefly on the under
    side and more rarely they have a distinct stripe on the shoulder
    like that on the shoulder of the ass or a broad dark patch
    representing a stripe before entering on any details i must
    premise that the term duncoloured is vague and includes three
    groups of colours viz that between creamcolour and
    reddishbrown which graduates into lightbay or
    lightchestnutthis i believe is often called fallowdun
    secondly leaden or slatecolour or mousedun which graduates into
    an ashcolour and lastly darkdun between brown and black in
    england i have examined a rather large lightlybuilt fallowdun
    devonshire pony figure 1 with a conspicuous stripe along the
    back with light transverse stripes on the under sides of its front
    legs and with four parallel stripes on each shoulder of these
    four stripes the posterior one was very minute and faint the
    anterior one on the other hand was long and broad but
    interrupted in the middle and truncated at its lower extremity
    with the anterior angle produced into a long tapering point i
    mention this latter fact because the shoulderstripe of the ass
    occasionally presents exactly the same appearance i have had an
    outline and description sent to me of a small purelybred light
    fallowdun welch pony with a spinal stripe a single transverse
    stripe on each leg and three shoulderstripes the posterior
    stripe corresponding with that on the shoulder of the ass was the
    longest whilst the two anterior parallel stripes arising from the
    mane decreased in length in a reversed manner as compared with
    the shoulderstripes on the abovedescribed devonshire pony i have
    seen a bright fallowdun cob with its front legs transversely
    barred on the under sides in the most conspicuous manner also a
    darkleaden mousecoloured pony with similar leg stripes but much
    less conspicuous also a bright fallowdun colt fully threeparts
    thoroughbred with very plain transverse stripes on the legs also
    a chestnutdun carthorse with a conspicuous spinal stripe with
    distinct traces of shoulderstripes but none on the legs i could
    add other cases my son made a sketch for me of a large heavy
    belgian carthorse of a fallowdun with a conspicuous spinal
    stripe traces of legstripes and with two parallel three inches
    apart stripes about seven or eight inches in length on both
    shoulders i have seen another rather light carthorse of a dirty
    dark creamcolour with striped legs and on one shoulder a large
    illdefined dark cloudy patch and on the opposite shoulder two
    parallel faint stripes all the cases yet mentioned are duns of
    various tints but mr w w edwards has seen a nearly thoroughbred
    chestnut horse which had the spinal stripe and distinct bars on
    the legs and i have seen two bay carriagehorses with black spinal
    stripes one of these horses had on each shoulder a light
    shoulderstripe and the other had a broad back illdefined stripe
    running obliquely halfway down each shoulder neither had
    legstripes
    the most interesting case which i have met with occurred in a colt
    of my own breeding a bay mare descended from a darkbrown flemish
    mare by a light grey turcoman horse was put to hercules a
    thoroughbred dark bay whose sire kingston and dam were both
    bays the colt ultimately turned out brown but when only a
    fortnight old it was a dirty bay shaded with mousegrey and in
    parts with a yellowish tint it had only a trace of the spinal
    stripe with a few obscure transverse bars on the legs but almost
    the whole body was marked with very narrow dark stripes in most
    parts so obscure as to be visible only in certain lights like the
    stripes which may be seen on black kittens these stripes were
    distinct on the hindquarters where they diverged from the spine
    and pointed a little forwards many of them as they diverged became
    a little branched exactly in the same manner as in some zebrine
    species the stripes were plainest on the forehead between the
    ears where they formed a set of pointed arches one under the
    other decreasing in size downwards towards the muzzle exactly
    similar marks may be seen on the forehead of the quagga and
    burchells zebra when this foal was two or three months old all
    the stripes entirely disappeared i have seen similar marks on the
    forehead of a fully grown fallowdun coblike horse having a
    conspicuous spinal stripe and with its front legs well barred
    in norway the colour of the native horse or pony is dun varying
    from almost creamcolour to darkmouse dun and an animal is not
    considered purely bred unless it has the spinal and
    legstripes34 my son estimated that about a third of the ponies
    which he saw there had striped legs he counted seven stripes on
    the forelegs and two on the hindlegs of one pony only a few of
    them exhibited traces of shoulder stripes but i have heard of a
    cob imported from norway which had the shoulder as well as the
    other stripes well developed colonel h smith35 alludes to
    dunhorses with the spinal stripe in the sierras of spain and the
    horses originally derived from spain in some parts of south
    america are now duns sir w elliot informs me that he inspected a
    herd of 300 south american horses imported into madras and many of
    these had transverse stripes on the legs and short
    shoulderstripes the most strongly marked individual of which a
    coloured drawing was sent me was a mousedun with the
    shoulderstripes slightly forked
    in the northwestern parts of india striped horses of more than one
    breed are apparently commoner than in any other part of the world
    and i have received information respecting them from several
    officers especially from colonel poole colonel curtis major
    campbell brigadier st john and others the kattywar horses are
    often fifteen or sixteen hands in height and are well but lightly
    built they are of all colours but the several kinds of duns
    prevail and these are so generally striped that a horse without
    stripes is not considered pure colonel poole believes that all the
    duns have the spinal stripe the legstripes are generally present
    and he thinks that about half the horses have the shoulderstripe
    this stripe is sometimes double or treble on both shoulders
    colonel poole has often seen stripes on the cheeks and sides of the
    nose he has seen stripes on the grey and bay kattywars when first
    foaled but they soon faded away i have received other accounts of
    creamcoloured bay brown and grey kattywar horses being striped
    eastward of india the shan north of burmah ponies as i am
    informed by mr blyth have spinal leg and shoulder stripes sir
    w elliot informs me that he saw two bay pegu ponies with
    legstripes burmese and javanese ponies are frequently
    duncoloured and have the three kinds of stripes in the same
    degree as in england36 mr swinhoe informs me that he examined
    two lightdun ponies of two chinese breeds viz those of shanghai
    and amoy both had the spinal stripe and the latter an indistinct
    shoulderstripe
    we thus see that in all parts of the world breeds of the horse as
    different as possible when of a duncolour including under this
    term a wide range of tint from cream to dusty black and rarely
    when almost white tinged with yellow grey bay and chestnut have
    the several abovespecified stripes horses which are of a yellow
    colour with white mane and tail and which are sometimes called
    duns i have never seen with stripes37
    from reasons which will be apparent in the chapter on reversion i
    have endeavoured but with poor success to discover whether duns
    which are so much oftener striped than other coloured horses are
    ever produced from the crossing of two horses neither of which are
    duns most persons to whom i have applied believe that one parent
    must be dun and it is generally asserted that when this is the
    case the duncolour and the stripes are strongly inherited38
    one case however has fallen under my own observation of a foal
    from a black mare by a bay horse which when fully grown was a dark
    fallowdun and had a narrow but plain spinal stripe hofacker39
    gives two instances of mouseduns mausrapp being produced from
    two parents of different colours and neither duns
    the stripes of all kinds are generally plainer in the foal than in
    the adult horse being commonly lost at the first shedding of the
    hair40 colonel poole believes that the stripes in the kattywar
    breed are plainest when the colt is first foaled they then become
    less and less distinct till after the first coat is shed when they
    come out as strongly as before but certainly often fade away as
    the age of the horse increases two other accounts confirm this
    fading of the stripes in old horses in india one writer on the
    other hand states that colts are often born without stripes but
    that they appear as the colt grows older three authorities affirm
    that in norway the stripes are less plain in the foal than in the
    adult in the case described by me of the young foal which was
    narrowly striped over nearly all its body there was no doubt about
    the early and complete disappearance of the stripes mr w w
    edwards examined for me twentytwo foals of racehorses and twelve
    had the spinal stripe more or less plain this fact and some other
    accounts which i have received lead me to believe that the spinal
    stripe often disappears in the english racehorse when old with
    natural species the young often exhibit characters which disappear
    at maturity
the stripes are variable in colour but are always darker than the rest
of the body they do not by any means always coexist on the different
parts of the body the legs may be striped without any shoulderstripe
or the converse case which is rarer may occur but i have never heard
of either shoulder or legstripes without the spinal stripe the latter
is by far the commonest of all the stripes as might have been
expected as it characterises the other seven or eight species of the
genus it is remarkable that so trifling a character as the
shoulderstripe being double or triple should occur in such different
breeds as welch and devonshire ponies the shan pony heavy
carthorses light south american horses and the lanky kattywar breed
colonel hamilton smith believes that one of his five supposed primitive
stocks was duncoloured and striped and that the stripes in all the
other breeds result from ancient crosses with this one primitive dun
but it is extremely improbable that different breeds living in such
distant quarters of the world should all have been crossed with any one
aboriginally distinct stock nor have we any reason to believe that the
effects of a cross at a very remote period would be propagated for so
many generations as is implied on this view
    with respect to the primitive colour of the horse having been dun
    colonel hamilton smith41 has collected a large body of evidence
    showing that this tint was common in the east as far back as the
    time of alexander and that the wild horses of western asia and
    eastern europe now are or recently were of various shades of dun
    it seems that not very long ago a wild breed of duncoloured horses
    with a spinal stripe was preserved in the royal parks in prussia i
    hear from hungary that the inhabitants of that country look at the
    duns with a spinal stripe as the aboriginal stock and so it is in
    norway duncoloured ponies are not rare in the mountainous parts
    of devonshire wales and scotland where the aboriginal breed
    would have the best chance of being preserved in south america in
    the time of azara when the horse had been feral for about 250
    years 90 out of 100 horses were baichtains and the remaining
    ten were zains that is brown not more than one in 2000 being
    black in north america the feral horses show a strong tendency to
    become roans of various shades but in certain parts as i hear
    from dr canfield they are mostly duns and striped42
in the following chapters on the pigeon we shall see that a blue bird
is occasionally produced by pure breeds of various colours and that
when this occurs certain black marks invariably appear on the wings and
tail so again when variously coloured breeds are crossed blue birds
with the same black marks are frequently produced we shall further see
that these facts are explained by and afford strong evidence in favour
of the view that all the breeds are descended from the rockpigeon or
 columba livia which is thus coloured and marked but the appearance
of the stripes on the various breeds of the horse when of a dun
colour does not afford nearly such good evidence of their descent from
a single primitive stock as in the case of the pigeon because no horse
certainly wild is known as a standard of comparison because the
stripes when they appear are variable in character because there is
far from sufficient evidence that the crossing of distinct breeds
produces stripes and lastly because all the species of the genus
equus have the spinal stripe and several species have shoulder and leg
stripes nevertheless the similarity in the most distinct breeds in
their general range of colour in their dappling and in the occasional
appearance especially in duns of legstripes and of double or triple
shoulderstripes taken together indicate the probability of the
descent of all the existing races from a single duncoloured more or
less striped primitive stock to which our horses occasionally revert
the ass
    four species of asses besides three zebras have been described by
    naturalists there is now little doubt that our domesticated animal
    is descended from the equus tniopus of abyssinia43 the ass is
    sometimes advanced as an instance of an animal domesticated as we
    know by the old testament from an ancient period which has varied
    only in a very slight degree but this is by no means strictly
    true for in syria alone there are four breeds44 first a light
    and graceful animal with an agreeable gait used by ladies
    secondly an arab breed reserved exclusively for the saddle
    thirdly a stouter animal used for ploughing and various purposes
    and lastly the large damascus breed with a peculiarly long body
    and ears in the south of france also there are several breeds and
    one of extraordinary size some individuals being as tall as
    fullsized horses although the ass in england is by no means
    uniform in appearance distinct breeds have not been formed this
    may probably be accounted for by the animal being kept chiefly by
    poor persons who do not rear large numbers nor carefully match
    and select the young for as we shall see in a future chapter the
    ass can with ease be greatly improved in size and strength by
    careful selection combined no doubt with good food and we may
    infer that all its other characters would be equally amenable to
    selection the small size of the ass in england and northern europe
    is apparently due far more to want of care in breeding than to
    cold for in western india where the ass is used as a beast of
    burden by some of the lower castes it is not much larger than a
    newfoundland dog being generally not more than from twenty to
    thirty inches high45
    the ass varies greatly in colour and its legs especially the
    forelegs both in england and other countriesfor instance in
    chinaare occasionally barred more plainly than those of
    duncoloured horses thirteen or fourteen transverse stripes have
    been counted on both the fore and hind legs with the horse the
    occasional appearance of legstripes was accounted for by reversion
    to a supposed parentform and in the case of the ass we may
    confidently believe in this explanation as e tniopus is known
    to be barred though only in a slight degree and not quite
    invariably the stripes are believed to occur most frequently and
    to be plainest on the legs of the domestic ass during early
    youth46 as likewise occurs with the horse the shoulderstripe
    which is so eminently characteristic of the species is
    nevertheless variable in breadth length and manner of
    termination i have measured one four times as broad as another
    and some more than twice as long as others in one lightgrey ass
    the shoulderstripe was only six inches in length and as thin as a
    piece of string and in another animal of the same colour there was
    only a dusky shade representing a stripe i have heard of three
    white asses not albinoes with no trace of shoulder or spinal
    stripes47 and i have seen nine other asses with no
    shoulderstripe and some of them had no spinal stripe three of
    the nine were lightgreys one a darkgrey another grey passing
    into reddishroan and the others were brown two being tinted on
    parts of their bodies with a reddish or bay shade if therefore
    grey and reddishbrown asses had been steadily selected and bred
    from the shoulder stripe would probably have been lost almost as
    generally and completely as in the case of the horse
    the shoulder stripe on the ass is sometimes double and mr blyth
    has seen even three or four parallel stripes48 i have observed
    in ten cases shoulderstripes abruptly truncated at the lower end
    with the anterior angle produced into a tapering point precisely
    as in the above dun devonshire pony i have seen three cases of the
    terminal portion abruptly and angularly bent and have seen and
    heard of four cases of a distinct though slight forking of the
    stripe in syria dr hooker and his party observed for me no less
    than five similar instances of the shoulderstripe plainly
    bifurcating over the fore leg in the common mule it likewise
    sometimes bifurcates when i first noticed the forking and angular
    bending of the shoulderstripe i had seen enough of the stripes in
    the various equine species to feel convinced that even a character
    so unimportant as this had a distinct meaning and was thus led to
    attend to the subject i now find that in the e burchellii and
    quagga the stripe which corresponds with the shoulderstripe of
    the ass as well as some of the stripes on the neck bifurcate and
    that some of those near the shoulder have their extremities bent
    angularly backwards the bifurcation and angular bending of the
    stripes on the shoulders apparently are connected with the nearly
    upright stripes on the sides of the body and neck changing their
    direction and becoming transverse on the legs finally we see that
    the presence of shoulder leg and spinal stripes in the horse
    their occasional absence in the assthe occurrence of double and
    triple shoulderstripes in both animals and the similar manner in
    which these stripes terminate downwardsare all cases of analogous
    variation in the horse and ass these cases are probably not due to
    similar conditions acting on similar constitutions but to a
    partial reversion in colour to the common progenitor of the genus
    we shall hereafter return to this subject and discuss it more
    fully

    the breeds of the pig have recently been more closely studied
    though much still remains to be done than those of almost any
    other domesticated animal this has been effected by hermann von
    nathusius in two admirable works especially in the later one on
    the skulls of the several races and by rtimeyer in his celebrated
    fauna of the ancient swiss lakedwellings1 nathusius has shown
    that all the known breeds may be divided into two great groups one
    resembling in all important respects and no doubt descended from
    the common wild boar so that this may be called the sus scrofa
    group the other group differs in several important and constant
    osteological characters its wild parentform is unknown the name
    given to it by nathusius according to the law of priority is 
    sus indicus of pallas this name must now be followed though an
    unfortunate one as the wild aboriginal does not inhabit india and
    the bestknown domesticated breeds have been imported from siam and
    china
    first for the sus scrofa breeds or those resembling the common
    wild boar these still exist according to nathusius
    schweineschdel s 75 in various parts of central and northern
    europe formerly every kingdom2 and almost every province in
    britain possessed its own native breed but these are now
    everywhere rapidly disappearing being replaced by improved breeds
    crossed with the s indicus form the skull in the breeds of the
     s scrofa type resembles in all important respects that of the
    european wild boar but it has become schweineschdel s 6368
    higher and broader relatively to its length and the hinder part is
    more upright the differences however are all variable in degree
    the breeds which thus resemble s scrofa in their essential skull
    characters differ conspicuously from each other in other respects
    as in the length of the ears and legs curvature of the ribs
    colour hairiness size and proportions of the body
    the wild sus scrofa has a wide range namely europe north
    africa as identified by osteological characters by rtimeyer and
    hindostan as similarly identified by nathusius but the wild boars
    inhabiting these several countries differ so much from each other
    in external characters that they have been ranked by some
    naturalists as specifically distinct even within hindostan these
    animals according to mr blyth form very distinct races in the
    different districts in the n western provinces as i am informed
    by the rev r everest the boar never exceeds 36 inches in height
    whilst in bengal one has been measured 44 inches in height in
    europe northern africa and hindostan domestic pigs have been
    known to cross with the wild native species3 and in hindostan an
    accurate observer4 sir walter elliot after describing the
    differences between wild indian and wild german boars remarks that
    the same differences are perceptible in the domesticated
    individuals of the two countries we may therefore conclude that
    the breeds of the sus scrofa type are descended from or have
    been modified by crossing with forms which may be ranked as
    geographical races but which according to some naturalists ought
    to be ranked as distinct species
pigs of the sus indicus type are best known to englishmen under the
form of the chinese breed the skull of s indicus as described by
nathusius differs from that of s scrofa in several minor respects
as in its greater breadth and in some details in the teeth but chiefly
in the shortness of the lachrymal bones in the greater width of the
fore part of the palatebones and in the divergence of the premolar
teeth it deserves especial notice that these latter characters are not
gained even in the least degree by the domesticated forms of s
scrofa after reading the remarks and descriptions given by nathusius
it seems to me to be merely playing with words to doubt whether s
indicus ought to be ranked as a species for the abovespecified
differences are more strongly marked than any that can be pointed out
between for instance the fox and the wolf or the ass and the horse
as already stated s indicus is not known in a wild state but its
domesticated forms according to nathusius come near to s vittatus
of java and some allied species a pig found wild in the aru islands
schweineschdel s 169 is apparently identical with s indicus
but it is doubtful whether this is a truly native animal the
domesticated breeds of china cochinchina and siam belong to this
type the roman or neapolitan breed the andalusian the hungarian and
the krause swine of nathusius inhabiting southeastern europe and
turkey and having fine curly hair and the small swiss
bndtnerschwein of rtimeyer all agree in their more important
skullcharacters with s indicus and as is supposed have all been
largely crossed with this form pigs of this type have existed during a
long period on the shores of the mediterranean for a figure
schweineschdel s 142 closely resembling the existing neapolitan
pig was found in the buried city of herculaneum
    rtimeyer has made the remarkable discovery that there lived
    contemporaneously in switzerland during the neolithic period two
    domesticated forms the s scrofa and the s scrofa palustris
    or torfschwein rtimeyer perceived that the latter approached the
    eastern breeds and according to nathusius it certainly belongs
    to the s indicus group but rtimeyer has subsequently shown
    that it differs in some wellmarked characters this author was
    formerly convinced that his torfschwein existed as a wild animal
    during the first part of the stone period and was domesticated
    during a later part of the same period5 nathusius whilst he
    fully admits the curious fact first observed by rtimeyer that the
    bones of domesticated and wild animals can be distinguished by
    their different aspect yet from special difficulties in the case
    of the bones of the pig schweineschdel s 147 is not
    convinced of the truth of the above conclusion and rtimeyer
    himself seems now to feel some doubt other naturalists have also
    argued strongly on the same side as nathusius6
    several breeds differing in the proportions of the body in the
    length of the ears in the nature of the hair in colour etc
    come under the s indicus type nor is this surprising
    considering how ancient the domestication of this form has been
    both in europe and in china in this latter country the date is
    believed by an eminent chinese scholar7 to go back at least 4900
    years from the present time this same scholar alludes to the
    existence of many local varieties of the pig in china and at the
    present time the chinese take extraordinary pains in feeding and
    tending their pigs not even allowing them to walk from place to
    place8 hence these pigs as nathusius has remarked9 display
    in an eminent degree the characters of a highlycultivated race
    and hence no doubt their high value in the improvement of our
    european breeds nathusius makes a remarkable statement
    schweineschdel s 138 that the infusion of the 132nd or
    even of the 164th part of the blood of s indicus into a breed
    of s scrofa is sufficient plainly to modify the skull of the
    latter species this singular fact may perhaps be accounted for by
    several of the chief distinctive characters of s indicus such
    as the shortness of the lachrymal bones etc being common to
    several species of the genus for in crosses characters which are
    common to many species apparently tend to be prepotent over those
    appertaining to only a few species
illustration fig 2head of japan or masked pig
    the japan pig s pliciceps of gray which was formerly
    exhibited in the zoological gardens has an extraordinary
    appearance from its short head broad forehead and nose great
    fleshy ears and deeply furrowed skin figure 2 is copied from that
    given by mr bartlett10 not only is the face furrowed but thick
    folds of skin which are harder than the other parts almost like
    the plates on the indian rhinoceros hang about the shoulders and
    rump it is coloured black with white feet and breeds true that
    it has long been domesticated there can be little doubt and this
    might have been inferred even from the fact that its young are not
    longitudinally striped for this is a character common to all the
    species included within the genus sus and the allied genera
    whilst in their natural state11 dr gray12 has described the
    skull of this animal which he ranks not only as a distinct
    species but places it in a distinct section of the genus
    nathusius however after his careful study of the whole group
    states positively schweineschdel s 153158 that the skull in
    all essential characters closely resembles that of the shorteared
    chinese breed of the s indicus type hence nathusius considers
    the japan pig as only a domesticated variety of s indicus if
    this really be the case it is a wonderful instance of the amount
    of modification which can be effected under domestication
    formerly there existed in the central islands of the pacific ocean
    a singular breed of pigs these are described by the rev d
    tyerman and g bennett13 as of small size humpbacked with a
    disproportionately long head with short ears turned backwards
    with a bushy tail not more than two inches in length placed as if
    it grew from the back within half a century after the introduction
    of european and chinese pigs into these islands the native breed
    according to the above authors became almost completely lost by
    being repeatedly crossed with them secluded islands as might have
    been expected seem favourable for the production or retention of
    peculiar breeds thus in the orkney islands the hogs have been
    described as very small with erect and sharp ears and with an
    appearance altogether different from the hogs brought from the
    south14
seeing how different the chinese pigs belonging to the sus indicus
type are in their osteological characters and in external appearance
from the pigs of the s scrofa type so that they must be considered
specifically distinct it is a fact well deserving attention that
chinese and common pigs have been repeatedly crossed in various
manners with unimpaired fertility one great breeder who had used pure
chinese pigs assured me that the fertility of the halfbreeds inter
se and of their recrossed progeny was actually increased and this is
the general belief of agriculturists again the japan pig or s
pliciceps of gray is so distinct in appearance from all common pigs
that it stretches ones belief to the utmost to admit that it is simply
a domestic variety yet this breed has been found perfectly fertile
with the berkshire breed and mr eyton informs me that he paired a
halfbred brother and sister and found them quite fertile together
illustration fig 3head of wild boar and of golden days a pig of
the yorkshire large breed
    the modification of the skull in the most highly cultivated races
    is wonderful to appreciate the amount of change nathusius work
    with its excellent figures should be studied the whole of the
    exterior in all its parts has been altered the hinder surface
    instead of sloping backwards is directed forwards entailing many
    changes in other parts the front of the head is deeply concave
    the orbits have a different shape the auditory meatus has a
    different direction and shape the incisors of the upper and lower
    jaws do not touch each other and they stand in both jaws beyond
    the plane of the molars the canines of the upper jaw stand in
    front of those of the lower jaw and this is a remarkable anomaly
    the articular surfaces of the occipital condyles are so greatly
    changed in shape that as nathusius remarks s 133 no
    naturalist seeing this important part of the skull by itself
    would suppose that it belonged to the genus sus these and various
    other modifications as nathusius observes can hardly be
    considered as monstrosities for they are not injurious and are
    strictly inherited the whole head is much shortened thus whilst
    in common breeds its length to that of the body is as 1 to 6 in
    the culturracen the proportion is as 1 to 9 and even recently
    as 1 to 1115 the following woodcut16 of the head of a wild
    boar and of a sow from a photograph of the yorkshire large breed
    may aid in showing how greatly the head in a highly cultivated race
    has been modified and shortened
    nathusius has well discussed the causes of the remarkable changes
    in the skull and shape of the body which the highly cultivated
    races have undergone these modifications occur chiefly in the pure
    and crossed races of the s indicus type but their commencement
    may be clearly detected in the slightly improved breeds of the s
    scrofa type17 nathusius states positively s 99 103 as the
    result of common experience and of his experiments that rich and
    abundant food given during youth tends by some direct action to
    make the head broader and shorter and that poor food works a
    contrary result he lays much stress on the fact that all wild and
    semidomesticated pigs in ploughing up the ground with their
    muzzles have whilst young to exert the powerful muscles fixed to
    the hinder part of the head in highly cultivated races this habit
    is no longer followed and consequently the back of the skull
    becomes modified in shape entailing other changes in other parts
    there can hardly be a doubt that so great a change in habits would
    affect the skull but it seems rather doubtful how far this will
    account for the greatly reduced length of the skull and for its
    concave front it is well known nathusius himself advancing many
    cases s 104 that there is a strong tendency in many domestic
    animalsin bull and pugdogs in the niata cattle in sheep in
    polish fowls shortfaced tumbler pigeons and in one variety of
    the carpfor the bones of the face to become greatly shortened in
    the case of the dog as h mller has shown this seems caused by
    an abnormal state of the primordial cartilage we may however
    readily admit that abundant and rich food supplied during many
    generations would give an inherited tendency to increased size of
    body and that from disuse the limbs would become finer and
    shorter18 we shall in a future chapter see also that the skull
    and limbs are apparently in some manner correlated so that any
    change in the one tends to affect the other
    nathusius has remarked and the observation is an interesting one
    that the peculiar form of the skull and body in the most highly
    cultivated races is not characteristic of any one race but is
    common to all when improved up to the same standard thus the
    largebodied longeared english breeds with a convex back and
    the smallbodied shorteared chinese breeds with a concave back
    when bred to the same state of perfection nearly resemble each
    other in the form of the head and body this result it appears is
    partly due to similar causes of change acting on the several races
    and partly to man breeding the pig for one sole purpose namely
    for the greatest amount of flesh and fat so that selection has
    always tended towards one and the same end with most domestic
    animals the result of selection has been divergence of character
    here it has been convergence19
    the nature of the food supplied during many generations has
    apparently affected the length of the intestines for according to
    cuvier20 their length to that of the body in the wild boar is as
    9 to 1in the common domestic boar as 135 to 1and in the siam
    breed as 16 to 1 in this latter breed the greater length may be
    due either to descent from a distinct species or to more ancient
    domestication the number of mamm vary as does the period of
    gestation the latest authority says21 that the period averages
    from 17 to 20 weeks but i think there must be some error in this
    statement in m tessiers observations on 25 sows it varied from
    109 to 123 days the rev w d fox has given me ten carefully
    recorded cases with wellbred pigs in which the period varied from
    101 to 116 days according to nathusius the period is shortest in
    the races which come early to maturity but the course of their
    development does not appear to be actually shortened for the young
    animal is born judging from the state of the skull less fully
    developed or in a more embryonic condition22 than in the case
    of common swine in the highly cultivated and early matured races
    the teeth also are developed earlier
    the difference in the number of the vertebr and ribs in different
    kinds of pigs as observed by mr eyton23 and as given in the
    following table has often been quoted the african sow probably
    belongs to the s scrofa type and mr eyton informs me that
    since the publication of this paper crossbred animals from the
    african and english races were found by lord hill to be perfectly

    some semimonstrous breeds deserve notice from the time of
    aristotle to the present time solidhoofed swine have occasionally
    been observed in various parts of the world although this
    peculiarity is strongly inherited it is hardly probable that all
    the animals with solid hoofs have descended from the same parents
    it is more probable that the same peculiarity has reappeared at
    various times and places dr struthers has lately described and
    figured24 the structure of the feet in both front and hind feet
    the distal phalanges of the two greater toes are represented by a
    single great hoofbearing phalanx and in the front feet the
    middle phalanges are represented by a bone which is single towards
    the lower end but bears two separate articulations towards the
    upper end from other accounts it appears that an intermediate toe
    is likewise sometimes superadded
illustration old irish pig with jawappendages
    another curious anomaly is offered by the appendages described by
    m eudesdeslongchamps as often characterizing the normandy pigs
    these appendages are always attached to the same spot to the
    corners of the jaw they are cylindrical about three inches in
    length covered with bristles and with a pencil of bristles rising
    out of a sinus on one side they have a cartilaginous centre with
    two small longitudinal muscles they occur either symmetrically on
    both sides of the face or on one side alone richardson figures
    them on the gaunt old irish greyhound pig and nathusius states
    that they occasionally appear in all the long eared races but are
    not strictly inherited for they occur or fail in animals of the
    same litter25 as no wild pigs are known to have analogous
    appendages we have at present no reason to suppose that their
    appearance is due to reversion and if this be so we are forced to
    admit that a somewhat complex though apparently useless structure
    may be suddenly developed without the aid of selection
it is a remarkable fact that the boars of all domesticated breeds have
much shorter tusks than wild boars many facts show that with many
animals the state of the hair is much affected by exposure to or
protection from climate and as we see that the state of the hair and
teeth are correlated in turkish dogs other analogous facts will be
hereafter given may we not venture to surmise that the reduction of
the tusks in the domestic boar is related to his coat of bristles being
diminished from living under shelter on the other hand as we shall
immediately see the tusks and bristles reappear with feral boars
which are no longer protected from the weather it is not surprising
that the tusks should be more affected than the other teeth as parts
developed to serve as secondary sexual characters are always liable to
much variation
    it is a wellknown fact that the young of wild european and indian
    pigs26 for the first six months are longitudinally banded with
    lightcoloured stripes this character generally disappears under
    domestication the turkish domestic pigs however have striped
    young as have those of westphalia whatever may be their
    hue27 whether these latter pigs belong to the same curlyhaired
    race as the turkish swine i do not know the pigs which have run
    wild in jamaica and the semiferal pigs of new granada both those
    which are black and those which are black with a white band across
    the stomach often extending over the back have resumed this
    aboriginal character and produce longitudinallystriped young this
    is likewise the case at least occasionally with the neglected
    pigs in the zambesi settlement on the coast of africa28
    the common belief that all domesticated animals when they run
    wild revert completely to the character of their parentstock is
    chiefly founded as far as i can discover on feral pigs but even
    in this case the belief is not grounded on sufficient evidence for
    the two main types namely s scrofa and indicus have not
    been distinguished the young as we have just seen reacquire
    their longitudinal stripes and the boars invariably reassume their
    tusks they revert also in the general shape of their bodies and
    in the length of their legs and muzzles to the state of the wild
    animal as might have been expected from the amount of exercise
    which they are compelled to take in search of food in jamaica the
    feral pigs do not acquire the full size of the european wild boar
    never attaining a greater height than 20 inches at the shoulder
    in various countries they reassume their original bristly covering
    but in different degrees dependent on the climate thus according
    to roulin the semiferal pigs in the hot valleys of new granada
    are very scantily clothed whereas on the paramos at the height
    of 7000 to 8000 feet they acquire a thick covering of wool lying
    under the bristles like that on the truly wild pigs of france
    these pigs on the paramos are small and stunted the wild boar of
    india is said to have the bristles at the end of its tail arranged
    like the plumes of an arrow whilst the european boar has a simple
    tuft and it is a curious fact that many but not all of the feral
    pigs in jamaica derived from a spanish stock have a plumed
    tail29 with respect to colour feral pigs generally revert to
    that of the wild boar but in certain parts of s america as we
    have seen some of the semiferal pigs have a curious white band
    across their stomachs and in certain other hot places the pigs are
    red and this colour has likewise occasionally been observed in the
    feral pigs of jamaica from these several facts we see that with
    pigs when feral there is a strong tendency to revert to the wild
    type but that this tendency is largely governed by the nature of
    the climate amount of exercise and other causes of change to
    which they have been subjected
    the last point worth notice is that we have unusually good evidence
    of breeds of pigs now keeping perfectly true which have been
    formed by the crossing of several distinct breeds the improved
    essex pigs for instance breed very true but there is no doubt
    that they largely owe their present excellent qualities to crosses
    originally made by lord western with the neapolitan race and to
    subsequent crosses with the berkshire breed this also having been
    improved by neapolitan crosses and likewise probably with the
    sussex breed30 in breeds thus formed by complex crosses the
    most careful and unremitting selection during many generations has
    been found to be indispensable chiefly in consequence of so much
    crossing some wellknown breeds have undergone rapid changes
    thus according to nathusius31 the berkshire breed of 1780 is
    quite different from that of 1810 and since this latter period
    at least two distinct forms have borne the same name
cattle
    domestic cattle are certainly the descendants of more than one wild
    form in the same manner as has been shown to be the case with our
    dogs and pigs naturalists have generally made two main divisions
    of cattle the humped kinds inhabiting tropical countries called
    in india zebus to which the specific name of  bos indicus has
    been given and the common nonhumped cattle generally included
    under the name of bos taurus the humped cattle were
    domesticated as may be seen on the egyptian monuments at least as
    early as the twelfth dynasty that is 2100 bc they differ from
    common cattle in various osteological characters even in a greater
    degree according to rtimeyer32 than do the fossil and
    prehistoric european species namely bos primigenius and 
    longifrons from each other they differ also as mr blyth33
    who has particularly attended to this subject remarks in general
    configuration in the shape of their ears in the point where the
    dewlap commences in the typical curvature of their horns in their
    manner of carrying their heads when at rest in their ordinary
    variations of colour especially in the frequent presence of
    nilgaulike markings on their feet and in the one being born
    with teeth protruding through the jaws and the other not so they
    have different habits and their voice is entirely different the
    humped cattle in india seldom seek shade and never go into the
    water and there stand kneedeep like the cattle of europe they
    have run wild in parts of oude and rohilcund and can maintain
    themselves in a region infested by tigers they have given rise to
    many races differing greatly in size in the presence of one or two
    humps in length of horns and other respects mr blyth sums up
    emphatically that the humped and humpless cattle must be considered
    as distinct species when we consider the number of points in
    external structure and habits independently of important
    osteological differences in which they differ from each other and
    that many of these points are not likely to have been affected by
    domestication there can hardly be a doubt notwithstanding the
    adverse opinion of some naturalists that the humped and nonhumped
    cattle must be ranked as specifically distinct
    the european breeds of humpless cattle are numerous professor low
    enumerates 19 british breeds only a few of which are identical
    with those on the continent even the small channel islands of
    guernsey jersey and alderney possess their own subbreeds34
    and these again differ from the cattle of the other british
    islands such as anglesea and the western isles of scotland
    desmarest who paid attention to the subject describes 15 french
    races excluding subvarieties and those imported from other
    countries in other parts of europe there are several distinct
    races such as the palecoloured hungarian cattle with their light
    and free step and enormous horns sometimes measuring above five
    feet from tip to tip35 the podolian cattle also are remarkable
    from the height of their forequarters in the most recent work on
    cattle36 engravings are given of fiftyfive european breeds it
    is however probable that several of these differ very little from
    each other or are merely synonyms it must not be supposed that
    numerous breeds of cattle exist only in longcivilised countries
    for we shall presently see that several kinds are kept by the
    savages of southern africa
    with respect to the parentage of the several european breeds we
    already know much from nilssons memoir37 and more especially
    from rtimeyers works and those of boyd dawkins two or three
    species or forms of bos closely allied to still living domestic
    races have been found in the more recent tertiary deposits or
    amongst prehistoric remains in europe following rtimeyer we
    have
    bos primigeniusthis magnificent well known species was
    domesticated in switzerland during the neolithic period even at
    this early period it varied a little having apparently been
    crossed with other races some of the larger races on the
    continent as the friesland etc and the pembroke race in
    england closely resemble in essential structure b primigenius
    and no doubt are its descendants this is likewise the opinion of
    nilsson bos primigenius existed as a wild animal in csars
    time and is now semiwild though much degenerated in size in the
    park of chillingham for i am informed by professor rtimeyer to
    whom lord tankerville sent a skull that the chillingham cattle are
    less altered from the true primigenius type than any other known
    breed38
    bos trochoceros this form is not included in the three species
    above mentioned for it is now considered by rtimeyer to be the
    female of an early domesticated form of b primigenius and as
    the progenitor of his frontosus race i may add that specific
    names have been given to four other fossil oxen now believed to be
    identical with b primigenius39
    bos longifrons or  brachyceros of owenthis very distinct
    species was of small size and had a short body with fine legs
    according to boyd dawkins40 it was introduced as a domesticated
    animal into britain at a very early period and supplied food to
    the roman legionaries41 some remains have been found in ireland
    in certain crannoges of which the dates are believed to be from
    843933 ad42 it was also the commonest form in a domesticated
    condition in switzerland during the earliest part of the neolithic
    period professor owen43 thinks it probable that the welsh and
    highland cattle are descended from this form as likewise is the
    case according to rtimeyer with some of the existing swiss
    breeds these latter are of different shades of colour from
    lightgrey to blackishbrown with a lighter stripe along the
    spine but they have no pure white marks the cattle of north wales
    and the highlands on the other hand are generally black or
    darkcoloured
    bos frontosus of nilssonthis species is allied to b
    longifrons and according to the high authority of mr boyd
    dawkins is identical with it but in the opinion of some judges is
    distinct both coexisted in scania during the same late geological
    period44 and both have been found in the irish crannoges45
    nilsson believes that his b frontosus may be the parent of the
    mountain cattle of norway which have a high protuberance on the
    skull between the base of the horns as professor owen and others
    believe that the scotch highland cattle are descended from his b
    longifrons it is worth notice that a capable judge46 has
    remarked that he saw no cattle in norway like the highland breed
    but that they more nearly resembled the devonshire breed
    on the whole we may conclude more especially from the researches
    of boyd dawkins that european cattle are descended from two
    species and there is no improbability in this fact for the genus
    bos readily yields to domestication besides these two species and
    the zebu the yak the gayal and the arni47 not to mention the
    buffalo or genus bubalus have been domesticated making altogether
    six species of bos the zebu and the two european species are now
    extinct in a wild state although certain races of cattle were
    domesticated at a very ancient period in europe it does not follow
    that they were first domesticated here those who place much
    reliance on philology argue that they were imported from the
    east48 it is probable that they originally inhabited a temperate
    or cold climate but not a land long covered with snow for our
    cattle as we have seen in the chapter on horses have not the
    instinct of scraping away the snow to get at the herbage beneath
    no one could behold the magnificent wild bulls on the bleak
    falkland islands in the southern hemisphere and doubt about the
    climate being admirably suited to them azara has remarked that in
    the temperate regions of la plata the cows conceive when two years
    old whilst in the much hotter country of paraguay they do not
    conceive till three years old from which fact as he adds one
    may conclude that cattle do not succeed so well in warm
    countries49
    bos primigenius and longifrons have been ranked by nearly all
    palontologists as distinct species and it would not be reasonable
    to take a different view simply because their domesticated
    descendants now intercross with the utmost freedom all the
    european breeds have so often been crossed both intentionally and
    unintentionally that if any sterility had ensued from such
    unions it would certainly have been detected as zebus inhabit a
    distant and much hotter region and as they differ in so many
    characters from our european cattle i have taken pains to
    ascertain whether the two forms are fertile when crossed the late
    lord powis imported some zebus and crossed them with common cattle
    in shropshire and i was assured by his steward that the crossbred
    animals were perfectly fertile with both parentstocks mr blyth
    informs me that in india hybrids with various proportions of
    either blood are quite fertile and this can hardly fail to be
    known for in some districts50 the two species are allowed to
    breed freely together most of the cattle which were first
    introduced into tasmania were humped so that at one time thousands
    of crossed animals existed there and mr b oneile wilson ma
    writes to me from tasmania that he has never heard of any sterility
    having been observed he himself formerly possessed a herd of such
    crossed cattle and all were perfectly fertile so much so that he
    cannot remember even a single cow failing to calve these several
    facts afford an important confirmation of the pallasian doctrine
    that the descendants of species which when first domesticated would
    if crossed have been in all probability in some degree sterile
    become perfectly fertile after a long course of domestication in a
    future chapter we shall see that this doctrine throws some light on
    the difficult subject of hybridism
    i have alluded to the cattle in chillingham park which according
    to rtimeyer have been very little changed from the bos
    primigenius type this park is so ancient that it is referred to
    in a record of the year 1220 the cattle in their instincts and
    habits are truly wild they are white with the inside of the ears
    reddishbrown eyes rimmed with black muzzles brown hoofs black
    and horns white tipped with black within a period of thirtythree
    years about a dozen calves were born with brown and blue spots
    upon the cheeks or necks but these together with any defective
    animals were always destroyed according to bewick about the
    year 1770 some calves appeared with black ears but these were also
    destroyed by the keeper and black ears have not since reappeared
    the wild white cattle in the duke of hamiltons park where i have
    heard of the birth of a black calf are said by lord tankerville to
    be inferior to those at chillingham the cattle kept until the year
    1780 by the duke of queensberry but now extinct had their ears
    muzzle and orbits of the eyes black those which have existed from
    time immemorial at chartley closely resemble the cattle at
    chillingham but are larger with some small difference in the
    colour of the ears they frequently tend to become entirely
    black and a singular superstition prevails in the vicinity that
    when a black calf is born some calamity impends over the noble
    house of ferrers all the black calves are destroyed the cattle
    at burton constable in yorkshire now extinct had ears muzzle
    and the tip of the tail black those at gisburne also in
    yorkshire are said by bewick to have been sometimes without dark
    muzzles with the inside alone of the ears brown and they are
    elsewhere said to have been low in stature and hornless51
the several abovespecified differences in the parkcattle slight
though they be are worth recording as they show that animals living
nearly in a state of nature and exposed to nearly uniform conditions
if not allowed to roam freely and to cross with other herds do not
keep as uniform as truly wild animals for the preservation of a
uniform character even within the same park a certain degree of
selectionthat is the destruction of the darkcoloured calvesis
apparently necessary
    boyd dawkins believes that the parkcattle are descended from
    anciently domesticated and not truly wild animals and from the
    occasional appearance of darkcoloured calves it is improbable
    that the aboriginal bos primigenius was white it is curious what
    a strong though not invariable tendency there is in wild or
    escaped cattle to become white with coloured ears under widely
    different conditions of life if the old writers boethius and
    leslie52 can be trusted the wild cattle of scotland were white
    and furnished with a great mane but the colour of their ears is
    not mentioned in wales53 during the tenth century some of the
    cattle are described as being white with red ears four hundred
    cattle thus coloured were sent to king john and an early record
    speaks of a hundred cattle with red ears having been demanded as a
    compensation for some offence but if the cattle were of a dark or
    black colour 150 were to be presented the black cattle of north
    wales apparently belong as we have seen to the small 
    longifrons type and as the alternative was offered of either 150
    dark cattle or 100 white cattle with red ears we may presume that
    the latter were the larger beasts and probably belonged to the
    primigenius type youatt has remarked that at the present day
    whenever cattle of the shorthorn breed are white the extremities
    of their ears are more or less tinged with red
    the cattle which have run wild on the pampas in texas and in two
    parts of africa have become of a nearly uniform dark
    brownishred54 on the ladrone islands in the pacific ocean
    immense herds of cattle which were wild in the year 1741 are
    described as milkwhite except their ears which are generally
    black55 the falkland islands situated far south with all the
    conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive from
    those of the ladrones offer a more interesting case cattle have
    run wild there during eighty or ninety years and in the southern
    districts the animals are mostly white with their feet or whole
    heads or only their ears black but my informant admiral
    sulivan56 who long resided on these islands does not believe
    that they are ever purely white so that in these two archipelagos
    we see that the cattle tend to become white with coloured ears in
    other parts of the falkland islands other colours prevail near
    port pleasant brown is the common tint round mount usborn about
    half the animals in some of the herds were lead or mousecoloured
    which elsewhere is an unusual tint these latter cattle though
    generally inhabiting high land breed about a month earlier than
    the other cattle and this circumstance would aid in keeping them
    distinct and in perpetuating a peculiar colour it is worth
    recalling to mind that blue or leadcoloured marks have
    occasionally appeared on the white cattle of chillingham so
    plainly different were the colours of the wild herds in different
    parts of the falkland islands that in hunting them as admiral
    sulivan informs me white spots in one district and dark spots in
    another district were always looked out for on the distant hills
    in the intermediate districts intermediate colours prevailed
    whatever the cause may be this tendency in the wild cattle of the
    falkland islands which are all descended from a few brought from
    la plata to break up into herds of three different colours is an
    interesting fact
returning to the several british breeds the conspicuous difference in
general appearance between shorthorns longhorns now rarely seen
herefords highland cattle alderneys etc must be familiar to every
one a part of this difference may be attributed to descent from
primordially distinct species but we may feel sure that there has been
a considerable amount of variation even during the neolithic period
the domestic cattle were to a certain extent variable within recent
times most of the breeds have been modified by careful and methodical
selection how strongly the characters thus acquired are inherited may
be inferred from the prices realised by the improved breeds even at
the first sale of collings shorthorns eleven bulls reached an average
of 214 pounds and lately shorthorn bulls have been sold for a thousand
guineas and have been exported to all quarters of the world
    some constitutional differences may be here noticed the shorthorns
    arrive at maturity far earlier than the wilder breeds such as
    those of wales or the highlands this fact has been shown in an
    interesting manner by mr simonds57 who has given a table of the
    average period of their dentition which proves that there is a
    difference of no less than six months in the appearance of the
    permanent incisors the period of gestation from observations made
    by tessier on 1131 cows varies to the extent of eightyone days
    and what is more interesting m lefour affirms that the period of
    gestation is longer in the large german cattle than in the smaller
    breeds58 with respect to the period of conception it seems
    certain that alderney and zetland cows often become pregnant
    earlier than other breeds59 lastly as four fully developed
    mamm is a generic character in the genus bos60 it is worth
    notice that with our domestic cows the two rudimentary mamm often
    become fairly well developed and yield milk
    as numerous breeds are generally found only in longcivilised
    countries it may be well to show that in some countries inhabited
    by barbarous races who are frequently at war with each other and
    therefore have little free communication several distinct breeds
    of cattle now exist or formerly existed at the cape of good hope
    leguat observed in the year 1720 three kinds61 at the present
    day various travellers have noticed the differences in the breeds
    in southern africa sir andrew smith several years ago remarked to
    me that the cattle possessed by the different tribes of caffres
    though living near each other under the same latitude and in the
    same kind of country yet differed and he expressed much surprise
    at the fact mr andersson has described62 the damara bechuana
    and namaqua cattle and he informs me in a letter that the cattle
    north of lake ngami are likewise different as mr galton has heard
    is also the case with the cattle of benguela the namaqua cattle in
    size and shape nearly resemble european cattle and have short
    stout horns and large hoofs the damara cattle are very peculiar
    being bigboned with slender legs and small hard feet their
    tails are adorned with a tuft of long bushy hair nearly touching
    the ground and their horns are extraordinarily large the bechuana
    cattle have even larger horns and there is now a skull in london
    with the two horns 8 ft 814 in long as measured in a straight
    line from tip to tip and no less than 13 ft 5 in as measured
    along their curvature mr andersson in his letter to me says that
    though he will not venture to describe the differences between the
    breeds belonging to the many different subtribes yet such
    certainly exist as shown by the wonderful facility with which the
    natives discriminate them
    that many breeds of cattle have originated through variation
    independently of descent from distinct species we may infer from
    what we see in south america where the genus bos was not endemic
    and where the cattle which now exist in such vast numbers are the
    descendants of a few imported from spain and portugal in columbia
    roulin63 describes two peculiar breeds namely pelones with
    extremely thin and fine hair and calongos absolutely naked
    according to castelnau there are two races in brazil one like
    european cattle the other different with remarkable horns in
    paraguay azara describes a breed which certainly originated in s
    america called chivos because they have straight vertical
    horns conical and very large at the base he likewise describes
    a dwarf race in corrientes with short legs and a body larger than
    usual cattle without horns and others with reversed hair have
    also originated in paraguay
    another monstrous breed called niatas or natas of which i saw two
    small herds on the northern bank of the plata is so remarkable as
    to deserve a fuller description this breed bears the same relation
    to other breeds as bull or pug dogs do to other dogs or as
    improved pigs according to h von nathusius do to common
    pigs64 rtimeyer believes that these cattle belong to the
    primigenius type65 the forehead is very short and broad with
    the nasal end of the skull together with the whole plane of the
    upper molarteeth curved upwards the lower jaw projects beyond
    the upper and has a corresponding upward curvature it is an
    interesting fact that an almost similar confirmation characterizes
    as i am informed by dr falconer the extinct and gigantic
    sivatherium of india and is not known in any other ruminant the
    upper lip is much drawn back the nostrils are seated high up and
    are widely open the eyes project outwards and the horns are
    large in walking the head is carried low and the neck is short
    the hind legs appear to be longer compared with the front legs
    than is usual the exposed incisor teeth the short head and
    upturned nostrils give these cattle the most ludicrous
    selfconfident air of defiance the skull which i presented to the
    college of surgeons has been thus described by professor owen66
    it is remarkable from the stunted development of the nasals
    premaxillaries and forepart of the lower jaw which is unusually
    curved upwards to come into contact with the premaxillaries the
    nasal bones are about onethird the ordinary length but retain
    almost their normal breadth the triangular vacuity is left between
    them the frontal and lachrymal which latter bone articulates with
    the premaxillary and thus excludes the maxillary from any junction
    with the nasal so that even the connexion of some of the bones is
    changed other differences might be added thus the plane of the
    condyles is somewhat modified and the terminal edge of the
    premaxillaries forms an arch in fact on comparison with the skull
    of a common ox scarcely a single bone presents the same exact
    shape and the whole skull has a wonderfully different appearance
the first brief published notice of this race was by azara between the
years 178396 but don f muniz of luxan who has kindly collected
information for me states that about 1760 these cattle were kept as
curiosities near buenos ayres their origin is not positively known
but they must have originated subsequently to the year 1552 when
cattle were first introduced senor muniz informs me that the breed is
believed to have originated with the indians southward of the plata
even to this day those reared near the plata show their less civilised
nature in being fiercer than common cattle and in the cow if visited
too often easily deserting her first calf the breed is very true and
a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves the breed has
already lasted at least a century a niata bull crossed with a common
cow and the reverse cross yield offspring having an intermediate
character but with the niata character strongly displayed according
to senor muniz there is the clearest evidence contrary to the common
belief of agriculturists in analogous cases that the niata cow when
crossed with a common bull transmits her peculiarities more strongly
than does the niata bull when crossed with a common cow when the
pasture is tolerably long these cattle feed as well as common cattle
with their tongue and palate but during the great droughts when so
many animals perish on the pampas the niata breed lies under a great
disadvantage and would if not attended to become extinct for the
common cattle like horses are able to keep alive by browsing with
their lips on the twigs of trees and on reeds this the niatas cannot
so well do as their lips do not join and hence they are found to
perish before the common cattle this strikes me as a good illustration
of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary habits of an
animal on what circumstances occurring only at long intervals of
time its rarity or extinction may depend it shows us also how
natural selection would have determined the rejection of the niata
modification had it arisen in a state of nature
    having described the semimonstrous niata breed i may allude to a
    white bull said to have been brought from africa which was
    exhibited in london in 1829 and which has been well figured by mr
    harvey67 it had a hump and was furnished with a mane the
    dewlap was peculiar being divided between its forelegs into
    parallel divisions its lateral hoofs were annually shed and grew
    to the length of five or six inches the eye was very peculiar
    being remarkably prominent and resembled a cup and ball thus
    enabling the animal to see on all sides with equal ease the pupil
    was small and oval or rather a parallelogram with the ends cut
    off and lying transversely across the ball a new and strange
    breed might probably have been formed by careful breeding and
    selection from this animal
    i have often speculated on the probable causes through which each
    separate district in great britain came to possess in former times
    its own peculiar breed of cattle and the question is perhaps
    even more perplexing in the case of southern africa we now know
    that the differences may be in part attributed to descent from
    distinct species but this cause is far from sufficient have the
    slight differences in climate and in the nature of the pasture in
    the different districts of britain directly induced corresponding
    differences in the cattle we have seen that the semiwild cattle
    in the several british parks are not identical in colouring or
    size and that some degree of selection has been requisite to keep
    them true it is almost certain that abundant food given during
    many generations directly affects the size of a breed68 that
    climate directly affects the thickness of the skin and the hair is
    likewise certain thus roulin asserts69 that the hides of the
    feral cattle on the hot llanos are always much less heavy than
    those of the cattle raised on the high platform of bogota and that
    these hides yield in weight and in thickness of hair to those of
    the cattle which have run wild on the lofty paramos the same
    difference has been observed in the hides of the cattle reared on
    the bleak falkland islands and on the temperate pampas low has
    remarked70 that the cattle which inhabit the more humid parts of
    britain have longer hair and thicker skins than other british
    cattle when we compare highly improved stallfed cattle with the
    wilder breeds or compare mountain and lowland breeds we cannot
    doubt that an active life leading to the free use of the limbs and
    lungs affects the shape and proportions of the whole body it is
    probable that some breeds such as the semimonstrous niata cattle
    and some peculiarities such as being hornless etc have appeared
    suddenly owing to what we may call in our ignorance spontaneous
    variation but even in this case a rude kind of selection is
    necessary and the animals thus characterised must be at least
    partially separated from others this degree of care however has
    sometimes been taken even in littlecivilised districts where we
    should least have expected it as in the case of the niata chivo
    and hornless cattle in s america
    that methodical selection has done wonders within a recent period
    in modifying our cattle no one doubts during the process of
    methodical selection it has occasionally happened that deviations
    of structure more strongly pronounced than mere individual
    differences yet by no means deserving to be called monstrosities
    have been taken advantage of thus the famous longhorn bull
    shakespeare though of the pure canley stock scarcely inherited a
    single point of the longhorned breed his horns excepted71 yet
    in the hands of mr fowler this bull greatly improved his race we
    have also reason to believe that selection carried on so far
    unconsciously that there was at no one time any distinct intention
    to improve or change the breed has in the course of time modified
    most of our cattle for by this process aided by more abundant
    food all the lowland british breeds have increased greatly in size
    and in early maturity since the reign of henry vii72 it should
    never be forgotten that many animals have to be annually
    slaughtered so that each owner must determine which shall be
    killed and which preserved for breeding in every district as
    youatt has remarked there is a prejudice in favour of the native
    breed so that animals possessing qualities whatever they may be
    which are most valued in each district will be oftenest preserved
    and this unmethodical selection assuredly will in the long run
    affect the character of the whole breed but it may be asked can
    this rude kind of selection have been practised by barbarians such
    as those of southern africa in a future chapter on selection we
    shall see that this has certainly occurred to some extent
    therefore looking to the origin of the many breeds of cattle which
    formerly inhabited the several districts of britain i conclude
    that although slight differences in the nature of the climate
    food etc as well as changed habits of life aided by correlation
    of growth and the occasional appearance from unknown causes of
    considerable deviations of structure have all probably played
    their parts yet that the occasional preservation in each district
    of those individual animals which were most valued by each owner
    has perhaps been even more effective in the production of the
    several british breeds as soon as two or more breeds were formed
    in any district or when new breeds descended from distinct species
    were introduced their crossing especially if aided by some
    selection will have multiplied the number and modified the
    characters of the older breeds
sheep
    i shall treat this subject briefly most authors look at our
    domestic sheep as descended from several distinct species mr
    blyth who has carefully attended to the subject believes that
    fourteen wild species now exist but that not one of them can be
    identified as the progenitor of any one of the interminable
    domestic races m gervais thinks that there are six species of
    ovis73 but that our domestic sheep form a distinct genus now
    completely extinct a german naturalist74 believes that our sheep
    descend from ten aboriginally distinct species of which only one
    is still living in a wild state another ingenious observer75
    though not a naturalist with a bold defiance of everything known
    on geographical distribution infers that the sheep of great
    britain alone are the descendants of eleven endemic british forms
    under such a hopeless state of doubt it would be useless for my
    purpose to give a detailed account of the several breeds but a few
    remarks may be added
    sheep have been domesticated from a very ancient period
    rtimeyer76 found in the swiss lakedwellings the remains of a
    small breed with thin tall legs and horns like those of a goat
    thus differing somewhat from any kind now known almost every
    country has its own peculiar breed and many countries have several
    breeds differing greatly from each other one of the most strongly
    marked races is an eastern one with a long tail including
    according to pallas twenty vertebr and so loaded with fat that
    it is sometimes placed on a truck which is dragged about by the
    living animal these sheep though ranked by fitzinger as a
    distinct aboriginal form bear in their drooping ears the stamp of
    long domestication this is likewise the case with those sheep
    which have two great masses of fat on the rump with the tail in a
    rudimentary condition the angola variety of the longtailed race
    has curious masses of fat on the back of the head and beneath the
    jaws77 mr hodgson in an admirable paper78 on the sheep of the
    himalaya infers from the distribution of the several races that
    this caudal augmentation in most of its phases is an instance of
    degeneracy in these preeminently alpine animals the horns
    present an endless diversity in character being not rarely absent
    especially in the female sex or on the other hand amounting to
    four or even eight in number the horns when numerous arise from
    a crest on the frontal bone which is elevated in a peculiar
    manner it is remarkable that multiplicity of horns is generally
    accompanied by great length and coarseness of the fleece79 this
    correlation however is far from being general for instance i am
    informed by mr d forbes that the spanish sheep in chile
    resemble in fleece and in all other characters their parent
    merinorace except that instead of a pair they generally bear four
    horns the existence of a pair of mamm is a generic character in
    the genus ovis as well as in several allied forms nevertheless as
    mr hodgson has remarked this character is not absolutely
    constant even among the true and proper sheep for i have more than
    once met with cgias a subhimalayan domestic race possessed of
    four teats80 this case is the more remarkable as when any part
    or organ is present in reduced number in comparison with the same
    part in allied groups it usually is subject to little variation
    the presence of interdigital pits has likewise been considered as a
    generic distinction in sheep but isidore geoffroy81 has shown
    that these pits or pouches are absent in some breeds
    in sheep there is a strong tendency for characters which have
    apparently been acquired under domestication to become attached
    either exclusively to the male sex or to be more highly developed
    in this than in the other sex thus in many breeds the horns are
    deficient in the ewe though this likewise occurs occasionally with
    the female of the wild musmon in the rams of the wallachian breed
    the horns spring almost perpendicularly from the frontal bone and
    then take a beautiful spiral form in the ewes they protrude nearly
    at right angles from the head and then become twisted in a
    singular manner82 mr hodgson states that the extraordinarily
    arched nose or chaffron which is so highly developed in several
    foreign breeds is characteristic of the ram alone and apparently
    is the result of domestication83 i hear from mr blyth that the
    accumulation of fat in the fattailed sheep of the plains of india
    is greater in the male than in the female and fitzinger84
    remarks that the mane in the african maned race is far more
    developed in the ram than in the ewe
    different races of sheep like cattle present constitutional
    differences thus the improved breeds arrive at maturity at an
    early age as has been well shown by mr simonds through their
    early average period of dentition the several races have become
    adapted to different kinds of pasture and climate for instance no
    one can rear leicester sheep on mountainous regions where cheviots
    flourish as youatt has remarked in all the different districts
    of great britain we find various breeds of sheep beautifully
    adapted to the locality which they occupy no one knows their
    origin they are indigenous to the soil climate pasturage and
    the locality on which they graze they seem to have been formed for
    it and by it85 marshall relates86 that a flock of heavy
    lincolnshire and light norfolk sheep which had been bred together
    in a large sheepwalk part of which was low rich and moist and
    another part high and dry with benty grass when turned out
    regularly separated from each other the heavy sheep drawing off to
    the rich soil and the lighter sheep to their own soil so that
    whilst there was plenty of grass the two breeds kept themselves as
    distinct as rooks and pigeons numerous sheep from various parts
    of the world have been brought during a long course of years to the
    zoological gardens of london but as youatt who attended the
    animals as a veterinary surgeon remarks few or none die of the
    rot but they are phthisical not one of them from a torrid climate
    lasts out the second year and when they die their lungs are
    tuberculated87 there is very good evidence that english breeds
    of sheep will not succeed in france88 even in certain parts of
    england it has been found impossible to keep certain breeds of
    sheep thus on a farm on the banks of the ouse the leicester sheep
    were so rapidly destroyed by pleuritis89 that the owner could not
    keep them the coarserskinned sheep never being affected
    the period of gestation was formerly thought to be of so
    unalterable a character that a supposed difference of this kind
    between the wolf and the dog was esteemed a sure sign of specific
    distinction but we have seen that the period is shorter in the
    improved breeds of the pig and in the larger breeds of the ox
    than in other breeds of these two animals and now we know on the
    excellent authority of hermann von nathusius90 that merino and
    southdown sheep when both have long been kept under exactly the
    same conditions differ in their average period of gestation as is
    seen in the following table
merinos     1503 days southdowns     1442 days halfbred merinos and
southdowns     1463 days 34 blood of southdown     1455 days 78
blood of southdown     1442 days
in this graduated difference in crossbred animals having different
proportions of southdown blood we see how strictly the two periods of
gestation have been transmitted nathusius remarks that as southdowns
grow with remarkable rapidity after birth it is not surprising that
their foetal development should have been shortened it is of course
possible that the difference in these two breeds may be due to their
descent from distinct parentspecies but as the early maturity of the
southdowns has long been carefully attended to by breeders the
difference is more probably the result of such attention lastly the
fecundity of the several breeds differs much some generally producing
twins or even triplets at a birth of which fact the curious shangai
sheep with their truncated and rudimentary ears and great roman
noses lately exhibited in the zoological gardens offer a remarkable
instance
    sheep are perhaps more readily affected by the direct action of the
    conditions of life to which they have been exposed than almost any
    other domestic animal according to pallas and more recently
    according to erman the fattailed kirghisian sheep when bred for
    a few generations in russia degenerate and the mass of fat
    dwindles away the scanty and bitter herbage of the steppes seems
    so essential to their development pallas makes an analogous
    statement with respect to one of the crimean breeds burnes states
    that the karakool breed which produces a fine curled black and
    valuable fleece when removed from its own canton near bokhara to
    persia or to other quarters loses its peculiar fleece91 in all
    such cases however it may be that a change of any kind in the
    conditions of life causes variability and consequent loss of
    character and not that certain conditions are necessary for the
    development of certain characters
    great heat however seems to act directly on the fleece several
    accounts have been published of the change which sheep imported
    from europe undergo in the west indies dr nicholson of antigua
    informs me that after the third generation the wool disappears
    from the whole body except over the loins and the animal then
    appears like a goat with a dirty doormat on its back a similar
    change is said to take place on the west coast of africa92 on
    the other hand many woolbearing sheep live on the hot plains of
    india roulin asserts that in the lower and heated valleys of the
    cordillera if the lambs are sheared as soon as the wool has grown
    to a certain thickness all goes on afterwards as usual but if not
    sheared the wool detaches itself in flakes and short shining hair
    like that on a goat is produced ever afterwards this curious
    result seems merely to be an exaggerated tendency natural to the
    merino breed for as a great authority namely lord somerville
    remarks the wool of our merino sheep after sheartime is hard and
    coarse to such a degree as to render it almost impossible to
    suppose that the same animal could bear wool so opposite in
    quality compared to that which has been clipped from it as the
    cold weather advances the fleeces recover their soft quality as
    in sheep of all breeds the fleece naturally consists of longer and
    coarser hair covering shorter and softer wool the change which it
    often undergoes in hot climates is probably merely a case of
    unequal development for even with those sheep which like goats are
    covered with hair a small quantity of underlying wool may always
    be found93 in the wild mountainsheep 0vis montana of north
    america there is an analogous annual change of coat the wool
    begins to drop out in early spring leaving in its place a coat of
    hair resembling that of the elk a change of pelage quite different
    in character from the ordinary thickening of the coat or hair
    common to all furred animals in winterfor instance in the horse
    the cow etc which shed their winter coat in the spring94
a slight difference in climate or pasture sometimes slightly affects
the fleece as has been observed even in different districts in
england and is well shown by the great softness of the wool brought
from southern australia but it should be observed as youatt
repeatedly insists that the tendency to change may generally be
counteracted by careful selection m lasterye after discussing this
subject sums up as follows the preservation of the merino race in
its utmost purity at the cape of good hope in the marshes of holland
and under the rigorous climate of sweden furnishes an additional
support of this my unalterable principle that finewoolled sheep may
be kept wherever industrious men and intelligent breeders exist
    that methodical selection has effected great changes in several
    breeds of sheep no one who knows anything on the subject
    entertains a doubt the case of the southdowns as improved by
    ellman offers perhaps the most striking instance unconscious or
    occasional selection has likewise slowly produced a great effect
    as we shall see in the chapters on selection that crossing has
    largely modified some breeds no one who will study what has been
    written on this subjectfor instance mr spooners paperwill
    dispute but to produce uniformity in a crossed breed careful
    selection and rigorous weeding as this author expresses it are
    indispensable95
    in some few instances new breeds have suddenly originated thus in
    1791 a ramlamb was born in massachusetts having short crooked
    legs and a long back like a turnspitdog from this one lamb the
    otter or ancon semimonstrous breed was raised as these sheep
    could not leap over the fences it was thought that they would be
    valuable but they have been supplanted by merinos and thus
    exterminated the sheep are remarkable from transmitting their
    character so truly that colonel humphreys96 never heard of but
    one questionable case of an ancon ram and ewe not producing ancon
    offspring when they are crossed with other breeds the offspring
    with rare exceptions instead of being intermediate in character
    perfectly resemble either parent even one of twins has resembled
    one parent and the second the other lastly the ancons have been
    observed to keep together separating themselves from the rest of
    the flock when put into enclosures with other sheep
a more interesting case has been recorded in the report of the juries
for the great exhibition 1851 namely the production of a merino
ramlamb on the mauchamp farm in 1828 which was remarkable for its
long smooth straight and silky wool by the year 1833 m graux had
raised rams enough to serve his whole flock and after a few more years
he was able to sell stock of his new breed so peculiar and valuable is
the wool that it sells at 25 per cent above the best merino wool even
the fleeces of halfbred animals are valuable and are known in france
as the mauchampmerino it is interesting as showing how generally
any marked deviation of structure is accompanied by other deviations
that the first ram and his immediate offspring were of small size with
large heads long necks narrow chests and long flanks but these
blemishes were removed by judicious crosses and selection the long
smooth wool was also correlated with smooth horns and as horns and
hair are homologous structures we can understand the meaning of this
correlation if the mauchamp and ancon breeds had originated a century
or two ago we should have had no record of their birth and many a
naturalist would no doubt have insisted especially in the case of the
mauchamp race that they had each descended from or been crossed with
some unknown aboriginal form
goats
    from the recent researches of m brandt most naturalists now
    believe that all our goats are descended from the capra gagrus
    of the mountains of asia possibly mingled with the allied indian
    species c falconeri of india97 in switzerland during the
    neolithic period the domestic goat was commoner than the sheep
    and this very ancient race differed in no respect from that now
    common in switzerland98 at the present time the many races
    found in several parts of the world differ greatly from each other
    nevertheless as far as they have been tried99 they are all
    quite fertile when crossed so numerous are the breeds that mr g
    clark100 has described eight distinct kinds imported into the one
    island of mauritius the ears of one kind were enormously
    developed being as measured by mr clark no less than 19 inches
    in length and 434 inches in breadth as with cattle the mamm of
    those breeds which are regularly milked become greatly developed
    and as mr clark remarks it is not rare to see their teats
    touching the ground the following cases are worth notice as
    presenting unusual points of variation according to godron101
    the mamm differ greatly in shape in different breeds being
    elongated in the common goat hemispherical in the angora race and
    bilobed and divergent in the goats of syria and nubia according to
    this same author the males of certain breeds have lost their usual
    offensive odour in one of the indian breeds the males and females
    have horns of widelydifferent shapes102 and in some breeds the
    females are destitute of horns103 m ramu of nancy informs me
    that many of the goats there bear on the upper part of the throat a
    pair of hairy appendages 70 mm in length and about 10 mm in
    diameter which in external appearance resemble those above
    described on the jaws of pigs the presence of interdigital pits
    or glands on all four feet has been thought to characterise the
    genus ovis and their absence to be characteristic of the genus
    capra but mr hodgson has found that they exist in the front feet
    of the majority of himalayan goats104 mr hodgson measured the
    intestines in two goats of the dg race and he found that the
    proportional length of the great and small intestines differed
    considerably in one of these goats the ccum was thirteen inches
    and in the other no less than thirtysix inches in length

domesticated rabbits
    all naturalists with as far as i know a single exception
    believe that the several domestic breeds of the rabbit are
    descended from the common wild species i shall therefore describe
    them more carefully than in the previous cases professor
    gervais1 states that the true wild rabbit is smaller than the
    domestic its proportions are not absolutely the same its tail is
    smaller its ears are shorter and more thickly clothed with hair
    and these characters without speaking of colour are so many
    indications opposed to the opinion which unites these animals under
    the same specific denomination few naturalists will agree with
    this author that such slight differences are sufficient to separate
    as distinct species the wild and domestic rabbit how extraordinary
    it would be if close confinement perfect tameness unnatural
    food and careful breeding all prolonged during many generations
    had not produced at least some effect the tame rabbit has been
    domesticated from an ancient period confucius ranges rabbits among
    animals worthy to be sacrificed to the gods and as he prescribes
    their multiplication they were probably at this early period
    domesticated in china they are mentioned by several of the
    classical writers in 1631 gervaise markham writes you shall not
    as in other cattell looke to their shape but to their richnesse
    onely elect your buckes the largest and goodliest conies you can
    get and for the richnesse of the skin that is accounted the
    richest which hath the equallest mixture of blacke and white haire
    together yet the blacke rather shadowing the white the furre
    should be thicke deepe smooth and shining  they are of body
    much fatter and larger and when another skin is worth two or
    three pence they are worth two shillings from this full
    description we see that silvergrey rabbits existed in england at
    this period and what is far more important we see that the
    breeding or selection of rabbits was then carefully attended to
    aldrovandi in 1637 describes on the authority of several old
    writers as scaliger in 1557 rabbits of various colours some
    like a hare and he adds that p valerianus who died a very old
    man in 1558 saw at verona rabbits four times bigger than ours2
    from the fact of the rabbit having been domesticated at an ancient
    period we must look to the northern hemisphere of the old world
    and to the warmer temperate regions alone for the aboriginal
    parentform for the rabbit cannot live without protection in
    countries as cold as sweden and though it has run wild in the
    tropical island of jamaica it has never greatly multiplied there
    it now exists and has long existed in the warmer temperate parts
    of europe for fossil remains have been found in several
    countries3 the domestic rabbit readily becomes feral in these
    same countries and when variously coloured kinds are turned out
    they generally revert to the ordinary grey colour4 wild rabbits
    if taken young can be domesticated though the process is
    generally very troublesome5 the various domestic races are often
    crossed and are believed to be quite fertile together and a
    perfect gradation can be shown to exist from the largest domestic
    kinds having enormously developed ears to the common wild kind
    the parentform must have been a burrowing animal a habit not
    common as far as i can discover to any other species in the large
    genus lepus only one wild species is known with certainty to exist
    in europe but the rabbit if it be a true rabbit from mount
    sinai and likewise that from algeria present slight differences
    and these forms have been considered by some authors as
    specifically distinct6 but such slight differences would aid us
    little in explaining the more considerable differences
    characteristic of the several domestic races if the latter are the
    descendants of two or more closely allied species these with the
    exception of the common rabbit have been exterminated in a wild
    state and this is very improbable seeing with what pertinacity
    this animal holds its ground from these several reasons we may
    infer with safety that all the domestic breeds are the descendants
    of the common wild species but from what we hear of the marvellous
    success in france in rearing hybrids between the hare and
    rabbit7 it is possible though not probable from the great
    difficulty in making the first cross that some of the larger
    races which are coloured like the hare may have been modified by
    crosses with this animal nevertheless the chief differences in
    the skeletons of the several domestic breeds cannot as we shall
    presently see have been derived from a cross with the hare
    there are many breeds which transmit their characters more or less
    truly every one has seen the enormous lopeared rabbits exhibited
    at our shows various allied subbreeds are reared on the
    continent such as the socalled andalusian which is said to have
    a large head with a round forehead and to attain a greater size
    than any other kind another large paris breed is named the
    rouennais and has a square head the socalled patagonian rabbit
    has remarkably short ears and a large round head although i have
    not seen all these breeds i feel some doubt about there being any
    marked difference in the shape of their skulls8 english
    lopeared rabbits often weigh 8 pounds or 10 pounds and one has
    been exhibited weighing 18 pounds whereas a fullsized wild rabbit
    weighs only about 314 pounds the head or skull in all the large
    lopeared rabbits examined by me is much longer relatively to its
    breadth than in the wild rabbit many of them have loose transverse
    folds of skin or dewlaps beneath the throat which can be pulled
    out so as to reach nearly to the ends of the jaws their ears are
    prodigiously developed and hang down on each side of their faces
    a rabbit was exhibited in 1867 with its two ears measured from the
    tip of one to the tip of the other 22 inches in length and each
    ear 538 inches in breadth in 1869 one was exhibited with ears
    measured in the same manner 2318 in length and 512 in breadth
    thus exceeding any rabbit ever exhibited at a prize show in a
    common wild rabbit i found that the length of two ears from tip to
    tip was 758 inches and the breadth only 178 inch the weight
    of body in the larger rabbits and the development of their ears
    are the qualities which win prizes and have been carefully
    selected
    the harecoloured or as it is sometimes called the belgian
    rabbit differs in nothing except colour from the other large
    breeds but mr j young of southampton a great breeder of this
    kind informs me that the females in all the specimens examined by
    him had only six mamm and this certainly was the case with two
    females which came into my possession mr b p brent however
    assures me that the number is variable with other domestic rabbits
    the common wild rabbit always has ten mamm the angora rabbit is
    remarkable from the length and fineness of its fur which even on
    the soles of the feet is of considerable length this breed is the
    only one which differs in its mental qualities for it is said to
    be much more sociable than other rabbits and the male shows no
    wish to destroy its young9 two live rabbits were brought to me
    from moscow of about the size of the wild species but with long
    soft fur different from that of the angora these moscow rabbits
    had pink eyes and were snowwhite excepting the ears two spots
    near the nose the upper and under surface of the tail and the
    hinder tarsi which were blackishbrown in short they were
    coloured nearly like the socalled himalayan rabbits presently to
    be described and differed from them only in the character of their
    fur there are two other breeds which come true to colour but
    differ in no other respect namely silvergreys and chinchillas
    lastly the nicard or dutch rabbit may be mentioned which varies
    in colour and is remarkable from its small size some specimens
    weighing only 114 pounds rabbits of this breed make excellent
    nurses for other and more delicate kinds10
illustration fig 5halflop rabbit
    certain characters are remarkably fluctuating or are very feebly
    transmitted by domestic rabbits thus one breeder tells me that
    with the smaller kinds he has hardly ever raised a whole litter of
    the same colour with the large lopeared breeds it is
    impossible says a great judge11 to breed true to colour but
    by judicious crossing a great deal may be done towards it the
    fancier should know how his does are bred that is the colour of
    their parents nevertheless certain colours as we shall
    presently see are transmitted truly the dewlap is not strictly
    inherited lopeared rabbits with their ears hanging down flat on
    each side of the face do not transmit this character at all truly
    mr delamer remarks that with fancy rabbits when both the
    parents are perfectly formed have model ears and are handsomely
    marked their progeny do not invariably turn out the same when
    one parent or even both are oarlaps that is have their ears
    sticking out at right angles or when one parent or both are
    halflops that is have only one ear dependent there is nearly as
    good a chance of the progeny having both ears fulllop as if both
    parents had been thus characterised but i am informed if both
    parents have upright ears there is hardly a chance of a fulllop
    in some halflops the ear that hangs down is broader and longer
    than the upright ear12 so that we have the unusual case of a
    want of symmetry on the two sides this difference in the position
    and size of the two ears probably indicates that the lopping
    results from the great length and weight of the ear favoured no
    doubt by the weakness of the muscles consequent on disuse
    anderson13 mentions a breed having only a single ear and
    professor gervais another breed destitute of ears
    we come now to the himalayan breed which is sometimes called
    chinese polish or russian these pretty rabbits are white or
    occasionally yellow excepting their ears nose feet and the
    upper side of the tail which are all brownishblack but as they
    have red eyes they may be considered as albinoes i have received
    several accounts of their breeding perfectly true from their
    symmetrical marks they were at first ranked as specifically
    distinct and were provisionally named l nigripes14 some good
    observers thought that they could detect a difference in their
    habits and stoutly maintained that they formed a new species the
    origin of this breed is so curious both in itself and as throwing
    some light on the complex laws of inheritance that it is worth
    giving in detail but it is first necessary briefly to describe two
    other breeds silvergreys or silversprigs generally have black
    heads and legs and their fine grey fur is interspersed with
    numerous black and white long hairs they breed perfectly true and
    have long been kept in warrens when they escape and cross with
    common rabbits the product as i hear from mr wyrley birch of
    wretham hall is not a mixture of the two colours but about half
    take after the one parent and the other half after the other
    parent secondly chinchillas or tame silvergreys i will use the
    former name have short paler mouse or slatecoloured fur
    interspersed with long blackish slatecoloured and white
    hairs15 these rabbits breed perfectly true a writer stated in
    185716 that he had produced himalayan rabbits in the following
    manner he had a breed of chinchillas which had been crossed with
    the common black rabbit and their offspring were either blacks or
    chinchillas these latter were again crossed with other chinchillas
    which had also been crossed with silvergreys and from this
    complicated cross himalayan rabbits were raised from these and
    other similar statements mr bartlett17 was led to make a
    careful trial in the zoological gardens and he found that by
    simply crossing silvergreys with chinchillas he could always
    produce some few himalayans and the latter notwithstanding their
    sudden origin if kept separate bred perfectly true but i have
    recently been assured the pure silvergreys of any subbreed
    occasionally produce himalayans
    the himalayans when first born are quite white and are then true
    albinoes but in the course of a few months they gradually assume
    their dark ears nose feet and tail occasionally however as i
    am informed by mr w a wooler and the rev w d fox the young
    are born of a very pale grey colour and specimens of such fur were
    sent me by the former gentleman the grey tint however disappears
    as the animal comes to maturity so that with these himalayans
    there is a tendency strictly confined to early youth to revert to
    the colour of the adult silvergrey parentstock silvergreys and
    chinchillas on the other hand present a remarkable contrast with
    the himalayans in their colour whilst quite young for they are
    born perfectly black but soon assume their characteristic grey or
    silver tints the same thing occurs with grey horses which as
    long as they are foals are generally of a nearly black colour but
    soon become grey and get whiter and whiter as they grow older
    hence the usual rule is that himalayans are born white and
    afterwards become in certain parts of their bodies darkcoloured
    whilst silvergreys are born black and afterwards become sprinkled
    with white exceptions however and of a directly opposite nature
    occasionally occur in both cases for young silvergreys are
    sometimes born in warrens as i hear from mr w birch of a
    creamcolour but these young animals ultimately become black the
    himalayans on the other hand sometimes produce as is stated by
    an experienced amateur18 a single black young one in a litter
    and this before two months elapse becomes perfectly white
to sum up the whole curious case wild silvergreys may be considered
as black rabbits which become grey at an early period of life when
they are crossed with common rabbits the offspring are said not to
have blended colours but to take after either parent and in this
respect they resemble black and albino varieties of most quadrupeds
which often transmit their colours in this same manner when they are
crossed with chinchillas that is with a paler subvariety the young
are at first pure albinoes but soon become darkcoloured in certain
parts of their bodies and are then called himalayans the young
himalayans however are sometimes at first either pale grey or
completely black in either case changing after a time to white in a
future chapter i shall advance a large body of facts showing that when
two varieties are crossed both of which differ in colour from their
parentstock there is a strong tendency in the young to revert to the
aboriginal colour and what is very remarkable this reversion
occasionally supervenes not before birth but during the growth of the
animal hence if it could be shown that silvergreys and chinchillas
were the offspring of a cross between a black and albino variety with
the colours intimately blendeda supposition in itself not improbable
and supported by the circumstance of silvergreys in warrens sometimes
producing creamywhite young which ultimately become blackthen all
the above given paradoxical facts on the changes of colour in
silvergreys and in their descendants the himalayans would come under
the law of reversion supervening at different periods of growth and in
different degrees either to the original black or to the original
albino parentvariety
    it is also remarkable that himalayans though produced so
    suddenly breed true but as whilst young they are albinoes the
    case falls under a very general rule albinism being well known to
    be strongly inherited for instance with white mice and many other
    quadrupeds and even white flowers but why it may be asked do
    the ears tail nose and feet and no other part of the body
    revert to a black colour this apparently depends on a law which
    generally holds good namely that characters common to many
    species of a genusand this in fact implies long inheritance from
    the ancient progenitor of the genusare found to resist variation
    or to reappear if lost more persistently than the characters which
    are confined to the separate species now in the genus lepus a
    large majority of the species have their ears and the upper surface
    of the tail tinted black but the persistence of these marks is
    best seen in those species which in winter become white thus in
    scotland the l variabilis19 in its winter dress has a shade of
    colour on its nose and the tips of its ears are black in the l
    tibetanus the ears are black the upper surface of the tail
    greyishblack and the soles of the feet brown in l glacialis
    the winter fur is pure white except the soles of the feet and the
    points of the ears even in the variouslycoloured fancy rabbits we
    may often observe a tendency in these same parts to be more darkly
    tinted than the rest of the body thus the several coloured marks
    on the himalayan rabbits as they grow old are rendered
    intelligible i may add a nearly analogous case fancy rabbits very
    often have a white star on their foreheads and the common english
    hare whilst young generally has as i have myself observed a
    similar white star on its forehead
    when variously coloured rabbits are set free in europe and are
    thus placed under their natural conditions they generally revert
    to the aboriginal grey colour this may be in part due to the
    tendency in all crossed animals as lately observed to revert to
    their primordial state but this tendency does not always prevail
    thus silvergrey rabbits are kept in warrens and remain true
    though living almost in a state of nature but a warren must not be
    stocked with both silvergreys and common rabbits otherwise in a
    few years there will be none but common greys surviving20 when
    rabbits run wild in foreign countries under new conditions of life
    they by no means always revert to their aboriginal colour in
    jamaica the feral rabbits are described as having been
    slatecoloured deeply tinted with sprinklings of white on the
    neck on the shoulders and on the back softening off to
    bluewhite under the breast and belly21 but in this tropical
    island the conditions were not favourable to their increase and
    they never spread widely and are now extinct as i hear from mr
    r hill owing to a great fire which occurred in the woods rabbits
    during many years have run wild in the falkland islands they are
    abundant in certain parts but do not spread extensively most of
    them are of the common grey colour a few as i am informed by
    admiral sulivan are harecoloured and many are black often with
    nearly symmetrical white marks on their faces hence m lesson
    described the black variety as a distinct species under the name
    of lepus magellanicus but this as i have elsewhere shown is an
    error22 within recent times the sealers have stocked some of the
    small outlying islets in the falkland group with rabbits and on
    pebble islet as i hear from admiral sulivan a large proportion
    are harecoloured whereas on rabbit islet a large proportion are
    of a bluish colour which is not elsewhere seen how the rabbits
    were coloured which were turned out of these islets is not known
    the rabbits which have become feral on the island of porto santo
    near madeira deserve a fuller account in 1418 or 1419 j
    gonzales zarco23 happened to have a female rabbit on board which
    had produced young during the voyage and he turned them all out on
    the island these animals soon increased so rapidly that they
    became a nuisance and actually caused the abandonment of the
    settlement thirtyseven years subsequently cada mosto describes
    them as innumerable nor is this surprising as the island was not
    inhabited by any beast of prey or by any terrestrial mammal we do
    not know the character of the motherrabbit but it was probably
    the common domesticated kind the spanish peninsula whence zarco
    sailed is known to have abounded with the common wild species at
    the most remote historical period and as these rabbits were taken
    on board for food it is improbable that they should have been of
    any peculiar breed that the breed was well domesticated is shown
    by the doe having littered during the voyage mr wollaston at my
    request brought home two of these feral rabbits in spirits of
    wine and subsequently mr w haywood sent to me three more
    specimens in brine and two alive these seven specimens though
    caught at different periods closely resembled each other they
    were full grown as shown by the state of their bones although the
    conditions of life in porto santo are evidently highly favourable
    to rabbits as proved by their extraordinarily rapid increase yet
    they differ conspicuously in their small size from the wild english
    rabbit four english rabbits measured from the incisors to the
    anus varied between 17 and 1734 inches in length whilst two of
    the porto santo rabbits were only 1412 and 15 inches in length
    but the decrease in size is best shown by weight four wild english
    rabbits averaged 3 pounds 5 ounces whilst one of the porto santo
    rabbits which had lived for four years in the zoological gardens
    but had become thin weighed only 1 pound 9 ounces a fairer test
    is afforded by the comparison of the wellcleaned limbbones of a
    porto santo rabbit killed on the island with the same bones of a
    wild english rabbit of average size and they differed in the
    proportion of rather less than five to nine so that the porto
    santo rabbits have decreased nearly three inches in length and
    almost half in weight of body24 the head has not decreased in
    length proportionally with the body and the capacity of the brain
    case is as we shall hereafter see singularly variable i prepared
    four skulls and these resembled each other more closely than do
    generally the skulls of wild english rabbits but the only
    difference in structure which they presented was that the
    supraorbital processes of the frontal bones were narrower
in colour the porto santo rabbit differs considerably from the common
rabbit the upper surface is redder and is rarely interspersed with
any black or blacktipped hairs the throat and certain parts of the
under surface instead of being pure white are generally pale grey or
leaden colour but the most remarkable difference is in the ears and
tail i have examined many fresh english rabbits and the large
collection of skins in the british museum from various countries and
all have the upper surface of the tail and the tips of the ears clothed
with blackishgrey fur and this is given in most works as one of the
specific characters of the rabbit now in the seven porto santo rabbits
the upper surface of the tail was reddishbrown and the tips of the
ears had no trace of the black edging but here we meet with a singular
circumstance in june 1861 i examined two of these rabbits recently
sent to the zoological gardens and their tails and ears were coloured
as just described but when one of their dead bodies was sent to me in
february 1865 the ears were plainly edged and the upper surface of
the tail was covered with blackishgrey fur and the whole body was
much less red so that under the english climate this individual rabbit
had recovered the proper colour of its fur in rather less than four
years
the two little porto santo rabbits whilst alive in the zoological
gardens had a remarkably different appearance from the common kind
they were extraordinarily wild and active so that many persons
exclaimed on seeing them that they were more like large rats than
rabbits they were nocturnal to an unusual degree in their habits and
their wildness was never in the least subdued so that the
superintendent mr bartlett assured me that he had never had a wilder
animal under his charge this is a singular fact considering that they
are descended from a domesticated breed i was so much surprised at it
that i requested mr haywood to make inquiries on the spot whether
they were much hunted by the inhabitants or persecuted by hawks or
cats or other animals but this is not the case and no cause can be
assigned for their wildness they live both on the central higher
rocky land and near the seacliffs and from being exceedingly shy and
timid seldom appear in the lower and cultivated districts they are
said to produce from four to six young at a birth and their breeding
season is in july and august lastly and this is a highly remarkable
fact mr bartlett could never succeed in getting these two rabbits
which were both males to associate or breed with the females of
several breeds which were repeatedly placed with them
if the history of these porto santo rabbits had not been known most
naturalists on observing their much reduced size their colour
reddish above and grey beneath their tails and ears not tipped with
black would have ranked them as a distinct species they would have
been strongly confirmed in this view by seeing them alive in the
zoological gardens and hearing that they refused to couple with other
rabbits yet this rabbit which there can be little doubt would thus
have been ranked as a distinct species as certainly originated since
the year 1420 finally from the three cases of the rabbits which have
run wild in porto santo jamaica and the falkland islands we see that
these animals do not under new conditions of life revert to or retain
their aboriginal character as is so generally asserted to be the case
by most authors
osteological characters
when we remember on the one hand how frequently it is stated that
important parts of the structure never vary and on the other hand on
what small differences in the skeleton fossil species have often been
founded the variability of the skull and of some other bones in the
domesticated rabbit well deserves attention it must not be supposed
that the more important differences immediately to be described
strictly characterise any one breed all that can be said is that they
are generally present in certain breeds we should bear in mind that
selection has not been applied to fix any character in the skeleton
and that the animals have not had to support themselves under uniform
habits of life we cannot account for most of the differences in the
skeleton but we shall see that the increased size of the body due to
careful nurture and continued selection has affected the head in a
particular manner even the elongation and lopping of the ears have
influenced in a small degree the form of the whole skull the want of
exercise has apparently modified the proportional length of the limbs
in comparison with that of the body
as a standard of comparison i prepared skeletons of two wild rabbits
from kent one from the shetland islands and one from antrim in
ireland as all the bones in these four specimens from such distant
localities closely resembled each other presenting scarcely any
appreciable difference it may be concluded that the bones of the wild
rabbit are generally uniform in character
skulli have carefully examined skulls of ten large lopeared
rabbits and of five common domestic rabbits which latter differ from
the lopeared only in not having such large bodies or ears yet both
larger than in the wild rabbit first for the ten lopeared rabbits in
all these the skull is remarkably elongated in comparison with its
breadth in a wild rabbit the length was 315 inches in a large fancy
rabbit 43 whilst the breadth of the cranium enclosing the brain was
in both almost exactly the same even by taking as the standard of
comparison the widest part of the zygomatic arch the skulls of the
lopeared are proportionally to their breadth threequarters of an inch
too long the depth of the head has increased almost in the same
proportion with the length it is the breadth alone which has not
increased the parietal and occipital bones enclosing the brain are
less arched both in a longitudinal and transverse line than in the
wild rabbit so that the shape of the cranium is somewhat different
the surface is rougher less cleanly sculptured and the lines of
sutures are more prominent
although the skulls of the large lopeared rabbits in comparison with
those of the wild rabbit are much elongated relatively to their
breadth yet relatively to the size of body they are far from
elongated the lopeared rabbits which i examined were though not fat
more than twice as heavy as the wild specimens but the skull was very
far from being twice as long even if we take the fairer standard of
the length of body from the nose to the anus the skull is not on an
average as long as it ought to be by a third of an inch in the small
feral porto santo rabbit on the other hand the head relatively to the
length of body is about a quarter of an inch too long
this elongation of the skull relatively to its breadth i find a
universal character not only with the large lopeared rabbits but in
all the artificial breeds as is well seen in the skull of the angora
i was at first much surprised at the fact and could not imagine why
domestication could produce this uniform result but the explanation
seems to lie in the circumstance that during a number of generations
the artificial races have been closely confined and have had little
occasion to exert either their senses or intellect or voluntary
muscles consequently the brain as we shall presently more fully see
has not increased relatively with the size of body as the brain has
not increased the bony case enclosing it has not increased and this
has evidently affected through correlation the breadth of the entire
skull from end to end
illustration fig 6skull of wild rabbit fig 7skull of large
lopeared rabbit
illustration fig 8part of zygomatic arch
    in all the skulls of the large lopeared rabbits the supraorbital
    plates or processes of the frontal bones are much broader than in
    the wild rabbit and they generally project more upwards in the
    zygomatic arch the posterior or projecting point of the malarbone
    is broader and blunter and in the specimen fig 8 it is so in a
    remarkable degree this point approaches nearer to the auditory
    meatus than in the wild rabbit as may be best seen in fig 8 but
    this circumstance mainly depends on the changed direction of the
    meatus the interparietal bone see fig 9 differs much in shape
    in the several skulls generally it is more oval that is more
    extended in the line of the longitudinal axis of the skull than in
    the wild rabbit the posterior margin of the square raised
    platform25 of the occiput instead of being truncated or
    projecting slightly as in the wild rabbit is in most lopeared
    rabbits pointed as in fig 9 c the paramastoids relatively to
    the size of the skull are generally much thicker than in the wild
    rabbit
illustration fig 9posterior end of skull of rabbits
illustration fig 10occipital foramen of rabbits
the occipital foramen fig 10 presents some remarkable differences
in the wild rabbit the lower edge between the condyles is considerably
and almost angularly hollowed out and the upper edge is deeply and
squarely notched hence the longitudinal axis exceeds the transverse
axis in the skulls of the lopeared rabbits the transverse axis
exceeds the longitudinal for in none of these skulls was the lower
edge between the condyles so deeply hollowed out in five of them there
was no upper square notch in three there was a trace of the notch and
in two alone it was well developed these differences in the shape of
the foramen are remarkable considering that it gives passage to so
important a structure as the spinal marrow though apparently the
outline of the latter is not affected by the shape of the passage
in all the skulls of the large lopeared rabbits the bony auditory
meatus is conspicuously larger than in the wild rabbit in a skull 43
inches in length and which barely exceeded in breadth the skull of a
wild rabbit which was 315 inches in length the longer diameter of
the meatus was exactly twice as great the orifice is more compressed
and its margin on the side nearest the skull stands up higher than the
outer side the whole meatus is directed more forwards as in breeding
lopeared rabbits the length of the ears and their consequent lopping
and lying flat on the face are the chief points of excellence there
can hardly be a doubt that the great change in the size form and
direction of the bony meatus relatively to this same part in the wild
rabbit is due to the continued selection of individuals having larger
and larger ears the influence of the external ear on the bony meatus
is well shown in the skulls i have examined three of halflops see
fig 5 in which one ear stands upright and the other and longer ear
hangs down for in these skulls there was a plain difference in the
form and direction of the bony meatus on the two sides but it is a
much more interesting fact that the changed direction and increased
size of the bony meatus have slightly affected on the same side the
structure of the whole skull i here give a drawing fig 11 of the
skull of a halflop and it may be observed that the suture between the
parietal and frontal bones does not run strictly at right angles to the
longitudinal axis of the skull the left frontal bone projects beyond
the right one both the posterior and anterior margins of the left
zygomatic arch on the side of the lopping ear stand a little in advance
of the corresponding bones on the opposite side even the lower jaw is
affected and the condyles are not quite symmetrical that on the left
standing a little in advance of that on the right this seems to me a
remarkable case of correlation of growth who would have surmised that
by keeping an animal during many generations under confinement and so
leading to the disuse of the muscles of the ears and by continually
selecting individuals with the longest and largest ears he would thus
indirectly have affected almost every suture in the skull and the form
of the lower jaw
illustration fig 11skull of halflop rabbit
in the large lopeared rabbits the only difference in the lower jaw in
comparison with that of the wild rabbit is that the posterior margin
of the ascending ramus is broader and more inflected the teeth in
neither jaw present any difference except that the small incisors
beneath the large ones are proportionately a little longer the molar
teeth have increased in size proportionately with the increased width
of the skull measured across the zygomatic arch and not
proportionally with its increased length the inner line of the sockets
of the molar teeth in the upper jaw of the wild rabbit forms a
perfectly straight line but in some of the largest skulls of the
lopeared this line was plainly bowed inwards in one specimen there
was an additional molar tooth on each side of the upper jaw between
the molars and premolars but these two teeth did not correspond in
size and as no rodent has seven molars this is merely a monstrosity
though a curious one
the five other skulls of common domestic rabbits some of which
approach in size the abovedescribed largest skulls whilst the others
exceed but little those of the wild rabbit are only worth notice as
presenting a perfect gradation in all the abovespecified differences
between the skulls of the largest lopeared and wild rabbits in all
however the supraorbital plates are rather larger and in all the
auditory meatus is larger in conformity with the increased size of the
external ears than in the wild rabbit the lower notch in the
occipital foramen in some was not so deep as in the wild rabbit but in
all five skulls the upper notch was well developed
the skull of the angora rabbit like the latter five skulls is
intermediate in general proportions and in most other characters
between those of the largest lopeared and wild rabbits it presents
only one singular character though considerably longer than the skull
of the wild rabbit the breadth measured within the posterior
supraorbital fissures is nearly a third less than in the wild the
skulls of the silvergrey and chinchilla and himalayan rabbits
are more elongated than in the wild with broader supraorbital plates
but differ little in any other respect excepting that the upper and
lower notches of the occipital foramen are not so deep or so well
developed the skull of the moscow rabbit scarcely differs at all
from that of the wild rabbit in the porto santo feral rabbits the
supraorbital plates are generally narrower and more pointed than in
our wild rabbits
as some of the largest lopeared rabbits of which i prepared skeletons
were coloured almost like hares and as these latter animals and
rabbits have as it is affirmed been recently crossed in france it
might be thought that some of the abovedescribed characters had been
derived from a cross at a remote period with the hare consequently i
examined skulls of the hare but no light could thus be thrown on the
peculiarities of the skulls of the larger rabbits it is however an
interesting fact as illustrating the law that varieties of one species
often assume the characters of other species of the same genus that i
found on comparing the skulls of ten species of hares in the british
museum that they differed from each other chiefly in the very same
points in which domestic rabbits varynamely in general proportions
in the form and size of the supraorbital plates in the form of the
free end of the malar bone and in the line of suture separating the
occipital and frontal bones moreover two eminently variable characters
in the domestic rabbit namely the outline of the occipital foramen
and the shape of the raised platform of the occiput were likewise
variable in two instances in the same species of hare
vertebrthe number is uniform in all the skeletons which i have
examined with two exceptions namely in one of the small feral porto
santo rabbits and in one of the largest lopeared kinds both of these
had as usual seven cervical twelve dorsal with ribs but instead of
seven lumbar both had eight lumbar vertebr this is remarkable as
gervais gives seven as the number for the whole genus lepus the caudal
vertebr apparently differ by two or three but i did not attend to
them and they are difficult to count with certainty
illustration fig 12atlas vertebr of rabbits
in the first cervical vertebra or atlas the anterior margin of the
neural arch varies a little in wild specimens being either nearly
smooth or furnished with a small supramedian atlantoid process i
have figured a specimen with the largest process a which i have
seen but it will be observed how inferior this is in size and
different in shape to that in a large lopeared rabbit in the latter
the inframedian process b is also proportionally much thicker and
longer the al are a little squarer in outline
illustration fig 13third cervical vertebr of natural size ofa

third cervical vertebrain the wild rabbit fig 13 a a this
vertebra viewed on the inferior surface has a transverse process
which is directed obliquely backwards and consists of a single pointed
bar in the fourth vertebra this process is slightly forked in the
middle in the large lopeared rabbits this process b  a is forked
in the third vertebra as in the fourth of the wild rabbit but the
third cervical vertebr of the wild and lopeared a b b b
rabbits differ more conspicuously when their anterior articular
surfaces are compared for the extremities of the anterodorsal
processes in the wild rabbit are simply rounded whilst in the
lopeared they are trifid with a deep central pit the canal for the
spinal marrow in the lopeared b b is more elongated in a
transverse direction than in the wild rabbit and the passages for the
arteries are of a slightly different shape these several differences
in this vertebra seem to me well deserving attention
first dorsal vertebraits neural spine varies in length in the wild
rabbit being sometimes very short but generally more than half as
long as that of the second dorsal but i have seen it in two large
lopeared rabbits threefourths of the length of that of the second
dorsal vertebra
illustration fig 14dorsal vertebr from sixth to tenth inclusive
of natural size viewed laterally a wild rabbit b large
harecoloured socalled spanish rabbit
    ninth and tenth dorsal vertebrin the wild rabbit the neural
    spine of the ninth vertebra is just perceptibly thicker than that
    of the eighth and the neural spine of the tenth is plainly thicker
    and shorter than those of all the anterior vertebr in the large
    lopeared rabbits the neural spines of the tenth ninth and eighth
    vertebr and even in a slight degree that of the seventh are very
    much thicker and of somewhat different shape in comparison with
    those of the wild rabbit so that this part of the vertebral column
    differs considerably in appearance from the same part in the wild
    rabbit and closely resembles in an interesting manner these same
    vertebr in some species of hares in the angora chinchilla and
    himalayan rabbits the neural spines of the eighth and ninth
    vertebr are in a slight degree thicker than in the wild on the
    other hand in one of the feral porto santo rabbits which in most
    of its characters deviates from the common wild rabbit in a
    direction exactly opposite to that assumed by the large lopeared
    rabbits the neural spines of the ninth and tenth vertebr were not
    at all larger than those of the several anterior vertebra in this
    same porto santo specimen there was no trace in the ninth vertebra
    of the anterior lateral processes see fig 14 which are plainly
    developed in all british wild rabbits and still more plainly
    developed in the large lopeared rabbits in a halfwild rabbit
    from sandon park26 a haemal spine was moderately well developed
    on the under side of the twelfth dorsal vertebra and i have seen
    this in no other specimen
lumbar vertebri have stated that in two cases there were eight
instead of seven lumbar vertebr the third lumbar vertebr in one
skeleton of a wild british rabbit and in one of the porto santo feral
rabbits had a haemal spine whilst in four skeletons of large
lopeared rabbits and in the himalayan rabbit this same vertebra had
a well developed hmal spine
illustration fig 15terminal bone of sternum of rabbits
pelvisin four wild specimens this bone was almost absolutely
identical in shape but in several domesticated breeds shades of
differences could be distinguished in the large lopeared rabbits the
whole upper part of the ilium is straighter or less splayed outwards
than in the wild rabbit and the tuberosity on the inner lip of the
anterior and upper part of the ilium is proportionally more prominent

illustration fig 16acromion of scapula of natural size a wild
rabbit b c d large lopeared rabbits
scapulathe acromion sends out a rectangular bar ending in an
oblique knob which latter in the wild rabbit fig 16 a varies a
little in shape and size as does the apex of the acromion in
sharpness and the part just below the rectangular bar in breadth but
the variations in these respects in the wild rabbit are very slight
whilst in the large lopeared rabbits they are considerable thus in
some specimens b the oblique terminal knob is developed into a short
bar forming an obtuse angle with the rectangular bar in another
specimen c these two unequal bars form nearly a straight line the
apex of the acromion varies much in breadth and sharpness as may be
seen by comparing figures b c and d
limbsin these i could detect no variation but the bones of the
feet were too troublesome to compare with much care
i have now described all the differences in the skeletons which i have
observed it is impossible not to be struck with the high degree of
variability or plasticity of many of the bones we see how erroneous
the oftenrepeated statement is that only the crests of the bones
which give attachment to muscles vary in shape and that only parts of
slight importance become modified under domestication no one will say
for instance that the occipital foramen or the atlas or the third
cervical vertebra is a part of slight importance if the several
vertebr of the wild and lopeared rabbits of which figures have been
given had been found fossil palontologists would have declared
without hesitation that they had belonged to distinct species
the effects of the use and disuse of partsin the large lopeared
rabbits the relative proportional length of the bones of the same leg
and of the front and hind legs compared with each other have remained
nearly the same as in the wild rabbit but in weight the bones of the
hind legs apparently have not increased in due proportion with the
front legs the weight of the whole body in the large rabbits examined
by me was from twice to twice and a half as great as that of the wild
rabbit and the weight of the bones of the front and hind limbs taken
together excluding the feet on account of the difficulty of cleaning
so many small bones has increased in the large lopeared rabbits in
nearly the same proportion consequently in due proportion to the
weight of body which they have to support if we take the length of the
body as the standard of comparison the limbs of the large rabbits have
not increased in length in due proportion by one inch and a half
again if we take as the standard of comparison the length of the
skull which as we have before seen has not increased in length in
due proportion to the length of body the limbs will be found to be
proportionally with those of the wild rabbit from half to
threequarters of an inch too short hence whatever standard of
comparison be taken the limbbones of the large lopeared rabbits have
not increased in length though they have in weight in full proportion
to the other parts of the frame and this i presume may be accounted
for by the inactive life which during many generations they have spent
nor has the scapula increased in length in due proportion to the
increased length of the body
    the capacity of the osseous case of the brain is a more interesting
    point to which i was led to attend by finding as previously
    stated that with all domesticated rabbits the length of the skull
    relatively to its breadth has greatly increased in comparison with
    that of the wild rabbits if we had possessed a large number of
    domesticated rabbits of nearly the same size with the wild rabbits
    it would have been a simple task to have measured and compared the
    capacities of their skulls but this is not the case almost all
    the domestic breeds have larger bodies than wild rabbits and the
    lopeared kinds are more than double their weight as a small
    animal has to exert its senses intellect and instincts equally
    with a large animal we ought not by any means to expect an animal
    twice or thrice as large as another to have a brain of double or
    treble the size27 now after weighing the bodies of four wild
    rabbits and of four large but not fattened lopeared rabbits i
    find that on an average the wild are to the lopeared in weight as
    1 to 217 in average length of body as 1 to 141 whilst in
    capacity of skull they are as 1 to 115 hence we see that the
    capacity of the skull and consequently the size of the brain has
    increased but little relatively to the increased size of the body
    and this fact explains the narrowness of the skull relatively to
    its length in all domestic rabbits

in the upper half of table 3 i have given the measurements of the skull
of ten wild rabbits and in the lower half of eleven thoroughly
domesticated kinds as these rabbits differ so greatly in size it is
necessary to have some standard by which to compare the capacities of
their skulls i have selected the length of skull as the best standard
for in the larger rabbits it has not as already stated increased in
length so much as the body but as the skull like every other part
varies in length neither it nor any other part affords a perfect
standard
in the first column of figures the extreme length of the skull is given
in inches and decimals i am aware that these measurements pretend to
greater accuracy than is possible but i have found it the least
trouble to record the exact length which the compass gave the second
and third columns give the length and weight of body whenever these
observations were made the fourth column gives the capacity of the
skull by the weight of small shot with which the skulls were filled
but it is not pretended that these weights are accurate within a few
grains in the fifth column the capacity is given which the skull ought
to have had by calculation according to the length of skull in
comparison with that of the wild rabbit no 1 in the sixth column the
difference between the actual and calculated capacities and in the
seventh the percentage of increase or decrease are given for
instance as the wild rabbit no 5 has a shorter and lighter body than
the wild rabbit no 1 we might have expected that its skull would have
had less capacity the actual capacity as expressed by the weight of
shot is 875 grains which is 97 grains less than that of the first
rabbit but comparing these two rabbits by the length of their skulls
we see that in no 1 the skull is 315 inches in length and in no 5
296 inches in length according to this ratio the brain of no 5
ought to have had a capacity of 913 grains of shot which is above the
actual capacity but only by 38 grains or to put the case in another
way as in column vii the brain of this small rabbit no 5 for
every 100 grains of weight is only 4 grains too lightthat is it
ought according to the standard rabbit no 1 to have been 4 per cent
heavier i have taken the rabbit no 1 as the standard of comparison
because of the skulls having a full average length this has the least
capacity so that it is the least favourable to the result which i wish
to show namely that the brain in all longdomesticated rabbits has
decreased in size either actually or relatively to the length of the
head and body in comparison with the brain of the wild rabbit had i
taken the irish rabbit no 3 as the standard the following results
would have been somewhat more striking
turning to table 3 the first four wild rabbits have skulls of the same
length and these differ but little in capacity the sandon rabbit no
4 is interesting as though now wild it is known to be descended
from a domesticated breed as is still shown by its peculiar colouring
and longer body nevertheless the skull has recovered its normal length
and full capacity the next three rabbits are wild but of small size
and they all have skulls with slightly lessened capacities the three
porto santo feral rabbits nos 8 to 10 offer a perplexing case their
bodies are greatly reduced in size as in a lesser degree are their
skulls in length and in actual capacity in comparison with the skulls
of wild english rabbits but when we compare the capacities of the
skull in the three porto santo rabbits we observe a surprising
difference which does not stand in any relation to the slight
difference in the length of their skulls nor as i believe to any
difference in the size of their bodies but i neglected weighing
separately their bodies i can hardly suppose that the medullary matter
of the brain in these three rabbits living under similar conditions
can differ as much as is indicated by the proportional difference of
capacity in their skulls nor do i know whether it is possible that one
brain may contain considerably more fluid than another hence i can
throw no light on this case
    looking to the lower half of table 3 which gives the measurements
    of domesticated rabbits we see that in all the capacity of the
    skull is less but in very various degrees than might have been
    anticipated according to the length of their skulls relatively to
    that of the wild rabbit no 1 in line 22 the average measurements
    of seven large lopeared rabbits are given now the question
    arises has the average capacity of the skull in these seven large
    rabbits increased as much as might have been expected from the
    greatly increased size of body we may endeavour to answer this
    question in two ways in the upper half of the table we have
    measurements of the skulls of six small wild rabbits nos 5 to
    10 and we find that on an average the skulls are 18 of an inch
    shorter and in capacity 91 grains less than the average length
    and capacity of the three first wild rabbits on the list the seven
    large lopeared rabbits on an average have skulls 411 inches in
    length and 1136 grains in capacity so that these skulls have
    increased in length more than five times as much as the skulls of
    the six small wild rabbits have decreased in length hence we might
    have expected that the skulls of the large lopeared rabbits would
    have increased in capacity five times as much as the skulls of the
    six small rabbits have decreased in capacity and this would have
    given an average increased capacity of 455 grains whilst the real
    average increase is only 155 grains again the large lopeared
    rabbits have bodies of nearly the same weight and size as the
    common hare but their heads are longer consequently if the
    lopeared rabbits had been wild it might have been expected that
    their skulls would have had nearly the same capacity as that of the
    skull of the hare but this is far from being the case for the
    average capacity of the two hareskulls nos 23 24 is so much
    larger than the average capacity of the seven lopeared skulls
    that the latter would have to be increased 21 per cent to come up
    to the standard of the hare28
i have previously remarked that if we had possessed many domestic
rabbits of the same average size with the wild rabbit it would have
been easy to compare the capacity of their skulls now the himalayan
moscow and angora rabbits nos 11 12 13 of table 3 are only a
little larger in body and have skulls only a little longer than the
wild animal and we see that the actual capacity of their skulls is
less than in the wild animal and considerably less by calculation
column 7 according to the difference in the length of their skulls
the narrowness of the braincase in these three rabbits could be
plainly seen and proved by external measurement the chinchilla rabbit
no 14 is a considerably larger animal than the wild rabbit yet the
capacity of its skull only slightly exceeds that of the wild rabbit
the angora rabbit no 13 offers the most remarkable case this animal
in its pure white colour and length of silky fur bears the stamp of
long domesticity it has a considerably longer head and body than the
wild rabbit but the actual capacity of its skull is less than that of
even the little wild porto santo rabbits by the standard of the length
of skull the capacity see column 7 is only half of what it ought to
have been i kept this individual animal alive and it was not
unhealthy nor idiotic this case of the angora rabbit so much surprised
me that i repeated all the measurements and found them correct i have
also compared the capacity of the skull of the angora with that of the
wild rabbit by other standards namely by the length and weight of the
body and by the weight of the limbbones but by all these standards
the brain appears to be much too small though in a less degree when
the standard of the limbbones was used and this latter circumstance
may probably be accounted for by the limbs of this anciently
domesticated breed having become much reduced in weight from its
longcontinued inactive life hence i infer that in the angora breed
which is said to differ from other breeds in being quieter and more
social the capacity of the skull has really undergone a remarkable
amount of reduction
from the several facts above givennamely firstly that the actual
capacity of the skull in the himalayan moscow and angora breeds is
less than in the wild rabbit though they are in all their dimensions
rather larger animals secondly that the capacity of the skull of the
large lopeared rabbits has not been increased in nearly the same ratio
as the capacity of the skull of the smaller wild rabbits has been
decreased and thirdly that the capacity of the skull in these same
large lopeared rabbits is very inferior to that of the hare an animal
of nearly the same sizei conclude notwithstanding the remarkable
differences in capacity in the skulls of the small porto santo rabbits
and likewise in the large lopeared kinds that in all
longdomesticated rabbits the brain has either by no means increased in
due proportion with the increased length of the head and increased size
of the body or that it has actually decreased in size relatively to
what would have occurred had these animals lived in a state of nature
when we remember that rabbits from having been domesticated and
closely confined during many generations cannot have exerted their
intellect instincts senses and voluntary movements either in
escaping from various dangers or in searching for food we may conclude
that their brains will have been feebly exercised and consequently
have suffered in development we thus see that the most important and
complicated organ in the whole organisation is subject to the law of
decrease in size from disuse
finally let us sum up the more important modifications which domestic
rabbits have undergone together with their causes as far as we can
obscurely see them by the supply of abundant and nutritious food
together with little exercise and by the continued selection of the
heaviest individuals the weight of the larger breeds has been more
than doubled the bones of the limbs taken together have increased in
weight in due proportion with the increased weight of body but the
hind legs have increased less than the front legs but in length they
have not increased in due proportion and this may have been caused by
the want of proper exercise with the increased size of the body the
third cervical has assumed characters proper to the fourth cervical
vertebra and the eighth and ninth dorsal vertebr have similarly
assumed characters proper to the tenth and posterior vertebr the
skull in the larger breeds has increased in length but not in due
proportion with the increased length of body the brain has not duly
increased in dimensions or has even actually decreased and
consequently the bony case for the brain has remained narrow and by
correlation has affected the bones of the face and the entire length of
the skull the skull has thus acquired its characteristic narrowness
from unknown causes the supraorbital process of the frontal bones and
the free end of the malar bones have increased in breadth and in the
larger breeds the occipital foramen is generally much less deeply
notched than in wild rabbits certain parts of the scapula and the
terminal sternal bones have become highly variable in shape the ears
have been increased enormously in length and breadth through continued
selection their weight conjoined probably with the disuse of their
muscles has caused them to lop downwards and this has affected the
position and form of the bony auditory meatus and this again by
correlation the position in a slight degree of almost every bone in
the upper part of the skull and even the position of the condyles of
the lower jaw

on the points of difference in the several breeds
i have been led to study domestic pigeons with particular care because
the evidence that all the domestic races are descended from one known
source is far clearer than with any other anciently domesticated
animal secondly because many treatises in several languages some of
them old have been written on the pigeon so that we are enabled to
trace the history of several breeds and lastly because from causes
which we can partly understand the amount of variation has been
extraordinarily great the details will often be tediously minute but
no one who really wants to understand the progress of change in
domestic animals and especially no one who has kept pigeons and has
marked the great difference between the breeds and the trueness with
which most of them propagate their kind will doubt that this
minuteness is worth while notwithstanding the clear evidence that all
the breeds are the descendants of a single species i could not
persuade myself until some years had passed that the whole amount of
difference between them had arisen since man first domesticated the
wild rockpigeon
    i have kept alive all the most distinct breeds which i could
    procure in england or from the continent and have prepared
    skeletons of all i have received skins from persia and a large
    number from india and other quarters of the world1 since my
    admission into two of the london pigeonclubs i have received the
    kindest assistance from many of the most eminent amateurs2
    the races of the pigeon which can be distinguished and which breed
    true are very numerous mm boitard and corbi3 describe in
    detail 122 kinds and i could add several european kinds not known
    to them in india judging from the skins sent me there are many
    breeds unknown here and sir w elliot informs me that a collection
    imported by an indian merchant into madras from cairo and
    constantinople included several kinds unknown in india i have no
    doubt that there exist considerably above 150 kinds which breed
    true and have been separately named but of these the far greater
    number differ from each other only in unimportant characters such
    differences will be here entirely passed over and i shall confine
    myself to the more important points of structure that many
    important differences exist we shall presently see i have looked
    through the magnificent collection of the columbid in the british
    museum and with the exception of a few forms such as the
    didunculus calnas goura etc i do not hesitate to affirm that
    some domestic races of the rockpigeon differ fully as much from
    each other in external characters as do the most distinct natural
    genera we may look in vain through the 288 known species4 for a
    beak so small and conical as that of the shortfaced tumbler for
    one so broad and short as that of the barb for one so long
    straight and narrow with its enormous wattles as that of the
    english carrier for an expanded upraised tail like that of the
    fantail or for an sophagus like that of the pouter i do not for
    a moment pretend that the domestic races differ from each other in
    their whole organisation as much as the more distinct natural
    genera i refer only to external characters on which however it
    must be confessed that most genera of birds have been founded
    when in a future chapter we discuss the principle of selection as
    followed by man we shall clearly see why the differences between
    the domestic races are almost always confined to external or at
    least to externally visible characters
owing to the amount and gradations of difference between the several
breeds i have found it indispensable in the following classification
to rank them under groups races and subraces to which varieties and
subvarieties all strictly inheriting their proper characters must
often be added even with the individuals of the same subvariety when
long kept by different fanciers different strains can sometimes be
recognised there can be no doubt that if wellcharacterised forms of
the several races had been found wild all would have been ranked as
distinct species and several of them would certainly have been placed
by ornithologists in distinct genera a good classification of the
various domestic breeds is extremely difficult owing to the manner in
which many of the forms graduate into each other but it is curious how
exactly the same difficulties are encountered and the same rules have
to be followed as in the classification of any natural but difficult
group of organic beings an artificial classification might be
followed which would present fewer difficulties than a natural
classification but then it would interrupt many plain affinities
extreme forms can readily be defined but intermediate and troublesome
forms often destroy our definitions forms which may be called
aberrant must sometimes be included within groups to which they do
not accurately belong characters of all kinds must be used but as
with birds in a state of nature those afforded by the beak are the
best and most readily appreciated it is not possible to weigh the
importance of all the characters which have to be used so as to make
the groups and subgroups of equal value lastly a group may contain
only one race and another and less distinctly defined group may
contain several races and subraces and in this case it is difficult
as in the classification of natural species to avoid placing too high
a value on the number of forms which a group may contain
    in my measurements i have never trusted to the eye and when
    speaking of a part being large or small i always refer to the wild
    rockpigeon columba livia as the standard of comparison the
    measurements are given in decimals of an inch5

i will now give a brief description of all the principal breeds the
diagram above may aid the reader in learning their names and seeing
their affinities the rockpigeon or  columba livia including under
this name two or three closelyallied subspecies or geographical
races hereafter to be described may be confidently viewed as we
shall see in the next chapter as the common parentform the names in
italics on the righthand side of the page show us the most distinct
breeds or those which have undergone the greatest amount of
modification the lengths of the dotted lines rudely represent the
degree of distinctness of each breed from the parentstock and the
names placed under each other in the columns show the more or less
closely connecting links the distances of the dotted lines from each
other approximately represent the amount of difference between the
several breeds
illustration fig 18english pouter
group i
this group includes a single race that of the pouters if the most
strongly marked subrace be taken namely the improved english pouter
this is perhaps the most distinct of all domesticated pigeons
      race i pouter pigeons
      kropftauben german grossesgorges or boulans french
sophagus of great size barely separated from the crop often
inflated body and legs elongated beak of moderate dimensions
subrace ithe improved english pouter when its crop is fully
inflated presents a truly astonishing appearance the habit of
slightly inflating the crop is common to all domestic pigeons but is
carried to an extreme in the pouter the crop does not differ except
in size from that of other pigeons but is less plainly separated by
an oblique constriction from the sophagus the diameter of the upper
part of the sophagus is immense even close up to the head the beak
in one bird which i possessed was almost completely buried when the
sophagus was fully expanded the males especially when excited pout
more than the females and they glory in exercising this power if a
bird will not to use the technical expression play the fancier as
i have witnessed by taking the beak into his mouth blows him up like
a balloon and the bird then puffed up with wind and pride struts
about retaining his magnificent size as long as he can pouters often
take flight with their crops inflated after one of my birds had
swallowed a good meal of peas and water as he flew up in order to
disgorge them and feed his nearly fledged young i heard the peas
rattling in his inflated crop as if in a bladder when flying they
often strike the backs of their wings together and thus make a
clapping noise
pouters stand remarkably upright and their bodies are thin and
elongated in connexion with this form of body the ribs are generally
broader and the vertebr more numerous than in other breeds from their
manner of standing their legs appear longer than they really are
though in proportion with those of c livia the legs and feet are
actually longer the wings appear much elongated but by measurement
in relation to the length of body this is not the case the beak
likewise appears longer but it is in fact a little shorter about 03
of an inch proportionally with the size of the body and relatively
to the beak of the rockpigeon the pouter though not bulky is a
large bird i measured one which was 34 inches from tip to tip of
wing and 19 inches from tip of beak to end of tail in a wild
rockpigeon from the shetland islands the same measurements gave only
28 and 14 there are many subvarieties of the pouter of different
colours but these i pass over
    subrace ii dutch pouterthis seems to be the parentform of
    our improved english pouters i kept a pair but i suspect that
    they were not pure birds they are smaller than english pouters
    and less well developed in all their characters neumeister7 says
    that the wings are crossed over the tail and do not reach to its
    extremity
    subrace iii the lille pouteri know this breed only from
    description8 it approaches in general form the dutch pouter but
    the inflated sophagus assumes a spherical form as if the pigeon
    had swallowed a large orange which had stuck close under the beak
    this inflated ball is represented as rising to a level with the
    crown of the head the middle toe alone is feathered a variety of
    this subrace called the claquant is described by mm boitard and
    corbi it pouts but little and is characterised by the habit of
    violently hitting its wings together over its backa habit which
    the english pouter has in a slight degree
subrace iv common german pouteri know this bird only from the
figures and description given by the accurate neumeister one of the
few writers on pigeons who as i have found may always be trusted
this subrace seems considerably different the upper part of the
sophagus is much less distended the bird stands less upright the
feet are not feathered and the legs and beak are shorter in these
respects there is an approach in form to the common rockpigeon the
tailfeathers are very long yet the tips of the closed wings extend
beyond the end of the tail and the length of the wings from tip to
tip and of the body is greater than in the english pouter
illustration fig 19english carrier
group ii
this group includes three races namely carriers runts and barbs
which are manifestly allied to each other indeed certain carriers and
runts pass into each other by such insensible gradations that an
arbitrary line has to be drawn between them carriers also graduate
through foreign breeds into the rockpigeon yet if wellcharacterised
carriers and barbs see figs 19 and 20 had existed as wild species no
ornithologist would have placed them in the same genus with each other
or with the rockpigeon this group may as a general rule be
recognised by the beak being long with the skin over the nostrils
swollen and often carunculated or wattled and with that round the eyes
bare and likewise carunculated the mouth is very wide and the feet
are large nevertheless the barb which must be classed in this same
group has a very short beak and some runts have very little bare skin
round their eyes

      trkische tauben pigeons turcs dragons
beak elongated narrow pointed eyes surrounded by much naked
generally carunculated skin neck and body elongated
subrace i the english carrierthis is a fine bird of large size
close feathered generally darkcoloured with an elongated neck the
beak is attenuated and of wonderful length in one specimen it was 14
inch in length from the feathered base to the tip therefore nearly
twice as long as that of the rockpigeon which measured only 77
whenever i compare proportionally any part in the carrier and
rockpigeon i take the length of the body from the base of the beak to
the end of the tail as the standard of comparison and according to
this standard the beak in one carrier was nearly half an inch longer
than in the rockpigeon the upper mandible is often slightly arched
the tongue is very long the development of the carunculated skin or
wattle round the eyes over the nostrils and on the lower mandible is
prodigious the eyelids measured longitudinally were in some
specimens exactly twice as long as in the rockpigeon the external
orifice or furrow of the nostrils was also twice as long the open
mouth in its widest part was in one case 75 of an inch in width
whereas in the rockpigeon it is only about 4 of an inch this great
width of mouth is shown in the skeleton by the reflexed edges of the
ramus of the lower jaw the head is flat on the summit and narrow
between the orbits the feet are large and coarse the length as
measured from end of hind toe to end of middle toe without the claws
was in two specimens 26 inches and this proportionally with the
rockpigeon is an excess of nearly a quarter of an inch one very fine
carrier measured 31 inches from tip to tip of wing birds of this
subrace are too valuable to be flown as carriers
subrace ii dragons persian carriersthe english dragon differs
from the improved english carrier in being smaller in all its
dimensions and in having less wattle round the eyes and over the
nostrils and none on the lower mandible sir w elliot sent me from
madras a bagdad carrier sometimes called khandesi the name of which
shows its persian origin it would be considered here a very poor
dragon the body was of the size of the rockpigeon with the beak a
little longer namely 1 inch from the tip to the feathered base the
skin round the eyes was only slightly wattled whilst that over the
nostrils was fairly wattled the hon c murray also sent me two
carriers direct from persia these had nearly the same character as the
madras bird being about as large as the rockpigeon but the beak in
one specimen was as much as 115 in length the skin over the nostrils
was only moderately and that round the eyes scarcely at all wattled

    hockertaubeni owe to the kindness of mr baily jun a dead
    specimen of this singular breed imported from germany it is
    certainly allied to the runts nevertheless from its close
    affinity with carriers it will be convenient here to describe it
    the beak is long and is hooked or bowed downwards in a highly
    remarkable manner as will be seen in fig 24d when i treat of the
    skeleton the eyes are surrounded by a wide space of bright red
    skin which as well as that over the nostrils is moderately
    wattled the breastbone is remarkably protuberant being abruptly
    bowed outwards the feet and tarsi are of great length larger than
    in firstrate english carriers the whole bird is of large size
    but in proportion to the size of the body the feathers of the wing
    and tail are short a wild rockpigeon of considerably less size
    had tailfeathers 46 inches in length whereas in the large
    bagadotten these feathers were scarcely over 41 inches in length
    riedel9 remarks that it is a very silent bird
    subrace iv bussorah carriertwo specimens were sent me by sir
    w elliot from madras one in spirits and the other skinned the
    name shows its persian origin it is much valued in india and is
    considered as a distinct breed from the bagdad carrier which forms
    my second subrace at first i suspected that these two subraces
    might have been recently formed by crosses with other breeds
    though the estimation in which they are held renders this
    improbable but in a persian treatise10 believed to have been
    written about 100 years ago the bagdad and bussorah breeds are
    described as distinct the bussorah carrier is of about the same
    size as the wild rockpigeon the shape of the beak with some
    little carunculated skin over the nostrils the much elongated
    eyelidsthe broad mouth measured internallythe narrow headthe
    feet proportionally a little longer than in the rockpigeonand
    the general appearance all show that this bird is an undoubted
    carrier yet in one specimen the beak was of exactly the same
    length as in the rockpigeon in the other specimen the beak as
    well as the opening of the nostrils was only a very little longer
    viz by 08 of an inch although there was a considerable space of
    bare and slightly carunculated skin round the eyes that over the
    nostrils was only in a slight degree rugose sir w elliot informs
    me that in the living bird the eye seems remarkably large and
    prominent and the same fact is noticed in the persian treatise
    but the bony orbit is barely larger than that in the rockpigeon
amongst the several breeds sent to me from madras by sir w elliot
there is a pair of the kali par black birds with the beak slightly
elongated with the skin over the nostrils rather full and with a
little naked skin round the eyes this breed seems more closely allied
to the carrier than to any other breed being nearly intermediate
between the bussorah carrier and the rockpigeon
the names applied in different parts of europe and in india to the
several kinds of carriers all point to persia or the surrounding
countries as the source of this race and it deserves especial notice
that even if we neglect the kali par as of doubtful origin we get a
series broken by very small steps from the rockpigeon through the
bussorah which sometimes has a beak not at all longer than that of the
rockpigeon and with the naked skin round the eyes and over the
nostrils very slightly swollen and carunculated through the bagdad
subrace and dragons to our improved english carriers which present
so marvellous a difference from the rockpigeon or columba livia

in other pigeons such as the length of the wings tail legs and
neck and the amount of naked skin round the eyes are excessively
variable in runts when the naked skin over the nostrils and round the
eyes is considerably developed and wattled and when the size of body
is not very great runts graduate in so insensible a manner into
carriers that the distinction is quite arbitrary this fact is
likewise shown by the names given to them in different parts of europe
nevertheless taking the most distinct forms at least five subraces
some of them including wellmarked varieties can be distinguished
which differ in such important points of structure that they would be
considered as good species in a state of nature
subrace i scanderoon of english writers die florentiner and
hinkeltauben of neumeisterbirds of this subrace of which i kept
one alive and have since seen two others differ from the bagadotten of
neumeister only in not having the beak nearly so much curved downwards
and in the naked skin round the eyes and over the nostrils being hardly
at all wattled nevertheless i have felt myself compelled to place the
bagadotten in race ii or that of the carriers and the present bird
in race iii or that of the runts the scanderoon has a very short
narrow and elevated tail wings extremely short so that the first
primary feathers were not longer than those of a small tumbler pigeon
neck long much bowed breastbone prominent beak long being 115
inch from tip to feathered base vertically thick slightly curved
downwards the skin over the nostrils swollen not wattled naked skin
round the eyes broad slightly carunculated legs long feet very
large skin of neck bright red often showing a naked medial line with
a naked red patch at the distal end of the radius of the wing my bird
as measured from the base of the beak to the root of the tail was
fully 2 inches longer than the rockpigeon yet the tail itself was
only 4 inches in length whereas in the rockpigeon which is a much
smaller bird the tail is 458 inches in length
the hinkelor florentiner taube of neumeister table 13 fig 1 agrees
with the above description in all the specified characters for the
beak is not mentioned except that neumeister expressly says that the
neck is short whereas in my scanderoon it was remarkably long and
bowed so that the hinkel forms a wellmarked variety
subrace ii pigeon cygne and pigeon bagadais of boitard and corbi
scanderoon of french writersi kept two of these birds alive
imported from france they differed from the first subrace or true
scanderoon in the much greater length of the wing and tail in the beak
not being so long and in the skin about the head being more
carunculated the skin of the neck is red but the naked patches on the
wings are absent one of my birds measured 38 inches from tip to tip
of wing by taking the length of the body as the standard of
comparison the two wings were no less than 5 inches longer than those
of the rockpigeon the tail was 6 inches in length and therefore 2
inches longer than that of the scanderoona bird of nearly the same
size the beak is longer thicker and broader than in the rockpigeon
proportionally with the size of body the eyelids nostrils and
internal gape of mouth are all proportionally very large as in
carriers the foot from the end of the middle to end of hind toe was
actually 285 inches in length which is an excess of 32 of an inch
over the foot of the rockpigeon proportionally to the relative size
of the two birds
    subrace iii spanish and roman runtsi am not sure that i am
    right in placing these runts in a distinct subrace yet if we
    take wellcharacterised birds there can be no doubt of the
    propriety of the separation they are heavy massive birds with
    shorter necks legs and beaks than in the foregoing races the
    skin over the nostrils is swollen but not carunculated the naked
    skin round the eyes is not very wide and only slightly
    carunculated and i have seen a fine socalled spanish runt with
    hardly any naked skin round the eyes of the two varieties to be
    seen in england one which is the rarer has very long wings and
    tail and agrees pretty closely with the last subrace the other
    with shorter wings and tail is apparently the pigeon romain
    ordinaire of boitard and corbi these runts are apt to tremble
    like fantails they are bad flyers a few years ago mr
    gulliver11 exhibited a runt which weighed 1 pound 14 ounces and
    as i am informed by mr tegetmeier two runts from the south of
    france were lately exhibited at the crystal palace each of which
    weighed 2 pounds 2 ounces a very fine rockpigeon from the
    shetland islands weighed only 14 ounces
subrace iv tronfo of aldrovandi leghorn runtin aldrovandis
work published in 1600 there is a coarse woodcut of a great italian
pigeon with an elevated tail short legs massive body and with the
beak short and thick i had imagined that this latter character so
abnormal in the group was merely a false representation from bad
drawing but moore in his work published in 1735 says that he
possessed a leghorn runt of which the beak was very short for so large
a bird in other respects moores bird resembled the first subrace or
scanderoon for it had a long bowed neck long legs short beak and
elevated tail and not much wattle about the head so that aldrovandis
and moores birds must have formed distinct varieties both of which
seem to be now extinct in europe sir w elliot however informs me
that he has seen in madras a shortbeaked runt imported from cairo
subrace v murassa adorned pigeon of madrasskins of these
handsome chequered birds were sent me from madras by sir w elliot
they are rather larger than the largest rockpigeon with longer and
more massive beaks the skin over the nostrils is rather full and very
slightly carunculated and they have some naked skin round the eyes
feet large this breed is intermediate between the rockpigeon and a
very poor variety of runt or carrier
from these several descriptions we see that with runts as with
carriers we have a fine gradation from the rockpigeon with the
tronfo diverging as a distinct branch to our largest and most massive
runts but the chain of affinities and many points of resemblance
between runts and carriers make me believe that these two races have
not descended by independent lines from the rockpigeon but from some
common parent as represented in the table which had already acquired
a moderately long beak with slightly swollen skin over the nostrils
and with some slightly carunculated naked skin round the eyes
illustration fig 20english barb
      race ivbarbs
      indische tauben pigeons polonais
beak short broad deep naked skin round the eyes broad and
carunculated skin over nostrils slightly swollen
misled by the extraordinary shortness and form of the beak i did not
at first perceive the near affinity of this race to that of carriers
until the fact was pointed out to me by mr brent subsequently after
examining the bussorah carrier i saw that no very great amount of
modification would be requisite to convert it into a barb this view of
the affinity of barbs to carriers is supported by the analogical
difference between the short and longbeaked runts and still more
strongly by the fact that young barbs and dragons within 24 hours
after being hatched resemble each other much more closely than do
young pigeons of other and equally distinct breeds at this early age
the length of beak the swollen skin over the rather open nostrils the
gape of the mouth and the size of the feet are the same in both
although these parts afterwards become widely different we thus see
that embryology as the comparison of very young animals may perhaps be
called comes into play in the classification of domestic varieties as
with species in a state of nature
fanciers with some truth compare the head and beak of the barb to
that of a bullfinch the barb if found in a state of nature would
certainly have been placed in a new genus formed for its reception the
body is a little larger than that of the rockpigeon but the beak is
more than 2 of an inch shorter although shorter it is both
vertically and horizontally thicker from the outward flexure of the
rami of the lower jaw the mouth internally is very broad in the
proportion of 6 to 4 to that of the rockpigeon the whole head is
broad the skin over the nostril is swollen but not carunculated
except slightly in firstrate birds when old whilst the naked skin
round the eye is broad and much carunculated it is sometimes so much
developed that a bird belonging to mr harrison weir could hardly see
to pick up food from the ground the eyelids in one specimen were
nearly twice as long as those of the rockpigeon the feet are coarse
and strong but proportionally rather shorter than in the rockpigeon
the plumage is generally dark and uniform barbs in short may be
called shortbeaked carriers bearing the same relation to carriers
that the tronfo of aldrovandi does to the common runt
group iii
this group is artificial and includes a heterogeneous collection of
distinct forms it may be defined by the beak in wellcharacterised
specimens of the several races being shorter than in the rockpigeon
and by the skin round the eyes not being much developed

race vfantails

aborted body and beak rather short
    the normal number of tailfeathers in the genus columba is 12 but
    fantails have from only 12 as has been asserted up to according
    to mm boitard and corbi 42 i have counted in one of my own
    birds 33 and at calcutta mr blyth12 has counted in an
    imperfect tail 34 feathers in madras as i am informed by sir w
    elliot 32 is the standard number but in england number is much
    less valued than the position and expansion of the tail the
    feathers are arranged in an irregular double row their permanent
    fanlike expansion and their upward direction are more remarkable
    characters than their increased number the tail is capable of the
    same movements as in other pigeons and can be depressed so as to
    sweep the ground it arises from a more expanded basis than in
    other pigeons and in three skeletons there were one or two extra
    coccygeal vertebr i have examined many specimens of various
    colours from different countries and there was no trace of the
    oilgland this is a curious case of abortion13 the neck is thin
    and bowed backwards the breast is broad and protuberant the feet
    are small the carriage of the bird is very different from that of
    other pigeons in good birds the head touches the tailfeathers
    which consequently often become crumpled they habitually tremble
    much and their necks have an extraordinary apparently convulsive
    backward and forward movement good birds walk in a singular
    manner as if their small feet were stiff owing to their large
    tails they fly badly on a windy day the darkcoloured varieties
    are generally larger than white fantails
    although between the best and common fantails now existing in
    england there is a vast difference in the position and size of the
    tail in the carriage of the head and neck in the convulsive
    movements of the neck in the manner of walking and in the breadth
    of the breast the differences so graduate away that it is
    impossible to make more than one subrace moore however an
    excellent old authority14 says that in 1735 there were two sorts
    of broadtailed shakers ie fantails one having a neck much
    longer and more slender than the other and i am informed by mr
    b p brent that there is an existing german fantail with a
    thicker and shorter beak
subrace ii java fantailmr swinhoe sent me from amoy in china
the skin of a fantail belonging to a breed known to have been imported
from java it was coloured in a peculiar manner unlike any european
fantail and for a fantail had a remarkably short beak although a
good bird of the kind it had only 14 tailfeathers but mr swinhoe
has counted in other birds of this breed from 18 to 24 tailfeathers
from a rough sketch sent to me it is evident that the tail is not so
much expanded or so much upraised as in even secondrate european
fantails the bird shakes its neck like our fantails it had a
welldeveloped oilgland fantails were known in india as we shall
hereafter see before the year 1600 and we may suspect that in the
java fantail we see the breed in its earlier and less improved
condition

feathers divergent along the front of the neck and breast beak very
short vertically rather thick sophagus somewhat enlarged
turbits and owls differ from each other slightly in the shape of the
head the former have a crest and the beak is differently curved but
they may be here conveniently grouped together these pretty birds
some of which are very small can be recognised at once by the feathers
irregularly diverging like a frill along the front of the neck in
the same manner but in a less degree as along the back of the neck in
the jacobin they have the remarkable habit of continually and
momentarily inflating the upper part of the sophagus which causes a
movement in the frill when the sophagus of a dead bird is inflated
it is seen to be larger than in other breeds and not so distinctly
separated from the crop the pouter inflates both its true crop and
sophagus the turbit inflates in a much less degree the sophagus
alone the beak of the turbit is very short being 28 of an inch
shorter than that of the rockpigeon proportionally with the size of
their bodies and in some owls brought by mr e vernon harcourt from
tunis it was even shorter the beak is vertically thicker and perhaps
a little broader in proportion to that of the rockpigeon
      race viitumblers
      tmmler or burzeltauben culbutants
during flight tumble backwards body generally small beak generally
short sometimes excessively short and conical
this race may be divided into four subraces namely persian lotan
common and shortfaced tumblers these subraces include many
varieties which breed true i have examined eight skeletons of various
kinds of tumblers excepting in one imperfect and doubtful specimen
the ribs are only seven in number whereas the rockpigeon has eight
ribs
subrace i persian tumblersi received a pair direct from persia
from the hon c murray they are rather smaller birds than the wild
rockpigeon about the size of the common dovecot pigeon white and
mottled slightly feathered on the feet with the beak just perceptibly
shorter than in the rockpigeon hm consul mr keith abbott informs
me that the difference in the length of beak is so slight that only
practised persian fanciers can distinguish these tumblers from the
common pigeon of the country he informs me that they fly in flocks
high up in the air and tumble well some of them occasionally appear to
become giddy and tumble to the ground in which respect they resemble
some of our tumblers
    subrace ii lotan or lowtun indian ground tumblersthese
    birds present one of the most remarkable inherited habits or
    instincts ever recorded the specimens sent to me from madras by
    sir w elliot are white slightly feathered on the feet with the
    feathers on the head reversed and they are rather smaller than the
    rock or dovecot pigeon the beak is proportionally only slightly
    shorter and rather thinner than in the rockpigeon these birds
    when gently shaken and placed on the ground immediately begin
    tumbling head over heels and they continue thus to tumble until
    taken up and soothedthe ceremony being generally to blow in their
    faces as in recovering a person from a state of hypnotism or
    mesmerism it is asserted that they will continue to roll over till
    they die if not taken up there is abundant evidence with respect
    to these remarkable peculiarities but what makes the case the more
    worthy of attention is that the habit has been inherited since
    before the year 1600 for the breed is distinctly described in the
    ayeen akbery15 mr evans kept a pair in london imported by
    captain vigne and he assures me that he has seen them tumble in
    the air as well as in the manner above described on the ground
    sir w elliot however writes to me from madras that he is
    informed that they tumble exclusively on the ground or at a very
    small height above it he also mentions birds of another
    subvariety called the kalmi lotan which begin to roll over if
    only touched on the neck with a rod or wand
    subrace iii common english tumblersthese birds have exactly
    the same habits as the persian tumbler but tumble better the
    english bird is rather smaller than the persian and the beak is
    plainly shorter compared with the rockpigeon and proportionally
    with the size of body the beak is from 15 to nearly 2 of an inch
    shorter but it is not thinner there are several varieties of the
    common tumbler namely baldheads beards and dutch rollers i
    have kept the latter alive they have differently shaped heads
    longer necks and are featherfooted they tumble to an
    extraordinary degree as mr brent remarks16 every few seconds
    over they go one two or three summersaults at a time here and
    there a bird gives a very quick and rapid spin revolving like a
    wheel though they sometimes lose their balance and make a rather
    ungraceful fall in which they occasionally hurt themselves by
    striking some object from madras i have received several
    specimens of the common tumbler of india differing slightly from
    each other in the length of their beaks mr brent sent me a dead
    specimen of a housetumbler17 which is a scotch variety not
    differing in general appearance and form of beak from the common
    tumbler mr brent states that these birds generally begin to
    tumble almost as soon as they can well fly at three months old
    they tumble well but still fly strong at five or six months they
    tumble excessively and in the second year they mostly give up
    flying on account of their tumbling so much and so close to the
    ground some fly round with the flock throwing a clean summersault
    every few yards till they are obliged to settle from giddiness and
    exhaustion these are called air tumblers and they commonly throw
    from twenty to thirty summersaults in a minute each clear and
    clean i have one red cock that i have on two or three occasions
    timed by my watch and counted forty summersaults in the minute
    others tumble differently at first they throw a single
    summersault then it is double till it becomes a continuous roll
    which puts an end to flying for if they fly a few yards over they
    go and roll till they reach the ground thus i had one kill
    herself and another broke his leg many of them turn over only a
    few inches from the ground and will tumble two or three times in
    flying across their loft these are called housetumblers from
    tumbling in the house the act of tumbling seems to be one over
    which they have no control an involuntary movement which they seem
    to try to prevent i have seen a bird sometimes in his struggles
    fly a yard or two straight upwards the impulse forcing him
    backwards while he struggles to go forwards if suddenly startled
    or in a strange place they seem less able to fly than if quiet in
    their accustomed loft these housetumblers differ from the lotan
    or ground tumbler of india in not requiring to be shaken in order
    to begin tumbling the breed has probably been formed merely by
    selecting the best common tumblers though it is possible that they
    may have been crossed at some former period with lotans
illustration fig 23shortfaced english tumbler
    subrace iv shortfaced tumblersthese are marvellous birds
    and are the glory and pride of many fanciers in their extremely
    short sharp and conical beaks with the skin over the nostrils
    but little developed they almost depart from the type of the
    columbid their heads are nearly globular and upright in front so
    that some fanciers say18 the head should resemble a cherry with
    a barleycorn stuck in it these are the smallest kind of pigeons
    mr esquilant possessed a blue baldhead two years old which when
    alive weighed before feedingtime only 6 ounces 5 drs two
    others each weighed 7 ounces we have seen that a wild rockpigeon
    weighed 14 ounces 2 drs and a runt 34 ounces 4 drs shortfaced
    tumblers have a remarkably erect carriage with prominent breasts
    drooping wings and very small feet the length of the beak from
    the tip to the feathered base was in one good bird only 4 of an
    inch in a wild rockpigeon it was exactly double this length as
    these tumblers have shorter bodies than the wild rockpigeon they
    ought of course to have shorter beaks but proportionally with the
    size of the body the beak is 28 of an inch too short so again
    the feet of this bird were actually 45 shorter and proportionally
    21 of an inch shorter than the feet of the rockpigeon the
    middle toe has only twelve or thirteen instead of fourteen or
    fifteen scutell the primary wingfeathers are not rarely nine
    instead of ten in number the improved shortfaced tumblers have
    almost lost the power of tumbling but there are several authentic
    accounts of their occasionally tumbling there are several
    subvarieties such as baldheads beards mottles and almonds
    the latter are remarkable from not acquiring their
    perfectlycoloured plumage until they have moulted three or four
    times there is good reason to believe that most of these
    subvarieties some of which breed truly have arisen since the
    publication of moores treatise in 173519
finally in regard to the whole group of tumblers it is impossible to
conceive a more perfect gradation than i have now lying before me from
the rockpigeon through persian lotan and common tumblers up to the
marvellous shortfaced birds which latter no ornithologist judging
from mere external structure would place in the same genus with the
rockpigeon the differences between the successive steps in this
series are not greater than those which may be observed between common
dovecotpigeons c livia brought from different countries
      race viiiindian frillback
beak very short feathers reversed
a specimen of this bird in spirits was sent to me from madras by sir
w elliot it is wholly different from the frillback often exhibited
in england it is a smallish bird about the size of the common
tumbler but has a beak in all its proportions like our shortfaced
tumblers the beak measured from the tip to the feathered base was
only 46 of an inch in length the feathers over the whole body are
reversed or curl backwards had this bird occurred in europe i should
have thought it only a monstrous variety of our improved tumbler but
as shortfaced tumblers are not known in india i think it must rank as
a distinct breed probably this is the breed seen by hasselquist in
1757 at cairo and said to have been imported from india
      race ixjacobin
      zopfor perrckentaube nonnain
feathers of the neck forming a hood wings and tail long beak
moderately short
    this pigeon can at once be recognised by its hood almost enclosing
    the head and meeting in front of the neck the hood seems to be
    merely an exaggeration of the crest of reversed feathers on the
    back of the head which is common to many subvarieties and which
    in the latztaube20 is in a nearly intermediate state between a
    hood and a crest the feathers of the hood are elongated both the
    wings and tail are likewise much elongated thus the folded wing of
    the jacobin though a somewhat smaller bird is fully 1 inch
    longer than in the rockpigeon taking the length of the body
    without the tail as the standard of comparison the folded wing
    proportionally with the wings of the rockpigeon is 2 inches too
    long and the two wings from tip to tip 5 inches too long in
    disposition this bird is singularly quiet seldom flying or moving
    about as bechstein and riedel have likewise remarked in
    germany21 the latter author also notices the length of the wings
    and tail the beak is nearly 2 of an inch shorter in proportion to
    the size of the body than in the rockpigeon but the internal gape
    of the mouth is considerably wider
group iv
the birds of this group may be characterised by their resemblance in
all important points of structure especially in the beak to the
rockpigeon the trumpeter forms the only wellmarked race of the
numerous other subraces and varieties i shall specify only a few of
the most distinct which i have myself seen and kept alive
      race xtrumpeter
      trommeltaube pigeon tambour glouglou
a tuft of feathers at the base of the beak curling forward feet much
feathered voice very peculiar size exceeding that of the
rockpigeon
this is a wellmarked breed with a peculiar voice wholly unlike that
of any other pigeon the coo is rapidly repeated and is continued for
several minutes hence their name of trumpeters they are also
characterised by a tuft of elongated feathers which curls forward over
the base of the beak and which is possessed by no other breed their
feet are so heavily feathered that they almost appear like little
wings they are larger birds than the rockpigeon but their beak is of
very nearly the same proportional size their feet are rather small
this breed was perfectly characterised in moores time in 1735 mr
brent says that two varieties exist which differ in size
      race xiscarcely differing in structure from the wild columba
      livia
subrace i laugherssize less than the rockpigeon voice very
peculiaras this bird agrees in nearly all its proportions with the
rockpigeon though of smaller size i should not have thought it
worthy of mention had it not been for its peculiar voicea character
supposed seldom to vary with birds although the voice of the laugher
is very different from that of the trumpeter yet one of my trumpeters
used to utter a single note like that of the laugher i have kept two
varieties of laughers which differed only in one variety being
turncrowned the smoothheaded kind for which i am indebted to the
kindness of mr brent besides its peculiar note used to coo in a
singular and pleasing manner which independently struck both mr
brent and myself as resembling that of the turtledove both varieties
come from arabia this breed was known by moore in 1735 a pigeon which
seems to say yakroo is mentioned in 1600 in the ayeen akbery and is
probably the same breed sir w elliot has also sent me from madras a
pigeon called yahui said to have come from mecca which does not
differ in appearance from the laugher it has a deep melancholy voice
like yahu often repeated yahu yahu means oh god oh god and
sayzid mohammed musari in the treatise written about 100 years ago
says that these birds are not flown because they repeat the name of
the most high god mr keith abbott however informs me that the
common pigeon is called yahoo in persia
subrace ii common frillback die strupptaubebeak rather longer
than in the rockpigeon feathers reversedthis is a considerably
larger bird than the rockpigeon and with the beak proportionally
with the size of body a little viz by 04 of an inch longer the
feathers especially on the wingcoverts have their points curled
upwards or backwards
subrace iii nuns pigeons coquillesthese elegant birds are
smaller than the rockpigeon the beak is actually 17 and
proportionally with the size of the body 1 of an inch shorter than in
the rockpigeons although of the same thickness in young birds the
scutell on the tarsi and toes are generally of a leadenblack colour
and this is a remarkable character though observed in a lesser degree
in some other breeds as the colour of the legs in the adult state is
subject to very little variation in any breed i have on two or three
occasions counted thirteen or fourteen feathers in the tail this
likewise occurs in the barely distinct breed called helmets nuns are
symmetrically coloured with the head primary wingfeathers tail and
tailcoverts of the same colour namely black or red and with the
rest of the body white this breed has retained the same character
since aldrovandi wrote in 1600 i have received from madras almost
similarly coloured birds
    subrace iv spots die blasstauben pigeons heurtsthese
    birds are a very little larger than the rockpigeon with the beak
    a trace smaller in all its dimensions and with the feet decidedly
    smaller they are symmetrically coloured with a spot on the
    forehead with the tail and tailcoverts of the same colour the
    rest of the body being white this breed existed in 167622 and
    in 1735 moore remarks that they breed truly as is the case at the
    present day
subrace v swallowsthese birds as measured from tip to tip of
wing or from the end of the beak to the end of the tail exceed in
size the rockpigeon but their bodies are much less bulky their feet
and legs are likewise smaller the beak is of about the same length
but rather slighter altogether their general appearance is
considerably different from that of the rockpigeon their heads and
wings are of the same colour the rest of the body being white their
flight is said to be peculiar this seems to be a modern breed which
however originated before the year 1795 in germany for it is
described by bechstein
    besides the several breeds now described three or four other very
    distinct kinds existed lately or perhaps still exist in germany
    and france firstly the karmeliten or carme pigeon which i have
    not seen it is described as of small size with very short legs
    and with an extremely short beak secondly the finnikin which is
    now extinct in england it had according to moores23 treatise
    published in 1735 a tuft of feathers on the hinder part of the
    head which ran down its back not unlike a horses mane when it
    is salacious it rises over the hen and turns round three or four
    times flapping its wings then reverses and turns as many times
    the other way the turner on the other hand when it plays to
    the female turns only one way whether these extraordinary
    statements may be trusted i know not but the inheritance of any
    habit may be believed after what we have seen with respect to the
    groundtumbler of india mm boitard and corbi describe a
    pigeon24 which has the singular habit of sailing for a
    considerable time through the air without flapping its wings like
    a bird of prey the confusion is inextricable from the time of
    aldrovandi in 1600 to the present day in the accounts published of
    the draijers smiters finnikins turners claquers etc which
    are all remarkable from their manner of flight mr brent informs
    me that he has seen one of these breeds in germany with its
    wingfeathers injured from having been so often struck together but
    he did not see it flying an old stuffed specimen of a finnikin in
    the british museum presents no wellmarked character thirdly a
    singular pigeon with a forked tail is mentioned in some treatises
    and as bechstein25 briefly describes and figures this bird with
    a tail having completely the structure of that of the
    houseswallow it must once have existed for bechstein was far
    too good a naturalist to have confounded any distinct species with
    the domestic pigeon lastly an extraordinary pigeon imported from
    belgium has lately been exhibited at the philoperisteron society in
    london26 which conjoins the colour of an archangel with the
    head of an owl or barb its most striking peculiarity being the
    extraordinary length of the tail and wingfeathers the latter
    crossing beyond the tail and giving to the bird the appearance of
    a gigantic swift cypselus or longwinged hawk mr tegetmeier
    informs me that this bird weighed only 10 ounces but in length was
    15 inches from tip to beak to end of tail and 32 inches from tip
    to tip of wing now the wild rockpigeon weighs 14 ounces and
    measures from tip to beak to end of tail 15 inches and from tip to
    tip of wing only 26 inches
i have now described all the domestic pigeons known to me and have
added a few others on reliable authority i have classed them under
four groups in order to mark their affinities and degrees of
difference but the third group is artificial the kinds examined by me
form eleven races which include several subraces and even these
latter present differences that would certainly have been thought of
specific value if observed in a state of nature the subraces likewise
include many strictly inherited varieties so that altogether there
must exist as previously remarked above 150 kinds which can be
distinguished though generally by characters of extremely slight
importance many of the genera of the columbid admitted by
ornithologists do not differ in any great degree from each other
taking this into consideration there can be no doubt that several of
the most strongly characterised domestic forms if found wild would
have been placed in at least five new genera thus a new genus would
have been formed for the reception of the improved english pouter a
second genus for carriers and runts and this would have been a wide or
comprehensive genus for it would have admitted common spanish runts
without any wattle shortbeaked runts like the tronfo and the
improved english carrier a third genus would have been formed for the
barb a fourth for the fantail and lastly a fifth for the short
beaked notwattled pigeons such as turbits and shortfaced tumblers
the remaining domestic forms might have been included in the same
genus with the wild rockpigeon
individual variability variations of a remarkable nature
the differences which we have as yet considered are characteristic of
distinct breeds but there are other differences either confined to
individual birds or often observed in certain breeds but not
characteristic of them these individual differences are of importance
as they might in most cases be secured and accumulated by mans power
of selection and thus an existing breed might be greatly modified or a
new one formed fanciers notice and select only those slight
differences which are externally visible but the whole organisation is
so tied together by correlation of growth that a change in one part is
frequently accompanied by other changes for our purpose modifications
of all kinds are equally important and if affecting a part which does
not commonly vary are of more importance than a modification in some
conspicuous part at the present day any visible deviation of character
in a wellestablished breed is rejected as a blemish but it by no
means follows that at an early period before wellmarked breeds had
been formed such deviations would have been rejected on the contrary
they would have been eagerly preserved as presenting a novelty and
would then have been slowly augmented as we shall hereafter more
clearly see by the process of unconscious selection
    i have made numerous measurements of the various parts of the body
    in the several breeds and have hardly ever found them quite the
    same in birds of the same breedthe differences being greater than
    we commonly meet with in wild species within the same district to
    begin with the primary feathers of the wing and tail but i must
    first mention as some readers may not be aware of the fact that
    the number of the primary wing and tailfeathers in wild birds is
    generally constant and characterises not only whole genera but
    even whole families when the tailfeathers are unusually numerous
    as for instance in the swan they are apt to be variable in number
    but this does not apply to the several species and genera of the
    columbid which never as far as i can hear have less than twelve
    or more than sixteen tailfeathers and these numbers characterise
    with rare exception whole subfamilies27 the wild rockpigeon
    has twelve tailfeathers with fantails as we have seen the
    number varies from fourteen to fortytwo in two young birds in the
    same nest i counted twentytwo and twentyseven feathers pouters
    are very liable to have additional tailfeathers and i have seen
    on several occasions fourteen or fifteen in my own birds mr bult
    had a specimen examined by mr yarrell with seventeen
    tailfeathers i had a nun with thirteen and another with fourteen
    tailfeathers and in a helmet a breed barely distinguishable from
    the nun i have counted fifteen and have heard of other such
    instances on the other hand mr brent possessed a dragon which
    during its whole life never had more than ten tailfeathers and
    one of my dragons descended from mr brents had only eleven i
    have seen a baldhead tumbler with only ten and mr brent had an
    airtumbler with the same number but another with fourteen
    tailfeathers two of these latter tumblers bred by mr brent
    were remarkableone from having the two central tailfeathers a
    little divergent and the other from having the two outer feathers
    longer by threeeighths of an inch than the others so that in both
    cases the tail exhibited a tendency but in different ways to
    become forked and this shows us how a swallowtailed breed like
    that described by bechstein might have been formed by careful
    selection
with respect to the primary wingfeathers the number in the columbid
as far as i can find out is always nine or ten in the rockpigeon it
is ten but i have seen no less than eight shortfaced tumblers with
only nine primaries and the occurrence of this number has been noticed
by fanciers owing to ten primaries of a white colour being one of the
points in shortfaced baldheadtumblers mr brent however had an
airtumbler not shortfaced which had in both wings eleven primaries
mr corker the eminent breeder of prize carriers assures me that some
of his birds had eleven primaries in both wings i have seen eleven in
one wing in two pouters i have been assured by three fanciers that
they have seen twelve in scanderoons but as neumeister asserts that in
the allied florence runt the middle flightfeather is often double the
number twelve may have been caused by two of the ten primaries having
each two shafts to a single feather the secondary wingfeathers are
difficult to count but the number seems to vary from twelve to
fifteen the length of the wing and tail relatively to the body and of
the wings to the tail certainly varies i have especially noticed this
in jacobins in mr bults magnificent collection of pouters the wings
and tail varied greatly in length and were sometimes so much elongated
that the birds could hardly play upright in the relative length of the
few first primaries i have observed only a slight degree of
variability mr brent informs me that he has observed the shape of the
first feather to vary very slightly but the variation in these latter
points is extremely slight compared with the differences which may be
observed in the natural species of the columbid
in the beak i have seen very considerable differences in birds of the
same breed as in carefully bred jacobins and trumpeters in carriers
there is often a conspicuous difference in the degree of attenuation
and curvature of the beak so it is indeed in many breeds thus i had
two strains of black barbs which evidently differed in the curvature
of the upper mandible in width of mouth i have found a great
difference in two swallows in fantails of firstrate merit i have seen
some birds with much longer and thinner necks than in others other
analogous facts could be given we have seen that the oilgland is
aborted in all fantails with the exception of the subrace from java
and i may add so hereditary is this tendency to abortion that some
although not all of the mongrels which i reared from the fantail and
pouter had no oilgland in one swallow out of many which i have
examined and in two nuns there was no oilgland
    the number of the scutell on the toes often varies in the same
    breed and sometimes even differs on the two feet of the same
    individual the shetland rockpigeon has fifteen on the middle and
    six on the hinder toe whereas i have seen a runt with sixteen on
    the middle and eight on the hind toe and a shortfaced tumbler
    with only twelve and five on these same toes the rockpigeon has
    no sensible amount of skin between its toes but i possessed a spot
    and a nun with the skin extending for a space of a quarter of an
    inch from the fork between the two  inner toes on the other
    hand as will hereafter be more fully shown pigeons with feathered
    feet very generally have the bases of their outer toes connected
    by skin i had a red tumbler which had a coo unlike that of its
    fellows approaching in tone to that of the laugher this bird had
    the habit to a degree which i never saw equalled in any other
    pigeon of often walking with its wings raised and arched in an
    elegantmanner i need say nothing on the great variability in
    almost every breed in size of body in colour in the feathering
    of the feet and in the feathers on the back of the head being
    reversed but i may mention a remarkable tumbler28 exhibited at
    the crystal palace which had an irregular crest of feathers on its
    head somewhat like the tuft on the head of the polish fowl mr
    bult reared a hen jacobin with the feathers on the thigh so long as
    to reach the ground and a cock having but in a lesser degree the
    same peculiarity from these two birds he bred others similarly
    characterised which were exhibited at the philoperisteron soc i
    bred a mongrel pigeon which had fibrous feathers and the wing and
    tailfeathers so short and imperfect that the bird could not fly
    even a foot in height
    there are many singular and inherited peculiarities in the plumage
    of pigeons thus almondtumblers do not acquire their perfect
    mottled feathers until they have moulted three or four times the
    kite tumbler is at first brindled black and red with a barred
    appearance but when it throws its nest feathers it becomes almost
    black generally with a bluish tail and a reddish colour on the
    inner webs of the primary wingfeathers29 neumeister describes
    a breed of a black colour with white bars on the wing and a white
    crescentshaped mark on the breast these marks are generally
    rustyred before the first moult but after the third or fourth
    moult they undergo a change the wingfeathers and the crown of the
    head likewise then become white or grey30
    it is an important fact and i believe there is hardly an exception
    to the rule that the especial characters for which each breed is
    valued are eminently variable thus in the fantail the number and
    direction of the tailfeathers the carriage of the body and the
    degree of trembling are all highly variable points in pouters the
    degree to which they pout and the shape of their inflated crops
    in the carrier the length narrowness and curvature of the beak
    and the amount of wattle in shortfaced tumblers the shortness of
    the beak the prominence of the forehead and general carriage31
    and in the almondtumbler the colour of the plumage in common
    tumblers the manner of tumbling in the barb the breadth and
    shortness of the beak and the amount of eyewattle in runts the
    size of body in turbits the frill and lastly in trumpeters the
    cooing as well as the size of the tuft of feathers over the
    nostrils these which are the distinctive and selected characters
    of the several breeds are all eminently variable
    there is another interesting fact with respect to the characters of
    the several breeds namely that they are often most strongly
    displayed in the male bird in carriers when the males and females
    are exhibited in separate pens the wattle is plainly seen to be
    much more developed in the males though i have seen a hen carrier
    belonging to mr haynes heavily wattled mr tegetmeier informs me
    that in twenty barbs in mr p h joness possession the males
    had generally the largest eyewattles mr esquilant also believes
    in this rule but mr h weir a firstrate judge entertains some
    doubt on the subject male pouters distend their crops to a much
    greater size than do the females i have however seen a hen in
    the possession of mr evans which pouted excellently but this is
    an unusual circumstance mr harrison weir a successful breeder of
    prize fantails informs me that his male birds often have a greater
    number of tailfeathers than the females mr eaton asserts32
    that if a cock and hen tumbler were of equal merit the hen would
    be worth double the money and as pigeons always pair so that an
    equal number of both sexes is necessary for reproduction this
    seems to show that high merit is rarer in the female than in the
    male in the development of the frill in turbits of the hood in
    jacobins of the tuft in trumpeters of tumbling in tumblers there
    is no difference between the males and females i may here add a
    rather different case namely the existence in france33 of a
    winecoloured variety of the pouter in which the male is generally
    chequered with black whilst the female is never so chequered dr
    chapuis also remarks34 that in certain lightcoloured pigeons the
    males have their feathers striated with black and these stri
    increase in size at each moult so that the male ultimately becomes
    spotted with black with carriers the wattle both on the beak and
    round the eyes and with barbs that round the eyes goes on
    increasing with age this augmentation of character with advancing
    age and more especially the difference between the males and
    females in the abovementioned several respects are remarkable
    facts for there is no sensible difference at any age between the
    two sexes in the aboriginal rockpigeon and not often any strongly
    marked difference throughout the family of the columbid35
osteological characters
in the skeletons of the various breeds there is much variability and
though certain differences occur frequently and others rarely in
certain breeds yet none can be said to be absolutely characteristic of
any breed considering that stronglymarked domestic races have been
formed chiefly by mans selection we ought not to expect to find great
and constant differences in the skeleton for fanciers neither see nor
do they care for modifications of structure in the internal framework
nor ought we to expect changes in the skeletons from changed habits of
life as every facility is given to the most distinct breeds to follow
the same habits and the much modified races are never allowed to
wander abroad and procure their own food in various ways moreover i
find on comparing the skeletons of columba livia oenas palumbus
and turtur which are ranked by all systematists in two or three
distinct though allied genera that the differences are extremely
slight certainly less than between the skeletons of some of the most
distinct domestic breeds how far the skeleton of the wild rockpigeon
is constant i have had no means of judging as i have examined only
two
illustration fig 24skulls of pigeons viewed laterally
skullthe individual bones especially those at the base do not
differ in shape but the whole skull in its proportions outline and
relative direction of the bones differs greatly in some of the breeds
as may be seen by comparing the figures of a the wild rockpigeon
b the shortfaced tumbler c the english carrier and d the
bagadotten carrier of neumeister all drawn of the natural size and
viewed laterally in the carrier besides the elongation of the bones
of the face the space between the orbits is proportionally a little
narrower than in the rockpigeon in the bagadotten the upper mandible
is remarkably arched and the premaxillary bones are proportionally
broader in the shortfaced tumbler the skull is more globular all the
bones of the face are much shortened and the front of the skull and
descending nasal bones are almost perpendicular the maxillojugal arch
and premaxillary bones form an almost straight line the space between
the prominent edges of the eyeorbits is depressed in the barb the
premaxillary bones are much shortened and their anterior portion is
thicker than in the rockpigeon as is the lower part of the nasal
bone in two nuns the ascending branches of the premaxillaries near
their tips were somewhat attenuated and in these birds as well as in
some others for instance in the spot the occipital crest over the
foramen was considerably more prominent than in the rockpigeon
illustration fig 25lower jaws seen from above
illustration fig 26skull of runt
illustration fig 27lateral view of jaws
in the lower jaw the articular surface is proportionably smaller in
many breeds than in the rockpigeon and the vertical diameter more
especially of the outer part of the articular surface is considerably
shorter may not this be accounted for by the lessened use of the jaws
owing to nutritious food having been given during a long period to all
highly improved pigeons in runts carriers and barbs and in a lesser
degree in several breeds the whole side of the jaw near the articular
end is bent inwards in a highly remarkable manner and the superior
margin of the ramus beyond the middle is reflexed in an equally
remarkable manner as may be seen in fig 25 in comparison with the
jaw of the rockpigeon this reflection of the upper margin of the
lower jaw is plainly connected with the singularly wide gape of the
mouth as has been described in runts carriers and barbs the
reflection is well shown in fig 26 of the head of a runt seen from
above here a wide open space may be observed on each side between the
edges of the lower jaw and of the premaxillary bones in the
rockpigeon and in several domestic breeds the edges of the lower jaw
on each side come close up to the premaxillary bones so that no open
space is left the degree of downward curvature of the distal half of
the lower jaw also differs to an extraordinary degree in some breeds
as may be seen in the drawings fig 27 a of the rockpigeon b of
the shortfaced tumbler and c of the bagadotten carrier of
neumeister in some runts the symphysis of the lower jaw is remarkably
solid no one would readily have believed that jaws differing in the
several abovespecified points so greatly could have belonged to the
same species
    vertebrall the breeds have twelve cervical vertebr36 but
    in a bussorah carrier from india the twelfth vertebra carried a
    small rib a quarter of an inch in length with a perfect double
    articulation
the dorsal vertebr are always eight in the rockpigeon all eight
bear ribs the eighth rib being very thin and the seventh having no
process in pouters all the ribs are extremely broad eight bear ribs
the eighth rib being very thin and the seventh having no process in
pouters all the ribs are extremely broad and in three out of four
skeletons examined by me the eighth rib was twice or even thrice as
broad as in the rockpigeon and the seventh pair had distinct
processes in many breeds there are only seven ribs as in seven out of
eight skeletons of various tumblers and in several skeletons of
fantails turbits and nuns
in all these breeds the seventh pair was very small and was destitute
of processes in which respect it differed from the same rib in the
rockpigeon in one tumbler and in the bussorah carrier even the
sixth pair had no process the hypapophysis of the second dorsal
vertebra varies much in development being sometimes as in several
but not all tumblers nearly as prominent as that of the third dorsal
vertebra and the two hypapophyses together tend to form an ossified
arch the development of the arch formed by the hypapophyses of the
third and fourth dorsal vertebr also varies considerably as does the
size of the hypapophysis of the fifth vertebra
the rockpigeon has twelve sacral vertebr but these vary in number
relative size and distinctness in the different breeds in pouters
with their elongated bodies there are thirteen or even fourteen and
as we shall immediately see an additional number of caudal vertebr
in runts and carriers there is generally the proper number namely
twelve but in one runt and in the bussorah carrier there were only
eleven in tumblers there are either eleven or twelve or thirteen
sacral vertebr
the caudal vertebr are seven in number in the rockpigeon in
fantails which have their tails so largely developed there are eight
or nine and apparently in one case ten and they are a little longer
than in the rockpigeon and their shape varies considerably pouters
also have eight or nine caudal vertebr i have seen eight in a nun
and jacobin tumblers though such small birds always have the normal
number seven as have carriers with one exception in which there were
only six
the following table will serve as a summary and will show the most
remarkable deviations in the number of the vertebra and ribs which i
have observed

the pelvis differs very little in any breed the anterior margin of
the ilium however is sometimes a little more equally rounded on both
sides than in the rockpigeon the ischium is also frequently rather
more elongated the obturatornotch is sometimes as in many tumblers
less developed than in the rockpigeon the ridges on the ilium are
very prominent in most runts
illustration fig 28scapul of pigeons
illustration fig 29furcula of pigeons
in the bones of the extremities i could detect no difference except in
their proportional lengths for instance the metatarsus in a pouter
was 165 inch and in a shortfaced tumbler only 95 in length and
this is a greater difference than would naturally follow from their
differentlysized bodies but long legs in the pouter and small feet
in the tumbler are selected points in some pouters the scapula is
rather straighter and in some tumblers it is straighter with the apex
less elongated than in the rockpigeon in fig 28 the scapula of the
rockpigeon a and of a shortfaced tumbler b are given the
processes at the summit of the coracoid which receive the
extremities of the furculum form a more perfect cavity in some
tumblers than in the rockpigeon in pouters these processes are larger
and differently shaped and the exterior angle of the extremity of the
coracoid which is articulated to the sternum is squarer
the two arms of the furculum in pouters diverge less proportionally
to their length than in the rockpigeon and the symphysis is more
solid and pointed in fantails the degree of divergence of the two arms
varies in a remarkable manner in fig 29 b and c represent the
furcula of two fantails and it will be seen that the divergence in b
is rather less even than in the furculum of the shortfaced
smallsized tumbler a whereas the divergence in c equals that in a
rockpigeon or in the pouter d though the latter is a much larger
bird the extremities of the furculum where articulated to the
coracoids vary considerably in outline
in the sternum the differences in form are slight except in the size
and outline of the perforations which both in the larger and lesser
sized breeds are sometimes small these perforations also are
sometimes either nearly circular or elongated as is often the case
with carriers the posterior perforations occasionally are not
complete being left open posteriorly the marginal apophyses forming
the anterior perforations vary greatly in development the degree of
convexity of the posterior part of the sternum differs much being
sometimes almost perfectly flat the manubrium is rather more prominent
in some individuals than in others and the pore immediately under it
varies greatly in size
correlation of growthby this term i mean that the whole
organisation is so connected that when one part varies other parts
vary but which of two correlated variations ought to be looked at as
the cause and which as the effect or whether both result from some
common cause we can seldom or never tell the point of interest for us
is that when fanciers by the continued selection of slight
variations have largely modified one part they often unintentionally
produce other modifications for instance the beak is readily acted on
by selection and with its increased or diminished length the tongue
increases or diminishes but not in due proportion for in a barb and
shortfaced tumbler both of which have very short beaks the tongue
taking the rockpigeon as the standard of comparison was
proportionally not shortened enough whilst in two carriers and in a
runt the tongue proportionally with the beak was not lengthened
enough thus in a firstrate english carrier in which the beak from
the tip to the feathered base was exactly thrice as long as in a
firstrate shortfaced tumbler the tongue was only a little more than
twice as long but the tongue varies in length independently of the
beak thus in a carrier with a beak 12 inch in length the tongue was
67 in length whilst in a runt which equalled the carrier in length of
body and in stretch of wings from tip to tip the beak was 92 whilst
the tongue was 73 of an inch in length so that the tongue was
actually longer than in the carrier with its long beak the tongue of
the runt was also very broad at the root of two runts one had its
beak longer by 23 of an inch whilst its tongue was shorter by 14
than in the other
with the increased or diminished length of the beak the length of the
slit forming the external orifice of the nostrils varies but not in
due proportion for taking the rockpigeon as the standard the
orifice in a shortfaced tumbler was not shortened in due proportion
with its very short beak on the other hand and this could not have
been anticipated the orifice in three english carriers in the
bagadotten carrier and in a runt pigeon cygne was longer by above
the tenth of an inch than would follow from the length of the beak
proportionally with that of the rockpigeon in one carrier the orifice
of the nostrils was thrice as long as in the rockpigeon though in
body and length of beak this bird was not nearly double the size of the
rockpigeon this greatly increased length of the orifice of the
nostrils seems to stand partly in correlation with the enlargement of
the wattled skin on the upper mandible and over the nostrils and this
is a character which is selected by fanciers so again the broad
naked and wattled skin round the eyes of carriers and barbs is a
selected character and in obvious correlation with this the eyelids
measured longitudinally are proportionally more than double the length
of those of the rockpigeon
the great difference see fig 27 in the curvature of the lower jaw in
the rockpigeon the tumbler and bagadotten carrier stands in obvious
relation to the curvature of the upper jaw and more especially to the
angle formed by the maxillojugal arch with the premaxillary bones but
in carriers runts and barbs the singular reflexion of the upper
margin of the middle part of the lower jaw see fig 25 is not
strictly correlated with the width or divergence as may be clearly
seen in fig 26 of the premaxillary bones but with the breadth of the
horny and soft parts of the upper mandible which are always overlapped
by the edges of the lower mandible
in pouters the elongation of the body is a selected character and the
ribs as we have seen have generally become very broad with the
seventh pair furnished with processes the sacral and caudal vertebr
have been augmented in number the sternum has likewise increased in
length but not in the depth of the crest by 4 of an inch more than
would follow from the greater bulk of the body in comparison with that
of the rockpigeon in fantails the length and number of the caudal
vertebr have increased hence during the gradual progress of
variation and selection the internal bony framework and the external
shape of the body have been to a certain extent modified in a
correlated manner
    although the wings and tail often vary in length independently of
    each other it is scarcely possible to doubt that they generally
    tend to become elongated or shortened in correlation this is well
    seen in jacobins and still more plainly in runts some varieties
    of which have their wings and tail of great length whilst others
    have both very short with jacobins the remarkable length of the
    tail and wingfeathers is not a character which is intentionally
    selected by fanciers but fanciers have been trying for centuries
    at least since the year 1600 to increase the length of the
    reversed feathers on the neck so that the hood may more completely
    enclose the head and it may be suspected that the increased length
    of the wing and tailfeathers stand in correlation with the
    increased length of the neckfeathers shortfaced tumblers have
    short wings in nearly due proportion with the reduced size of their
    bodies but it is remarkable seeing that the number of the primary
    wingfeathers is a constant character in most birds that these
    tumblers generally have only nine instead of ten primaries i have
    myself observed this in eight birds and the original columbarian
    society37 reduced the standard for baldhead tumblers from ten to
    nine white flightfeathers thinking it unfair that a bird which
    had only nine feathers should be disqualified for a prize because
    it had not ten white flightfeathers on the other hand in
    carriers and runts which have large bodies and long wings eleven
    primary feathers have occasionally been observed
mr tegetmeier has informed me of a curious and inexplicable case of
correlation namely that young pigeons of all breeds which when mature
become white yellow silver ie extremely pale blue or
duncoloured are born almost naked whereas pigeons of other colours
are born wellclothed with down mr esquilant however has observed
that young dun carriers are not so bare as young dun barbs and
tumblers mr tegetmeier has seen two young birds in the same nest
produced from differently coloured parents which differed greatly in
the degree to which they were at first clothed with down
i have observed another case of correlation which at first sight
appears quite inexplicable but on which as we shall see in a future
chapter some light can be thrown by the law of homologous parts
varying in the same manner the case is that when the feet are much
feathered the roots of the feathers are connected by a web of skin
and apparently in correlation with this the two outer toes become
connected for a considerable space by skin i have observed this in
very many specimens of pouters trumpeters swallows rollertumblers
likewise observed in this breed by mr brent and in a lesser degree
in other featherfooted pigeons
the feet of the smaller and larger breeds are of course much smaller or
larger than those of the rockpigeon but the scutell or scales
covering the toes and tarsi have not only decreased or increased in
size but likewise in number to give a single instance i have counted
eight scutell on the hind toe of a runt and only five on that of a
shortfaced tumbler with birds in a state of nature the number of the
scutell on the feet is usually a constant character the length of the
feet and the length of the beak apparently stand in correlation but as
disuse apparently has affected the size of the feet this case may come
under the following discussion
on the effects of disusein the following discussion on the relative
proportions of the feet sternum furculum scapul and wings i may
premise in order to give some confidence to the reader that all my
measurements were made in the same manner and that they were made
without the least intention of applying them to the following purpose

i measured most of the birds which came into my possession from the
feathered base of the beak the length of beak itself being so
variable to the end of the tail and to the oilgland but
unfortunately except in a few cases not to the root of the tail i
measured each bird from the extreme tip to tip of wing and the length
of the terminal folded part of the wing from the extremity of the
primaries to the joint of the radius i measured the feet without the
claws from the end of the middle toe to the end of the hind toe and
the tarsus and middle toe together i have taken in every case the mean
measurement of two wild rockpigeons from the shetland islands as the
standard of comparison the following table shows the actual length of
the feet in each bird and the difference between the length which the
feet ought to have had according to the size of body of each in
comparison with the size of body and length of feet of the rockpigeon
calculated with a few specified exceptions by the standard of the
length of the body from the base of the beak to the oilgland i have
preferred this standard owing to the variability of the length of
tail but i have made similar calculations taking as the standard the
length from tip to tip of wing and likewise in most cases from the
base of the beak to the end of the tail and the result has always been
closely similar to give an example the first bird in the table being
a shortfaced tumbler is much smaller than the rockpigeon and would
naturally have shorter feet but it is found on calculation to have
feet too short by 11 of an inch in comparison with the feet of the
rockpigeon relatively to the size of the body in these two birds as
measured from the base of beak to the oilgland so again when this
same tumbler and the rockpigeon were compared by the length of their
wings or by the extreme length of their bodies the feet of the
tumbler were likewise found to be too short in very nearly the same
proportion i am well aware that the measurements pretend to greater
accuracy than is possible but it was less trouble to write down the
actual measurements given by the compasses in each case than an
approximation

in these two tables tables i and ii we see in the first column the
actual length of the feet in thirtysix birds belonging to various
breeds and in the two other columns we see by how much the feet are
too short or too long according to the size of bird in comparison
with the rockpigeon in the first table twentytwo specimens have
their feet too short on an average by a little above the tenth of an
inch viz 107 and five specimens have their feet on an average a
very little too long namely by 07 of an inch but some of these
latter cases can be explained for instance with pouters the legs and
feet are selected for length and thus any natural tendency to a
diminution in the length of the feet will have been counteracted in
the swallow and barb when the calculation was made on any standard of
comparison besides the one used viz length of body from base of beak
to oilgland the feet were found to be too small
    in the second table we have eight birds with their beaks much
    longer than in the rockpigeon both actually and proportionally
    with the size of body and their feet are in an equally marked
    manner longer namely in proportion on an average by 29 of an
    inch i should here state that in table i there are a few partial
    exceptions to the beak being proportionally shorter than in the
    rockpigeon thus the beak of the english frillback is just
    perceptibly longer and that of the bussorah carrier of the same
    length or slightly longer than in the rockpigeon the beaks of
    spots swallows and laughers are only a very little shorter or of
    the same proportional length but slenderer nevertheless these
    two tables taken conjointly indicate pretty plainly some kind of
    correlation between the length of the beak and the size of the
    feet breeders of cattle and horses believe that there is an
    analogous connection between the length of the limbs and head they
    assert that a racehorse with the head of a drayhorse or a
    greyhound with the head of a bulldog would be a monstrous
    production as fancy pigeons are generally kept in small aviaries
    and are abundantly supplied with food they must walk about much
    less than the wild rockpigeon and it may be admitted as highly
    probable that the reduction in the size of the feet in the
    twentytwo birds in the first table has been caused by disuse38
    and that this reduction has acted by correlation on the beaks of
    the great majority of the birds in table i when on the other
    hand the beak has been much elongated by the continued selection
    of successive slight increments of length the feet by correlation
    have likewise become much elongated in comparison with those of the
    wild rockpigeon notwithstanding their lessened use
as i had taken measures from the end of the middle toe to the heel of
the tarsus in the rockpigeon and in the above thirtysix birds i have
made calculations analogous with those above given and the result is
the same namely that in the shortbeaked breeds with equally few
exceptions as in the former case the middle toe conjointly with the
tarsus has decreased in length whereas in the longbeaked breeds it
has increased in length though not quite so uniformly as in the former
case for the leg in some varieties of the runt varies much in length
as fancy pigeons are generally confined in aviaries of moderate size
and as even when not confined they do not search for their own food
they must during many generations have used their wings incomparably
less than the wild rockpigeon hence it seemed to me probable that all
the parts of the skeleton subservient to flight would be found to be
reduced in size with respect to the sternum i have carefully measured
its extreme length in twelve birds of different breeds and in two wild
rockpigeons from the shetland islands for the proportional comparison
i have tried three standards of measurement with all twelve birds
namely the length from the base of the beak to the oilgland to the
end of the tail and from the extreme tip to tip of wings the result
has been in each case nearly the same the sternum being invariably
found to be shorter than in the wild rockpigeon i will give only a
single table as calculated by the standard from the base of the beak
to the oilgland for the result in this case is nearly the mean
between the results obtained by the two other standards

this table shows that in these twelve breeds the sternum is of an
average onethird of an inch exactly 332 shorter than in the
rockpigeon proportionally with the size of their bodies so that the
sternum has been reduced by between oneseventh and oneeighth of its
entire length and this is a considerable reduction
i have also measured in twentyone birds including the above dozen
the prominence of the crest of the sternum relatively to its length
independently of the size of the body in two of the twentyone birds
the crest was prominent in the same relative degree as in the
rockpigeon in seven it was more prominent but in five out of these
seven namely in a fantail two scanderoons and two english carriers
this greater prominence may to a certain extent be explained as a
prominent breast is admired and selected by fanciers in the remaining
twelve birds the prominence was less hence it follows that the crest
exhibits a slight though uncertain tendency to be reduced in
prominence in a greater degree than does the length of the sternum
relatively to the size of body in comparison with the rockpigeon
i have measured the length of the scapula in nine different large and
smallsized breeds and in all the scapula is proportionally shorter
taking the same standard as before than in the wild rockpigeon the
reduction in length on an average is very nearly onefifth of an inch
or about oneninth of the length of the scapula in the rockpigeon
the arms of the furcula in all the specimens which i compared diverged
less proportionally with the size of body than in the rockpigeon
and the whole furculum was proportionally shorter thus in a runt
which measured from tip to tip of wings 38 inches the furculum was
only a very little longer with the arms hardly more divergent than in
a rockpigeon which measured from tip to tip 26 inches in a barb
which in all its measurements was a little larger than the same
rockpigeon the furculum was a quarter of an inch shorter in a
pouter the furculum had not been lengthened proportionally with the
increased length of the body in a shortfaced tumbler which measured
from tip to tip of wings 24 inches therefore only 2 inches less than
the rockpigeon the furculum was barely twothirds of the length of
that of the rockpigeon
    we thus clearly see that the sternum scapula and furculum are all
    reduced in proportional length but when we turn to the wings we
    find what at first appears a wholly different and unexpected
    result i may here remark that i have not picked out specimens but
    have used every measurement made by me taking the length from the
    base of beak to the end of the tail as the standard of comparison
    i find that out of thirtyfive birds of various breeds
    twentyfive have wings of greater and ten have them of less
    proportional length than in the rockpigeon but from the
    frequently correlated length of the tail and wingfeathers it is
    better to take as the standard of comparison the length from the
    base of the beak to the oilgland and by this standard out of
    twentysix of the same birds which had been thus measured
    twentyone had wings too long and only five had them too short in
    the twentyone birds the wings exceeded in length those of the
    rockpigeon on an average by 113 inch whilst in the five birds
    they were less in length by only 8 of an inch as i was much
    surprised that the wings of closely confined birds should thus so
    frequently have been increased in length it occurred to me that it
    might be solely due to the greater length of the wingfeathers for
    this certainly is the case with the jacobin which has wings of
    unusual length as in almost every case i had measured the folded
    wings i subtracted the length of this terminal part from that of
    the expanded wings and thus i obtained with a moderate degree of
    accuracy the length of the wings from the ends of the two radii
    answering from wrist to wrist in our arms the wings thus measured
    in the same twentyfive birds now gave a widely different result
    for they were proportionally with those of the rockpigeon too
    short in seventeen birds and in only eight too long of these
    eight birds five were longbeaked39 and this fact perhaps
    indicates that there is some correlation of the length of the beak
    with the length of the bones of the wings in the same manner as
    with that of the feet and tarsi the shortening of the humerus and
    radius in the seventeen birds may probably be attributed to disuse
    as in the case of the scapula and furculum to which the wingbones
    are attachedthe lengthening of the wingfeathers and
    consequently the expansion of the wings from tip to tip being on
    the other hand as completely independent of use and disuse as is
    the growth of the hair or wool on our longhaired dogs or
    longwoolled sheep
to sum up we may confidently admit that the length of the sternum and
frequently the prominence of its crest the length of the scapula and
furculum have all been reduced in size in comparison with the same
parts in the rockpigeon and i presume that this may be attributed to
disuse or lessened exercise the wings as measured from the ends of
the radii have likewise been generally reduced in length but owing
to the increased growth of the wingfeathers the wings from tip to
tip are commonly longer than in the rockpigeon the feet as well as
the tarsi conjointly with the middle toe have likewise in most cases
become reduced and this it is probable has been caused by their
lessened use but the existence of some sort of correlation between the
feet and beak is shown more plainly than the effects of disuse we have
also some faint indication of a similar correlation between the main
bones of the wing and the beak
summary on the points of difference between the several domestic
races and between the individual birdsthe beak together with the
bones of the face differ remarkably in length breadth shape and
curvature the skull differs in shape and greatly in the angle formed
by the union of the premaxillary nasal and maxillojugal bones the
curvature of the lower jaw and the reflection of its upper margin as
well as the gape of the mouth differ in a highly remarkable manner
the tongue varies much in length both independently and in correlation
with the length of the beak the development of the naked wattled skin
over the nostrils and round the eyes varies in an extreme degree the
eyelids and the external orifices of the nostrils vary in length and
are to a certain extent correlated with the degree of development of
the wattle the size and form of the sophagus and crop and their
capacity for inflation differ immensely the length of the neck
varies with the varying shape of the body the breadth and number of
the ribs the presence of processes the number of the sacral vertebr
and the length of the sternum all vary the number and size of the
coccygeal vertebr vary apparently in correlation with the increased
size of the tail the size and shape of the perforations in the
sternum and the size and divergence of the arms of the furculum
differ the oilgland varies in development and is sometimes quite
aborted the direction and length of certain feathers have been much
modified as in the hood of the jacobin and the frill of the turbit
the wing and tailfeathers generally vary in length together but
sometimes independently of each other and of the size of the body the
number and position of the tailfeather vary to an unparalleled degree
the primary and secondary wingfeathers occasionally vary in number
apparently in correlation with the length of the wing the length of
the leg and the size of the feet and in connection with the latter
the number of the scutell all vary a web of skin sometimes connects
the bases of the two inner toes and almost invariably the two outer
toes when the feet are feathered
    the size of the body differs greatly a runt has been known to
    weigh more than five times as much as a shortfaced tumbler the
    eggs differ in size and shape according to parmentier40 some
    races use much straw in building their nests and others use
    little but i cannot hear of any recent corroboration of this
    statement the length of time required for hatching the eggs is
    uniform in all the breeds the period at which the characteristic
    plumage of some breeds is acquired and at which certain changes of
    colour supervene differs the degree to which the young birds are
    clothed with down when first hatched is different and is
    correlated in a singular manner with the colour of the plumage the
    manner of flight and certain inherited movements such as clapping
    the wings tumbling either in the air or on the ground and the
    manner of courting the female present the most singular
    differences in disposition the several races differ some races
    are very silent others coo in a highly peculiar manner
    although many different races have kept true in character during
    several centuries as we shall hereafter more fully see yet there
    is far more individual variability in the most constant breeds than
    in birds in a state of nature there is hardly any exception to the
    rule that those characters vary most which are now most valued and
    attended to by fanciers and which consequently are now being
    improved by continued selection this is indirectly admitted by
    fanciers when they complain that it is much more difficult to breed
    high fancy pigeons up to the proper standard of excellence than the
    socalled toy pigeons which differ from each other merely in
    colour for particular colours when once acquired are not liable to
    continued improvement or augmentation some characters become
    attached from quite unknown causes more strongly to the male than
    to the female sex so that we have in certain races a tendency
    towards the appearance of secondary sexual characters41 of which
    the aboriginal rockpigeon displays not a trace

 of columba in several species of psittacus in some species of otis

 39 it perhaps deserves notice that besides these five birds two of
 the eight were barbs which as i have shown must be classed in the

 during the reduction of their beaks their wings had retained a little
 of that excess of length which is characteristic of their nearest
 relations and progenitors

the differences described in the last chapter between the eleven chief
domestic races and between individual birds of the same race would be
of little significance if they had not all descended from a single
wild stock the question of their origin is therefore of fundamental
importance and must be discussed at considerable length no one will
think this superfluous who considers the great amount of difference
between the races who knows how ancient many of them are and how
truly they breed at the present day fanciers almost unanimously
believe that the different races are descended from several wild
stocks whereas most naturalists believe that all are descended from
the columba livia or rockpigeon
    temminck1 has well observed and mr gould has made the same
    remark to me that the aboriginal parent must have been a species
    which roosted and built its nest on rocks and i may add that it
    must have been a social bird for all the domestic races are highly
    social and none are known to build or habitually to roost on
    trees the awkward manner in which some pigeons kept by me in a
    summerhouse near an old walnuttree occasionally alighted on the
    barer branches was evident2 nevertheless mr r scot skirving
    informs me that he often saw crowds of pigeons in upper egypt
    settling on low trees but not on palms in preference to alighting
    on the mud hovels of the natives in india mr blyth3 has been
    assured that the wild c livia var intermedia sometimes
    roosts in trees i may here give a curious instance of compulsion
    leading to changed habits the banks of the nile above lat 28 30
    are perpendicular for a long distance so that when the river is
    full the pigeons cannot alight on the shore to drink and mr
    skirving repeatedly saw whole flocks settle on the water and drink
    whilst they floated down the stream these flocks seen from a
    distance resembled flocks of gulls on the surface of the sea
    if any domestic race had descended from a species which was not
    social or which built its nest and roosted in trees4 the sharp
    eyes of fanciers would assuredly have detected some vestige of so
    different an aboriginal habit for we have reason to believe that
    aboriginal habits are long retained under domestication thus with
    the common ass we see signs of its original desert life in its
    strong dislike to cross the smallest stream of water and in its
    pleasure in rolling in the dust the same strong dislike to cross a
    stream is common to the camel which has been domesticated from a
    very ancient period young pigs though so tame sometimes squat
    when frightened and thus try to conceal themselves even on an open
    and bare place young turkeys and occasionally even young fowls
    when the hen gives the dangercry run away and try to hide
    themselves like young partridges or pheasants in order that their
    mother may take flight of which she has lost the power the
    muskduck cairina moschata in its native country often perches
    and roosts on trees5 and our domesticated muskducks though
    such sluggish birds are fond of perching on the tops of barns
    walls etc and if allowed to spend the night in the henhouse
    the female will generally go to roost by the side of the hens but
    the drake is too heavy to mount thither with ease6 we know that
    the dog however well and regularly fed often buries like the
    fox any superfluous food and we see him turning round and round
    on a carpet as if to trample down grass to form a bed we see him
    on bare pavements scratching backwards as if to throw earth over
    his excrement although as i believe this is never effected even
    where there is earth in the delight with which lambs and kids
    crowd together and frisk on the smallest hillock we see a vestige
    of their former alpine habits
we have therefore good reason to believe that all the domestic races of
the pigeon are descended either from some one or from several species
which both roosted and built their nests on rocks and were social in
disposition as only five or six wild species have these habits and
make any near approach in structure to the domesticated pigeon i will
enumerate them
    firstly the columba leuconota resembles certain domestic
    varieties in its plumage with the one marked and neverfailing
    difference of a white band which crosses the tail at some distance
    from the extremity this species moreover inhabits the himalaya
    close to the limit of perpetual snow and therefore as mr blyth
    has remarked is not likely to have been the parent of our domestic
    breeds which thrive in the hottest countries secondly the c
    rupestris of central asia which is intermediate7 between the
    c leuconota and livia but has nearly the same coloured tail
    as the former species thirdly the  columba littoralis builds
    and roosts according to temminck on rocks in the malayan
    archipelago it is white excepting parts of the wing and the tip
    of the tail which are black its legs are lividcoloured and this
    is a character not observed in any adult domestic pigeon but i
    need not have mentioned this species or the closelyallied c
    luctuosa as they in fact belong to the genus carpophaga
    fourthly columba guinea which ranges from guinea8 to the cape
    of good hope and roosts either on trees or rocks according to the
    nature of the country this species belongs to the genus
    strictoenas of reichenbach but is closely allied to columba it is
    to some extent coloured like certain domestic races and has been
    said to be domesticated in abyssinia but mr mansfield parkyns
    who collected the birds of that country and knows the species
    informs me that this is a mistake moreover the c guinea is
    characterised by the feathers of the neck having peculiar notched
    tipsa character not observed in any domestic race fifthly the 
    columba nas of europe which roosts on trees and builds its nest
    in holes either in trees or the ground this species as far as
    external characters go might be the parent of several domestic
    races but though it crosses readily with the true rockpigeon
    the offspring as we shall presently see are sterile hybrids and
    of such sterility there is not a trace when the domestic races are
    intercrossed it should also be observed that if we were to admit
    against all probability that any of the foregoing five or six
    species were the parents of some of our domestic pigeons not the
    least light would be thrown on the chief differences between the
    eleven most stronglymarked races
    we now come to the best known rockpigeon the columba livia
    which is often designated in europe preeminently as the
    rockpigeon and which naturalists believe to be the parent of all
    the domesticated breeds this bird agrees in every essential
    character with the breeds which have been only slightly modified
    it differs from all other species in being of a slatyblue colour
    with two black bars on the wings and with the croup or loins
    white occasionally birds are seen in faroe and the hebrides with
    the black bars replaced by two or three black spots this form has
    been named by brehm9 c amali but this species has not been
    admitted as distinct by other ornithologists graba10 even found
    a difference in the bars on the right and left wings of the same
    bird in faroe another and rather more distinct form is either
    truly wild or has become feral on the cliffs of england and was
    doubtfully named by mr blyth11 as c affinis but is now no
    longer considered by him as a distinct species c affinis is
    rather smaller than the rockpigeon of the scottish islands and
    has a very different appearance owing to the wingcoverts being
    chequered with black with similar marks often extending over the
    back the chequering consists of a large black spot on the two
    sides but chiefly on the outer side of each feather the
    wingbars in the true rockpigeon and in the chequered variety are
    in fact due to similar though larger spots symmetrically crossing
    the secondary wingfeather and the larger coverts hence the
    chequering arises merely from an extension of these marks to other
    parts of the plumage chequered birds are not confined to the
    coasts of england for they were found by graba at faroe and w
    thompson12 says that at islay fully half the wild rockpigeons
    were chequered colonel king of hythe stocked his dovecot with
    young wild birds which he himself procured from nests at the orkney
    islands and several specimens kindly sent to me by him were all
    plainly chequered as we thus see that chequered birds occur
    mingled with the true rockpigeon at three distinct sites namely
    faroe the orkney islands and islay no importance can be attached
    to this natural variation in the plumage
    prince c l bonaparte13 a great divider of species enumerates
    with a mark of interrogation as distinct from c livia the c
    turricola of italy the c rupestris of daouria and the c
    schimperi of abyssinia but these birds differ from c livia in
    characters of the most trifling value in the british museum there
    is a chequered pigeon probably the c schimperi of bonaparte
    from abyssinia to these may be added the c gymnocyclus of g r
    gray from w africa which is slightly more distinct and has
    rather more naked skin round the eyes than the rockpigeon but
    from information given me by dr daniell it is doubtful whether
    this is a wild bird for dovecotpigeons which i have examined
    are kept on the coast of guinea
    the wild rockpigeon of india c intermedia of strickland has
    been more generally accepted as a distinct species it differs
    chiefly in the croup being blue instead of snowwhite but as mr
    blyth informs me the tint varies being sometimes albescent when
    this form is domesticated chequered birds appear just as occurs in
    europe with the truly wild c livia moreover we shall
    immediately have proof that the blue and white croup is a highly
    variable character and bechstein14 asserts that with
    dovecotpigeons in germany this is the most variable of all the
    characters of the plumage hence it may be concluded that c
    intermedia cannot be ranked as specifically distinct from c
    livia
in madeira there is a rockpigeon which a few ornithologists have
suspected to be distinct from c livia i have examined numerous
specimens collected by mr e v harcourt and mr mason they are
rather smaller than the rock pigeon from the shetland islands and
their beaks are plainly thinner but the thickness of the beak varied
in the several specimens in plumage there is remarkable diversity
some specimens are identical in every feather i speak after actual
comparison with the rockpigeon of the shetland islands others are
chequered like c affinis from the cliffs of england but generally
to a greater degree being almost black over the whole back others are
identical with the socalled c intermedia of india in the degree of
blueness of the croup whilst others have this part very pale or very
dark blue and are likewise chequered so much variability raises a
strong suspicion that these birds are domestic pigeons which have
become feral
    from these facts it can hardly be doubted that c livia affinis
    intermedia and the forms marked with an interrogation by
    bonaparte ought all to be included under a single species but it
    is quite immaterial whether or not they are thus ranked and
    whether some one of these forms or all are the progenitors of the
    various domestic kinds as far as any light can thus be thrown on
    the differences between the more stronglymarked races that common
    dovecotpigeons which are kept in various parts of the world are
    descended from one or from several of the abovementioned wild
    varieties of c livia no one who compares them will doubt but
    before making a few remarks on dovecotpigeons it should be stated
    that the wild rockpigeon has been found easy to tame in several
    countries we have seen that colonel king at hythe stocked his
    dovecot more than twenty years ago with young wild birds taken at
    the orkney islands and since then they have greatly multiplied
    the accurate macgillivray15 asserts that he completely tamed a
    wild rockpigeon in the hebrides and several accounts are on
    records of these pigeons having bred in dovecots in the shetland
    islands in india as captain hutton informs me the wild
    rockpigeon is easily tamed and breeds readily with the domestic
    kind and mr blyth16 asserts that wild birds come frequently to
    the dovecots and mingle freely with their inhabitants in the
    ancient ayeen akbery it is written that if a few wild pigeons be
    taken they are speedily joined by a thousand others of their
    kind
    dovecotpigeons are those which are kept in dovecots in a semi
    domesticated state for no special care is taken of them and they
    procure their own food except during the severest weather in
    england and judging from mm boitard and corbis work in
    france the common dovecot pigeon exactly resembles the chequered
    variety of c livia but i have seen dovecots brought from
    yorkshire without any trace of chequering like the wild
    rockpigeon of the shetland islands the chequered dovecots from
    the orkney islands after having been domesticated by colonel king
    for more than twenty years differed slightly from each other in
    the darkness of their plumage and in the thickness of their beaks
    the thinnest beak being rather thicker than the thickest one in the
    madeira birds in germany according to bechstein the common
    dovecotpigeon is not chequered in india they often become
    chequered and sometimes pied with white the croup also as i am
    informed by mr blyth becomes nearly white i have received from
    sir j brooke some dovecotpigeons which originally came from the
    s natunas islands in the malay archipelago and which had been
    crossed with the singapore dovecots they were small and the
    darkest variety was extremely like the dark chequered variety with
    a blue croup from madeira but the beak was not so thin though
    decidedly thinner than in the rock pigeon from the shetland
    islands a dovecotpigeon sent to me by mr swinhoe from foochow
    in china was likewise rather small but differed in no other
    respect i have also received through the kindness of dr daniell
    four living dovecotpigeons from sierra leone17 these were fully
    as large as the shetland rockpigeon with even bulkier bodies in
    plumage some of them were identical with the shetland rock pigeon
    but with the metallic tints apparently rather more brilliant
    others had a blue croup and resembled the chequered variety of c
    intermedia of india and some were so much chequered as to be
    nearly black in these four birds the beak differed slightly in
    length but in all it was decidedly shorter more massive and
    stronger than in the wild rockpigeon from the shetland islands or
    in the english dovecot when the beaks of these african pigeons
    were compared with the thinnest beaks of the wild madeira
    specimens the contrast was great the former being fully onethird
    thicker in a vertical direction than the latter so that any one at
    first would have felt inclined to rank these birds as specifically
    distinct yet so perfectly graduated a series could be formed
    between the abovementioned varieties that it was obviously
    impossible to separate them
to sum up the wild columba livia including under this name c
affinis intermedia and the other still more closelyaffined
geographical races has a vast range from the southern coast of norway
and the faroe islands to the shores of the mediterranean to madeira
and the canary islands to abyssinia india and japan it varies
greatly in plumage being in many places chequered with black and
having either a white or blue croup or loins it varies also slightly
in the size of the beak and body dovecotpigeons which no one
disputes are descended from one or more of the above wild forms
present a similar but greater range of variation in plumage in the
size of body and in the length and thickness of the beak there seems
to be some relation between the croup being blue or white and the
temperature of the country inhabited by both wild and dovecot pigeons
for nearly all the dovecotpigeons in the northern parts of europe have
a white croup like that of the wild european rockpigeon and nearly
all the dovecotpigeons of india have a blue croup like that of the
wild c intermedia of india as in various countries the wild
rockpigeon has been found easy to tame it seems extremely probable
that the dovecotpigeons throughout the world are the descendants of at
least two and perhaps more wild stocks but these as we have just
seen cannot be ranked as specifically distinct
with respect to the variation of c livia we may without fear of
contradiction go one step further those pigeonfanciers who believe
that all the chief races such as carriers pouters fantails etc
are descended from distinct aboriginal stocks yet admit that the
socalled toypigeons which differ from the rockpigeon in little
except colour are descended from this bird by toypigeons are meant
such birds as spots nuns helmets swallows priests monks
porcelains swabians archangels breasts shields and others in
europe and many others in india it would indeed be as puerile to
suppose that all these birds are descended from so many distinct wild
stocks as to suppose this to be the case with the many varieties of the
gooseberry heartsease or dahlia yet these kinds all breed true and
many of them include subvarieties which likewise transmit their
character truly they differ greatly from each other and from the
rockpigeon in plumage slightly in size and proportions of body in
size of feet and in the length and thickness of their beaks they
differ from each other in these respects more than do dovecotpigeons
although we may safely admit that dovecotpigeons which vary slightly
and that toy pigeons which vary in a greater degree in accordance
with their more highlydomesticated condition are descended from c
livia including under this name the aboveenumerated wild
geographical races yet the question becomes far more difficult when we
consider the eleven principal races most of which have been profoundly
modified it can however be shown by indirect evidence of a
perfectly conclusive nature that these principal races are not
descended from so many wild stocks and if this be once admitted few
will dispute that they are the descendants of c livia which agrees
with them so closely in habits and in most characters which varies in
a state of nature and which has certainly undergone a considerable
amount of variation as in the toypigeons we shall moreover presently
see how eminently favourable circumstances have been for a great amount
of modification in the more carefully tended breeds
the reasons for concluding that the several principal races are not
descended from so many aboriginal and unknown stocks may be grouped
under the following six heads
firstlyif the eleven chief races have not arisen from the variation
of some one species together with its geographical races they must be
descended from several extremely distinct aboriginal species for no
amount of crossing between only six or seven wild forms could produce
races so distinct as pouters carriers runts fantails turbits
shortfaced tumblers jacobins and trumpeters how could crossing
produce for instance a pouter or a fantail unless the two supposed
aboriginal parents possessed the remarkable characters of these breeds
i am aware that some naturalists following pallas believe that
crossing gives a strong tendency to variation independently of the
characters inherited from either parent they believe that it would be
easier to raise a pouter or fantail pigeon from crossing two distinct
species neither of which possessed the characters of these races than
from any single species i can find few facts in support of this
doctrine and believe in it only to a limited degree but in a future
chapter i shall have to recur to this subject for our present purpose
the point is not material the question which concerns us is whether
or not many new and important characters have arisen since man first
domesticated the pigeon on the ordinary view variability is due to
changed conditions of life on the pallasian doctrine variability or
the appearance of new characters is due to some mysterious effect from
the crossing of two species neither of which possesses the characters
in question in some few instances it is possible that wellmarked
races may have been formed by crossing for instance a barb might
perhaps be formed by a cross between a longbeaked carrier having
large eyewattles and some shortbeaked pigeon that many races have
been in some degree modified by crossing and that certain varieties
which are distinguished only by peculiar tints have arisen from crosses
between differentlycoloured varieties is almost certain on the
doctrine therefore that the chief races owe their differences to
their descent from distinct species we must admit that at least eight
or nine or more probably a dozen species all having the same habit of
breeding and roosting on rocks and living in society either now exist
somewhere or formerly existed but have become extinct as wild birds
considering how carefully wild pigeons have been collected throughout
the world and what conspicuous birds they are especially when
frequenting rocks it is extremely improbable that eight or nine
species which were long ago domesticated and therefore must have
inhabited some anciently known country should still exist in the wild
state and be unknown to ornithologists
the hypothesis that such species formerly existed but have become
extinct is in some slight degree more probable but the extinction of
so many species within the historical period is a bold hypothesis
seeing how little influence man has had in exterminating the common
rockpigeon which agrees in all its habits of life with the domestic
races the c livia now exists and flourishes on the small northern
islands of faroe on many islands off the coast of scotland on
sardinia and the shores of the mediterranean and in the centre of
india fanciers have sometimes imagined that the several supposed
parentspecies were originally confined to small islands and thus
might readily have been exterminated but the facts just given do not
favour the probability of their extinction even on small islands nor
is it probable from what is known of the distribution of birds that
the islands near europe should have been inhabited by peculiar species
of pigeons and if we assume that distant oceanic islands were the
homes of the supposed parentspecies we must remember that ancient
voyages were tediously slow and that ships were then illprovided with
fresh food so that it would not have been easy to bring home living
birds i have said ancient voyages for nearly all the races of the
pigeon were known before the year 1600 so that the supposed wild
species must have been captured and domesticated before that date
secondlythe doctrine that the chief domestic races are descended
from several aboriginal species implies that several species were
formerly so thoroughly domesticated as to breed readily when confined
although it is easy to tame most wild birds experience shows us that
it is difficult to get them to breed freely under confinement although
it must be owned that this is less difficult with pigeons than with
most other birds during the last two or three hundred years many
birds have been kept in aviaries but hardly one has been added to our
list of thoroughly reclaimed species yet on the above doctrine we must
admit that in ancient times nearly a dozen kinds of pigeons now
unknown in the wild state were thoroughly domesticated
    thirdlymost of our domesticated animals have run wild in
    various parts of the world but birds owing apparently to their
    partial loss of the power of flight less often than quadrupeds
    nevertheless i have met with accounts showing that the common fowl
    has become feral in south america and perhaps in west africa and
    on several islands the turkey was at one time almost feral on the
    banks of the parana and the guineafowl has become perfectly wild
    at ascension and in jamaica in this latter island the peacock
    also has become a maroon bird the common duck wanders from its
    home and becomes almost wild in norfolk hybrids between the common
    and muskduck which have become wild have been shot in north
    america belgium and near the caspian sea the goose is said to
    have run wild in la plata the common dovecotpigeon has become
    wild at juan fernandez norfolk island ascension probably at
    madeira on the shores of scotland and as is asserted on the
    banks of the hudson in north america18 but how different is the
    case when we turn to the eleven chief domestic races of the
    pigeon which are supposed by some authors to be descended from so
    many distinct species no one has ever pretended that any one of
    these races has been found wild in any quarter of the world yet
    they have been transported to all countries and some of them must
    have been carried back to their native homes on the view that all
    the races are the product of variation we can understand why they
    have not become feral for the great amount of modification which
    they have undergone shows how long and how thoroughly they have
    been domesticated and this would unfit them for a wild life
fourthlyif it be assumed that the characteristic differences
between the various domestic races are due to descent from several
aboriginal species we must conclude that man chose for domestication
in ancient times either intentionally or by chance a most abnormal
set of pigeons for that species resembling such birds as pouters
fantails carriers barbs shortfaced tumblers turbits etc would
be in the highest degree abnormal as compared with all the existing
members of the great pigeon family cannot be doubted thus we should
have to believe that man not only formerly succeeded in thoroughly
domesticating several highly abnormal species but that these same
species have since all become extinct or are at least now unknown
this double accident is so extremely improbable that the assumed
existence of so many abnormal species would require to be supported by
the strongest evidence on the other hand if all the races are
descended from c livia we can understand as will hereafter be more
fully explained how any slight deviation in structure which first
appeared would continually be augmented by the preservation of the most
strongly marked individuals and as the power of selection would be
applied according to mans fancy and not for the birds own good the
accumulated amount of deviation would certainly be of an abnormal
nature in comparison with the structure of pigeons living in a state of
nature
i have already alluded to the remarkable fact that the characteristic
differences between the chief domestic races are eminently variable we
see this plainly in the great difference in the number of the
tailfeathers in the fantail in the development of the crop in
pouters in the length of the beak in tumblers in the state of the
wattle in carriers etc if these characters are the result of
successive variations added together by selection we can understand
why they should be so variable for these are the very parts which have
varied since the domestication of the pigeon and therefore would be
likely still to vary these variations moreover have been recently and
are still being accumulated by mans selection therefore they have not
as yet become firmly fixed
    fifthlyall the domestic races pair readily together and what
    is equally important their mongrel offspring are perfectly
    fertile to ascertain this fact i made many experiments which are
    given in the note below and recently mr tegetmeier has made
    similar experiments with the same result19 the accurate
    neumeister asserts that when dovecots are crossed with pigeons of
    any other breed the mongrels are extremely fertile and hardy20
    mm boitard and corbi21 affirm after their great experience
    that the more distinct the breeds are which are crossed the more
    productive are their mongrel offspring i admit that the doctrine
    first broached by pallas is highly probable if not actually
    proved namely that closely allied species which in a state of
    nature or when first captured would have been in some degree
    sterile if crossed lose this sterility after a long course of
    domestication yet when we consider the great difference between
    such races as pouters carriers runts fantails turbits tumblers
    etc the fact of their perfect or even increased fertility when
    intercrossed in the most complicated manner becomes a strong
    argument in favour of their having all descended from a single
    species this argument is rendered much stronger when we hear i
    append in a note22 all the cases which i have collected that
    hardly a single wellascertained instance is known of hybrids
    between two true species of pigeons being fertile inter se or
    even when crossed with one of their pure parents
sixthlyexcluding certain important characteristic differences the
chief races agree most closely both with each other and with c livia
in all other respects as previously observed all are eminently
sociable all dislike to perch or roost and refuse to build in trees
all lay two eggs and this is not a universal rule with the columbid
all as far as i can hear require the same time for hatching their
eggs all can endure the same great range of climate all prefer the
same food and are passionately fond of salt all exhibit with the
asserted exception of the finnikin and turner which do not differ much
in any other character the same peculiar gestures when courting the
females and all with the exception of trumpeters and laughers which
likewise do not differ much in any other character coo in the same
peculiar manner unlike the voice of any other wild pigeon all the
coloured breeds display the same peculiar metallic tints on the breast
a character far from general with pigeons each race presents nearly
the same range of variation in colour and in most of the races we have
the same singular correlation between the development of down in the
young and the future colour of plumage all have the proportional
length of their toes and of their primary wingfeathers nearly the
samecharacters which are apt to differ in the several members of the
columbid in those races which present some remarkable deviation of
structure such as in the tail of fantails crop of pouters beak of
carriers and tumblers etc the other parts remain nearly unaltered
now every naturalist will admit that it would be scarcely possible to
pick out a dozen natural species in any family which should agree
closely in habits and in general structure and yet should differ
greatly in a few characters alone this fact is explicable through the
doctrine of natural selection for each successive modification of
structure in each natural species is preserved solely because it is of
service and such modifications when largely accumulated imply a great
change in the habits of life and this will almost certainly lead to
other changes of structure throughout the whole organisation on the
other hand if the several races of the pigeon have been produced by
man through selection and variation we can readily understand how it
is that they should still all resemble each other in habits and in
those many characters which man has not cared to modify whilst they
differ to so prodigious a degree in those parts which have struck his
eye or pleased his fancy
    besides the points above enumerated in which all the domestic
    races resemble c livia and each other there is one which
    deserves special notice the wild rockpigeon is of a slatyblue
    colour the wings are crossed by two bars the croup varies in
    colour being generally white in the pigeon of europe and blue in
    that of india the tail has a black bar close to the end and the
    outer webs of the outer tailfeathers are edged with white except
    near the tips these combined characters are not found in any wild
    pigeon besides c livia i have looked carefully through the
    great collections of pigeons in the british museum and i find that
    a dark bar at the end of the tail is common that the white edging
    to the outer tailfeathers is not rare but that the white croup is
    extremely rare and the two black bars on the wings occur in no
    other pigeon excepting the alpine c leuconota and c
    rupestris of asia now if we turn to the domestic races it is
    highly remarkable as an eminent fancier mr wicking observed to
    me that whenever a blue bird appears in any race the wings
    almost invariably show the double black bars23 the primary
    wingfeathers may be white or black and the whole body may be of
    any colour but if the wingcoverts are blue the two black bars
    are sure to appear i have myself seen or acquired trustworthy
    evidence as given below24 of blue birds with black bars on the
    wing with the croup either white or very pale or dark blue with
    the tail having a terminal black bar and with the outer feathers
    externally edged with white or very pale coloured in the following
    races which as i carefully observed in each case appeared to be
    perfectly true namely in pouters fantails tumblers jacobins
    turbits barbs carriers runts of three distinct varieties
    trumpeters swallows and in many other toypigeons which as being
    closely allied to c livia are not worth enumerating thus we
    see that in purelybred races of every kind known in europe blue
    birds occasionally appear having all the marks which characterise
    c livia and which concur in no other wild species mr blyth
    also has made the same observation with respect to the various
    domestic races known in india
    certain variations in the plumage are equally common in the wild
    c livia in dovecotpigeons and in all the most highly modified
    races thus in all the croup varies from white to blue being
    most frequently white in europe and very generally blue in
    india25 we have seen that the wild c livia in europe and
    dovecots in all parts of the world often have the upper
    wingcoverts chequered with black and all the most distinct races
    when blue are occasionally chequered in precisely the same manner
    thus i have seen pouters fantails carriers turbits tumblers
    indian and english swallows baldpates and other toypigeons
    blue and chequered and mr esquilant has seen a chequered runt i
    bred from two pure blue tumblers a chequered bird
    the facts hitherto given refer to the occasional appearance in pure
    races of blue birds with black wingbars and likewise of blue and
    chequered birds but it will now be seen that when two birds
    belonging to distinct races are crossed neither of which have nor
    probably have had during many generations a trace of blue in their
    plumage or a trace of wingbars and the other characteristic
    marks they very frequently produce mongrel offspring of a blue
    colour sometimes chequered with black wingbars etc or if not
    of a blue colour yet with the several characteristic marks more or
    less plainly developed i was led to investigate this subject from
    mm boitard and corbi26 having asserted that from crosses
    between certain breeds it is rare to get anything but bisets or
    dovecot pigeons which as we know are blue birds with the usual
    characteristic marks we shall hereafter see that this subject
    possesses independently of our present object considerable
    interest so that i will give the results of my own trials in full
    i selected for experiment races which when pure very seldom
    produce birds of a blue colour or have bars on their wings and
    tail
the nun is white with the head tail and primary wingfeathers black
it is a breed which was established as long ago as the year 1600 i
crossed a male nun with a female red common tumbler which latter
variety generally breeds true thus neither parent had a trace of blue
in the plumage or of bars on the wing and tail i should premise that
common tumblers are rarely blue in england from the above cross i
reared several young one was red over the whole back but with the
tail as blue as that of the rockpigeon the terminal bar however was
absent but the outer feathers were edged with white a second and
third nearly resembled the first but the tail in both presented a
trace of the bar at the end a fourth was brownish and the wings
showed a trace of the double bar a fifth was pale blue over the whole
breast back croup and tail but the neck and primary wingfeathers
were reddish the wings presented two distinct bars of a red colour
the tail was not barred but the outer feathers were edged with white
i crossed this last curiously coloured bird with a black mongrel of
complicated descent namely from a black barb a spot and
almondtumbler so that the two young birds produced from this cross
included the blood of five varieties none of which had a trace of blue
or of wing and tailbars one of the two young birds was
brownishblack with black wingbars the other was reddishdun with
reddish wingbars paler than the rest of the body with the croup pale
blue the tail bluish with a trace of the terminal bar
    mr eaton27 matched two shortfaced tumblers namely a splash
    cock and kite hen neither of which are blue or barred and from
    the first nest he got a perfect blue bird and from the second a
    silver or pale blue bird both of which in accordance with all
    analogy no doubt presented the usual characteristic marks
    i crossed two male black barbs with two female red spots these
    latter have the whole body and wings white with a spot on the
    forehead the tail and tailcoverts red the race existed at least
    as long ago as 1676 and now breeds perfectly true as was known to
    be the case in the year 173528 barbs are uniformlycoloured
    birds with rarely even a trace of bars on the wing or tail they
    are known to breed very true the mongrels thus raised were black
    or nearly black or dark or pale brown sometimes slightly piebald
    with white of these birds no less than six presented double
    wingbars in two the bars were conspicuous and quite black in
    seven some white feathers appeared on the croup and in two or
    three there was a trace of the terminal bar to the tail but in
    none were the outer tailfeathers edged with white
i crossed black barbs of two excellent strains with purelybred
snowwhite fantails the mongrels were generally quite black with a
few of the primary wing and tail feathers white others were dark
reddishbrown and others snowwhite none had a trace of wingbars or
of the white croup i then paired together two of these mongrels
namely a brown and black bird and their offspring displayed
wingbars faint but of a darker brown than the rest of body in a
second brood from the same parents a brown bird was produced with
several white feathers confined to the croup
    i crossed a male dun dragon belonging to a family which had been
    dun coloured without wingbars during several generations with a
    uniform red barb bred from two black barbs and the offspring
    presented decided but faint traces of wingbars i crossed a
    uniform red male runt with a white trumpeter and the offspring had
    a slatyblue tail with a bar at the end and with the outer
    feathers edged with white i also crossed a female black and white
    chequered trumpeter of a different strain from the last with a
    male almondtumbler neither of which exhibited a trace of blue or
    of the white croup or of the bar at end of tail nor is it
    probable that the progenitors of these two birds had for many
    generations exhibited any of these characters for i have never
    even heard of a blue trumpeter in this country and my
    almondtumbler was purely bred yet the tail of this mongrel was
    bluish with a broad black bar at the end and the croup was
    perfectly white it may be observed in several of these cases that
    the tail first shows a tendency to become by reversion blue and
    this fact of the persistency of colour in the tail and
    tailcoverts29 will surprise no one who has attended to the
    crossing of pigeons
the last case which i will give is the most curious i paired a mongrel
female barbfantail with a mongrel male barbspot neither of which
mongrels had the least blue about them let it be remembered that blue
barbs are excessively rare that spots as has been already stated
were perfectly characterised in the year 1676 and breed perfectly
true this likewise is the case with white fantails so much so that i
have never heard of white fantails throwing any other colour
nevertheless the offspring from the above two mongrels was of exactly
the same blue tint as that of the wild rockpigeon from the shetland
islands over the whole back and wings the double black wingbars were
equally conspicuous the tail was exactly alike in all its characters
and the croup was pure white the head however was tinted with a
shade of red evidently derived from the spot and was of a paler blue
than in the rockpigeon as was the stomach so that two black barbs a
red spot and a white fantail as the four purelybred grandparents
produced a bird exhibiting the general blue colour together with every
characteristic mark the wild columba livia
with respect to crossed breeds frequently producing blue birds
chequered with black and resembling in all respects both the
dovecotpigeon and the chequered wild variety of the rockpigeon the
statement before referred to by mm boitard and corbi would almost
suffice but i will give three instances of the appearance of such
birds from crosses in which one alone of the parents or
greatgrandparents was blue but not chequered i crossed a male blue
turbit with a snowwhite trumpeter and the following year with a dark
leadenbrown shortfaced tumbler the offspring from the first cross
were as perfectly chequered as any dovecotpigeon and from the second
so much so as to be nearly as black as the most darkly chequered
rockpigeon from madeira another bird whose greatgrandparents were a
white trumpeter a white fantail a white redspot a red runt and a
blue pouter was slatyblue and chequered exactly like a
dovecotpigeon i may here add a remark made to me by mr wicking who
has had more experience than any other person in england in breeding
pigeons of various colours namely that when a blue or a blue and
chequered bird having black wing bars once appears in any race and
is allowed to breed these characters are so strongly transmitted that
it is extremely difficult to eradicate them
what then are we to conclude from this tendency in all the chief
domestic races both when purely bred and more especially when
intercrossed to produce offspring of a blue colour with the same
characteristic marks varying in the same manner as in columbia
livia if we admit that these races are all descended from c livia
no breeder will doubt that the occasional appearance of blue birds thus
characterised is accounted for on the wellknown principle of throwing
back or reversion why crossing should give so strong a tendency to
reversion we do not with certainty know but abundant evidence of this
fact will be given in the following chapters it is probable that i
might have bred even for a century pure black barbs spots nuns white
fantails trumpeters etc without obtaining a single blue or barred
bird yet by crossing these breeds i reared in the first and second
generation during the course of only three or four years a
considerable number of young birds more or less plainly coloured blue
and with most of the characteristic marks when black and white or
black and red birds are crossed it would appear that a slight
tendency exists in both parents to produce blue offspring and that
this when combined overpowers the separate tendency in either parent
to produce black or white or red offspring
if we reject the belief that all the races of the pigeon are the
modified descendants of c livia and suppose that they are descended
from several aboriginal stocks then we must choose between the three
following assumptions firstly that at least eight or nine species
formerly existed which were aboriginally coloured in various ways but
have since varied in exactly the same manner so as to assume the
colouring of c livia but this assumption throws not the least light
on the appearance of such colours and marks when the races are crossed
or secondly we may assume that the aboriginal species were all
coloured blue and had the wingbars and other characteristic marks of
c liviaa supposition which is highly improbable as besides this
one species no existing member of the columbid presents these combined
characters and it would not be possible to find any other instance of
several species identical in plumage yet as different in important
points of structure as are pouters fantails carriers tumblers etc
or lastly we may assume that all the races whether descended from c
livia or from several aboriginal species although they have been bred
with so much care and are so highly valued by fanciers have all been
crossed within a dozen or score of generations with c livia and
have thus acquired their tendency to produce blue birds with the
several characteristic marks i have said that it must be assumed that
each race has been crossed with c livia within a dozen or at the
utmost within a score of generations for there is no reason to
believe that crossed offspring ever revert to one of their ancestors
when removed by a greater number of generations in a breed which has
been crossed only once the tendency to reversion will naturally become
less and less in the succeeding generations as in each there will be
less and less of the blood of the foreign breed but when there has
been no cross with a distinct breed and there is a tendency in both
parents to revert to some longlost character this tendency for all
that we can see to the contrary may be transmitted undiminished for an
indefinite number of generations these two distinct cases of reversion
are often confounded together by those who have written on inheritance
considering on the one hand the improbability of the three
assumptions which have just been discussed and on the other hand how
simply the facts are explained on the principle of reversion we may
conclude that the occasional appearance in all the races both when
purely bred and more especially when crossed of blue birds sometimes
chequered with double wingbars with white or blue croups with a bar
at the end of the tail and with the outer tailfeathers edged with
white affords an argument of the greatest weight in favour of the view
that all are descended from columba livia including under this name
the three or four wild varieties or subspecies before enumerated
to sum up the six foregoing arguments which are opposed to the belief
that the chief domestic races are the descendants of at least eight or
nine or perhaps a dozen species for the crossing of any less number
would not yield the characteristic differences between the several
races  firstly the improbability that so many species should still
exist somewhere but be unknown to ornithologists or that they should
have become within the historical period extinct although man has had
so little influence in exterminating the wild c livia secondly the
improbability of man in former times having thoroughly domesticated and
rendered fertile under confinement so many species thirdly these
supposed species having nowhere become feral fourthly the
extraordinary fact that man should intentionally or by chance have
chosen for domestication several species extremely abnormal in
character and furthermore the points of structure which render these
supposed species so abnormal being now highly variable fifthly the
fact of all the races though differing in many important points of
structure producing perfectly fertile mongrels whilst all the hybrids
which have been produced between even closely allied species in the
pigeonfamily are sterile sixthly the remarkable statements just
given on the tendency in all the races both when purely bred and when
crossed to revert in numerous minute details of colouring to the
character of the wild rockpigeon and to vary in a similar manner to
these arguments may be added the extreme improbability that a number of
species formerly existed which differed greatly from each other in
some few points but which resembled each other as closely as do the
domestic races in other points of structure in voice and in all their
habits of life when these several facts and arguments are fairly taken
into consideration it would require an overwhelming amount of evidence
to make us admit that the chief domestic races are descended from
several aboriginal stocks and of such evidence there is absolutely
none
the belief that the chief domestic races are descended from several
wild stocks no doubt has arisen from the apparent improbability of such
great modifications of structure having been effected since man first
domesticated the rockpigeon nor am i surprised at any degree of
hesitation in admitting their common parentage formerly when i went
into my aviaries and watched such birds as pouters carriers barbs
fantails and shortfaced tumblers etc i could not persuade myself
that all had descended from the same wild stock and that man had
consequently in one sense created these remarkable modifications
therefore i have argued the question of their origin at great and as
some will think superfluous length
    finally in favour of the belief that all the races are descended
    from a single stock we have in columba livia a still existing
    and widely distributed species which can be and has been
    domesticated in various countries this species agrees in most
    points of structure and in all its habits of life as well as
    occasionally in every detail of plumage with the several domestic
    races it breeds freely with them and produces fertile offspring
    it varies in a state of nature30 and still more so when
    semidomesticated as shown by comparing the sierra leone pigeons
    with those of india or with those which apparently have run wild
    in madeira it has undergone a still greater amount of variation in
    the case of the numerous toypigeons which no one supposes to be
    descended from distinct species yet some of these toypigeons have
    transmitted their character truly for centuries why then should
    we hesitate to believe in that greater amount of variation which is
    necessary for the production of the eleven chief races it should
    be borne in mind that in two of the most stronglymarked races
    namely carriers and shortfaced tumblers the extreme forms can be
    connected with the parentspecies by graduated differences not
    greater than those which may be observed between the
    dovecotpigeons inhabiting different countries or between the
    various kinds of toypigeonsgradations which must certainly be
    attributed to variation
    that circumstances have been eminently favourable for the
    modification of the pigeon through variation and selection will now
    be shown the earliest record as has been pointed out to me by
    professor lepsius of pigeons in a domesticated condition occurs
    in the fifth egyptian dynasty about 3000 bc31 but mr birch
    of the british museum informs me that the pigeon appears in a bill
    of fare in the previous dynasty domestic pigeons are mentioned in
    genesis leviticus and isaiah32 in the time of the romans as
    we hear from pliny33 immense prices were given for pigeons
    nay they are come to this pass that they can reckon up their
    pedigree and race in india about the year 1600 pigeons were
    much valued by akbar khan 20000 birds were carried about with the
    court and the merchants brought valuable collections the monarch
    of iran and turan sent him some very rare breeds his majesty
    says the courtly historian by crossing the breeds which method
    was never practised before has improved them astonishingly34
    akber khan possessed seventeen distinct kinds eight of which were
    valuable for beauty alone at about this same period of 1600 the
    dutch according to aldrovandi were as eager about pigeons as the
    romans had formerly been the breeds which were kept during the
    fifteenth century in europe and in india apparently differed from
    each other tavernier in his travels in 1677 speaks as does
    chardin in 1735 of the vast number of pigeonhouses in persia and
    the former remarks that as christians were not permitted to keep
    pigeons some of the vulgar actually turned mahometans for this
    sole purpose the emperor of morocco had his favourite keeper of
    pigeons as is mentioned in moores treatise published 1737 in
    england from the time of willughby in 1678 to the present day as
    well as in germany and in france numerous treatises have been
    published on the pigeon in india about a hundred years ago a
    persian treatise was written and the writer thought it no light
    affair for he begins with a solemn invocation in the name of
    god the gracious and merciful many large towns in europe and
    the united states now have their societies of devoted
    pigeonfanciers at present there are three such societies in
    london in india as i hear from mr blyth the inhabitants of
    delhi and of some other great cities are eager fanciers mr layard
    informs me that most of the known breeds are kept in ceylon in
    china according to mr swinhoe of amoy and dr lockhart of
    shangai carriers fantails tumblers and other varieties are
    reared with care especially by the bonzes or priests the chinese
    fasten a kind of whistle to the tailfeathers of their pigeons and
    as the flock wheels through the air they produce a sweet sound in
    egypt the late abbas pacha was a great fancier of fantails many
    pigeons are kept at cairo and constantinople and these have lately
    been imported by native merchants as i hear from sir w elliot
    into southern india and sold at high prices
    the foregoing statements show in how many countries and during how
    long a period many men have been passionately devoted to the
    breeding of pigeons hear how an enthusiastic fancier at the
    present day writes if it were possible for noblemen and gentlemen
    to know the amazing amount of solace and pleasure derived from
    almond tumblers when they begin to understand their properties i
    should think that scarce any nobleman or gentleman would be without
    their aviaries of almond tumblers35 the pleasure thus taken is
    of paramount importance as it leads amateurs carefully to note and
    preserve each slight deviation of structure which strikes their
    fancy pigeons are often closely confined during their whole lives
    they do not partake of their naturally varied diet they have often
    been transported from one climate to another and all these changes
    in their conditions of life would be likely to cause variability
    pigeons have been domesticated for nearly 5000 years and have been
    kept in many places so that the numbers reared under domestication
    must have been enormous and this is another circumstance of high
    importance for it obviously favours the chance of rare
    modifications of structure occasionally appearing slight
    variations of all kinds would almost certainly be observed and if
    valued would owing to the following circumstances be preserved
    and propagated with unusual facility pigeons differently from any
    other domesticated animal can easily be mated for life and
    though kept with other pigeons rarely prove unfaithful to each
    other even when the male does break his marriagevow he does not
    permanently desert his mate i have bred in the same aviaries many
    pigeons of different kinds and never reared a single bird of an
    impure strain hence a fancier can with the greatest ease select
    and match his birds he will also see the good results of his care
    for pigeons breed with extraordinary rapidity he may freely reject
    inferior birds as they serve at an early age as excellent food
      history of the principal races of the pigeon36
before discussing the means and steps by which the chief races have
been formed it will be advisable to give some historical details for
more is known of the history of the pigeon little though this is than
of any other domesticated animal some of the cases are interesting as
proving how long domestic varieties may be propagated with exactly the
same or nearly the same characters and other cases are still more
interesting as showing how slowly but steadily races have been greatly
modified during successive generations in the last chapter i stated
that trumpeters and laughers both so remarkable for their voices seem
to have been perfectly characterised in 1735 and laughers were
apparently known in india before the year 1600 spots in 1676 and nuns
in the time of aldrovandi before 1600 were coloured exactly as they
now are common tumblers and ground tumblers displayed in india before
the year 1600 the same extraordinary peculiarities of flight as at the
present day for they are well described in the ayeen akbery these
breeds may all have existed for a much longer period we know only that
they were perfectly characterised at the dates above given the 
average length of life of the domestic pigeon is probably about five
or six years if so some of these races have retained their character
perfectly for at least forty or fifty generations
    poutersthese birds as far as a very short description serves
    for comparison appear to have been well characterised in
    aldrovandis time37 before the year 1600 length of body and
    length of leg are at the present time the two chief points of
    excellence in 1735 moore said see mr j m eatons editionand
    moore was a firstrate fancierthat he once saw a bird with a body
    20 inches in length though 17 or 18 inches is reckoned a very
    good length and he has seen the legs very nearly 7 inches in
    length yet a leg 6 or 6 long must be allowed to be a very good
    one mr bult the most successful breeder of pouters in the
    world informs me that at present 1858 the standard length of the
    body is not less than 18 inches but he has measured one bird 19
    inches in length and has heard of 20 and 22 inches but doubts the
    truth of these latter statements the standard length of the leg is
    now 7 inches but mr bult has recently measured two of his own
    birds with legs 7 long so that in the 123 years which have
    elapsed since 1735 there has been hardly any increase in the
    standard length of the body 17 or 18 inches was formerly reckoned
    a very good length and now 18 inches is the minimum standard but
    the length of leg seems to have increased as moore never saw one
    quite 7 inches long now the standard is 7 and two of mr bults
    birds measured 7 inches in length the extremely slight
    improvement in pouters except in the length of the leg during the
    last 123 years may be partly accounted for by the neglect which
    they suffered as i am informed by mr bult until within the last
    20 or 30 years about 176538 there was a change of fashion
    stouter and more feathered legs being preferred to thin and nearly
    naked legs
    fantailsthe first notice of the existence of this breed is in
    india before the year 1600 as given in the ayeen akbery39 at
    this date judging from aldrovandi the breed was unknown in
    europe in 1677 willughby speaks of a fantail with 26
    tailfeathers in 1735 moore saw one with 36 feathers and in 1824
    mm boitard and corbi assert that in france birds can easily be
    found with 42 tailfeathers in england the number of the
    tailfeathers is not at present so much regarded as their upward
    direction and expansion the general carriage of the bird is
    likewise now much valued the old descriptions do not suffice to
    show whether in these latter respects there has been much
    improvement but if fantails with their heads and tails touching
    had formerly existed as at the present time the fact would almost
    certainly have been noticed the fantails which are now found in
    india probably show the state of the race as far as carriage is
    concerned at the date of their introduction into europe and some
    said to have been brought from calcutta which i kept alive were
    in a marked manner inferior to our exhibition birds the java
    fantail shows the same difference in carriage and although mr
    swinhoe has counted 18 and 24 tailfeathers in his birds a
    firstrate specimen sent to me had only 14 tailfeathers
jacobinsthis breed existed before 1600 but the hood judging from
the figure given by aldrovandi did not enclose the head nearly so
perfectly as at present nor was the head then white nor were the
wings and tail so long but this last character might have been
overlooked by the rude artist in moores time in 1735 the jacobin
was considered the smallest kind of pigeon and the bill is said to be
very short hence either the jacobin or the other kinds with which it
was then compared must since that time have been considerably
modified for moores description and it must be remembered that he
was a firstrate judge is clearly not applicable as far as size of
body and length of beak are concerned to our present jacobins in
1795 judging from bechstein the breed had assumed its present
character
turbitsit has generally been supposed by the older writers on
pigeons that the turbit is the cortbeck of aldrovandi but if this be
the case it is an extraordinary fact that the characteristic frill
should not have been noticed the beak moreover of the cortbeck is
described as closely resembling that of the jacobin which shows a
change in the one or the other race the turbit with its
characteristic frill and bearing its present name is described by
willughby in 1677 and the bill is said to be like that of the
bullfincha good comparison but now more strictly applicable to the
beak of the barb the subbreed called the owl was well known in
moores time in 1735
    tumblerscommon tumblers as well as ground tumblers perfect as
    far as tumbling is concerned existed in india before the year
    1600 and at this period diversified modes of flight such as
    flying at night the ascent to a great height and manner of
    descent seem to have been much attended to in india as at the
    present time belon40 in 1555 saw in paphlagonia what he
    describes as a very new thing viz pigeons which flew so high in
    the air that they were lost to view but returned to their
    pigeonhouse without separating this manner of flight is
    characteristic of our present tumblers but it is clear that belon
    would have mentioned the act of tumbling if the pigeons described
    by him had tumbled tumblers were not known in europe in 1600 as
    they are not mentioned by aldrovandi who discusses the flight of
    pigeons they are briefly alluded to by willughby in 1687 as
    small pigeons which show like footballs in the air the
    shortfaced race did not exist at this period as willughby could
    not have overlooked birds so remarkable for their small size and
    short beaks we can even trace some of the steps by which this race
    has been produced moore in 1735 enumerates correctly the chief
    points of excellence but does not give any description of the
    several subbreeds and from this fact mr eaton infers41 that
    the shortfaced tumbler had not then come to full perfection moore
    even speaks of the jacobin as being the smallest pigeon thirty
    years afterwards in 1765 in the treatise dedicated to mayor
    shortfaced almond tumblers are fully described but the author an
    excellent fancier expressly states in his preface p xiv that
    from great care and expense in breeding them they have arrived to
    so great perfection and are so different from what they were 20 or
    30 years past that an old fancier would have condemned them for no
    other reason than because they are not like what used to be thought
    good when he was in the fancy before hence it would appear that
    there was a rather sudden change in the character of the
    shortfaced tumbler at about this period and there is reason to
    suspect that a dwarfed and halfmonstrous bird the parentform of
    the several shortfaced subbreeds then appeared i suspect this
    because shortfaced tumblers are born with their beaks ascertained
    by careful measurement as short proportionally with the size of
    their bodies as in the adult bird and in this respect they differ
    greatly from all other breeds which slowly acquire during growth
    their various characteristic qualities
    since the year 1765 there has been some change in one of the chief
    characters of the shortfaced tumbler namely in the length of the
    beak fanciers measure the head and beak from the tip of the beak
    to the front corner of the eyeball about the year 1765 a head and
    beak was considered good42 which measured in the usual manner
    was 78 of an inch in length now it ought not to exceed 58 of an
    inch it is however possible as mr eaton candidly
    confessesfor a bird to be considered as pleasant or neat even at
    68 of an inch but exceeding that length it must be looked upon as
    unworthy of attention mr eaton states that he has never seen in
    the course of his life more than two or three birds with the head
    and beak not exceeding half an inch in length still i believe in
    the course of a few years that the head and beak will be shortened
    and that halfinch birds will not be considered so great a
    curiosity as at the present time that mr eatons opinion
    deserves attention cannot be doubted considering his success in
    winning prizes at our exhibitions finally in regard to the tumbler
    it may be concluded from the facts above given that it was
    originally introduced into europe probably first into england
    from the east and that it then resembled our common english
    tumbler or more probably the persian or indian tumbler with a
    beak only just perceptibly shorter than that of the common
    dovecotpigeon with respect to the shortfaced tumbler which is
    not known to exist in the east there can hardly be a doubt that
    the whole wonderful change in the size of the head beak body and
    feet and in general carriage has been produced during the last
    two centuries by continued selection aided probably by the birth
    of a semi monstrous bird somewhere about the year 1750
runtsof their history little can be said in the time of pliny the
pigeons of campania were the largest known and from this fact alone
some authors assert that they were runts in aldrovandis time in
1600 two subbreeds existed but one of them the shortbeaked is now
extinct in europe
barbsnotwithstanding statements to the contrary it seems to me
impossible to recognise the barb in aldrovandis description and
figures four breeds however existed in the year 1600 which evidently
were allied both to barbs and carriers to show how difficult it is to
recognise some of the breeds described by aldrovandi i will give the
different opinions in regard to the above four kinds named by him c
indica cretensis gutturosa and persica willughby thought that
the columba indica was a turbit but the eminent fancier mr brent
believes that it was an inferior barb c cretensis with a short
beak and a swelling on the upper mandible cannot be recognised c
falsely called gutturosa which from its rostrum breve crassum
et tuberosum seems to me to come nearest to the barb mr brent
believes to be a carrier and lastly the c persica et turcica mr
brent thinks and i quite concur with him was a shortbeaked carrier
with very little wattle in 1687 the barb was known in england and
willughby describes the beak as like that of the turbit but it is not
credible that his barbs should have had a beak like that of our present
birds for so accurate an observer could not have overlooked its great
breadth
    english carrierwe may look in vain in aldrovandis work for any
    bird resembling our prize carriers the c persica et turcica of
    this author comes the nearest but is said to have had a short
    thick beak therefore it must have approached in character a barb
    and have differed greatly from our carriers in willughbys time
    in 1677 we can clearly recognise the carrier yet he adds the
    bill is not short but of a moderate length a description which
    no one would apply to our present carriers so conspicuous for the
    extraordinary length of their beaks the old names given in europe
    to the carrier and the several names now in use in india indicate
    that carriers originally came from persia and willughbys
    description would perfectly apply to the bussorah carrier as it now
    exists in madras in later times we can partially trace the
    progress of change in our english carriers moore in 1735 says
    an inch and a half is reckoned a long beak though there are very
    good carriers that are found not to exceed an inch and a quarter
    these birds must have resembled or perhaps been a little superior
    to the carriers previously described now found in persia in
    england at the present day there are as mr eaton43 states
    beaks that would measure from edge of eye to tip of beak one
    inch and threequarters and some few even two inches in length
from these historical details we see that nearly all the chief domestic
races existed before the year 1600 some remarkable only for colour
appear to have been identical with our present breeds some were nearly
the same some considerably different and some have since become
extinct several breeds such as finnikins and turners the
swallowtailed pigeon of bechstein and the carmelite seem to have
originated and to have disappeared within this same period any one now
visiting a wellstocked english aviary would certainly pick out as the
most distinct kinds the massive runt the carrier with its wonderfully
elongated beak and great wattles the barb with its short broad beak
and eyewattles the shortfaced tumbler with its small conical beak
the pouter with its great crop long legs and body the fantail with
its upraised widelyexpanded wellfeathered tail the turbit with its
frill and short blunt beak and the jacobin with his hood now if this
same person could have viewed the pigeons kept before 1600 by akber
khan in india and by aldrovandi in europe he would have seen the
jacobin with a less perfect hood the turbit apparently without its
frill the pouter with shorter legs and in every way less
remarkablethat is if aldrovandis pouter resembled the old german
kind the fantail would have been far less singular in appearance and
would have had much fewer feathers in its tail he would have seen
excellent flying tumblers but he would in vain have looked for the
marvellous shortfaced breeds he would have seen birds allied to
barbs but it is extremely doubtful whether he would have met with our
actual barbs and lastly he would have found carriers with beaks and
wattle incomparably less developed than in our english carriers he
might have classed most of the breeds in the same groups as at present
but the differences between the groups were then far less strongly
pronounced than at present in short the several breeds had at this
early period not diverged in so great a degree as now from their
aboriginal common parent the wild rockpigeon
      manner of formation of the chief races
we will now consider more closely the probable steps by which the chief
races have been formed as long as pigeons are kept semidomesticated
in dovecots in their native country without any care in selecting and
matching them they are liable to little more variation than the wild
c livia namely in the wings becoming chequered with black in the
croup being blue or white and in the size of the body when however
dovecotpigeons are transported into diversified countries such as
sierra leone the malay archipelago and madeira they are exposed to
new conditions of life and apparently in consequence vary in a
somewhat greater degree when closely confined either for the pleasure
of watching them or to prevent their straying they must be exposed
even in their native climate to considerably different conditions for
they cannot obtain their natural diversity of food and what is
probably more important they are abundantly fed whilst debarred from
taking much exercise under these circumstances we might expect to
find from the analogy of all other domesticated animals a greater
amount of individual variability than with the wild pigeon and this is
the case the want of exercise apparently tends to reduce the size of
the feet and organs of flight and then from the law of correlation of
growth the beak apparently becomes affected from what we now see
occasionally taking place in our aviaries we may conclude that sudden
variations or sports such as the appearance of a crest of feathers on
the head of feathered feet of a new shade of colour of an additional
feather in the tail or wing would occur at rare intervals during the
many centuries which have elapsed since the pigeon was first
domesticated at the present day such sports are generally rejected
as blemishes and there is so much mystery in the breeding of pigeons
that if a valuable sport did occur its history would often be
concealed before the last hundred and fifty years there is hardly a
chance of the history of any such sport having been recorded but it by
no means follows from this that such sports in former times when the
pigeon had undergone much less variation would have been rejected we
are profoundly ignorant of the cause of each sudden and apparently
spontaneous variation as well as of the infinitely numerous shades of
difference between the birds of the same family but in a future
chapter we shall see that all such variations appear to be the indirect
result of changes of some kind in the conditions of life
hence after a long course of domestication we might expect to see in
the pigeon much individual variability and occasional sudden
variations as well as slight modifications from the lessened use of
certain parts together with the effects of correlation of growth but
without selection all this would produce only a trifling or no result
for without such aid differences of all kinds would from the two
following causes soon disappear in a healthy and vigorous lot of
pigeons many more young birds are killed for food or die than are
reared to maturity so that an individual having any peculiar
character if not selected would run a good chance of being destroyed
and if not destroyed the peculiarity in question would generally be
obliterated by free intercrossing it might however occasionally
happen that the same variation repeatedly occurred owing to the action
of peculiar and uniform conditions of life and in this case it would
prevail independently of selection but when selection is brought into
play all is changed for this is the foundationstone in the formation
of new races and with the pigeon circumstances as we have already
seen are eminently favourable for selection when a bird presenting
some conspicuous variation has been preserved and its offspring have
been selected carefully matched and again propagated and so onwards
during successive generations the principle is so obvious that nothing
more need be said about it this may be called methodical selection
for the breeder has a distinct object in view namely to preserve some
character which has actually appeared or to create some improvement
already pictured in his mind
another form of selection has hardly been noticed by those authors who
have discussed this subject but is even more important this form may
be called unconscious selection for the breeder selects his birds
unconsciously unintentionally and without method yet he surely
though slowly produces a great result i refer to the effects which
follow from each fancier at first procuring and afterwards rearing as
good birds as he can according to his skill and according to the
standard of excellence at each successive period he does not wish
permanently to modify the breed he does not look to the distant
future or speculate on the final result of the slow accumulation
during many generations of successive slight changes he is content if
he possesses a good stock and more than content if he can beat his
rivals the fancier in the time of aldrovandi when in the year 1600 he
admired his own jacobins pouters or carriers never reflected what
their descendants in the year 1860 would become he would have been
astonished could he have seen our jacobins our improved english
carriers and our pouters he would probably have denied that they were
the descendants of his own onceadmired stock and he would perhaps not
have valued them for no other reason as was written in 1765 than
because they were not like what used to be thought good when he was in
the fancy no one will attribute the lengthened beak of the carrier
the shortened beak of the shortfaced tumbler the lengthened leg of
the pouter the more perfectly enclosed hood of the jacobin
etcchanges effected since the time of aldrovandi or even since a
much later periodto the direct and immediate action of the conditions
of life for these several races have been modified in various and even
in directly opposite ways though kept under the same climate and
treated in all respects in as nearly uniform a manner as possible each
slight change in the length or shortness of the beak in the length of
leg etc has no doubt been indirectly and remotely caused by some
change in the conditions to which the bird has been subjected but we
must attribute the final result as is manifest in those cases of which
we have any historical record to the continued selection and
accumulation of many slight successive variations
    the action of unconscious selection as far as pigeons are
    concerned depends on a universal principle in human nature
    namely on our rivalry and desire to outdo our neighbours we see
    this in every fleeting fashion even in our dress and it leads the
    fancier to endeavour to exaggerate every peculiarity in his breeds
    a great authority on pigeons44 says fanciers do not and will
    not admire a medium standard that is half and half which is
    neither here nor there but admire extremes after remarking that
    the fancier of shortfaced beard tumblers wishes for a very short
    beak and that the fancier of longfaced beard tumblers wishes for
    a very long beak he says with respect to one of intermediate
    length dont deceive yourself do you suppose for a moment the
    short or the longfaced fancier would accept such a bird as a gift
    certainly not the shortfaced fancier could see no beauty in it
    the longfaced fancier would swear there was no use in it etc in
    these comical passages written seriously we see the principle
    which has ever guided fanciers and has led to such great
    modifications in all the domestic races which are valued solely for
    their beauty or curiosity
fashions in pigeonbreeding endure for long periods we cannot change
the structure of a bird as quickly as we can the fashion of our dress
in the time of aldrovandi no doubt the more the pouter inflated his
crop the more he was valued nevertheless fashions do to a certain
extent change first one point of structure and then another is
attended to or different breeds are admired at different times and in
different countries as the author just quoted remarks the fancy ebbs
and flows a thorough fancier nowadays never stoops to breed
toybirds yet these very toys are now most carefully bred in
germany breeds which at the present time are highly valued in india
are considered worthless in england no doubt when breeds are
neglected they degenerate still we may believe that as long as they
are kept under the same conditions of life characters once gained will
be partially retained for a long time and may form the startingpoint
for a future course of selection
let it not be objected to this view of the action of unconscious
selection that fanciers would not observe or care for extremely slight
differences those alone who have associated with fanciers can be
thoroughly aware of their accurate powers of discrimination acquired by
long practice and of the care and labour which they bestow on their
birds i have known a fancier deliberately study his birds day after
day to settle which to match together and which to reject observe how
difficult the subject appears to one of the most eminent and
experienced fanciers mr eaton the winner of many prizes says i
would here particularly guard you against keeping too great a variety
of pigeons otherwise you will know a little about all the kinds but
nothing about one as it ought to be known it is possible there may
be a few fanciers that have a good general knowledge of the several
fancy pigeons but there are many who labour under the delusion of
supposing they know what they do not speaking exclusively of one sub
variety of one race namely the shortfaced almond tumbler and after
saying that some fanciers sacrifice every property to obtain a good
head and beak and that other fanciers sacrifice everything for
plumage he remarks some young fanciers who are over covetous go in
for all the five properties at once and they have their reward by
getting nothing in india as i hear from mr blyth pigeons are
likewise selected and matched with the greatest care we must not judge
of the slight divergences from existing varieties which would have been
valued in ancient days by those which are now valued after the
formation of so many races each with its own standard of perfection
kept uniform by our numerous exhibitions the ambition of the most
energetic fancier may be fully satisfied by the difficulty of excelling
other fanciers in the breeds already established without trying to
form a new one
    a difficulty with respect to the power of selection will perhaps
    already have occurred to the reader namely what could have led
    fanciers first to attempt to make such singular breeds as pouters
    fantails carriers etc but it is this very difficulty which the
    principle of unconscious selection removes undoubtedly no fancier
    ever did intentionally make such an attempt all that we need
    suppose is that a variation occurred sufficiently marked to catch
    the discriminating eye of some ancient fancier and then
    unconscious selection carried on for many generations that is the
    wish of succeeding fanciers to excel their rivals would do the
    rest in the case of the fantail we may suppose that the first
    progenitor of the breed had a tail only slightly erected as may
    now be seen in certain runts45 with some increase in the number
    of the tailfeathers as now occasionally occurs with nuns in the
    case of the pouter we may suppose that some bird inflated its crop
    a little more than other pigeons as is now the case in a slight
    degree with the esophagus of the turbit we do not know the origin
    of the common tumbler but we may suppose that a bird was born with
    some affection of the brain leading it to make somersaults in the
    air46 and before the year 1600 pigeons remarkable for their
    diversified manner of flight were much valued in india and by the
    order of the emperor akber khan were sedulously trained and
    carefully matched
in the foregoing cases we have supposed that a sudden variation
conspicuous enough to catch a fanciers eye first appeared but even
this degree of abruptness in the process of variation is not necessary
for the formation of a new breed when the same kind of pigeon has been
kept pure and has been bred during a long period by two or more
fanciers slight differences in the strain can often be recognised
thus i have seen first rate jacobins in one mans possession which
certainly differed slightly in several characters from those kept by
another i possessed some excellent barbs descended from a pair which
had won a prize and another lot descended from a stock formerly kept
by that famous fancier sir john sebright and these plainly differed in
the form of the beak but the differences were so slight that they
could hardly be given by words again the common english and dutch
tumbler differ in a somewhat greater degree both in length of beak and
shape of head what first caused these slight differences cannot be
explained any more than why one man has a long nose and another a short
one in the strains long kept distinct by different fanciers such
differences are so common that they cannot be accounted for by the
accident of the birds first chosen for breeding having been originally
as different as they now are the explanation no doubt lies in
selection of a slightly different nature having been applied in each
case for no two fanciers have exactly the same taste and consequently
no two in choosing and carefully matching their birds prefer or
select exactly the same as each man naturally admires his own birds
he goes on continually exaggerating by selection whatever slight
peculiarities they may possess this will more especially happen with
fanciers living in different countries who do not compare their stocks
or aim at a common standard of perfection thus when a mere strain has
once been formed unconscious selection steadily tends to augment the
amount of difference and thus converts the strain into a subbreed and
this ultimately into a wellmarked breed or race
the principle of correlation of growth should never be lost sight of
most pigeons have small feet apparently caused by their lessened use
and from correlation as it would appear their beaks have likewise
become reduced in length the beak is a conspicuous organ and as soon
as it had thus become perceptibly shortened fanciers would almost
certainly strive to reduce it still more by the continued selection of
birds with the shortest beaks whilst at the same time other fanciers
as we know has actually been the case would in other subbreeds
strive to increase its length with the increased length of the beak
the tongue becomes greatly lengthened as do the eyelids with the
increased development of the eyewattles with the reduced or increased
size of the feet the number of the scutell vary with the length of
the wing the number of the primary wingfeathers differ and with the
increased length of the body in the pouter the number of the sacral
vertebr is augmented these important and correlated differences of
structure do not invariably characterise any breed but if they had
been attended to and selected with as much care as the more conspicuous
external differences there can hardly be a doubt that they would have
been rendered constant fanciers could assuredly have made a race of
tumblers with nine instead of ten primary wingfeathers seeing how
often the number nine appears without any wish on their part and
indeed in the case of the whitewinged varieties in opposition to their
wish in a similar manner if the vertebr had been visible and had
been attended to by fanciers assuredly an additional number might
easily have been fixed in the pouter if these latter characters had
once been rendered constant we should never have suspected that they
had at first been highly variable or that they had arisen from
correlation in the one case with the shortness of the wings and in
the other case with the length of the body
in order to understand how the chief domestic races have become
distinctly separated from each other it is important to bear in mind
that fanciers constantly try to breed from the best birds and
consequently that those which are inferior in the requisite qualities
are in each generation neglected so that after a time the less
improved parentstocks and many subsequently formed intermediate grades
become extinct this has occurred in the case of the pouter turbit
and trumpeter for these highly improved breeds are now left without
any links closely connecting them either with each other or with the
aboriginal rockpigeon in other countries indeed where the same care
has not been applied or where the same fashion has not prevailed the
earlier forms may long remain unaltered or altered only in a slight
degree and we are thus sometimes enabled to recover the connecting
links this is the case in persia and india with the tumbler and
carrier which there differ but slightly from the rockpigeon in the
proportions of their beaks so again in java the fantail sometimes has
only fourteen caudal feathers and the tail is much less elevated and
expanded than in our improved birds so that the java bird forms a link
between a firstrate fantail and the rockpigeon
occasionally a breed may be retained for some particular quality in a
nearly unaltered condition in the same country together with highly
modified offshoots or subbreeds which are valued for some distinct
property we see this exemplified in england where the common tumbler
which is valued only for its flight does not differ much from its
parentform the eastern tumbler whereas the shortfaced tumbler has
been prodigiously modified from being valued not for its flight but
for other qualities but the commonflying tumbler of europe has
already begun to branch out into slightly different subbreeds such as
the common english tumbler the dutch roller the glasgow
housetumbler and the longfaced beard tumbler etc and in the
course of centuries unless fashions greatly change these subbreeds
will diverge through the slow and insensible process of unconscious
selection and become modified in a greater and greater degree after
a time the perfectly graduated links which now connect all these
subbreeds together will be lost for there would be no object and
much difficulty in retaining such a host of intermediate subvarieties
the principle of divergence together with the extinction of the many
previously existing intermediate forms is so important for
understanding the origin of domestic races as well as of species in a
state of nature that i will enlarge a little more on this subject our
third main group includes carriers barbs and runts which are plainly
related to one another yet wonderfully distinct in several important
characters according to the view given in the last chapter these
three races have probably descended from an unknown race having an
intermediate character and this race from the rockpigeon their
characteristic differences are believed to be due to different breeders
having at an early period admired different points of structure and
then on the acknowledged principle of admiring extremes having gone
on breeding without any thought of the future as good birds as they
couldcarrierfanciers preferring long beaks with much
wattlebarbfanciers preferring short thick beaks with much
eyewattleand runtfanciers not caring about the beak or wattle but
only for the size and weight of the body this process would have led
to the neglect and final extinction of the earlier inferior and
intermediate birds and thus it has come to pass that in europe these
three races are now so extraordinarily distinct from each other but in
the east whence they were originally brought the fashion has been
different and we there see breeds which connect the highly modified
english carrier with the rockpigeon and others which to a certain
extent connect carriers and runts looking back to the time of
aldrovandi we find that there existed in europe before the year 1600
four breeds which were closely allied to carriers and barbs but which
competent authorities cannot now identify with our present barbs and
carriers nor can aldrovandis runts be identified with our present
runts these four breeds certainly did not differ from each other
nearly so much as do our existing english carriers barbs and runts
all this is exactly what might have been anticipated if we could
collect all the pigeons which have ever lived from before the time of
the romans to the present day we should be able to group them in
several lines diverging from the parent rockpigeon each line would
consist of almost insensible steps occasionally broken by some
slightly greater variation or sport and each would culminate in one of
our present highly modified forms of the many former connecting links
some would be found to have become absolutely extinct without having
left any issue whilst others though extinct would be recognised as
the progenitors of the existing races
i have heard it remarked as a strange circumstance that we occasionally
hear of the local or complete extinction of domestic races whilst we
hear nothing of their origin how it has been asked can these losses
be compensated and more than compensated for we know that with almost
all domesticated animals the races have largely increased in number
since the time of the romans but on the view here given we can
understand this apparent contradiction the extinction of a race within
historical times is an event likely to be noticed but its gradual and
scarcely sensible modification through unconscious selection and its
subsequent divergence either in the same or more commonly in distant
countries into two or more strains and their gradual conversion into
subbreeds and these into well marked breeds are events which would
rarely be noticed the death of a tree that has attained gigantic
dimensions is recorded the slow growth of smaller trees and their
increase in number excite no attention
in accordance with the belief in the great power of selection and of
the little direct power of changed conditions of life except in
causing general variability or plasticity of organisation it is not
surprising that dovecotpigeons have remained unaltered from time
immemorial and that some toypigeons which differ in little else
besides colour from the dovecotpigeon have retained the same
character for several centuries for when one of these toypigeons had
once become beautifully and symmetrically colouredwhen for instance
a spot had been produced with the crown of its head its tail and
tailcoverts of a uniform colour the rest of the body being
snowwhiteno alteration or improvement would be desired on the other
hand it is not surprising that during this same interval of time our
highlybred pigeons have undergone an astonishing amount of change for
in regard to them there is no defined limit to the wish of the fancier
and there is no known limit to the variability of their characters
what is there to stop the fancier desiring to give to his carrier a
longer and longer beak or to his tumbler a shorter and shorter beak
nor has the extreme limit of variability in the beak if there be any
such limit as yet been reached notwithstanding the great improvement
effected within recent times in the shortfaced almond tumbler mr
eaton remarks the field is still as open for fresh competitors as it
was one hundred years ago but this is perhaps an exaggerated
assertion for the young of all highlyimproved fancy birds are
extremely liable to disease and death
i have heard it objected that the formation of the several domestic
races of the pigeon throws no light on the origin of the wild species
of the columbid because their differences are not of the same nature
the domestic races for instance do not differ or differ hardly at
all in the relative lengths and shape of the primary wingfeathers in
the relative length of the hind toe or in habits of life as in
roosting and building in trees but the above objection shows how
completely the principle of selection has been misunderstood it is not
likely that characters selected by the caprice of man should resemble
differences preserved under natural conditions either from being of
direct service to each species or from standing in correlation with
other modified and serviceable structures until man selects birds
differing in the relative length of the wingfeathers or toes etc no
sensible change in these parts should be expected nor could man do
anything unless these parts happened to vary under domestication i do
not positively assert that this is the case although i have seen
traces of such variability in the wingfeathers and certainly in the
tailfeathers it would be a strange fact if the relative length of the
hind toe should never vary seeing how variable the foot is both in
size and in the number of the scutell with respect to the domestic
races not roosting or building in trees it is obvious that fanciers
would never attend to or select such changes in habits but we have
seen that the pigeons in egypt which do not for some reason like
settling on the low mud hovels of the natives are led apparently by
compulsion to perch in crowds on the trees we may even affirm that
if our domestic races had become greatly modified in any of the above
specified respects and it could be shown that fanciers had never
attended to such points or that they did not stand in correlation with
other selected characters the fact on the principles advocated in
this chapter would have offered a serious difficulty
let us briefly sum up the last two chapters on the pigeon we may
conclude with confidence that all the domestic races notwithstanding
their great amount of difference are descended from the columba
livia including under this name certain wild races but the
differences between the latter throw no light whatever on the
characters which distinguish the domestic races in each breed or
subbreed the individual birds are more variable than birds in a state
of nature and occasionally they vary in a sudden and stronglymarked
manner this plasticity of organisation apparently results from changed
conditions of life disuse has reduced certain parts of the body
correlation of growth so ties the organisation together that when one
part varies other parts vary at the same time when several breeds have
once been formed their intercrossing aids the progress of
modification and has even produced new subbreeds but as in the
construction of a building mere stones or bricks are of little avail
without the builders art so in the production of new races
selection has been the presiding power fanciers can act by selection
on excessively slight individual differences as well as on those
greater differences which are called sports selection is followed
methodically when the fancier tries to improve and modify a breed
according to a prefixed standard of excellence or he acts
unmethodically and unconsciously by merely trying to rear as good
birds as he can without any wish or intention to alter the breed the
progress of selection almost inevitably leads to the neglect and
ultimate extinction of the earlier and less improved forms as well as
of many intermediate links in each long line of descent thus it has
come to pass that most of our present races are so marvellously
distinct from each other and from the aboriginal rockpigeon

 19 i have drawn out a long table of the various crosses made by
 fanciers between the several domestic breeds but i do not think it
 worth while publishing i have myself made for this special purpose
 many crosses and all were perfectly fertile i have united in one
 bird five of the most distinct races and with patience i might
 undoubtedly have thus united all the case of five distinct breeds
 being blended together with unimpaired fertility is important because
 grtner has shown that it is a very general though not as he
 thought universal rule that complex crosses between several species
 are excessively sterile i have met with only two or three cases of
 reported sterility in the offspring of certain races when crossed
 pistor das ganze der feldtaubenzucht 1831 s 15 asserts that the
 mongrels from barbs and fantails are sterile i have proved this to be
 erroneous not only by crossing those hybrids with several other
 hybrids of the same parentage but by the more severe test of pairing
 brother and sister hybrids inter se and they were perfectly
 fertile temminck has stated hist nat gn des pigeons tom i

 breeds but my turbits crossed when left free with almond tumblers
 and with trumpeters the same thing has occurred rev e s dixon

 however made some vague statements s 22 on the sterility of
 turbits when crossed with certain other crossed breeds but i have
 little doubt that the rev e s dixons explanation of such
 statements is correct viz that individual birds both with turbits
 and other breeds are occasionally sterile

 has made the same cross several times in england but the young were
 very apt to die at about ten days old one hybrid which he reared
 from c nas and a male antwerp carrier paired with a dragon but

 pigeon will cross with c palumbus turtur risoria and t

 this would have been mentioned had the fact been ascertained in the
 zoological gardens ms report to me from mr james hunt a male
 hybrid from turtur vulgaris and a domestic pigeon paired with
 several different species of pigeons and doves but none of the eggs
 were good hybrids from c nas and gymnophthalmos were sterile
 in loudons mag of nat hist vol vii 1834 p 154 it is said
 that a male hybrid from turtur vulgaris male and the
 creamcoloured t risoria female paired during two years with a
 female t risoria and the latter laid many eggs but all were
 sterile mm boitard and corbi les pigeons p 235 state that the
 hybrids from these two turtledoves are invariably sterile both inter
 se and with either pure parent the experiment was tried by m corbi
 avec une espce dobstination and likewise by m mauduyt and by m
 vieillot temminck also found the hybrids from these two species quite
 barren therefore when bechstein naturgesch deutschlands vgel
 b iv s 101 asserts that the hybrids from these two turtledoves
 propagate inter se equally well with pure species and when a writer
 in the field newspaper in a letter dated nov 10th 1858 makes a
 similar assertion it would appear that there must be some mistake
 though what the mistake is i know not as bechstein at least must have
 known the white variety of t risoria it would be an unparalleled
 fact if the same two species sometimes produced extremely fertile
 and sometimes extremely barren offspring in the ms report from
 the zoological gardens it is said that hybrids from turtur vulgaris
 and  suratensis and from t vulgaris and ectopistes
 migratorius were sterile two of the latter male hybrids paired with
 their pure parents viz turtur vulgaris and the ectopistes and
 likewise with t risoria and with  columba nas and many eggs
 were produced but all were barren at paris hybrids have been raised

 eggs but these proved barren in 1860 columba gymnophthalmos and
 maculosa produced hybrids in these same gardens
 23 there is one exception to the rule namely in a subvariety of
 the swallow of german origin which is figured by neumeister and was
 shown to me by mr wicking this bird is blue but has not the black
 wingbars for our object however in tracing the descent of the
 chief races this exception signifies the less as the swallow
 approaches closely in structure to c livia in many subvarieties
 the black bars are replaced by bars of various colours the figures
 given by neumeister are sufficient to show that if the wings alone
 are blue the black wingbars appear
 24 i have observed blue birds with all the abovementioned marks in
 the following races which seemed to be perfectly pure and were shown
 at various exhibitions pouters with the double black wingbars with
 white croup dark bar to end of tail and white edging to outer
 tailfeathers turbits with all these same characters fantails with
 the same but the croup in some was bluish or pure blue mr wicking
 bred blue fantails from two black birds carriers including the
 bagadotten of neumeister with all the marks two birds which i
 examined had white and two had blue croups the white edging to the
 outer tailfeathers was not present in all mr corker a great
 breeder assures me that if black carriers are matched for many
 successive generations the offspring become first ashcoloured and
 then blue with black wingbars runts of the elongated breed had the
 same marks but the croup was pale blue the outer tailfeathers had
 white edges neumeister figures the great florence runt of a blue
 colour with black bars jacobins are very rarely blue but i have
 received authentic accounts of at least two instances of the blue
 variety with black bars having appeared in england blue jacobins were
 bred by mr brent from two black birds i have seen common tumblers
 both indian and english and shortfaced tumblers of a blue colour
 with black wingbars with the black bar at the end of the tail and
 with the outer tailfeathers edged with white the croup in all was
 blue or extremely pale blue never absolutely white blue barbs and
 trumpeters seem to be excessively rare but neumeister who may be
 implicitly trusted figures blue varieties of both with black
 wingbars mr brent informs me that he has seen a blue barb and mr
 h weir as i am informed by mr tegetmeier once bred a silver which
 means very pale blue barb from two yellow birds
 25 mr blyth informs me that all the domestic races in india have
 the croup blue but this is not invariable for i possess a very pale
 blue simmali pigeon with the croup perfectly white sent to me by sir
 w elliot from madras a slatyblue and chequered nakshi pigeon has
 some white feathers on the croup alone in some other indian pigeons
 there were a few white feathers confined to the croup and i have
 noticed the same fact in a carrier from persia the java fantail
 imported into amoy and thence sent me has a perfectly white croup

 29 i could give numerous examples two will suffice a mongrel
 whose four grandparents were a white turbit white trumpeter white
 fantail and blue pouter was white all over except a very few
 feathers about the head and on the wings but the whole tail and
 tailcoverts were dark bluishgrey another mongrel whose four
 grandparents were a red runt white trumpeter white fantail and the
 same blue pouter was pure white all over except the tail and upper
 tailcoverts which were pale fawn and except the faintest trace of
 double wingbars of the same pale fawn tint
 30 it deserves notice as bearing on the general subject of
 variation that not only c livia presents several wild forms
 regarded by some naturalists as species and by others as subspecies
 or as mere varieties but that the species of several allied genera
 are in the same predicament this is the case as mr blyth has
 remarked to me with treron palumbus and turtur

    as some naturalists may not be familiar with the chief breeds of
    the fowl it will be advisable to give a condensed description of
    them1 from what i have read and seen of specimens brought from
    several quarters of the world i believe that most of the chief
    kinds have been imported into england but many subbreeds are
    probably still unknown here the following discussion on the origin
    of the various breeds and on their characteristic differences does
    not pretend to completeness but may be of some interest to the
    naturalist the classification of the breeds cannot as far as i
    can see be made natural they differ from each other in different
    degrees and do not afford characters in subordination to each
    other by which they can be ranked in group under group they seem
    all to have diverged by independent and different roads from a
    single type each chief breed includes differently coloured
    subvarieties most of which can be truly propagated but it would
    be superfluous to describe them i have classed the various crested
    fowls as subbreeds under the polish fowl but i have great doubts
    whether this is a natural arrangement showing true affinity or
    blood relationship it is scarcely possible to avoid laying stress
    on the commonness of a breed and if certain foreign subbreeds had
    been largely kept in this country they would perhaps have been
    raised to the rank of mainbreeds several breeds are abnormal in
    character that is they differ in certain points from all wild
    gallinaceous birds at first i made a division of the breeds into
    normal and abnormal but the result was wholly unsatisfactory
1 game breedthis may be considered as the typical breed as it
deviates only slightly from the wild gallus bankiva or as perhaps
more correctly named ferrugineus beak strong comb single and
upright spurs long and sharp feathers closely appressed to the body
tail with the normal number of 14 feathers eggs often pale buff
disposition indomitably courageous exhibited even in the hens and
chickens an unusual number of differently coloured varieties exist
such as black and brownbreasted reds duckwings blacks whites
piles etc with their legs of various colours
2 malay breedbody of great size with head neck and legs
elongated carriage erect tail small sloping downwards generally
formed of 16 feathers comb and wattle small earlobe and face red
skin yellowish feathers closely appressed to the body neckhackles
short narrow and hard eggs often pale buff chickens feather late
disposition savage of eastern origin
3 cochin or shangai breedsize great wing feathers short arched
much hidden in the soft downy plumage barely capable of flight tail
short generally formed of 16 feathers developed at a late period in
the young males legs thick feathered spurs short thick nail of
middle toe flat and broad an additional toe not rarely developed skin
yellowish comb and wattle well developed skull with deep medial
furrow occipital foramen subtriangular vertically elongated voice
peculiar eggs rough buffcoloured disposition extremely quiet of
chinese origin
4 dorking breedsize great body square compact feet with an
additional toe comb well developed but varies much in form wattles
well developed colour of plumage various skull remarkably broad
between the orbits of english origin
the white dorking may be considered as a distinct subbreed being a
less massive bird
illustration fig 30spanish fowl
5 spanish breed fig 30tall with stately carriage tarsi long
comb single deeply serrated of immense size wattles largely
developed the large earlobes and sides of face white plumage black
glossed with green do not incubate tender in constitution the comb
being often injured by frost eggs white smooth of large size
chickens feather late but the young cocks show their masculine
characters and crow at an early age of mediterranean origin
the andalusians may be ranked as a subbreed they are of a
slatyblue colour and their chickens are well feathered a smaller
shortlegged dutch subbreed has been described by some authors as
distinct
illustration fig 31hamburgh fowl
6 hamburgh breed fig 31size moderate comb flat produced
backwards covered with numerous small points wattle of moderate
dimensions ear lobe white legs blueish thin do not incubate skull
with the tips of the ascending branches of the premaxillary and with
the nasal bones standing a little separate from each other anterior
margin of the frontal bones less depressed than usual
there are two subbreeds the  spangled hamburgh of english origin
with the tips of the feathers marked with a dark spot and the
pencilled hamburgh of dutch origin with dark transverse lines
across each feather and with the body rather smaller both these
subbreeds include gold and silver varieties as well as some other
subvarieties black hamburghs have been produced by a cross with the
spanish breed

7 crested or polish breed fig 32head with a large rounded crest
of feathers supported on a hemispherical protuberance of the frontal
bones which includes the anterior part of the brain the ascending
branches of premaxillary bones and the inner nasal processes are much
shortened the orifice of the nostrils raised and crescentic beak
short comb absent or small and of crescentic shape wattles either
present or replaced by a beardlike tuft of feathers legs leadenblue
sexual differences appear late in life do not incubate there are
several beautiful varieties which differ in colour and slightly in
other respects
the following subbreeds agree in having a crest more or less
developed with the comb when present of crescentic shape the skull
presents nearly the same remarkable peculiarities of structure as in
the true polish fowl
    subbreed a sultansa turkish breed resembling white polish
    fowls with a large crest and beard with short and wellfeathered
    legs the tail is furnished with additional sickle feathers do not

ascending branches of the premaxillaries i have seen an allied white
tailless breed from turkey

subbreed g guelderlandsno comb head said to be surmounted by a
longitudinal crest of soft velvety feathers nostrils said to be
crescentic wattles well developed legs feathered colour black from
north america the breda fowl seems to be closely allied to the
guelderland
8 bantam breedoriginally from japan5 characterised by small size
alone carriage bold and erect there are several subbreeds such as
the cochin game and sebright bantams some of which have been
recently formed by various crosses the black bantam has a differently
shaped skull with the occipital foramen like that of the cochin fowl
    9 rumpless fowlsthese are so variable in character6 that they
    hardly deserve to be called a breed any one who will examine the
    caudal vertebr will see how monstrous the breed is
10 creepers or jumpersthese are characterised by an almost monstrous
shortness of legs so that they move by jumping rather than by walking
they are said not to scratch up the ground i have examined a burmese
variety which had a skull of rather unusual shape
11 frizzled or caffre fowlsnot uncommon in india with the feathers
curling backwards and with the primary feathers of the wing and tail
imperfect periosteum of bones black
12 silk fowlsfeathers silky with the primary wing and tailfeathers
imperfect skin and periosteum of bones black comb and wattles dark
leadenblue earlappets tinged with blue legs thin often furnished
with an additional toe size rather small
13 sooty fowlsan indian breed having the peculiar appearance of a
white bird smeared with soot with black skin and periosteum the hens
alone are thus characterised
    from this synopsis we see that the several breeds differ
    considerably and they would have been nearly as interesting for us
    as pigeons if there had been equally good evidence that all had
    descended from one parentspecies most fanciers believe that they
    are descended from several primitive stocks the rev e s
    dixon7 argues strongly on this side of the question and one
    fancier even denounces the opposite conclusion by asking do we
    not perceive pervading this spirit the spirit of the deist
    most naturalists with the exception of a few such as temminck
    believe that all the breeds have proceeded from a single species
    but authority on such a point goes for little fanciers look to all
    parts of the world as the possible sources of their unknown stocks
    thus ignoring the laws of geographical distribution they know well
    that the several kinds breed truly even in colour they assert
    but as we shall see on very weak grounds that most of the breeds
    are extremely ancient they are strongly impressed with the great
    difference between the chief kinds and they ask with force can
    differences in climate food or treatment have produced birds so
    different as the black stately spanish the diminutive elegant
    bantam the heavy cochin with its many peculiarities and the
    polish fowl with its great topknot and protuberant skull but
    fanciers whilst admitting and even overrating the effects of
    crossing the various breeds do not sufficiently regard the
    probability of the occasional birth during the course of
    centuries of birds with abnormal and hereditary peculiarities
    they overlook the effects of correlation of growthof the
    longcontinued use and disuse of parts and of some direct result
    from changed food and climate though on this latter head i have
    found no sufficient evidence and lastly they all as far as i
    know entirely overlook the allimportant subject of unconscious or
    unmethodical selection though they are well aware that their birds
    differ individually and that by selecting the best birds for a few
    generations they can improve their stocks
    an amateur writes8 as follows the fact that poultry have until
    lately received but little attention at the hands of the fancier
    and been entirely confined to the domains of the producer for the
    market would alone suggest the improbability of that constant and
    unremitting attention having been observed in breeding which is
    requisite to the consummating in the offspring of any two birds
    transmittable forms not exhibited by the parents this at first
    sight appears true but in a future chapter on selection abundant
    facts will be given showing not only that careful breeding but
    that actual selection was practised during ancient periods and by
    barely civilised races of man in the case of the fowl i can adduce
    no direct facts showing that selection was anciently practised but
    the romans at the commencement of the christian era kept six or
    seven breeds and columella particularly recommends as the best
    those sorts that have five toes and white ears9 in the
    fifteenth century several breeds were known and described in
    europe and in china at nearly the same period seven kinds were
    named a more striking case is that at present in one of the
    philippine islands the semibarbarous inhabitants have distinct
    native names for no less than nine subbreeds of the game fowl10
    azara11 who wrote towards the close of the last century states
    that in the interior parts of south america where i should not
    have expected that the least care would have been taken of poultry
    a blackskinned and blackboned breed is kept from being
    considered fertile and its flesh good for sick persons now every
    one who has kept poultry knows how impossible it is to keep several
    breeds distinct unless the utmost care be taken in separating the
    sexes will it then be pretended that those persons who in ancient
    times and in semicivilised countries took pains to keep the breeds
    distinct and who therefore valued them would not occasionally
    have destroyed inferior birds and occasionally have preserved their
    best birds this is all that is required it is not pretended that
    any one in ancient times intended to form a new breed or to modify
    an old breed according to some ideal standard of excellence he who
    cared for poultry would merely wish to obtain and afterwards to
    rear the best birds which he could but this occasional
    preservation of the best birds would in the course of time modify
    the breed as surely though by no means as rapidly as does
    methodical selection at the present day if one person out of a
    hundred or out of a thousand attended to the breeding of his birds
    this would be sufficient for the birds thus tended would soon
    become superior to others and would form a new strain and this
    strain would as explained in the last chapter slowly have its
    characteristic differences augmented and at last be converted into
    a new subbreed or breed but breeds would often be for a time
    neglected and would deteriorate they would however partially
    retain their character and afterwards might again come into
    fashion and be raised to a standard of perfection higher than their
    former standard as has actually occurred quite recently with
    polish fowls if however a breed were utterly neglected it would
    become extinct as has recently happened with one of the polish
    subbreeds whenever in the course of past centuries a bird
    appeared with some slight abnormal structure such as with a
    larklike crest on its head it would probably often have been
    preserved from that love of novelty which leads some persons in
    england to keep rumpless fowls and others in india to keep
    frizzled fowls and after a time any such abnormal appearance would
    be carefully preserved from being esteemed a sign of the purity
    and excellence of the breed for on this principle the romans
    eighteen centuries ago valued the fifth toe and the white earlobe
    in their fowls
 thus from the occasional appearance of abnormal characters though at
 first only slight in degree from the effects of the use and the
 disuse of parts possibly from the direct effects of changed climate
 and food from correlation of growth from occasional reversions to
 old and longlost characters from the crossing of breeds when more
 than one had been formed but above all from unconscious selection
 carried on during many generations there is no insuperable
 difficulty to the best of my judgment in believing that all the
 breeds have descended from some one parentsource can any single
 species be named from which we may reasonably suppose that all are
 descended the gallus bankiva apparently fulfils every requirement i
 have already given as fair an account as i could of the arguments in
 favour of the multiple origin of the several breeds and now i will
 give those in favour of their common descent from g bankiva
    but it will be convenient first briefly to describe all the known
    species of gallus the g sonneratii does not range into the
    northern parts of india according to colonel sykes12 it
    presents at different heights of the ghauts two strongly marked
    varieties perhaps deserving to be called species it was at one
    time thought to be the primitive stock of all our domestic breeds
    and this shows that it closely approaches the common fowl in
    general structure but its hackles partially consist of highly
    peculiar horny lamin transversely banded with three colours and
    i have met no authentic account of any such character having been
    observed in any domestic breed13 this species also differs
    greatly from the common fowl in the comb being finely serrated
    and in the loins being destitute of true hackles its voice is
    utterly different it crosses readily in india with domestic hens
    and mr blyth14 raised nearly 100 hybrid chickens but they were
    tender and mostly died whilst young those which were reared were
    absolutely sterile when crossed inter se or with either parent at
    the zoological gardens however some hybrids of the same
    parentage were not quite so sterile mr dixon as he informed me
    made with mr yarrells aid particular inquiries on this subject
    and was assured that out of 50 eggs only five or six chickens were
    reared some however of these halfbred birds were crossed with
    one of their parents namely a bantam and produced a few
    extremely feeble chickens mr dixon also procured some of these
    same birds and crossed them in several ways but all were more or
    less infertile nearly similar experiments have recently been tried
    on a great scale in the zoological gardens with almost the same
    result15 out of 500 eggs raised from various first crosses and
    hybrids between g sonneratii bankiva and varius only 12
    chickens were reared and of these only three were the product of
    hybrids inter se from these facts and from the abovementioned
    stronglymarked differences in structure between the domestic fowl
    and g sonneratii we may reject this latter species as the
    parent of any domestic breed
    ceylon possesses a fowl peculiar to the island viz g
    stanleyii this species approaches so closely except in the
    colouring of the comb to the domestic fowl that messrs layard
    and kellaert16 would have considered it as they inform me as
    one of the parentstocks had it not been for its singularly
    different voice this bird like the last crosses readily with
    tame hens and even visits solitary farms and ravishes them two
    hybrids a male and female thus produced were found by mr
    mitford to be quite sterile both inherited the peculiar voice of
    g stanleyii this species then may in all probability be
    rejected as one of the primitive stocks of the domestic fowl
    java and the islands eastward as far as flores are inhabited by g
    varius or furcatus which differs in so many charactersgreen
    plumage unserrated comb and single median wattlethat no one
    supposes it to have been the parent of any one of our breeds yet
    as i am informed by mr crawfurd17 hybrids are commonly raised
    between the male g varius and the common hen and are kept for
    their great beauty but are invariably sterile this however was
    not the case with some bred in the zoological gardens these
    hybrids were at one time thought to be specifically distinct and
    were named g neus mr blyth and others believe that the g
    temminckii18 of which the history is not known is a similar
    hybrid sir j brooke sent me some skins of domestic fowls from
    borneo and across the tail of one of these as mr tegetmeier
    observed there were transverse blue bands like those which he had
    seen on the tailfeathers of hybrids from g varius reared in
    the zoological gardens this fact apparently indicates that some of
    the fowls of borneo have been slightly affected by crosses with g
    varius but the case may possibly be one of analogous variation i
    may just allude to the g giganteus so often referred to in
    works on poultry as a wild species but marsden19 the first
    describer speaks of it as a tame breed and the specimen in the
    british museum evidently has the aspect of a domestic variety
    the last species to be mentioned namely gallus bankiva has a
    much wider geographical range than the three previous species it
    inhabits northern india as far west as sinde and ascends the
    himalaya to a height of 4000 ft it inhabits burmah the malay
    peninsula the indochinese countries the philippine islands and
    the malayan archipelago as far eastward as timor this species
    varies considerably in the wild state mr blyth informs me that
    the specimens both male and female brought from near the
    himalaya are rather paler coloured than those from other parts of
    india whilst those from the malay peninsula and java are brighter
    coloured than the indian birds i have seen specimens from these
    countries and the difference of tint in the hackles was
    conspicuous the malayan hens were a shade redder on the breast and
    neck than the indian hens the malayan males generally had a red
    earlappet instead of a white one as in india but mr blyth has
    seen one indian specimen without the white earlappet the legs are
    leaden blue in the indian whereas they show some tendency to be
    yellowish in the malayan and javan specimens in the former mr
    blyth finds the tarsus remarkably variable in length according to
    temminck20 the timor specimens differ as a local race from that
    of java these several wild varieties have not as yet been ranked
    as distinct species if they should as is not unlikely be
    hereafter thus ranked the circumstance would be quite immaterial
    as far as the parentage and differences of our domestic breeds are
    concerned the wild g bankiva agrees most closely with the
    blackbreasted red gamebreed in colouring and in all other
    respects except in being smaller and in the tail being carried
    more horizontally but the manner in which the tail is carried is
    highly variable in many of our breeds for as mr brent informs
    me the tail slopes much in the malays is erect in the games and
    some other breeds and is more than erect in dorkings bantams
    etc there is one other difference namely that in g bankiva
    according to mr blyth the neckhackles when first moulted are
    replaced during two or three months not by other hackles as with
    our domestic poultry but by short blackish feathers21 mr
    brent however has remarked that these black feathers remain in
    the wild bird after the development of the lower hackles and
    appear in the domestic bird at the same time with them so that the
    only difference is that the lower hackles are replaced more slowly
    in the wild than in the tame bird but as confinement is known
    sometimes to affect the masculine plumage this slight difference
    cannot be considered of any importance it is a significant fact
    that the voice of both the male and female g bankiva closely
    resembles as mr blyth and others have noted the voice of both
    sexes of the common domestic fowl but the last note of the crow of
    the wild bird is rather less prolonged captain hutton well known
    for his researches into the natural history of india informs me
    that he has seen several crossed fowls from the wild species and
    the chinese bantam these crossed fowls bred freely with bantams
    but unfortunately were not crossed inter se captain hutton
    reared chickens from the eggs of the gallus bankiva and these
    though at first very wild afterwards became so tame that they
    would crowd round his feet he did not succeed in rearing them to
    maturity but as he remarks no wild gallinaceous bird thrives
    well at first on hard grain mr blyth also found much difficulty
    in keeping g bankiva in confinement in the philippine islands
    however the natives must succeed better as they keep wild cocks
    to fight with their domestic gamebirds22 sir walter elliot
    informs me that the hen of a native domestic breed of pegu is
    undistinguishable from the hen of the wild g bankiva and the
    natives constantly catch wild cocks by taking tame cocks to fight
    with them in the woods23 mr crawfurd remarks that from
    etymology it might be argued that the fowl was first domesticated
    by the malays and javanese24 it is also a curious fact of which
    i have been assured by mr blyth that wild specimens of the 
    gallus bankiva brought from the countries east of the bay of
    bengal are far more easily tamed than those of india nor is this
    an unparalleled fact for as humboldt long ago remarked the same
    species sometimes evinces a more tameable disposition in one
    country than in another if we suppose that the g bankiva was
    first tamed in malaya and afterwards imported into india we can
    understand an observation made to me by mr blyth that the
    domestic fowls of india do not resemble the wild g bankiva of
    india more closely than do those of europe
    from the extremely close resemblance in colour general structure
    and especially in voice between gallus bankiva and the game
    fowl from their fertility as far as this has been ascertained
    when crossed from the possibility of the wild species being tamed
    and from its varying in the wild state we may confidently look at
    it as the parent of the most typical of all the domestic breeds
    namely the game fowl it is a significant fact that almost all
    the naturalists in india namely sir w elliot mr s n ward mr
    layard mr j c jerdon and mr blyth25 who are familiar with
    g bankiva believe that it is the parent of most or all our
    domestic breeds but even if it be admitted that g bankiva is the
    parent of the game breed yet it may be urged that other wild
    species have been the parents of the other domestic breeds and
    that these species still exist though unknown in some country or
    have become extinct the extinction however of several species of
    fowls is an improbable hypothesis seeing that the four known
    species have not become extinct in the most ancient and thickly
    peopled regions of the east there is in fact not one other kind
    of domesticated bird of which the wild parentform is unknown
    that is become extinct for the discovery of new or the
    rediscovery of old species of gallus we must not look as fanciers
    often look to the whole world the larger gallinaceous birds as
    mr blyth has remarked26 generally have a restricted range we
    see this well illustrated in india where the genus gallus inhabits
    the base of the himalaya and is succeeded higher up by
    gallophasis and still higher up by phasianus australia with its
    islands is out of the question as the home for unknown species of
    the genus it is also as improbable that gallus should inhabit
    south america27 as that a hummingbird should be found in the old
    world from the character of the other gallinaceous birds of
    africa it is not probable that gallus is an african genus we need
    not look to the western parts of asia for messrs blyth and
    crawfurd who have attended to this subject doubt whether gallus
    ever existed in a wild state even as far west as persia although
    the earliest greek writers speak of the fowl as a persian bird
    this probably merely indicates its line of importation for the
    discovery of unknown species we must look to india to the
    indochinese countries and to the northern parts of the malay
    archipelago the southern portion of china is the most likely
    country but as mr blyth informs me skins have been exported from
    china during a long period and living birds are largely kept there
    in aviaries so that any native species of gallus would probably
    have become known mr birch of the british museum has translated
    for me passages from a chinese encyclopdia published in 1609 but
    compiled from more ancient documents in which it is said that
    fowls are creatures of the west and were introduced into the east
    ie china in a dynasty 1400 bc whatever may be thought of so
    ancient a date we see that the indochinese and indian regions
    were formerly considered by the chinese as the source of the
    domestic fowl from these several considerations we must look to
    the present metropolis of the genus namely to the southeastern
    parts of asia for the discovery of species which were formerly
    domesticated but are now unknown in the wild state and the most
    experienced ornithologists do not consider it probable that such
    species will be discovered
 in considering whether the domestic breeds are descended from one
 species namely g bankiva or from several we must not quite
 overlook though we must not exaggerate the importance of the test of
 fertility most of our domestic breeds have been so often crossed and
 their mongrels so largely kept that it is almost certain if any
 degree of infertility had existed between them it would have been
 detected on the other hand the four known species of gallus when
 crossed with each other or when crossed with the exception of g
 bankiva with the domestic fowl produce infertile hybrids
 finally we have not such good evidence with fowls as with pigeons of
 all the breeds having descended from a single primitive stock in both
 cases the argument of fertility must go for something in both we have
 the improbability of man having succeeded in ancient times in
 thoroughly domesticating several supposed speciesmost of these
 supposed species being extremely abnormal as compared with their
 natural alliesall being now either unknown or extinct though the
 parentform of no other domesticated bird has been lost but in
 searching for the supposed parentstocks of the various breeds of the
 pigeon we were enabled to confine our search to species having
 peculiar habits of life whilst with fowls there is nothing in their
 habits in any marked manner distinct from those of other gallinaceous
 birds in the case of pigeons i have shown that purelybred birds of
 every race and the crossed offspring of distinct races frequently
 resemble or revert to the wild rockpigeon in general colour and in
 each characteristic mark with fowls we have facts of a similar
 nature but less strongly pronounced which we will now discuss
reversion and analogous variationpurelybred game malay cochin
dorking bantam and as i hear from mr tegetmeier silk fowls may
frequently or occasionally be met with which are almost identical in
plumage with the wild g bankiva this is a fact well deserving
attention when we reflect that these breeds rank amongst the most
distinct fowls thus coloured are called by amateurs blackbreasted
reds hamburghs properly have a very different plumage nevertheless
as mr tegetmeier informs me the great difficulty in breeding cocks
of the goldenspangled variety is their tendency to have black breasts
and red backs the males of white bantams and white cochins as they
come to maturity often assume a yellowish or saffron tinge and the
longer neck hackles of black bantam cocks28 when two or three years
old not uncommonly become ruddy these latter bantams occasionally
even moult brassywinged or actually redshouldered so that in
these several cases we see a plain tendency to reversion to the hues of
g bankiva even during the lifetime of the individual bird with
spanish polish pencilled hamburgh silverspangled hamburgh fowls
and with some other less common breeds i have never heard of a
blackbreasted red bird having appeared
from my experience with pigeons i made the following crosses i first
killed all my own poultry no others living near my house and then
procured by mr tegetmeiers assistance a firstrate black spanish
cock and hens of the following pure breedswhite game white cochin
silverspangled polish silverspangled hamburgh silverpencilled
hamburgh and white silk in none of these breeds is there a trace of
red nor when kept pure have i ever heard of the appearance of a red
feather though such an occurrence would perhaps not be very improbable
with white games and white cochins of the many chickens reared from
the above six crosses the majority were black both in the down and in
the first plumage some were white and a very few were mottled black
and white in one lot of eleven mixed eggs from the white game and
white cochin by the black spanish cock seven of the chickens were
white and only four black i mention this fact to show that whiteness
of plumage is strongly inherited and that the belief in the prepotent
power in the male to transmit his colour is not always correct the
chickens were hatched in the spring and in the latter part of august
several of the young cocks began to exhibit a change which with some
of them increased during the following years thus a young male bird
from the silverspangled polish hen was in its first plumage
coalblack and combined in its comb crest wattle and beard the
characters of both parents but when two years old the secondary
wingfeathers became largely and symmetrically marked with white and
wherever in g bankiva the hackles are red they were in this bird
greenishblack along the shaft narrowly bordered with brownishblack
and this again broadly bordered with very pale yellowishbrown so that
in general appearance the plumage had become palecoloured instead of
black in this case with advancing age there was a great change but
no reversion to the red colour of g bankiva
a cock with a regular rose comb derived either from the spangled or
pencilled silver hamburgh was likewise at first quite black but in
less than a year the neckhackles as in the last case became whitish
whilst those on the loins assumed a decided reddishyellow tint and
here we see the first symptom of reversion this likewise occurred with
some other young cocks which need not here be described it has also
been recorded29 by a breeder that he crossed two silverpencilled
hamburgh hens with a spanish cock and reared a number of chickens all
of which were black the cocks having  golden and the hens brownish
hackles so that in this instance likewise there was a clear tendency
to reversion
two young cocks from my white game hen were at first snow white of
these one subsequently assumed male orangecoloured hackles chiefly
on the loins and the other an abundance of fine orangered hackles on
the neck loins and upper wingcoverts here again we have a more
decided though partial reversion to the colours of g bankiva this
second cock was in fact coloured like an inferior pile came cocknow
this subbreed can be produced as i am informed by mr tegetmeier by
crossing a blackbreasted red game cock with a white game hen and the
pile subbreed thus produced can afterwards be truly propagated so
that we have the curious fact of the glossyblack spanish cock and the
blackbreasted red game cock when crossed with white game hens
producing offspring of nearly the same colours
i reared several birds from the white silk hen by the spanish cock all
were coalblack and all plainly showed their parentage in having
blackish combs and bones none inherited the socalled silky feathers
and the noninheritance of this character has been observed by others
the hens never varied in their plumage as the young cocks grew old
one of them assumed yellowishwhite hackles and thus resembled in a
considerable degree the cross from the hamburgh hen the other became a
gorgeous bird so much so that an acquaintance had it preserved and
stuffed simply from its beauty when stalking about it closely
resembled the wild gallus bankiva but with the red feathers rather
darker on close comparison one considerable difference presented
itself namely that the primary and secondary wingfeathers were edged
with greenishblack instead of being edged as in g bankiva with
fulvous and red tints the space also across the back which bears
darkgreen feathers was broader and the comb was blackish in all
other respects even in trifling details of plumage there was the
closest accordance altogether it was a marvellous sight to compare
this bird first with g bankiva and then with its father the glossy
greenblack spanish cock and with its diminutive mother the white
silk hen this case of reversion is the more extraordinary as the
spanish breed has long been known to breed true and no instance is on
record of its throwing a single red feather the silk hen likewise
breeds true and is believed to be ancient for aldrovandi before
1600 alludes probably to this breed and described it as covered with
wool it is so peculiar in many characters that some writers have
considered it as specifically distinct yet as we now see when
crossed with the spanish fowl it yields offspring closely resembling
the wild g bankiva
mr tegetmeier has been so kind as to repeat at my request the cross
between a spanish cock and silk hen and he obtained similar results
for he thus raised besides a black hen seven cocks all of which were
darkbodied with more or less orangered hackles in the ensuing year
he paired the black hen with one of her brothers and raised three
young cocks all coloured like their father and a black hen mottled
with white
the hens from the six abovedescribed crosses showed hardly any
tendency to revert to the mottledbrown plumage of the female g
bankiva one hen however from the white cochin which was at first
coalblack became slightly brown or sooty several hens which were
for a long time snowwhite acquired as they grew old a few black
feathers a hen from the white game which was for a long time entirely
black glossed with green when two years old had some of the primary
wing feathers greyishwhite and a multitude of feathers over her body
narrowly and symmetrically tipped or laced with white i had expected
that some of the chickens whilst covered with down would have assumed
the longitudinal stripes so general with gallinaceous birds but this
did not occur in a single instance two or three alone were
reddishbrown about their heads i was unfortunate in losing nearly all
the white chickens from the first crosses so that black prevailed with
the grandchildren but they were much diversified in colour some being
sooty others mottled and one blackish chicken had its feathers oddly
tipped and barred with brown
i will here add a few miscellaneous facts connected with reversion and
with the law of analogous variation this law implies as stated in a
previous chapter that the varieties of one species frequently mock
distinct but allied species and this fact is explained according to
the views which i maintain on the principle of allied species having
descended from one primitive form the white silk fowl with black skin
and bones degenerates as has been observed by mr hewitt and mr r
orton in our climate that is it reverts to the ordinary colour of
the common fowl in its skin and bones due care having been taken to
prevent any cross in germany30 a distinct breed with black bones
and with black not silky plumage has likewise been observed to
degenerate
mr tegetmeier informs me that when distinct breeds are crossed fowls
are frequently produced with their feathers marked or pencilled by
narrow transverse lines of a darker colour this may be in part
explained by direct reversion to the parentform the bankiva hen for
this bird has all its upper plumage finely mottled with dark and rufous
brown with the mottling partially and obscurely arranged in transverse
lines but the tendency to pencilling is probably much strengthened by
the law of analogous variation for the hens of some other species of
gallus are more plainly pencilled and the hens of many gallinaceous
birds belonging to other genera as the partridge have pencilled
feathers mr tegetmeier has also remarked to me that although with
domestic pigeons we have so great a diversity of colouring we never
see either pencilled or spangled feathers and this fact is
intelligible on the law of analogous variation as neither the wild
rock pigeon nor any closely allied species has such feathers the
frequent appearance of pencilling in crossed birds probably accounts
for the existence of cuckoo subbreeds in the game polish dorking
cochin andalusian and bantam breeds the plumage of these birds is
slatyblue or grey with each feather transversely barred with darker
lines so as to resemble in some degree the plumage of the cuckoo it
is a singular fact considering that the male of no species of gallus
is in the least barred that the cuckoolike plumage has often been
transferred to the male more especially in the cuckoo dorking and the
fact is all the more singular as in gold and silverpencilled
hamburghs in which pencilling is characteristic of the breed the male
is hardly at all pencilled this kind of plumage being confined to the
female
another case of analogous variation is the occurrence of spangled
subbreeds of hamburgh polish malay and bantam fowls spangled
feathers have a dark mark properly crescentshaped on their tips
whilst pencilled feathers have several transverse bars the spangling
cannot be due to reversion to g bankiva nor does it often follow
as i hear from mr tegetmeier from crossing distinct breeds but it is
a case of analogous variation for many gallinaceous birds have
spangled feathersfor instance the common pheasant hence spangled
breeds are often called pheasantfowls another case of analogous
variation in several domestic breeds is inexplicable it is that the
chickens whilst covered with down of the black spanish black game
black polish and black bantam all have white throats and breasts and
often have some white on their wings31 the editor of the poultry
chronicle32 remarks that all the breeds which properly have red
earlappets occasionally produce birds with white eartappets this
remark more especially applies to the game breed which of all comes
nearest to the g bankiva and we have seen that with this species
living in a state of nature the earlappets vary in colour being red
in the malayan countries and generally but not invariably white in
india
in concluding this part of my subject i may repeat that there exists
one widelyranging varying and common species of gallus namely g
bankiva which can be tamed produces fertile offspring when crossed
with common fowls and closely resembles in its whole structure
plumage and voice the game breed hence it may be safely ranked as the
parent of this the most typical domesticated breed we have seen that
there is much difficulty in believing that other now unknown species
have been the parents of the other domestic breeds we know that all
the breeds are most closely allied as shown by their similarity in
most points of structure and in habits and by the analogous manner in
which they vary we have also seen that several of the most distinct
breeds occasionally or habitually closely resemble in plumage g
bankiva and that the crossed offspring of other breeds which are not
thus coloured show a stronger or weaker tendency to revert to this
same plumage some of the breeds which appear the most distinct and
the least likely to have proceeded from g bankiva such as polish
fowls with their protuberant and little ossified skulls and cochins
with their imperfect tail and small wings bear in these characters the
plain marks of their artificial origin we know well that of late years
methodical selection has greatly improved and fixed many characters
and we have every reason to believe that unconscious selection carried
on for many generations will have steadily augmented each new
peculiarity and thus have given rise to new breeds as soon as two or
three breeds were once formed crossing would come into play in
changing their character and in increasing their number brahma
pootras according to an account lately published in america offer a
good instance of a breed lately formed by a cross which can be truly
propagated the wellknown sebright bantams offer another and similar
instance hence it may be concluded that not only the gamebreed but
that all our breeds are probably the descendants of the malayan or
indian variety of g bankiva if so this species has varied greatly
since it was first domesticated but there has been ample time as we
shall now show
history of the fowlrtimeyer found no remains of the fowl in the
ancient swiss lakedwellings but according to jeitteles33 such
have certainly since been found associated with extinct animals and
prehistoric remains it is therefore a strange fact that the fowl is
not mentioned in the old testament nor figured on the ancient egyptian
monuments it is not referred to by homer or hesiod about 900 bc
but is mentioned by theognis and aristophanes between 400 and 500 bc
it is figured on some of the babylonian cylinders between the sixth
and seventh centuries bc of which mr layard sent me an impression
and on the harpy tomb in lycia about 600 bc so that the fowl
apparently reached europe in a domesticated condition somewhere about
the sixth century bc it had travelled still farther westward by the
time of the christian era for it was found in britain by julius csar
in india it must have been domesticated when the institutes of manu
were written that is according to sir w jones 1200 bc but
according to the later authority of mr h wilson only 800 bc for
the domestic fowl is forbidden whilst the wild is permitted to be
eaten if as before remarked we may trust the old chinese
encyclopdia the fowl must have been domesticated several centuries
earlier as it is said to have been introduced from the west into china
1400 bc
sufficient materials do not exist for tracing the history of the
separate breeds about the commencement of the christian era columella
mentions a fivetoed fighting breed and some provincial breeds but we
know nothing about them he also alludes to dwarf fowls but these
cannot have been the same with our bantams which as mr crawfurd has
shown were imported from japan into bantam in java a dwarf fowl
probably the true bantam is referred to in an old japanese
encyclopdia as i am informed by mr birch in the chinese
encyclopdia published in 1596 but compiled from various sources some
of high antiquity seven breeds are mentioned including what we should
now call jumpers or creepers and likewise fowls with black feathers
bones and flesh in 1600 aldrovandi describes seven or eight breeds of
fowls and this is the most ancient record from which the age of our
european breeds can be inferred the gallus turcicus certainly seems
to be a pencilled hamburgh but mr brent a most capable judge thinks
that aldrovandi evidently figured what he happened to see and not the
best of the breed mr brent indeed considers all aldrovandis fowls
as of impure breed but it is a far more probable view that all our
breeds have been much improved and modified since his time for as he
went to the expense of so many figures he probably would have secured
characteristic specimens the silk fowl however probably then existed
in its present state as did almost certainly the fowl with frizzled or
reversed feathers mr dixon34 considers aldrovandis paduan fowl as
a variety of the polish whereas mr brent believes it to have been
more nearly allied to the malay the anatomical peculiarities of the
skull of the polish breed were noticed by p borelli in 1656 i may add
that in 1737 one polish subbreed viz the goldenspangled was
known but judging from albins description the comb was then larger
the crest of feathers much smaller the breast more coarsely spotted
and the stomach and thighs much blacker a goldenspangled polish fowl
in this condition would now be of no value
differences in external and internal structure between the breeds
individual variabilityfowls have been exposed to diversified
conditions of life and as we have just seen there has been ample time
for much variability and for the slow action of unconscious selection
as there are good grounds for believing that all the breeds are
descended from gallus bankiva it will be worth while to describe in
some detail the chief points of difference beginning with the eggs and
chickens i will pass on to their secondary sexual characters and then
to their differences in external structure and in the skeleton i enter
on the following details chiefly to show how variable almost every
character has become under domestication
eggsmr dixon remarks35 that to every hen belongs an individual
peculiarity in the form colour and size of her egg which never
changes during her lifetime so long as she remains in health and
which is as well known to those who are in the habit of taking her
produce as the handwriting of their nearest acquaintance i believe
that this is generally true and that if no great number of hens be
kept the eggs of each can almost always be recognised the eggs of
differently sized breeds naturally differ much in size but apparently
not always in strict relation to the size of the hen thus the malay is
a larger bird than the spanish but  she produces not such large eggs
white bantams are said to lay smaller eggs than other bantams36
white cochins on the other hand as i hear from mr tegetmeier
certainly lay larger eggs than buff cochins the eggs however of the
different breeds vary considerably in character for instance mr
ballance states37 that his malay pullets of last year laid eggs
equal in size to those of any duck and other malay hens two or three
years old laid eggs very little larger than a good sized bantams egg
some were as white as a spanish hens egg and others varied from a
light creamcolour to a deep rich buff or even to a brown the shape
also varies the two ends being much more equally rounded in cochins
than in games or polish spanish fowls lay smoother eggs than cochins
of which the eggs are generally granulated the shell in this latter
breed and more especially in malays is apt to be thicker than in games
or spanish but the minorcas a subbreed of spanish are said to lay
harder eggs than true spanish38 the colour differs considerablythe
cochins laying buffcoloured eggs the malays a paler variable buff
and games a still paler buff it would appear that darkercoloured eggs
characterise the breeds which have lately come from the east or are
still closely allied to those now living there the colour of the yolk
according to ferguson as well as of the shell differs slightly in the
subbreeds of the game i am also informed by mr brent that dark
partridgecoloured cochin hens lay darker coloured eggs than the other
cochin subbreeds the flavour and richness of the egg certainly differ
in different breeds the productiveness of the several breeds is very
different spanish polish and hamburgh hens have lost the incubating
instinct
chickensas the young of almost all gallinaceous birds even of the
black curassow and black grouse whilst covered with down are
longitudinally striped on the backof which character when adult
neither sex retains a traceit might have been expected that the
chickens of all our domestic fowls would have been similarly
striped39 this could however hardly have been expected when the
adult plumage in both sexes has undergone so great a change as to be
wholly white or black in white fowls of various breeds the chickens
are uniformly yellowish white passing in the blackboned silk fowl
into bright canaryyellow this is also generally the case with the
chickens of white cochins but i hear from mr zurhost that they are
sometimes of a buff or oak colour and that all those of this latter
colour which were watched turned out males the chickens of buff
cochins are of a goldenyellow easily distinguishable from the paler
tint of the white cochins and are often longitudinally streaked with
dark shades the chickens of silvercinnamon cochins are almost always
of a buff colour the chickens of the white game and white dorking
breeds when held in particular lights sometimes exhibit on the
authority of mr brent faint traces of longitudinal stripes fowls
which are entirely black namely spanish black game black polish
and black bantams display a new character for their chickens have
their breasts and throats more or less white with sometimes a little
white elsewhere spanish chickens also occasionally brent have
where the down was white their first true feathers tipped for a time
with white the primordially striped character is retained by the
chickens of most of the game subbreeds brent dixon by dorkings by
the partridge and grousecoloured subbreeds of cochins brent but
not as we have seen by the subbreeds by the pheasantmalay dixon
but apparently not at which i am much surprised by other malays the
following breeds and subbreeds are barely or not at all
longitudinally striped viz gold and silver pencilled hamburghs
which can hardly be distinguished from each other brent in the down
both having a few dark spots on the head and rump with occasionally a
longitudinal stripe dixon on the back of the neck i have seen only
one chicken of the silverspangled hamburgh and this was obscurely
striped along the back goldspangled polish chickens tegetmeier are
of a warm russet brown and silverspangled polish chickens are grey
sometimes dixon with dashes of ochre on the head wings and breast
cuckoo and bluedun fowls dixon are grey in the down the chickens of
sebright bantams dixon are uniformly dark brown whilst those of the
brownbreasted red game bantam are black with some white on the throat
and breast from these facts we see that young chickens of the
different breeds and even of the same main breed differ much in their
downy plumage and although longitudinal stripes characterise the
young of all wild gallinaceous birds they disappear in several
domestic breeds perhaps it may be accepted as a general rule that the
more the adult plumage differs from that of the adult g bankiva the
more completely the chickens have lost their stripes
with respect to the period of life at which the characters proper to
each breed first appear it is obvious that such structures as
additional toes must be formed long before birth in polish fowls the
extraordinary protuberance of the anterior part of the skull is well
developed before the chickens come out of the egg40 but the crest
which is supported on the protuberance is at first feebly developed
nor does it attain its full size until the second year the spanish
cock is preeminent for his magnificent comb and this is developed at
an unusually early age so that the young males can be distinguished
from the females when only a few weeks old and therefore earlier than
in other breeds they likewise crow very early namely when about six
weeks old in the dutch subbreed of the spanish fowl the white
earlappets are developed earlier than in the common spanish breed41
cochins are characterised by a small tail and in the young cocks the
tail is developed at an unusually late period42 game fowls are
notorious for their pugnacity and the young cocks crow clap their
little wings and fight obstinately with each other even whilst under
their mothers care43 i have often had says one author44
whole broods scarcely feathered stoneblind from fighting the rival
couples moping in corners and renewing their battles on obtaining the
first ray of light the weapons and pugnacity of all male gallinaceous
birds evidently serve the purpose of gaining possession of the females
so that the tendency in our game chickens to fight at an extremely
early age is not only useless but injurious as they suffer much from
their wounds the training for battle during an early age may be
natural to the wild gallus bankiva but as man during many generations
has gone on selecting the most obstinately pugnacious cocks it is more
probable that their pugnacity has been unnaturally increased and
unnaturally transferred to the young male chickens in the same manner
it is probable that the extraordinary development of the comb in the
spanish cock has been unintentionally transferred to the young cocks
for fanciers would not care whether their young birds had large combs
but would select for breeding the adults which had the finest combs
whether or not developed at an early period the last point which need
here be noticed is that though the chickens of spanish and malay fowls
are well covered with down the true feathers are acquired at an
unusually late age so that for a time the young birds are partially
naked and are liable to suffer from cold
secondary sexual charactersthe two sexes in the parentform the
gallus bankiva differ much in colour in our domestic breeds the
difference is never greater but is often less and varies much in
degree even in the subbreeds of the same main breed thus in certain
game fowls the difference is as great as in the parentform whilst in
the black and white subbreeds there is no difference in plumage mr
brent informs me that he has seen two strains of blackbreasted red
games of which the cocks could not be distinguished whilst the hens
in one were partridgebrown and in the other fawnbrown a similar case
has been observed in the strains of the brownbreasted red game the
hen of the duckwinged game is extremely beautiful and differs
much from the hens of all the other game subbreeds but generally as
with the blue and grey game and with some subvarieties of the
pilegame a moderately close relation may be observed between the
males and females in the variation of their plumage45 a similar
relation is also evident when we compare the several varieties of
cochins in the two sexes of gold and silverspangled and of buff
polish fowls there is much general similarity in the colouring and
marks of the whole plumage excepting of course in the hackles crest
and beard in spangled hamburghs there is likewise a considerable
degree of similarity between the two sexes in pencilled hamburghs on
the other hand there is much dissimilarity the pencilling which is
characteristic of the hens being almost absent in the males of both the
golden and silver varieties but as we have already seen it cannot be
given as a general rule that male fowls never have pencilled feathers
for cuckoo dorkings are remarkable from having nearly similar markings
in both sexes
it is a singular fact that the males in certain subbreeds have lost
some of their secondary masculine characters and from their close
resemblance in plumage to the females are often called hennies there
is much diversity of opinion whether these males are in any degree
sterile that they sometimes are partially sterile seems clear46 but
this may have been caused by too close interbreeding that they are not
quite sterile and that the whole case is widely different from that of
old females assuming masculine characters is evident from several of
these henlike subbreeds having been long propagated the males and
females of gold and silverlaced sebright bantams can be barely
distinguished from each other except by their combs wattles and
spurs for they are coloured alike and the males have not hackles nor
the flowing sicklelike tailfeathers a hentailed subbreed of
hamburghs was recently much esteemed there is also a breed of
gamefowls in which the males and females resemble each other so
closely that the cocks have often mistaken their henfeathered
opponents in the cockpit for real hens and by the mistake have lost
their lives47 the cocks though dressed in the feathers of the hen
are highspirited birds and their courage has been often proved an
engraving even has been published of one celebrated hentailed victor
mr tegetmeier48 has recorded the remarkable case of a brownbreasted
red game cock which after assuming its perfect masculine plumage
became henfeathered in the autumn of the following year but he did
not lose voice spurs strength nor productiveness this bird has now
retained the same character during five seasons and has begot both
henfeathered and malefeathered offspring mr grantley f berkeley
relates the still more singular case of a celebrated strain of polecat
game fowls which produced in nearly every brood a single hencock
the great peculiarity in one of these birds was that he as the
seasons succeeded each other was not always a hencock and not always
of the colour called the polecat which is black from the polecat and
hencock feather in one season he moulted to a full maleplumaged
blackbreasted red and in the following year he returned to the former
feather49
i have remarked in my origin of species that secondary sexual
characters are apt to differ much in the species of the same genus and
to be unusually variable in the individuals of the same species so it
is with the breeds of the fowl as we have already seen as far as the
colour of plumage is concerned and so it is with the other secondary
sexual characters firstly the comb differs much in the various
breeds50 and its form is eminently characteristic of each kind with
the exception of the dorkings in which the form has not been as yet
determined on by fanciers and fixed by selection a single
deeplyserrated comb is the typical and most common form it differs
much in size being immensely developed in spanish fowls and in a
local breed called redcaps it is sometimes upwards of three inches
in breadth at the front and more than four inches in length measured
to the end of the peak behind51 in some breeds the comb is double
and when the two ends are cemented together it forms a cupcomb in
the rosecomb it is depressed covered with small projections and
produced backwards in the horned and crevecoeur fowl it is produced
into two horns it is triple in the peacombed brahmas short and
truncated in the malays and absent in the guelderlands in the
tasselled game a few long feathers rise from the back of the comb in
many breeds a crest of feathers replaces the comb the crest when
little developed arises from a fleshy mass but when much developed
from a hemispherical protuberance of the skull in the best polish
fowls it is so largely developed that i have seen birds which could
hardly pick up their food and a german writer asserts52 that they
are in consequence liable to be struck by hawks monstrous structures
of this kind would thus be suppressed in a state of nature the
wattles also vary much in size being small in malays and some other
breeds in certain polish subbreeds they are replaced by a great tuft
of feathers called a beard
the hackles do not differ much in the various breeds but are short and
stiff in malays and absent in hennies as in some orders male birds
display extraordinarilyshaped feathers such as naked shafts with
discs at the end etc the following case may be worth giving in the
wild gallus bankiva and in our domestic fowls the barbs which arise
from each side of the extremities of the hackles are naked or not
clothed with barbules so that they resemble bristles but mr brent
sent me some scapular hackles from a young birchen duckwing game cock
in which the naked barbs became densely reclothed with barbules
towards their tips so that these tips which were dark coloured with a
metallic lustre were separated from the lower parts by a
symmetricallyshaped transparent zone formed of the naked portions of
the barbs hence the coloured tips appeared like little separate
metallic discs
the sicklefeathers in the tail of which there are three pair and
which are eminently characteristic of the male sex differ much in the
various breeds they are scimitarshaped in some hamburghs instead of
being long and flowing as in the typical breeds they are extremely
short in cochins and are not at all developed in hennies they are
carried together with the whole tail erect in dorkings and gaines
but droop much in malays and in some cochins sultans are characterised
by an additional number of lateral sicklefeathers the spurs vary
much being placed higher or lower on the shank being extremely long
and sharp in games and blunt and short in cochins these latter birds
seem aware that their spurs are not efficient weapons for though they
occasionally use them they more frequently fight as i am informed by
mr tegetmeier by seizing and shaking each other with their beaks in
some indian game cocks received by mr brent from germany there are
as he informs me three four or even five spurs on each leg some
dorkings also have two spurs on each leg53 and in birds of this
breed the spur is often placed almost on the outside of the leg double
spurs are mentioned in an ancient chinese encyclopdia their
occurrence may be considered as a case of analogous variation for some
wild gallinaceous birds for instance the polyplectron have double
spurs
judging from the differences which generally distinguish the sexes in
the gallinace certain characters in our domestic fowls appear to have
been transferred from the one sex to the other in all the species
except in turnix when there is any conspicuous difference in plumage
between the male and female the male is always the most beautiful but
in goldenspangled hamburghs the hen is equally beautiful with the
cock and incomparably more beautiful than the hen in any natural
species of gallus so that here a masculine character has been
transferred to the female on the other hand in cuckoo dorkings and in
other cuckoo breeds the pencilling which in gallus is a female
attribute has been transferred to the male nor on the principle of
analogous variation is this transference surprising as the males in
many gallinaceous genera are barred or pencilled with most of these
birds head ornaments of all kinds are more fully developed in the male
than in the female but in polish fowls the crest or topknot which in
the male replaces the comb is equally developed in both sexes in the
males of certain other subbreeds which from the hen having a small
crest are called larkcrested a single upright comb sometimes almost
entirely takes the place of the crest54 from this latter case and
more especially from some facts presently to be given with respect to
the protuberance of the skull in polish fowls the crest in this breed
must be viewed as a feminine character which has been transferred to
the male in the spanish breed the male as we know has an immense
comb and this has been partially transferred to the female for her
comb is unusually large though not upright in game fowls the bold and
savage disposition of the male has likewise been largely transferred to
the female55 and she sometimes even possesses the eminently
masculine character of spurs many cases are on record of fertile hens
being furnished with spurs and in germany according to bechstein56
the spurs in the silk hen are sometimes very long he mentions also
another breed similarly characterised in which the hens are excellent
layers but are apt to disturb and break their eggs owing to their
spurs
mr layard57 has given an account of a breed of fowls in ceylon with
black skin bones and wattle but with ordinary feathers and which
cannot be more aptly described than by comparing them to a white fowl
drawn down a sooty chimney it is however adds mr layard a
remarkable fact that a male bird of the pure sooty variety is almost as
rare as a tortoiseshell tomcat mr blyth found the same rule to
hold good with this breed near calcutta the males and females on the
other hand of the blackboned european breed with silky feathers do
not differ from each other so that in the one breed black skin and
bones and the same kind of plumage are common to both sexes whilst in
the other breed these characters are confined to the female sex
at the present day all the breeds of polish fowls have the great bony
protuberance on their skulls which includes part of the brain and
supports the crest equally developed in both sexes but formerly in
germany the skull of the hen alone was protuberant blumenbach58 who
particularly attended to abnormal peculiarities in domestic animals
states in 1805 that this was the case and bechstein had previously
in 1793 observed the same fact this latter author has carefully
described the effects on the skull of a crest not only in the case of
fowls but of ducks geese and canaries he states that with fowls
when the crest is not much developed it is supported on a fatty mass
but when much developed it is always supported on a bony protuberance
of variable size he well describes the peculiarities of this
protuberance he attended also to the effects of the modified shape of
the brain on the intellect of these birds and disputes pallas
statement that they are stupid he then expressly remarks that he never
observed this protuberance in male fowls hence there can be no doubt
that this extraordinary character in the skulls of polish fowls was
formerly in germany confined to the female sex but has now been
transferred to the males and has thus become common to both sexes
     external differences not connected with the sexes between the
     breeds and between individual birds
the size of the body differs greatly mr tegetmeier has known a brahma
to weigh 17 pounds a fine malay cock 10 pounds whilst a firstrate
sebright bantam weighs hardly more than 1 pound during the last 20
years the size of some of our breeds has been largely increased by
methodical selection whilst that of other breeds has been much
diminished we have already seen how greatly colour varies even within
the same breed we know that the wild g bankiva varies slightly in
colour we know that colour is variable in all our domestic animals
nevertheless some eminent fanciers have so little faith in variability
that they have actually argued that the chief game subbreeds which
differ from each other in nothing but colour are descended from
distinct wild species crossing often causes strange modification of
colour mr tegetmeier informs me that when buff and white cochins are
crossed some of the chickens are almost invariably black according to
mr brent black and white cochins occasionally produce chickens of a
slatyblue tint and this same tint results as mr tegetmeier tells
me from crossing white cochins with black spanish fowls or white
dorkings with black minorcas59 a good observer60 states that a
firstrate silverspangled hamburgh hen gradually lost the most
characteristic qualities of the breed for the black lacing to her
feathers disappeared and her legs changed from leadenblue to white
but what makes the case remarkable is that this tendency ran in the
blood for her sister changed in a similar but less strongly marked
manner and chickens produced from this latter hen were at first almost
pure white but on moulting acquired black colours and some spangled
feathers with almost obliterated markings so that a new variety arose
in this singular manner the skin in the different breeds differs much
in colour being white in common kinds yellow in malays and cochins
and black in silk fowls thus mocking as m godron61 remarks the
three principal types of skin in mankind the same author adds that as
different kinds of fowls living in distant and isolated parts of the
world have black skin and bones this colour must have appeared at
various times and places
the shape and carriage of the body and the shape of the head differ
much the beak varies slightly in length and curvature but
incomparably less than with pigeons in most crested fowls the nostrils
offer a remarkable peculiarity in being raised with a crescentic
outline the primary wingfeathers are short in cochins in a male
which must have been more than twice as heavy as g bankiva these
feathers were in both birds of the same length i have counted with
mr tegetmeiers aid the primary wingfeathers in thirteen cocks and
hens of various breeds in four of them namely in two hamburghs a
cochin and game bantam there were 10 instead of the normal number 9
but in counting these feathers i have followed the practice of
fanciers and have not included the first minute primary feather
barely threequarters of an inch in length these feathers differ
considerably in relative length the fourth or the fifth or the
sixth being the longest with the third either equal to or
considerably shorter than the fifth in wild gallinaceous species the
relative length and number of the main wing and tailfeathers are
extremely constant
the tail differs much in erectness and size being small in malays and
very small in cochins in thirteen fowls of various breeds which i have
examined five had the normal number of 14 feathers including in this
number the two middle sicklefeathers six others viz a caffre cock
goldspangled polish cock cochin hen sultan hen game hen and malay
hen had 16 and two an old cochin cock and malay hen had 17 feathers
the rumpless fowl has no tail and in one which i possessed there was no
oilgland but this bird though the os coccygis was extremely
imperfect had a vestige of a tail with two rather long feathers in the
position of the outer caudals this bird came from a family where as i
was told the breed had kept true for twenty years but rumpless fowls
often produce chickens with tails62 an eminent physiologist63 has
recently spoken of this breed as a distinct species had he examined
the deformed state of the os coccyx he would never have come to this
conclusion he was probably misled by the statement which may be found
in some works that tailless fowls are wild in ceylon but this
statement as i have been assured by mr layard and dr kellaert who
have so closely studied the birds of ceylon is utterly false
the tarsi vary considerably in length being relatively to the femur
considerably longer in the spanish and frizzled and shorter in the
silk and bantam breeds than in the wild g bankiva but in the
latter as we have seen the tarsi vary in length the tarsi are often
feathered the feet in many breeds are furnished with additional toes
goldenspangled polish fowls are said64 to have the skin between
their toes much developed mr tegetmeier observed this in one bird
but it was not so in one which i examined prof hoffmann has sent me a
sketch of the feet of a fowl of the common breed at giessen with a web
extending between the three toes for about a third of their length in
cochins the middle toe is said65 to be nearly double the length of
the lateral toes and therefore much longer than in g bankiva or in
other fowls but this was not the case in two which i examined the
nail of the middle toe in this same breed is surprisingly broad and
flat but in a variable degree in two birds which i examined of this
structure in the nail there is only a trace in g bankiva
the voice differs slightly as i am informed by mr dixon in almost
every breed the malays66 have a loud deep somewhat prolonged crow
but with considerable individual difference colonel sykes remarks that
the domestic kulm cock in india has not the shrill clear pipe of the
english bird and his scale of notes appears more limited dr hooker
was struck with the prolonged howling screech of the cocks in
sikhim67 the crow of the cochin is notoriously and ludicrously
different from that of the common cock the disposition of the
different breeds is widely different varying from the savage and
defiant temper of the gamecock to the extremely peaceable temper of
the cochins the latter it has been asserted graze to a much greater
extent than any other varieties the spanish fowls suffer more from
frost than other breeds
before we pass on to the skeleton the degree of distinctness of the
several breeds from g bankiva ought to be noticed some writers
speak of the spanish as one of the most distinct breeds and so it is
in general aspect but its characteristic differences are not
important the malay appears to me more distinct from its tall
stature small drooping tail with more than fourteen tailfeathers and
from its small comb and wattles nevertheless one malay subbreed is
coloured almost exactly like g bankiva some authors consider the
polish fowl as very distinct but this is a semimonstrous breed as
shown by the protuberant and irregularly perforated skull the cochin
from its deeply furrowed frontal bones peculiarly shaped occipital
foramen short wingfeathers short tail containing more than fourteen
feathers broad nail to the middle toe fluffy plumage rough and
darkcoloured eggs and especially from its peculiar voice is probably
the most distinct of all the breeds if any one of our breeds has
descended from some unknown species distinct from g bankiva it is
probably the cochin but the balance of evidence does not favour this
view all the characteristic differences of the cochin breed are more
or less variable and may be detected in a greater or lesser degree in
other breeds one subbreed is coloured closely like g bankiva the
feathered legs often furnished with an additional toe the wings
incapable of flight the extremely quiet disposition indicate a long
course of domestication and these fowls come from china where we know
that plants and animals have been tended from a remote period with
extraordinary care and where consequently we might expect to find
profoundly modified domestic races
osteological differencesi have examined twentyseven skeletons and
fiftythree skulls of various breeds including three of g bankiva
nearly half of these skulls i owe to the kindness of mr tegetmeier
and three of the skeletons to mr eyton
illustration fig 33occipital foramen of the skulls of fowls
the skull differs greatly in size in different breeds being nearly
twice as long in the largest cochins but not nearly twice as broad as
in bantams the bones at the base from the occipital foramen to the
anterior end including the quadrates and pterygoids are absolutely
identical in  shape in all the skulls so is the lower jaw in the
forehead slight differences are often perceptible between the males and
females evidently caused by the presence of the comb in every case i
take the skull of g bankiva as the standard of comparison in four
games in one malay hen in an african cock in a frizzled cock from
madras in two blackboned silk hens no differences worth notice
occur in three spanish cocks the form of the forehead between the
orbits differs considerably in one it is considerably depressed
whilst in the two others it is rather prominent with a deep medial
furrow the skull of the hen is smooth in three skulls of sebright
bantams the crown is more globular and slopes more abruptly to the
occiput than in  g bankiva in a bantam or jumper from burmah these
same characters are more strongly pronounced and the supraocciput is
more pointed in a black bantam the skull is not so globular and the
occipital foramen is very large and has nearly the same subtriangular
outline presently to be described in cochins and in this skull the two
ascending branches of the premaxillary are overlapped in a singular
manner by the processes of the nasal bone but as i have seen only one
specimen some of these differences may be individual of cochins and
brahmas the latter a crossed race approaching closely to cochins i
have examined seven skulls at the point where the ascending branches
of the premaxillary rest on the frontal bone the surface is much
depressed and from this depression a deep medial furrow extends
backwards to a variable distance the edges of this fissure are rather
prominent as is the top of the skull behind and over the orbits these
characters are less developed in the hens the pterygoids and the
processes of the lower jaw are broader relatively to the size of the
head than in g bankiva and this is likewise the case with dorkings
when of large size the fork of the hyoid bone in cochins is twice as
wide as in g bankiva whereas the length of the other hyoid bones is
only as three to two but the most remarkable character is the shape of
the occipital foramen in g bankiva a the breadth in a horizontal
line exceeds the height in a vertical line and the outline is nearly
circular whereas in cochins b the outline is subtriangular and the
vertical line exceeds the horizontal line in length this same form
likewise occurs in the black bantam above referred to and an approach
to it may be seen in some dorkings and in a slight degree in certain
other breeds
illustration fig 34skulls of fowls
of dorkings i have examined three skulls one belonging to the
whitesubbreed the one character deserving notice is the breadth of
the frontal bones which are moderately furrowed in the middle thus in
a skull which was less than once and a half the length of that of g
bankiva the breadth between the orbits was exactly double of
hamburghs i have examined four skulls male and female of the
pencilled subbreed and one male of the spangled subbreed the
nasal bones stand remarkably wide apart but in a variable degree
consequently narrow membranecovered spaces are left between the tips
of the two ascending branches of the premaxillary bones which are
rather short and between these branches and the nasal bones the
surface of the frontal bone on which the branches of the premaxillary
rest is very little depressed these peculiarities no doubt stand in
close relation with the broad flattened rosecomb characteristic of
the hamburgh breed
illustration fig 35longitudinal sections of skulls of fowls
i have examined fourteen skulls of  polish and other crested breeds
their differences are extraordinary first for nine skulls of different
subbreeds of english polish fowls the hemispherical protuberance of
the frontal bones68 may be seen in fig 34 in which b the skull of
a whitecrested polish fowl is shown obliquely from above with the
skull a of g bankiva in the same position in fig 35 longitudinal
sections are given of the skull of a polish fowl and for comparison
of a cochin of the same size the protuberance in all polish fowls
occupies the same position but differs much in size in one of my nine
specimens it was extremely slight the degree to which the protuberance
is ossified varies greatly larger or smaller portions of bone being
replaced by membrane in one specimen there was only a single open
pore generally there are many variously shaped open spaces the bone
forming an irregular reticulation a medial longitudinal arched
ribbon of bone is generally retained but in one specimen there was no
bone whatever over the whole protuberance and the skull when cleaned
and viewed from above presented the appearance of an open basin the
change in the whole internal form of the skull is surprisingly great
the brain is modified in a corresponding manner as is shown in the two
longitudinal sections which deserve attentive consideration the upper
and anterior cavity of the three into which the skull may be divided
is the one which is so greatly modified it is evidently much larger
than in the cochin skull of the same size and extends much further
beyond the interorbital septum but laterally is less deep this
cavity as i hear from mr tegetmeier is entirely filled with brain
in the skull of the cochin and of all ordinary fowls a strong internal
ridge of bone separates the anterior from the central cavity but this
ridge is quite absent in the polish skull here figured the shape of
the central cavity is circular in the polish and lengthened in the
cochin skull the shape of the posterior cavity together with the
position size and number of the pores for the nerves differ much in
these two skulls a pit deeply penetrating the occipital bone of the
cochin is entirely absent in this polish skull whilst in another
specimen it was well developed in this second specimen the whole
internal surface of the posterior cavity likewise differs to a certain
extent in shape i made sections of two other skullsnamely of a
polish fowl with the protuberance singularly little developed and of a
sultan in which it was a little more developed and when these two
skulls were placed between the two above figured fig 35 a perfect
gradation in the configuration of each part of the internal surface
could be traced in the polish skull with a small protuberance the
ridge between the anterior and middle cavities was present but low
and in the sultan this ridge was replaced by a narrow furrow standing
on a broad raised eminence
illustration fig 36skulls of horned fowl
it may naturally be asked whether these remarkable modifications in the
form of the brain affect the intellect of polish fowls some writers
have stated that they are extremely stupid but bechstein and mr
tegetmeier have shown that this is by no means generally the case
nevertheless bechstein69 states that he had a polish hen which was
crazy and anxiously wandered about all day long a hen in my
possession was solitary in her habits and was often so absorbed in
reverie that she could be touched she was also deficient in the most
singular manner in the faculty of finding her way so that if she
strayed a hundred yards from her feedingplace she was completely
lost and would then obstinately try to proceed in a wrong direction i
have received other and similar accounts of polish fowls appearing
stupid or halfidiotic70
to return to the skull of polish fowls the posterior part viewed
externally differs little from that of g bankiva in most fowls the
posteriorlateral process of the frontal bone and the process of the
squamosal bone run together and are ossified near their extremities
this union of the two bones however is not constant in any breed and
in eleven out of fourteen skulls of crested breeds these processes
were quite distinct these processes when not united instead of being
inclined anteriorly as in all common breeds descend at right angles
to the lower jaw and in this case the longer axis of the bony cavity
of the ear is likewise more perpendicular than in other breeds when
the squamosal process is free instead of expanding at the tip it is
reduced to an extremely fine and pointed style of variable length the
pterygoid and quadrate bones present no differences the palatine bones
are a little more curved upwards at their posterior ends the frontal
bones anteriorly to the protuberance are as in dorkings very broad
but in a variable degree the nasal bones either stand far apart as in
hamburghs or almost touch each other and in one instance were
ossified together each nasal bone properly sends out in front two long
processes of equal lengths forming a fork but in all the polish
skulls except one the inner process was considerably but in a
variable degree shortened and somewhat upturned in all the skulls
except one the two ascending branches of the premaxillary instead of
running up between the processes of the nasal bones and resting on the
ethmoid bone are much shortened and terminate in a blunt somewhat
upturned point in those skulls in which the nasal bones approach quite
close to each other or are ossified together it would be impossible
for the ascending branches of the premaxillary to reach the ethmoid and
frontal bones hence we see that even the relative connection of the
bones has been changed apparently in consequence of the branches of
the premaxillary and of the inner processes of the nasal bones being
somewhat upturned the external orifices of the nostrils are upraised
and assume a crescentic outline
i must still say a few words on some of the foreign crested breeds the
skull of a crested rumpless white turkish fowl was very slightly
protuberant and but little perforated the ascending branches of the
premaxillary were well developed in another turkish breed called
ghoondooks the skull was considerably protuberant and perforated the
ascending branches of the premaxillary were so much aborted that they
projected only 115th of an inch and the inner processes of the nasal
bone were so completely aborted that the surface where they should
have projected was quite smooth here then we see these two bones
modified to an extreme degree of sultans another turkish breed i
examined two skulls in that of the female the protuberance was much
larger than in the male in both skulls the ascending branches of the
premaxillary were very short and in both the nasal portion of the
inner processes of the nasal bones were ossified together these sultan
skulls differed from those of english polish fowls in the frontal
bones anteriorly to the protuberance not being broad
the last skull which i need describe is a unique one lent to me by mr
tegetmeier it resembles a polish skull in most of its characters but
has not the great frontal protuberance it has however two rounded
knobs of a different nature which stand more in front above the
lachrymal bones these curious knobs into which the brain does not
enter are separated from each other by a deep medial furrow and this
is perforated by a few minute pores the nasal bones stand rather wide
apart with their inner processes and the ascending branches of the
premaxillary upturned and shortened the two knobs no doubt supported
the two great hornlike projections of the comb
from the foregoing facts we see in how astonishing a manner some of the
bones of the skull vary in crested fowls the protuberance may
certainly be called in one sense a monstrosity as being wholly unlike
anything observed in nature but as in ordinary cases it is not
injurious to the bird and as it is strictly inherited it can hardly
in another sense be called a monstrosity a series may be formed
commencing with the blackboned silk fowl which has a very small crest
with the skull beneath penetrated only by a few minute orifices but
with no other change in its structure and from this first stage we may
proceed to fowls with a moderately large crest which rests according
to bechstein on a fleshy mass but without any protuberance in the
skull i may add that i have seen a similar fleshy or fibrous mass
beneath the tuft of feathers on the head of the tufted duck and in
this case there was no actual protuberance in the skull but it had
become a little more globular lastly when we come to fowls with a
largely developed crest the skull becomes largely protuberant and is
perforated by a multitude of irregular open spaces the close relation
between the crest and the size of the bony protuberance is shown in
another way for mr tegetmeier informs me that if chickens lately
hatched be selected with a large bony protuberance when adult they
will have a large crest there can be no doubt that in former times the
breeder of polish fowls attended solely to the crest and not to the
skull nevertheless by increasing the crest in which he has been
wonderfully successful he has unintentionally made the skull
protuberant to an astonishing degree and through correlation of
growth he has at the same time affected the form and relative
connexion of the premaxillary and nasal bones the shape of the orifice
of the nose the breadth of the frontal bones the shape of the
postlateral processes of the frontal and squamosal bones the
direction of the axis of the bony cavity of the ear and lastly the
internal configuration of the whole skull together with the shape of
the brain
illustration fig 37sixth cervical verterbra of fowls
vertebrin g bankiva there are fourteen cervical seven dorsal
with ribs apparently fifteen lumbar and sacral and six caudal
vertebr71 but the lumbar and sacral are so much anchylosed that i
am not sure of their number and this makes the comparison of the total
number of vertebr in the several breeds difficult i have spoken of
six caudal vertebr because the basal one is almost completely
anchylosed with the pelvis but if we consider the number as seven the
caudal vertebr agree in all the skeletons the cervical vertebr are
as just stated in appearance fourteen but out of twentythree
skeletons in a fit state for examination in five of them namely in
two games in two pencilled hamburghs and in a polish the fourteenth
vertebra bore ribs which though small were perfectly developed with
a double articulation the presence of these little ribs cannot be
considered as a fact of much importance for all the cervical vertebr
bear representatives of ribs but their development in the fourteenth
vertebra reduces the size of the passages in the transverse processes
and makes this vertebra exactly like the first dorsal vertebra the
addition of these little ribs does not affect the fourteenth cervical
alone for properly the ribs of the first true dorsal vertebra are
destitute of processes but in some of the skeletons in which the
fourteenth cervical bore little ribs the first pair of true ribs had
welldeveloped processes when we know that the sparrow has only nine
and the swan twentythree cervical vertebr72 we need feel no
surprise at the number of the cervical vertebr in the fowl being as
it appears variable
there are seven dorsal vertebr bearing ribs the first dorsal is never
anchylosed with the succeeding four which are generally anchylosed
together in one sultan fowl however the two first dorsal vertebr
were free in two skeletons the fifth dorsal was free generally the
sixth is free as in g bankiva but sometimes only at its posterior
end where in contact with the seventh the seventh dorsal vertebra in
every case excepting in one spanish cock was anchylosed with the
lumbar vertebr so that the degree to which these middle dorsal
vertebr are anchylosed is variable
seven is the normal number of true ribs but in two skeletons of the
sultan fowl in which the fourteenth cervical vertebra was not
furnished with little ribs there were eight pairs the eighth pair
seemed to be developed on a vertebra corresponding with the first
lumbar in g bankiva the sternal portion of both the seventh and
eighth ribs did not reach the sternum in four skeletons in which ribs
were developed on the fourteenth cervical vertebra there were when
these cervical ribs are included eight pairs but in one game cock in
which the fourteenth cervical was furnished with ribs there were only
six pairs of true dorsal ribs the sixth pair in this case did not have
processes and thus resembled the seventh pair in other skeletons in
this game cock as far as could be judged from the appearance of the
lumbar vertebr a whole dorsal vertebra with its ribs was missing we
thus see that the ribs whether or not the little pair attached to the
fourteenth cervical vertebra be counted vary from six to eight pair
the sixth pair is frequently not furnished with processes the sternal
portion of the seventh pair is extremely broad in cochins and is
completely ossified as previously stated it is scarcely possible to
count the lumbosacral vertebr but they certainly do not correspond
in shape or number in the several skeletons the caudal vertebr are
closely similar in all the skeletons the only difference being whether
or not the basal one is anchylosed to the pelvis they hardly vary even
in length not being shorter in cochins with their short
tailfeathers than in other breeds in a spanish cock however the
caudal vertebr were a little elongated in three rumpless fowls the
caudal vertebr were few in number and anchylosed together into a
misformed mass
in the individual vertebr the differences in structure are very
slight in the atlas the cavity for the occipital condyle is either
ossified into a ring or is as in bankiva open on its upper margin
the upper arc of the spinal canal is a little more arched in cochins
in conformity with the shape of the occipital foramen than in g
bankiva in several skeletons a difference but not of much
importance may be observed which commences at the fourth cervical
vertebra and is greatest at about the sixth seventh or eighth
vertebra this consists in the hmal descending processes being united
to the body of the vertebra by a sort of buttress this structure may
be observed in cochins polish some hamburghs and probably other
breeds but is absent or barely developed in game dorking spanish
bantam and several other breeds examined by me on the dorsal surface
of the sixth cervical vertebra in cochins three prominent points are
more strongly developed than in the corresponding vertebra of the game
fowl or g bankiva
pelvisthis differs in some few points in the several skeletons the
anterior margin of the ilium seems at first to vary much in outline
but this is chiefly due to the degree to which the margin in the middle
part is ossified to the crest of the vertebr the outline however
does differ in being more truncated in bantams and more rounded in
certain breeds as in cochins the outline of the ischiadic foramen
differs considerably being nearly circular in bantams instead of
eggshaped as in the bankiva and more regularly oval in some
skeletons as in the spanish the obturator notch is also much less
elongated in some skeletons than in others the end of the pubic bone
presents the greatest difference being hardly enlarged in the bankiva
considerably and gradually enlarged in cochins and in a lesser degree
in some other breeds and abruptly enlarged in bantams in one bantam
this bone extended very little beyond the extremity of the ischium the
whole pelvis in this latter bird differed widely in its proportions
being far broader proportionally to its length than in bankiva
illustration fig 38extremity of the furcula of fowls
sternumthis bone is generally so much deformed that it is scarcely
possible to compare its shape strictly in the several breeds the form
of the triangular extremity of the lateral processes differs
considerably being either almost equilateral or much elongated the
front margin of the crest is more or less perpendicular and varies
greatly as does the curvature of the posterior end and the flatness
of the lower surface the outline of the manubrial process also varies
being wedgeshaped in the bankiva and rounded in the spanish breed
the furculum differs in being more or less arched and greatly as
may be seen in the accompanying outlines in the shape of the terminal
plate but the shape of this part differed a little in two skeletons of
the wild bankiva the coracoid presents no difference worth notice
the scapula varies in shape being of nearly uniform breadth in
bankiva much broader in the middle in the polish fowl and abruptly
narrowed towards the apex in the two sultan fowls
i carefully compared each separate bone of the leg and wing relatively
to the same bones in the wild bankiva in the following breeds which i
thought were the most likely to differ namely in cochin dorking
spanish polish burmese bantam frizzled indian and blackboned silk
fowls and it was truly surprising to see how absolutely every process
articulation and pore agreed though the bones differed greatly in
size the agreement is far more absolute than in other parts of the
skeleton in stating this i do not refer to the relative thickness and
length of the several bones for the tarsi varied considerably in both
these respects but the other limbbones varied little even in relative
length
finally i have not examined a sufficient number of skeletons to say
whether any of the foregoing differences except in the skull are
characteristic of the several breeds apparently some differences are
more common in certain breeds than in othersas an additional rib to
the fourteenth cervical vertebra in hamburghs and games and the
breadth of the end of the pubic bone in cochins both skeletons of the
sultan fowl had eight dorsal vertebr and the end of the scapula in
both was somewhat attenuated in the skull the deep medial furrow in
the frontal bones and the vertically elongated occipital foramen seem
to be characteristic of cochins as is the great breadth of the frontal
bones in dorkings the separation and open spaces between the tips of
the ascending branches of the premaxillaries and nasal bones as well
as the front part of the skull being but little depressed characterise
hamburghs the globular shape of the posterior part of the skull seems
to be characteristic of laced bantams and lastly the protuberance of
the skull with the ascending branches of the premaxillaries partially
aborted together with the other differences before specified are
eminently characteristic of polish and other crested fowls
but the most striking result of my examination of the skeleton is the
great variability of all the bones except those of the extremities to
a certain extent we can understand why the skeleton fluctuates so much
in structure fowls have been exposed to unnatural conditions of life
and their whole organisation has thus been rendered variable but the
breeder is quite indifferent to and never intentionally selects any
modification in the skeleton external characters if not attended to
by man such as the number of the tail and wing feathers and their
relative lengths which in wild birds are generally constantfluctuate
in our domestic fowls in the same manner as the several parts of the
skeleton an additional toe is a point in dorkings and has become a
fixed character but is variable in cochins and silk fowls the colour
of the plumage and the form of the comb are in most breeds or even
subbreeds eminently fixed characters but in dorkings these points
have not been attended to and are variable when any modification in
the skeleton is related to some external character which man values it
has been unintentionally on his part acted on by selection and has
become more or less fixed we see this in the wonderful protuberance of
the skull which supports the crest of feathers in polish fowls and
which by correlation has affected other parts of the skull we see the
same result in the two protuberances which support the horns in the
horned fowl and in the flattened shape of the front of the skull in
hamburghs consequent on their flattened and broad rosecombs we know
not in the least whether additional ribs or the changed outline of the
occipital foramen or the changed form of the scapula or of the
extremity of the furculum are in any way correlated with other
structures or have arisen from the changed conditions and habits of
life to which our fowls have been subjected but there is no reason to
doubt that these various modifications in the skeleton could be
rendered either by direct selection or by the selection of correlated
structures as constant and as characteristic of each breed as are the
size and shape of the body the colour of the plumage and the form of
the comb
     effects of the disuse of parts
judging from the habits of our european gallinaceous birds gallus
bankiva in its native haunts would use its legs and wings more than do
our domestic fowls which rarely fly except to their roosts the silk
and the frizzled fowls from having imperfect wingfeathers cannot fly
at all and there is reason to believe that both these breeds are
ancient so that their progenitors during many generations cannot have
flown the cochins also from their short wings and heavy bodies can
hardly fly up to a low perch therefore in these breeds especially in
the two first a considerable diminution in the wingbones might have
been expected but this is not the case in every specimen after
disarticulating and cleaning the bones i carefully compared the
relative length of the two main bones of the wing to each other and of
the two main bones of the leg to each other with those of g
bankiva and it was surprising to see except in the case of the
tarsi how exactly the same relative length had been retained this
fact is curious from showing how truly the proportions of an organ may
be inherited although not fully exercised during many generations i
then compared in several breeds the length of the femur and tibia with
the humerus and ulna and likewise these same bones with those of g
bankiva the result was that the wingbones in all the breeds except
the burmese jumper which has unnaturally short legs are slightly
shortened relatively to the legbones but the decrease is so slight
that it may be due to the standard specimen of g bankiva having
accidentally had wings of slightly greater length than usual so that
the measurements are not worth giving but it deserves notice that the
silk and frizzled fowls which are quite incapable of flight had their
wings less reduced relatively to their legs than in almost any other
breed we have seen with domesticated pigeons that the bones of the
wings are somewhat reduced in length whilst the primary feathers are
rather increased in length and it is just possible though not
probable that in the silk and frizzled fowls any tendency to decrease
in the length of the wingbones from disuse may have been checked
through the law of compensation by the decreased growth of the
wingfeathers and consequent increased supply of nutriment the
wingbones however in both these breeds are found to be slightly
reduced in length when judged by the standard of the length of the
sternum or head relatively to these same parts in g bankiva
the actual weight of the main bones of the leg and wing in twelve
breeds is given in the two first columns in table i the calculated
weight of the wingbones relatively to the legbones in comparison
with the leg and wingbones of g bankiva are given in the third

in the eight first birds belonging to distinct breeds in this table
we see a decided reduction in the weight of the bones of the wing
in the indian frizzled fowl which cannot fly the reduction is carried
to the greatest extent namely to thirtythree per cent of their
proper proportional weight in the next four birds including the silk
hen which is incapable of flight we see that the wings relatively to
the legs are slightly increased in weight but it should be observed
that if in these birds the legs had become from any cause reduced in
weight this would give the false appearance of the wings having
increased in relative weight now a reduction of this nature has
certainly occurred with the burmese jumper in which the legs are
abnormally short and in the two hamburghs and silk fowl the legs
though not short are formed of remarkably thin and light bones i make
these statements not judging by mere eyesight but after having
calculated the weights of the legbones relatively to those of g
bankiva according to the only two standards of comparison which i
could use namely the relative lengths of the head and sternum for i
do not know the weight of the body in g bankiva which would have
been a better standard according to these standards the legbones in
these four fowls are in a marked manner far lighter than in any other
breed it may therefore be concluded that in all cases in which the
legs have not been through some unknown cause much reduced in weight
the wingbones have become reduced in weight relatively to the
legbones in comparison with those of g bankiva and this reduction
of weight may i apprehend safely be attributed to disuse
to make table i quite satisfactory it ought to have been shown that in
the eight first birds the legbones have not actually increased in
weight out of due proportion with the rest of the body this i cannot
show from not knowing as already remarked the weight of the wild
bankiva74 i am indeed inclined to suspect that the legbones in the
dorking no 2 in the table are proportionally too heavy but this
bird was a very large one weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces though very
thin its legbones were more than ten times as heavy as those of the
burmese jumper i tried to ascertain the length both of the legbones
and wingbones relatively to other parts of the body and skeleton but
the whole organisation in these birds which have been so long
domesticated has become so variable that no certain conclusions could
be reached for instance the legs of the above dorking cock were
nearly threequarters of an inch too short relatively to the length of
the sternum and more than threequarters of an inch too long
relatively to the length of the skull in comparison with these same
parts in g bankiva

in table ii in the two first columns we see in inches and decimals the
length of the sternum and the extreme depth of its crest to which the
pectoral muscles are attached in the third column we have the
calculated depth of the crest relatively to the length of the sternum
in comparison with these same parts in g bankiva75
by looking to the third column we see that in every case the depth of
the crest relatively to the length of the sternum in comparison with
g bankiva is diminished generally between 10 and 20 per cent but
the degree of reduction varies much partly in consequence of the
frequently deformed state of the sternum in the silk fowl which
cannot fly the crest is 34 per cent less deep than what it ought to
have been this reduction of the crest in all the breeds probably
accounts for the great variability before referred to in the
curvature of the furculum and in the shape of its sternal extremity
medical men believe that the abnormal form of the spine so commonly
observed in women of the higher ranks results from the attached muscles
not being fully exercised so it is with our domestic fowls for they
use their pectoral muscles but little and out of twentyfive sternums
examined by me three alone were perfectly symmetrical ten were
moderately crooked and twelve were deformed to an extreme degree mr
romanes however believes that the malformation is due to fowls whilst
young resting their sternums on the sticks on which they roost
finally we may conclude with respect to the various breeds of the
fowl that the main bones of the wing have probably been shortened in a
very slight degree that they have certainly become lighter relatively
to the legbones in all the breeds in which these latter bones are not
unnaturally short or delicate and that the crest of the sternum to
which the pectoral muscles are attached has invariably become less
prominent the whole sternum being also extremely liable to deformity
these results we may attribute to the lessened use of the wings
correlation of growthi will here sum up the few facts which i have
collected on this obscure but important subject in cochin and game
fowls there is perhaps some relation between the colour of the plumage
and the darkness of the eggshell in sultans the additional
sicklefeathers in the tail are apparently related to the general
redundancy of the plumage as shown by the feathered legs large crest
and beard in two tailless fowls which i examined the oilgland was
aborted a large crest of feathers as mr tegetmeier has remarked
seems always accompanied by a great diminution or almost entire absence
of the comb a large beard is similarly accompanied by diminished or
absent wattles these latter cases apparently come under the law of
compensation or balancement of growth a large beard beneath the lower
jaw and a large topknot on the skull often go together the comb when
of any peculiar shape as with horned spanish and hamburgh fowls
affects in a corresponding manner the underlying skull and we have
seen how wonderfully this is the case with crested fowls when the crest
is largely developed with the protuberance of the frontal bones the
shape of the internal surface of the skull and of the brain is greatly
modified the presence of a crest influences in some unknown way the
development of the ascending branches of the premaxillary bone and of
the inner processes of the nasal bones and likewise the shape of the
external orifice of the nostrils there is a plain and curious
correlation between a crest of feathers and the imperfectly ossified
condition of the skull not only does this hold good with nearly all
crested fowls but likewise with tufted ducks and as dr gunther
informs me with tufted geese in germany
lastly the feathers composing the crest in male polish fowls resemble
hackles and differ greatly in shape from those in the crest of the
female the neck wingcoverts and loins in the male bird are properly
covered with hackles and it would appear that feathers of this shape
have spread by correlation to the head of the male this little fact is
interesting because though both sexes of some wild gallinaceous birds
have their heads similarly ornamented yet there is often a difference
in the size and shape of feathers forming their crests furthermore
there is in some cases as in the male gold and in the male amherst
pheasants p pictus and amhersti a close relation in colour as
well as in structure between the plumes on the head and on the loins
it would therefore appear that the same law has regulated the state of
the feathers on the head and body both with species living under
natural conditions and with birds which have varied under
domestication

 27 i have consulted an eminent authority mr sclater on this
 subject and he thinks that i have not expressed myself too strongly
 i am aware that one ancient author acosta speaks of fowls as having
 inhabited s america at the period of its discovery and more
 recently about 1795 olivier de serres speaks of wild fowls in the
 forests of guiana these were probably feral birds dr daniell tells
 me he believes that fowls have become wild on the west coast of
 equatorial africa they may however not be true fowls but
 gallinaceous birds belonging to the genus phasidus the old voyager
 barbut says that poultry are not natural to guinea capt w allen
 narrative of niger expedition 1848 vol ii p 42 describes wild
 fowls on ilha dos rollas an island near st thomass on the west
 coast of africa the natives informed him that they had escaped from a
 vessel wrecked there many years ago they were extremely wild and had
 a cry quite different to that of the domestic fowl and their
 appearance was somewhat changed hence it is not a little doubtful
 notwithstanding the statement of the natives whether these birds
 really were fowls that the fowl has become feral on several islands
 is certain mr fry a very capable judge informed mr layard in a
 letter that the fowls which have run wild on ascension had nearly
 all got back to their primitive colours red and black cocks and
 smokygrey hens but unfortunately we do not know the colour of the
 poultry which were turned out fowls have become feral on the nicobar
 islands blyth in the indian field 1858 p 62 and in the
 ladrones ansons voyage those found in the pellew islands
 crawfurd are believed to be feral and lastly it is asserted that
 they have become feral in new zealand but whether this is correct i
 know not

 73 it may be well to explain how the calculation has been made for
 the third column in g bankiva the legbones are to the wingbones
 as 86  54 or as neglecting decimals 100  62in cochins as 311 
 162 or as 100  52in dorkings as 557  248 or as 100  44 and so
 on for the other breeds we thus get the series of 62 52 44 for the
 relative weights of the wingbones in g bankiva cochins dorkings
 etc and now taking 100 instead of 62 for the weight of the
 wingbones in g bankiva we get by another rule of three 83 as
 the weight of the wingbones in cochins 70 in the dorkings and so on
 for the remainder of the third column in the table
 74 mr blyth in annals and mag of nat hist 2nd series vol

 g bankiva but from what i have seen of the skins and skeletons of
 various breeds i cannot believe that my two specimens of g bankiva
 could have weighed so much
 75 the third column is calculated on the same principle as explained
 in footnote 73 above

i will as in previous cases first briefly describe the chief domestic
breeds of the duck
breed 1 common domestic duckvaries much in colour and in
proportions and differs in instincts and disposition from the wild
duck there are several subbreeds1 the aylesbury of great size
white with paleyellow beak and legs abdominal dermal sack largely
developed 2 the rouen of great size coloured like the wild duck
with green or mottled beak dermal sack largely developed 3 tufted
duck with a large topknot of fine downy feathers supported on a
fleshy mass with the skull perforated beneath the topknot in a duck
which i imported from holland was two and a half inches in diameter
4 labrador or canadian or buenos ayres or east indian plumage
entirely black beak broader relatively to its length than in the
wild duck eggs slightly tinted with black this subbreed perhaps
ought to be ranked as a breed it includes two subvarieties one as
large as the common domestic duck which i have kept alive and the
other smaller and often capable of flight1 i presume it is this
latter subvariety which has been described in france2 as flying
well being rather wild and when cooked having the flavour of the wild
duck nevertheless this subvariety is polygamous like other
domesticated ducks and unlike the wild duck these black labrador ducks
breed true but a case is given by dr turral of the french subvariety
producing young with some white feathers on the head and neck and with
an ochrecoloured patch on the breast
breed 2 hookbilled duckthis bird presents an extraordinary
appearance from the downward curvature of the beak the head is often
tufted the common colour is white but some are coloured like wild
ducks it is an ancient breed having been noticed in 16763 it shows
its prolonged domestication by almost incessantly laying eggs like the
fowls which are called everlasting layers4
breed 3 call duckremarkable from its small size and from the
extraordinary loquacity of the female beak short these birds are
either white or coloured like the wild duck
breed 4 penguin duckthis is the most remarkable of all the breeds
and seems to have originated in the malayan archipelago it walks with
its body extremely erect and with its thin neck stretched straight
upwards beak rather short tail upturned including only 18 feathers
femur and metatarsus elongated
almost all naturalists admit that the several breeds are descended from
the common wild duck anas boschas most fanciers on the other
hand take as usual a very different view5 unless we deny that
domestication prolonged during centuries can affect even such
unimportant characters as colour size and in a slight degree
proportional dimensions and mental disposition there is no reason
whatever to doubt that the domestic duck is descended from the common
wild species for the one differs from the other in no important
character we have some historical evidence with respect to the period
and progress of the domestication of the duck it was unknown6 to the
ancient egyptians to the jews of the old testament and to the greeks
of the homeric period about eighteen centuries ago columella7 and
varro speak of the necessity of keeping ducks in netted enclosures like
other wild fowl so that at this period there was danger of their
flying away moreover the plan recommended by columella to those who
wish to increase their stock of ducks namely to collect the eggs of
the wild bird and to place them under a hen shows as mr dixon
remarks that the duck had not at this time become a naturalised and
prolific inmate of the roman poultryyard the origin of the domestic
duck from the wild species is recognised in nearly every language of
europe as aldrovandi long ago remarked by the same name being applied
to both the wild duck has a wide range from the himalayas to north
america it crosses readily with the domestic bird and the crossed
offspring are perfectly fertile
both in north america and europe the wild duck has been found easy to
tame and breed in sweden this experiment was carefully tried by
tiburtius he succeeded in rearing wild ducks for three generations
but though they were treated like common ducks they did not vary even
in a single feather the young birds suffered from being allowed to
swim about in cold water8 as is known to be the case though the
fact is a strange one with the young of the common domestic duck an
accurate and wellknown observer in england9 has described in detail
his often repeated and successful experiments in domesticating the wild
duck young birds are easily reared from eggs hatched under a bantam
but to succeed it is indispensable not to place the eggs of both the
wild and tame duck under the same hen for in this case the young wild
ducks die off leaving their more hardy brethren in undisturbed
possession of their fostermothers care the difference of habit at
the onset in the newlyhatched ducklings almost entails such a result
to a certainty the wild ducklings were from the first quite tame
towards those who took care of them as long as they wore the same
clothes and likewise to the dogs and cats of the house they would
even snap with their beaks at the dogs and drive them away from any
spot which they coveted but they were much alarmed at strange men and
dogs differently from what occurred in sweden mr hewitt found that
his young birds always changed and deteriorated in character in the
course of two or three generations notwithstanding that great care was
taken to prevent their crossing with tame ducks after the third
generation his birds lost the elegant carriage of the wild species and
began to acquire the gait of the common duck they increased in size in
each generation and their legs became less fine the white collar
round the neck of the mallard became broader and less regular and some
of the longer primary wingfeathers became more or less white when
this occurred mr hewitt destroyed nearly the whole of his stock and
procured fresh eggs from wild nests so that he never bred the same
family for more than five or six generations his birds continued to
pair together and never became polygamous like the common domestic
duck i have given these details because no other case as far as i
know has been so carefully recorded by a competent observer of the
progress of change in wild birds reared for several generations in a
domestic condition
from these considerations there can hardly be a doubt that the wild
duck is the parent of the common domestic kind nor need we look to
other species for the parentage of the more distinct breeds namely
penguin call hookbilled tufted and labrador ducks i will not
repeat the arguments used in the previous chapters on the improbability
of man having in ancient times domesticated several species since
become unknown or extinct though ducks are not readily exterminated in
the wild stateon some of the supposed parentspecies having had
abnormal characters in comparison with all the other species of the
genus as with hookbilled and penguin duckson all the breeds as far
as is known being fertile together10on all the breeds having the
same general disposition instinct etc but one fact bearing on this
question may be noticed in the great duck family one species alone
namely the male of a boschas has its four middle tailfeathers
curled upwardly now in every one of the abovenamed domestic breeds
these curled feathers exist and on the supposition that they are
descended from distinct species we must assume that man formerly hit
upon species all of which had this now unique character moreover
subvarieties of each breed are coloured almost exactly like the wild
duck as i have seen with the largest and smallest breeds namely
rouens and call ducks and as mr brent states11 is the case with
hookbilled ducks this gentleman as he informs me crossed a white
aylesbury drake and a black labrador duck and some of the ducklings as
they grew up assumed the plumage of the wild duck
with respect to penguins i have not seen many specimens and none were
coloured precisely like the wild duck but sir james brooke sent me
three skins from lombok and bali in the malayan archipelago the two
females were paler and more rufous than the wild duck and the drake
differed in having the whole under and upper surface excepting the
neck tailcoverts tail and wings silvergrey finely pencilled with
dark lines closely like certain parts of the plumage of the wild
mallard but i found this drake to be identical in every feather with a
variety of the common breed procured from a farmyard in kent and i
have occasionally elsewhere seen similar specimens the occurrence of a
duck bred under so peculiar a climate as that of the malayan
archipelago where the wild species does not exist with exactly the
same plumage as may occasionally be seen in our farmyards is a fact
worth notice nevertheless the climate of the malayan archipelago
apparently tends to cause the duck to vary much for zollinger12
speaking of the penguin breed says that in lombok there is an unusual
and very wonderful variety of ducks one penguin drake which i kept
alive differed from those of which the skins were sent me from lombok
in having its breast and back partially coloured with chestnutbrown
thus more closely resembling the mallard
from these several facts more especially from the drakes of all the
breeds having curled tailfeathers and from certain subvarieties in
each breed occasionally resembling in general plumage the wild duck we
may conclude with confidence that all the breeds are descended from a
boschas
i will now notice some of the peculiarities characteristic of the
several breeds the eggs vary in colour some common ducks laying
palegreenish and others quite white eggs the eggs which are first
laid during each season by the black labrador duck are tinted black
as if rubbed with ink a good observer assured me that one year his
ducks of this breed laid almost perfectly white eggs another curious
case shows what singular variations sometimes occur and are inherited
mr hansell13 relates that he had a common duck which always laid
eggs with the yolk of a darkbrown colour like melted glue and the
young ducks hatched from these eggs laid the same kind of eggs so
that the breed had to be destroyed
illustration fig 39skulls of ducks viewed laterally
a wild duck b hookbilled duck
the hookbilled duck is highly remarkable see fig 39 of skull and
its peculiar beak has been inherited at least since the year 1676 this
structure is evidently analogous with that described in the bagadotten
carrier pigeon mr brent14 says that when hookbilled ducks are
crossed with common ducks many young ones are produced with the upper
mandible shorter than the lower which not unfrequently causes the
death of the bird with ducks a tuft of feathers on the head is by no
means a rare occurrence namely in the truetufted breed the
hookbilled the common farmyard kind and in a duck having no other
peculiarity which was sent to me from the malayan archipelago the tuft
is only so far interesting as it affects the skull which is thus
rendered slightly more globular and is perforated by numerous
apertures call ducks are remarkable from their extraordinary
loquacity the drake only hisses like common drakes nevertheless when
paired with the common duck he transmits to his female offspring a
strong quacking tendency this loquacity seems at first a surprising
character to have been acquired under domestication but the voice
varies in the different breeds mr brent15 says that hookbilled
ducks are very loquacious and that rouens utter a dull loud and
monotonous cry easily distinguishable by an experienced ear as the
loquacity of the call duck is highly serviceable these birds being
used in decoys this quality may have been increased by selection for
instance colonel hawker says if young wild ducks cannot be got for a
decoy by way of makeshift select tame birds which are the most
clamorous even if their colour should not be like that of wild
ones16 it has been erroneously asserted that call ducks hatch their
eggs in less time than common ducks17
the penguin duck is the most remarkable of all the breeds the thin
neck and body are carried erect the wings are small the tail is
upturned and the thighbones and metatarsi are considerably lengthened
in proportion with the same bones in the wild duck in five specimens
examined by me there were only eighteen tailfeathers instead of twenty
as in the wild duck but i have also found only eighteen and nineteen
tailfeathers in two labrador ducks on the middle toe in three
specimens there were twentyseven or twentyeight scutell whereas in
two wild ducks there were thirtyone and thirtytwo the penguin when
crossed transmits with much power its peculiar form of body and gait to
its offspring this was manifest with some hybrids raised in the
zoological gardens between one of these birds and the egyptian
goose18 anser gyptiacus and likewise with some mongrels which i
raised between the penguin and labrador duck i am not much surprised
that some writers should maintain that this breed must be descended
from an unknown and distinct species but from the reasons already
assigned it seems to me far more probable that it is the descendant
much modified by domestication under an unnatural climate of anas
boschas
osteological charactersthe skulls of the several breeds differ from
each other and from the skull of the wild duck in very little except in
the proportional length and curvature of the premaxillaries these
latter bones in the call duck are short and a line drawn from their
extremities to the summit of the skull is nearly straight instead of
being concave as in the common duck so that the skull resembles that
of a small goose in the hookbilled duck fig 39 these same bones
as well as the lower jaw curve downwards in a most remarkable manner
as represented in the labrador duck the premaxillaries are rather
broader than in the wild duck and in two skulls of this breed the
vertical ridges on each side of the supraoccipital bone are very
prominent in the penguin the premaxillaries are relatively shorter
than in the wild duck and the inferior points of the paramastoids more
prominent in a dutch tufted duck the skull under the enormous tuft
was slightly more globular and was perforated by two large apertures
in this skull the lachrymal bones were produced much further backwards
so as to have a different shape and nearly to touch the post lat
processes of the frontal bones thus almost completing the bony orbit
of the eye as the quadrate and pterygoid bones are of such complex
shape and stand in relation with so many other bones i carefully
compared them in all the principal breeds but excepting in size they
presented no difference
illustration fig 40cervical verterbr of ducks
vertebr and ribsin one skeleton of the labrador duck there were
the usual fifteen cervical vertebr and the usual nine dorsal vertebr
bearing ribs in the other skeleton there were fifteen cervical and ten
dorsal vertebr with ribs nor as far as could be judged was this
owing merely to a rib having been developed on the first lumbar
vertebra for in both skeletons the lumbar vertebr agreed perfectly in
number shape and size with those of the wild duck in two skeletons
of the call duck there were fifteen cervical and nine dorsal vertebr
in a third skeleton small ribs were attached to the socalled fifteenth
cervical vertebra making ten pairs of ribs but these ten ribs do not
correspond or arise from the same vertebra with the ten in the
abovementioned labrador duck in the call duck which had small ribs
attached to the fifteenth cervical vertebra the hmal spines of the
thirteenth and fourteenth cervical and of the seventeenth dorsal
vertebr corresponded with the spines on the fourteenth fifteenth and
eighteenth vertebr of the wild duck so that each of these vertebr
had acquired a structure proper to one posterior to it in position in
the eighth cervical vertebra of this same call duck fig 40 b the
two branches of the hmal spine stand much closer together than in the
wild duck a and the descending hmal processes are much shortened
in the penguin duck the neck from its thinness and erectness falsely
appears as ascertained by measurement to be much elongated but the
cervical and dorsal vertebr present no difference the posterior
dorsal vertebr however are more completely anchylosed to the pelvis
than in the wild duck the aylesbury duck has fifteen cervical and ten
dorsal vertebr furnished with ribs but the same number of lumbar
sacral and caudal vertebr as far as could be traced as in the wild
duck the cervical vertebr in this same duck fig 40 d were much
broader and thicker relatively to their length than in the wild c so
much so that i have thought it worth while to give a sketch of the
twelfth cervical vertebra in these two birds from the foregoing
statements we see that the fifteenth cervical vertebra occasionally
becomes modified into a dorsal vertebra and when this occurs all the
adjoining vertebr are modified we also see that an additional dorsal
vertebra bearing a rib is occasionally developed the number of the
cervical and lumbar vertebr apparently remaining the same as usual
i examined the bony enlargement of the trachea in the males of the
penguin call hookbilled labrador and aylesbury breeds and in all
it was identical in shape
the pelvis is remarkably uniform but in the skeleton of the
hookbilled duck the anterior part is much bowed inwards in the
aylesbury and some other breeds the ischiadic foramen is less
elongated in the sternum furculum coracoids and scapul the
differences are so slight and so variable as not to be worth notice
except that in two skeletons of the penguin duck the terminal portion
of the scapula was much attenuated
in the bones of the leg and wing no modification in shape could be
observed but in the penguin and hookbilled ducks the terminal
phalanges of the wing are a little shortened in the former the femur
and metatarsus but not the tibia are considerably lengthened
relatively to the same bones in the wild duck and to the wingbones in
both birds this elongation of the legbones could be seen whilst the
bird was alive and is no doubt connected with its peculiar upright
manner of walking in a large aylesbury duck on the other hand the
tibia was the only bone of the leg which relatively to the other bones
was slightly lengthened
on the effects of the increased and decreased use of the limbsin
all the breeds the bones of the wing measured separately after having
been cleaned relatively to those of the leg have become slightly
shortened in comparison with the same bones in the wild duck as may
be seen in table i

in table i we see by comparison with the wild duck that the reduction
in the length of the bones of the wing relatively to those of the
legs though slight is universal the reduction is least in the call
duck which has the power and the habit of frequently flying
in weight there is a greater relative difference between the bones of
the leg and wing as may be seen in table ii

in these domesticated birds the considerably lessened weight of the
bones of the wing ie on an average twentyfive per cent of their
proper proportional weight as well as their slightly lessened length
relatively to the legbones might follow not from any actual decrease
in the wingbones but from the increased weight and length of the
bones of the legs table iiia shows that the legbones relatively to
the weight of the entire skeleton have really increased in weight but
table iiib shows that according to the same standard the wingbones
have also really decreased in weight so that the relative
disproportion shown in the foregoing tables between the wing and
legbones in comparison with those of the wild duck is partly due to
the increase in weight and length of the legbones and partly to the
decrease in weight and length of the wingbones

with respect to table iii i may first state that i tested them by
taking another skeleton of a wild duck and of a common domestic duck
and by comparing the weight of  all the bones of the leg with all
those of the wings and the result was the same in the first of these
tables we see that the legbones in each case have increased in actual
weight it might have been expected that with the increased or
decreased weight of the entire skeleton the legbones would have
become proportionally heavier or lighter but their greater weight in
all the breeds relatively to the other bones can be accounted for only
by these domestic birds having used their legs in walking and standing
much more than the wild for they never fly and the more artificial
breeds rarely swim in the second table we see with the exception of
one case a plain reduction in the weight of the bones of the wing and
this no doubt has resulted from their lessened use the one exceptional
case namely in one of the call ducks is in truth no exception for
this bird was constantly in the habit of flying about and i have seen
it day after day rise from my grounds and fly for a long time in
circles of more than a mile in diameter in this call duck there is not
only no decrease but an actual increase in the weight of the
wingbones relatively to those of the wildduck and this probably is
consequent on the remarkable lightness and thinness of all the bones of
the skeleton
lastly i weighed the furculum coracoids and scapula of a wild duck
and of a common domestic duck and i found that their weight
relatively to that of the whole skeleton was as one hundred in the
former to eightynine in the latter this shows that these bones in the
domestic duck have been reduced eleven per cent of their due
proportional weight the prominence of the crest of the sternum
relatively to its length is also much reduced in all the domestic
breeds these changes have evidently been caused by the lessened use of
the wings
it is well known that several birds belonging to different orders and
inhabiting oceanic islands have their wings greatly reduced in size
and are incapable of flight i suggested in my origin of species
that as these birds are not persecuted by any enemies the reduction
of their wings had probably been caused by gradual disuse hence
during the earlier stages of the process of reduction such birds would
probably have resembled our domesticated ducks in the state of their
organs of flight this is the case with the waterhen gallinula
nesiotis of tristan dacunha which can flutter a little but
obviously uses its legs and not its wings as a mode of escape now
mr sclater19 finds in this bird that the wings sternum and
coracoids are all reduced in length and the crest of the sternum in
depth in comparison with the same bones in the european waterhen g
chloropus on the other hand the thighbones and pelvis are
increased in length the former by four lines relatively to the same
bones in the common waterhen hence in the skeleton of this natural
species nearly the same changes have occurred only carried a little
further as with our domestic ducks and in this latter case i presume
no one will dispute that they have resulted from the lessened use of
the wings and the increased use of the legs
the goose
this bird deserves some notice as hardly any other anciently
domesticated bird or quadruped has varied so little that geese were
anciently domesticated we know from certain verses in homer and from
these birds having been kept 388 bc in the capitol at rome as
sacred to juno which sacredness implies great antiquity20 that the
goose has varied in some degree we may infer from naturalists not
being unanimous with respect to its wild parentform though the
difficulty is chiefly due to the existence of three or four closely
allied wild european species21 a large majority of capable judges
are convinced that our geese are descended from the wild greyleg goose
a ferus the young of which can easily be tamed22 this species
when crossed with the domestic goose produced in the zoological
gardens as i was assured in 1849 perfectly fertile offspring23
yarrell24 has observed that the lower part of the trachea of the
domestic goose is sometimes flattened and that a ring of white
feathers sometimes surrounds the base of the beak these characters
seem at first sight good indications of a cross at some former period
with the whitefronted goose a albifrons but the white ring is
variable in this latter species and we must not overlook the law of
analogous variation that is of one species assuming some of the
characters of allied species
as the goose has proved so little flexible in its organisation under
longcontinued domestication the amount of variation which it has
undergone may be worth giving it has increased in size and in
productiveness25 and varies from white to a dusky colour several
observers26 have stated that the gander is more frequently white than
the goose and that when old it almost invariably becomes white but
this is not the case with the parentform the a ferus here again
the law of analogous variation may have come into play as the almost
snowwhite male of the rock goose bernicla antarctica standing on
the seashore by his dusky partner is a sight well known to those who
have traversed the sounds of tierra del fuego and the falkland islands
some geese have topknots and the skull beneath as before stated is
perforated a subbreed has lately been formed with the feathers
reversed at the back of the head and neck27 the beak varies a little
in size and is of a yellower tint than in the wild species but its
colour and that of the legs are both slightly variable28 this latter
fact deserves attention because the colour of the legs and beak is
highly serviceable in discriminating the several closely allied wild
forms29 at our shows two breeds are exhibited viz the embden and
toulouse but they differ in nothing except colour30 recently a
smaller and singular variety has been imported from sebastopol31
with the scapular feathers as i hear from mr tegetmeier who sent me
specimens greatly elongated curled and even spirally twisted the
margins of these feathers are rendered plumose by the divergence of the
barbs and barbules so that they resemble in some degree those on the
back of the black australian swan these feathers are likewise
remarkable from the central shaft which is excessively thin and
transparent being split into fine filaments which after running for
a space free sometimes coalesce again it is a curious fact that these
filaments are regularly clothed on each side with fine down or
barbules precisely like those on the proper barbs of the feather this
structure of the feathers is transmitted to halfbred birds in 
gallus sonneratii the barbs and barbules blend together and form thin
horny plates of the same nature with the shaft in this variety of the
goose the shaft divides into filaments which acquire barbules and
thus resemble true barbs
although the domestic goose certainly differs somewhat from any known
wild species yet the amount of variation which it has undergone as
compared with that of most domesticated animals is singularly small
this fact can be partially accounted for by selection not having come
largely into play birds of all kinds which present many distinct races
are valued as pets or ornaments no one makes a pet of the goose the
name indeed in more languages than one is a term of reproach the
goose is valued for its size and flavour for the whiteness of its
feathers which adds to their value and for its prolificness and
tameness in all these points the goose differs from the wild
parentform and these are the points which have been selected even in
ancient times the roman gourmands valued the liver of the white
goose and pierre belon32 in 1555 speaks of two varieties one of
which was larger more fecund and of a better colour than the other
and he expressly states that good managers attended to the colour of
their goslings so that they might know which to preserve and select
for breeding
the peacock
this is another bird which has hardly varied under domestication
except in sometimes being white or piebald mr waterhouse carefully
compared as he informs me skins of the wild indian and domestic bird
and they were identical in every respect except that the plumage of
the latter was perhaps rather thicker whether our birds are descended
from those introduced into europe in the time of alexander or have
been subsequently imported is doubtful they do not breed very freely
with us and are seldom kept in large numberscircumstances which
would greatly interfere with the gradual selection and formation of new
breeds there is one strange fact with respect to the peacock namely
the occasional appearance in england of the japanned or
blackshouldered kind this form has lately been named on the high
authority of mr sclater as a distinct species viz pavo
nigripennis which he believes will hereafter be found wild in some
country but not in india where it is certainly unknown the males of
these japanned birds differ conspicuously from the common peacock in
the colour of their secondary wingfeathers scapulars wingcoverts
and thighs and are i think more beautiful they are rather smaller
than the common sort and are always beaten by them in their battles
as i hear from the hon a s g canning the females are much paler
coloured than those of the common kind both sexes as mr canning
informs me are white when they leave the egg and they differ from the
young of the white variety only in having a peculiar pinkish tinge on
their wings these japanned birds though appearing suddenly in flocks
of the common kind propagate their kind quite truly although they do
not resemble the hybrids which have been raised between p cristatus
and  muticus nevertheless they are in some respects intermediate in
character between these two species and this fact favours as mr
sclater believes the view that they form a distinct and natural
species33
on the other hand sir h heron states34 that this breed suddenly
appeared within his memory in lord brownlows large stock of pied
white and common peacocks the same thing occurred in sir j
trevelyans flock composed entirely of the common kind and in mr
thorntons stock of common and pied peacocks it is remarkable that in
these two latter instances the blackshouldered kind though a smaller
and weaker bird increased to the extinction of the previously
existing breed i have also received through mr sclater a statement
from mr hudson gurney that he reared many years ago a pair of
blackshouldered peacocks from the common kind and another
ornithologist prof a newton states that five or six years ago a
female bird in all respects similar to the female of the
blackshouldered kind was produced from a stock of common peacocks in
his possession which during more than twenty years had not been
crossed with birds of any other strain mr jenner weir informs me that
a peacock at blackheath whilst young was white but as it became older
gradually assumed the characters of the blackshouldered variety both
its parents were common peacocks lastly mr canning has given a case
of a female of this same variety appearing in ireland in a flock of the
ordinary kind35 here then we have seven well authenticated cases
in great britain of japanned birds having suddenly appeared within
recent times in flocks of the common peafowl this variety must also
have formerly appeared in europe for mr canning has seen an old
picture and another is referred to in the field with this variety
represented these facts seem to me to indicate that the japanned
peacock is a strongly marked variety or sport which tends at all
times and in many places to reappear this view is supported by the
young being at first white like the young of the white breed which is
undoubtedly a variation if on the other hand we believe the japanned
peacock to be a distinct species we must suppose that in all the above
cases the common breed had at some former period been crossed by it
but had lost every trace of the cross yet that the offspring of these
birds suddenly and completely reacquired through reversion the
characters of p nigripennis i have heard of no other such case in
the animal or vegetable kingdom to perceive the full improbability of
such an occurrence we may suppose that a breed of dogs had been
crossed at some former period with a wolf but had lost every trace of
the wolflike character yet that the breed gave birth in seven
instances in the same country within no great length of time to a
wolf perfect in every character and we must further suppose that in
two of the cases the newly produced wolves afterwards spontaneously
increased to such an extent as to lead to the extinction of the parent
breed of dogs so remarkable a bird as the p nigripennis when first
imported would have realised a large price it is therefore improbable
that it should have been silently introduced and its history
subsequently lost on the whole the evidence seems to me as it did to
sir r heron to be decisive in favour of the japanned or
blackshouldered breed being a variation induced by some unknown
cause on this view the case is the most remarkable one ever recorded
of the abrupt appearance of a new form which so closely resembles a
true species that it has deceived one of the most experienced of living
ornithologists
the turkey
it seems fairly well established by mr gould36 that the turkey in
accordance with the history of its first introduction is descended
from a wild mexican form which had been domesticated by the natives
before the discovery of america and which is now generally ranked as a
local race and not as a distinct species however this may be the
case deserves notice because in the united states wild male turkeys
sometimes court the domestic hens which are descended from the mexican
form and are generally received by them with great pleasure37
several accounts have likewise been published of young birds reared in
the united states from the eggs of the wild species crossing and
commingling with the common breed in england also this same species
has been kept in several parks from two of which the rev w d fox
procured birds and they crossed freely with the common domestic kind
and during many years afterwards as he informs me the turkeys in his
neighbourhood clearly showed traces of their crossed parentage we here
have an instance of a domestic race being modified by a cross with a
distinct wild race or species f michaux38 suspected in 1802 that
the common domestic turkey was not descended from the united states
species alone but likewise from a southern form and he went so far as
to believe that english and french turkeys differed from having
different proportions of the blood of the two parentforms
english turkeys are smaller than either wild form they have not varied
in any great degree but there are some breeds which can be
distinguished as norfolks suffolks whites and coppercoloured or
cambridge all of which if precluded from crossing with other breeds
propagate their kind truly of these kinds the most distinct is the
small hardy dullblack norfolk turkey of which the chickens are
black occasionally with white patches about the head the other breeds
scarcely differ except in colour and their chickens are generally
mottled all over with brownishgrey39 the inferior tailcoverts vary
in number and according to a german superstition the hen lays as many
eggs as the cock has feathers of this kind40 albin in 1738 and
temminck within a much later period describe a beautiful breed
duskyyellowish brown above and white beneath with a large topknot
of soft plumose feather the spurs of the male were rudimentary this
breed has been for a long time extinct in europe but a living specimen
has lately been imported from the east coast of africa which still
retains the topknot and the same general colouring and rudimentary
spurs41 mr wilmot has described42 a white turkeycock having a
crest formed of feathers about four inches long with bare quills and
a tuft of soft white down growing at the end many of the young birds
inherited this kind of crest but afterwards it fell off or was pecked
out by the other birds this is an interesting case as with care a new
breed might probably have been formed and a topknot of this nature
would have been to a certain extent analogous to that borne by the
males in several allied genera such as euplocomus lophophorus and
pavo
wild turkeys believed in every instance to have been imported from the
united states have been kept in the parks of lords powis leicester
hill and derby the rev w d fox procured birds from the two
firstnamed parks and he informs me that they certainly differed a
little from each other in the shape of their bodies and in the barred
plumage on their wings these birds likewise differed from lord hills
stock some of the latter kept at oulton by sir p egerton though
precluded from crossing with common turkeys occasionally produced much
palercoloured birds and one that was almost white but not an albino
these halfwild turkeys in thus differing slightly from each other
present an analogous case with the wild cattle kept in the several
british parks we must suppose that such differences have resulted from
the prevention of free intercrossing between birds ranging over a wide
area and from the changed conditions to which they have been exposed
in england in india the climate has apparently wrought a still greater
change in the turkey for it is described by mr blyth43 as being
much degenerated in size utterly incapable of rising on the wing of
a black colour and with the long pendulous appendages over the beak
enormously developed
the guinea fowl
the domesticated guinea fowl is now believed by some naturalists to be
descended from the numida ptilorhynca which inhabits very hot and
in parts extremely arid districts in eastern africa consequently it
has been exposed in this country to extremely different conditions of
life nevertheless it has hardly varied at all except in the plumage
being either paler or darkercoloured it is a singular fact that this
bird varies more in colour in the west indies and on the spanish main
under a hot though humid climate than in europe44 the guinea fowl
has become thoroughly feral in jamaica and in st domingo45 and has
diminished in size the legs are black whereas the legs of the
aboriginal african bird are said to be grey this small change is worth
notice on account of the oftenrepeated statement that all feral
animals invariably revert in every character to their original type
the canary bird
as this bird has been recently domesticated namely within the last
350 years its variability deserves notice it has been crossed with
nine or ten other species of fringillid and some of the hybrids are
almost completely fertile but we have no evidence that any distinct
breed has originated from such crosses notwithstanding the modern
domestication of the canary many varieties have been produced even
before the year 1718 a list of twentyseven varieties was published in
france46 and in 1779 a long schedule of the desired qualities was
printed by the london canary society so that methodical selection has
been practised during a considerable period the greater number of the
varieties differ only in colour and in the markings of their plumage
some breeds however differ in shape such as the hooped or bowed
canaries and the belgian canaries with their much elongated bodies
mr brent47 measured one of the latter and found it eight inches in
length whilst the wild canary is only five and a quarter inches long
there are topknotted canaries and it is a singular fact that if two
topknotted birds are matched the young instead of having very fine
topknots are generally bald or even have a wound on their heads48
it would appear as if the topknot were due to some morbid condition
which is increased to an injurious degree when two birds in this state
are paired there is a featherfooted breed and another with a kind of
frill running down the breast one other character deserves notice from
being confined to one period of life and from being strictly inherited
at the same period namely the wing and tail feathers in prize
canaries being black but this colour is retained only until the first
moult once moulted the peculiarity ceases49 canaries differ much
in disposition and character and in some small degree in song they
produce eggs three or four times during the year
goldfish
besides mammals and birds only a few animals belonging to the other
great classes have been domesticated but to show that it is an almost
universal law that animals when removed from their natural conditions
of life vary and that races can be formed when selection is applied
it is necessary to say a few words on goldfish bees and silkmoths
goldfish cyprinus auratus were introduced into europe only two or
three centuries ago but they have been kept in confinement from an
ancient period in china mr blyth50 suspects from the analogous
variation of other fishes that goldencoloured fish do not occur in a
state of nature these fishes frequently live under the most unnatural
conditions and their variability in colour size and in some
important points of structure is very great m sauvigny has described
and given coloured drawings of no less than eightynine varieties51
many of the varieties however such as triple tailfins etc ought
to be called monstrosities but it is difficult to draw any distinct
line between a variation and a monstrosity as goldfish are kept for
ornament or curiosity and as the chinese are just the people to have
secluded a chance variety of any kind and to have matched and paired
from it52 it might have been predicted that selection would have
been largely practised in the formation of new breeds and this is the
case in an old chinese work it is said that fish with vermilion scales
were first raised in confinement during the sung dynasty which
commenced ad 960 and now they are cultivated in families
everywhere for the sake of ornament in another and more ancient work
it is said that there is not a household where the goldfish is not
cultivated in rivalry as to its colour and as a source of profit
etc53 although many breeds exist it is a singular fact that the
variations are often not inherited sir r heron54 kept many of these
fishes and placed all the deformed ones namely those destitute of
dorsal fins and those furnished with a double anal fin or triple tail
in a pond by themselves but they did not produce a greater proportion
of deformed offspring than the perfect fishes
passing over an almost infinite diversity of colour we meet with the
most extraordinary modifications of structure thus out of about two
dozen specimens bought in london mr yarrell observed some with the
dorsal fin extending along more than half the length of the back
others with this fin reduced to only five or six rays and one with no
dorsal fin the anal fins are sometimes double and the tail is often
triple this latter deviation of structure seems generally to occur at
the expense of the whole or part of some other fin55 but bory de
saintvincent56 saw at madrid goldfish furnished with a dorsal fin
and a triple tail one variety is characterised by a hump on its back
near the head and the rev l jenyns57 has described a most singular
variety imported from china almost globular in form like a diodon
with the fleshy part of the tail as if entirely cut away the caudal
fin being set on a little behind the dorsal and immediately above the
anal in this fish the anal and caudal fins were double the anal fin
being attached to the body in a vertical line the eyes also were
enormously large and protuberant
hivebees
bees have been domesticated from an ancient period if indeed their
state can be considered one of domestication for they search for their
own food with the exception of a little generally given to them during
the winter their habitation is a hive instead of a hole in a tree
bees however have been transported into almost every quarter of the
world so that climate ought to have produced whatever direct effect it
is capable of producing it is frequently asserted that the bees in
different parts of great britain differ in size colour and temper
and godron58 says that they are generally larger in the south than in
other parts of france it has also been asserted that the little brown
bees of high burgundy when transported to la bresse become large and
yellow in the second generation but these statements require
confirmation as far as size is concerned it is known that bees
produced in very old combs are smaller owing to the cells having
become smaller from the successive old cocoons the best
authorities59 concur that with the exception of the ligurian race or
species presently to be mentioned distinct breeds do not exist in
britain or on the continent there is however even in the same stock
some variability in colour thus mr woodbury states60 that he has
several times seen queen bees of the common kind annulated with
yellowlike ligurian queens and the latter darkcoloured like common
bees he has also observed variations in the colour of the drones
without any corresponding difference in the queens or workers of the
same hive the great apiarian dzierzon in answer to my queries on
this subject says61 that in germany bees of some stocks are
decidedly dark whilst others are remarkable for their yellow colour
bees also seem to differ in habits in different districts for dzierzon
adds if many stocks with their offspring are more inclined to swarm
whilst others are richer in honey so that some beekeepers even
distinguish between swarming and honeygathering bees this is a habit
which has become second nature caused by the customary mode of keeping
the bees and the pasturage of the district for example what a
difference in this respect one may perceive to exist between the bees
of the luneburg heath and those of this country    removing an
old queen and substituting a young one of the current year is here an
infallible mode of keeping the strongest stock from swarming and
preventing dronebreeding whilst the same means if adopted in hanover
would certainly be of no avail i procured a hive full of dead bees
from jamaica where they have long been naturalised and on carefully
comparing them under the microscope with my own bees i could detect
not a trace of difference
this remarkable uniformity in the hivebee wherever kept may probably
be accounted for by the great difficulty or rather impossibility of
bringing selection into play by pairing particular queens and drones
for these insects unite only during flight nor is there any record
with a single partial exception of any person having separated and
bred from a hive in which the workers presented some appreciable
difference in order to form a new breed seclusion from other bees
would as we now know be indispensable for since the introduction of
the ligurian bee into germany and england it has been found that the
drones wander at least two miles from their own hives and often cross
with the queens of the common bee62 the ligurian bee although
perfectly fertile when crossed with the common kind is ranked by most
naturalists as a distinct species whilst by others it is ranked as a
variety but this form need not here be noticed as there is no reason
to believe that it is the product of domestication the egyptian and
some other bees are likewise ranked by dr gerstcker63 but not by
other highly competent judges as geographical races he grounds his
conclusion in chief part on the fact that in certain districts as in
the crimea and rhodes they vary so much in colour that the several
geographical races can be closely connected by intermediate forms
i have alluded to a single instance of the separation and preservation
of a particular stock of bees mr lowe64 procured some bees from a
cottager a few miles from edinburgh and perceived that they differed
from the common bee in the hairs on the head and thorax being lighter
coloured and more profuse in quantity from the date of the
introduction of the ligurian bee into great britain we may feel sure
that these bees had not been crossed with this form mr lowe
propagated this variety but unfortunately did not separate the stock
from his other bees and after three generations the new character was
almost completely lost nevertheless as he adds a great number of
the bees still retain traces though faint of the original colony
this case shows us what could probably be effected by careful and
longcontinued selection applied exclusively to the workers for as we
have seen queens and drones cannot be selected and paired
silkmoths
these insects are in several respects interesting to us more
especially because they have varied largely at an early period of life
and the variations have been inherited at corresponding periods as the
value of the silkmoth depends entirely on the cocoon every change in
its structure and qualities has been carefully attended to and races
differing much in the cocoon but hardly at all in the adult state
have been produced with the races of most other domestic animals the
young resemble each other closely whilst the adults differ much
it would be useless even if it were possible to describe all the many
kinds of silkworms several distinct species exist in india and china
which produce useful silk and some of these are capable of freely
crossing with the common silkmoth as has been recently ascertained in
france captain hutton65 states that throughout the world at least
six species have been domesticated and he believes that the silkmoths
reared in europe belong to two or three species this however is not
the opinion of several capable judges who have particularly attended to
the cultivation of this insect in france and hardly accords with some
facts presently to be given
the common silkmoth bombyx mori was brought to constantinople in
the sixth century whence it was carried into italy and in 1494 into
france66 everything has been favourable for the variation of this
insect it is believed to have been domesticated in china as long ago
as 2700 bc it has been kept under unnatural and diversified
conditions of life and has been transported into many countries there
is reason to believe that the nature of the food given to the
caterpillar influences to a certain extent the character of the
breed67 disuse has apparently aided in checking the development of
the wings but the most important element in the production of the many
now existing much modified races no doubt has been the close
attention which has long been applied in many countries to every
promising variation the care taken in europe in the selection of the
best cocoons and moths for breeding is notorious68 and the
production of eggs is followed as a distinct trade in parts of france
i have made inquiries through dr falconer and am assured that in
india the natives are equally careful in the process of selection in
china the production of eggs is confined to certain favourable
districts and the raisers are precluded by law from producing silk so
that their whole attention may be necessarily given up to this one
object69
the following details on the differences between the several breeds are
taken when not stated to the contrary from m robinets excellent
work70 which bears every sign of care and large experience the
eggs in the different races vary in colour in shape being round
elliptic or oval and in size the eggs laid in june in the south of
france and in july in the central provinces do not hatch until the
following spring and it is in vain says m robinet to expose them to
a temperature gradually raised in order that the caterpillar may be
quickly developed yet occasionally without any known cause batches
of eggs are produced which immediately begin to undergo the proper
changes and are hatched in from twenty to thirty days from these and
some other analogous facts it may be concluded that the trevoltini
silkworms of italy of which the caterpillars are hatched in from
fifteen to twenty days do not necessarily form as has been
maintained a distinct species although the breeds which live in
temperate countries produce eggs which cannot be immediately hatched by
artificial heat yet when they are removed to and reared in a hot
country they gradually acquire the character of quick development as
in the trevoltini races71
caterpillarsthese vary greatly in size and colour the skin is
generally white sometimes mottled with black or grey and occasionally
quite black the colour however as m robinet asserts is not
constant even in perfectly pure breeds except in the race tigre
so called from being marked with transverse black stripes as the
general colour of the caterpillar is not correlated with that of the
silk72 this character is disregarded by cultivators and has not
been fixed by selection captain hutton in the paper before referred
to has argued with much force that the dark tigerlike marks which so
frequently appear during the later moults in the caterpillars of
various breeds are due to reversion for the caterpillars of several
allied wild species of bombyx are marked and coloured in this manner
he separated some caterpillars with the tigerlike marks and in the
succeeding spring pp 149 298 nearly all the caterpillars reared
from them were darkbrindled and the tints became still darker in the
third generation the moths reared from these caterpillars73 also
became darker and resembled in colouring the wild b huttoni on
this view of the tigerlike marks being due to reversion the
persistency with which they are transmitted is intelligible
several years ago mrs whitby took great pains in breeding silkworms on
a large scale and she informed me that some of her caterpillars had
dark eyebrows this is probably the first step in reversion towards the
tigerlike marks and i was curious to know whether so trifling a
character would be inherited at my request she separated in 1848
twenty of these caterpillars and having kept the moths separate bred
from them of the many caterpillars thus reared every one without
exception had eyebrows some darker and more decidedly marked than the
others but all had eyebrows more or less plainly visible black
caterpillars occasionally appear amongst those of the common kind but
in so variable a manner that according to m robinet the same race
will one year exclusively produce white caterpillars and the next year
many black ones nevertheless i have been informed by m a bossi of
geneva that if these black caterpillars are separately bred from
they reproduce the same colour but the cocoons and moths reared from
them do not present any difference
the caterpillar in europe ordinarily moults four times before passing
into the cocoon stage but there are races  trois mues and the
trevoltini race likewise moults only thrice it might have been thought
that so important a physiological difference would not have arisen
under domestication but m robinet74 states that on the one hand
ordinary caterpillars occasionally spin their cocoons after only three
moults and on the other hand presque toutes les races  trois mues
que nous avons exprimentees ont fait quatre mues  la seconde ou  la
troisime anne ce qui semble prouver quil a suffi de les placer dans
des conditions favorables pour leur rendre une facult quelles avaient
perdue sous des influences moins favorables
cocoonsthe caterpillar in changing into the cocoon loses about 50
per cent of its weight but the amount of loss differs in different
breeds and this is of importance to the cultivator the cocoon in the
different races presents characteristic differences being large or
smallnearly spherical with no constriction as in the race de loriol
or cylindrical with either a deep or slight constriction in the
middle with the two ends or with one end alone more or less pointed
the silk varies in fineness and quality and in being nearly white but
of two tints or yellow generally the colour of the silk is not
strictly inherited but in the chapter on selection i shall give a
curious account how in the course of sixtyfive generations the
number of yellow cocoons in one breed has been reduced in france from
one hundred to thirtyfive in the thousand according to robinet the
white race called sina by careful selection during the last
seventyfive years est arrive  un tel tat de puret quon ne voit
pas un seul cocon jaune dans des millions de cocons blancs75
cocoons are sometimes formed as is well known entirely destitute of
silk which yet produce moths unfortunately mrs whitby was prevented
by an accident from ascertaining whether this character would prove
hereditary
adult stagei can find no account of any constant difference in the
moths of the most distinct races mrs whitby assured me that there was
none in the several kinds bred by her and i have received a similar
statement from the eminent naturalist m de quatrefages captain
hutton also says76 that the moths of all kinds vary much in colour
but in nearly the same inconstant manner considering how much the
cocoons in the several races differ this fact is of interest and may
probably be accounted for on the same principle as the fluctuating
variability of colour in the caterpillar namely that there has been
no motive for selecting and perpetuating any particular variation
the males of the wild bombycid fly swiftly in the daytime and
evening but the females are usually very sluggish and inactive77
in several moths of this family the females have abortive wings but no
instance is known of the males being incapable of flight for in this
case the species could hardly have been perpetuated in the silkmoth
both sexes have imperfect crumpled wings and are incapable of flight
but still there is a trace of the characteristic difference in the two
sexes for though on comparing a number of males and females i could
detect no difference in the development of their wings yet i was
assured by mrs whitby that the males of the moths bred by her used
their wings more than the females and could flutter downwards though
never upwards she also states that when the females first emerge from
the cocoon their wings are less expanded than those of the male the
degree of imperfection however in the wings varies much in different
races and under different circumstances m quatrefages78 says that
he has seen a number of moths with their wings reduced to a third
fourth or tenth part of their normal dimensions and even to mere
short straight stumps il me semble quil y a l un vritable arrt de
dveloppement partiel on the other hand he describes the female
moths of the andr jean breed as having leurs ailes larges et tales
un seul prsente quelques courbures irrgulires et des plis anormaux
as moths and butterflies of all kinds reared from wild caterpillars
under confinement often have crippled wings the same cause whatever
it may be has probably acted on silkmoths but the disuse of their
wings during so many generations has it may be suspected likewise
come into play
the moths of many breeds fail to glue their eggs to the surface on
which they are laid79 but this proceeds according to capt
hutton80 merely from the glands of the ovipositor being weakened
as with other longdomesticated animals the instincts of the silkmoth
have suffered the caterpillars when placed on a mulberrytree often
commit the strange mistake of devouring the base of the leaf on which
they are feeding and consequently fall down but they are capable
according to m robinet81 of again crawling up the trunk even this
capacity sometimes fails for m martins82 placed some caterpillars
on a tree and those which fell were not able to remount and perished
of hunger they were even incapable of passing from leaf to leaf
some of the modifications which the silkmoth has undergone stand in
correlation with one another thus the eggs of the moths which produce
white cocoons and of those which produce yellow cocoons differ slightly
in tint the abdominal feet also of the caterpillars which yield
white cocoons are always white whilst those which give yellow cocoons
are invariably yellow83 we have seen that the caterpillars with dark
tigerlike stripes produce moths which are more darkly shaded than
other moths it seems well established84 that in france the
caterpillars of the races which produce white silk and certain black
caterpillars have resisted better than other races the disease which
has recently devastated the silkdistricts lastly the races differ
constitutionally for some do not succeed so well under a temperate
climate as others and a damp soil does not equally injure all the
races85
from these various facts we learn that silkmoths like the higher
animals vary greatly under longcontinued domestication we learn also
the more important fact that variations may occur at various periods of
life and be inherited at a corresponding period and finally we see
that insects are amenable to the great principle of selection

i shall not enter into so much detail on the variability of cultivated
plants as in the case of domesticated animals the subject is involved
in much difficulty botanists have generally neglected cultivated
varieties as beneath their notice in several cases the wild prototype
is unknown or doubtfully known and in other cases it is hardly
possible to distinguish between escaped seedlings and truly wild
plants so that there is no safe standard of comparison by which to
judge of any supposed amount of change not a few botanists believe
that several of our anciently cultivated plants have become so
profoundly modified that it is not possible now to recognise their
aboriginal parentforms equally perplexing are the doubts whether some
of them are descended from one species or from several inextricably
commingled by crossing and variation variations often pass into and
cannot be distinguished from monstrosities and monstrosities are of
little significance for our purpose many varieties are propagated
solely by grafts buds layers bulbs etc and frequently it is not
known how far their peculiarities can be transmitted by seminal
generation nevertheless some facts of value can be gleaned and other
facts will hereafter be incidentally given one chief object in the two
following chapters is to show how many characters in our cultivated
plants have become variable
before entering on details a few general remarks on the origin of
cultivated plants may be introduced m alph de candolle1 in an
admirable discussion on this subject in which he displays a wonderful
amount of knowledge gives a list of 157 of the most useful cultivated
plants of these he believes that 85 are almost certainly known in
their wild state but on this head other competent judges2 entertain
great doubts of 40 of them the origin is admitted by m de candolle
to be doubtful either from a certain amount of dissimilarity which
they present when compared with their nearest allies in a wild state
or from the probability of the latter not being truly wild plants but
seedlings escaped from culture of the entire 157 32 alone are ranked
by m de candolle as quite unknown in their aboriginal condition but
it should be observed that he does not include in his list several
plants which present illdefined characters namely the various forms
of pumpkins millet sorghum kidneybean dolichos capsicum and
indigo nor does he include flowers and several of the more anciently
cultivated flowers such as certain roses the common imperial lily
the tuberose and even the lilac are said3 not to be known in the
wild state
from the relative numbers above given and from other arguments of much
weight m de candolle concludes that plants have rarely been so much
modified by culture that they cannot be identified with their wild
prototypes but on this view considering that savages probably would
not have chosen rare plants for cultivation that useful plants are
generally conspicuous and that they could not have been the
inhabitants of deserts or of remote and recently discovered islands it
appears strange to me that so many of our cultivated plants should be
still unknown or only doubtfully known in the wild state if on the
other hand many of these plants have been profoundly modified by
culture the difficulty disappears the difficulty would also be
removed if they have been exterminated during the progress of
civilisation but m de candolle has shown that this probably has
seldom occurred as soon as a plant was cultivated in any country the
halfcivilised inhabitants would no longer have need to search the
whole surface of the land for it and thus lead to its extirpation and
even if this did occur during a famine dormant seeds would be left in
the ground in tropical countries the wild luxuriance of nature as was
long ago remarked by humboldt overpowers the feeble efforts of man in
anciently civilised temperate countries where the whole face of the
land has been greatly changed it can hardly be doubted that some
plants have become extinct nevertheless de candolle has shown that all
the plants historically known to have been first cultivated in europe
still exist here in the wild state
mm loiseleurdeslongchamps4 and de candolle have remarked that our
cultivated plants more especially the cereals must originally have
existed in nearly their present state for otherwise they would not
have been noticed and valued as objects of food but these authors
apparently have not considered the many accounts given by travellers of
the wretched food collected by savages i have read an account of the
savages of australia cooking during a dearth many vegetables in
various ways in the hopes of rendering them innocuous and more
nutritious dr hooker found the halfstarved inhabitants of a village
in sikhim suffering greatly from having eaten arumroots5 which they
had pounded and left for several days to ferment so as partially to
destroy their poisonous nature and he adds that they cooked and ate
many other deleterious plants sir andrew smith informs me that in
south africa a large number of fruits and succulent leaves and
especially roots are used in times of scarcity the natives indeed
know the properties of a long catalogue of plants some having been
found during famines to be eatable others injurious to health or even
destructive to life he met a party of baquanas who having been
expelled by the conquering zulus had lived for years on any roots or
leaves which afforded some little nutriment and distended their
stomachs so as to relieve the pangs of hunger they looked like
walking skeletons and suffered fearfully from constipation sir andrew
smith also informs me that on such occasions the natives observe as a
guide for themselves what the wild animals especially baboons and
monkeys eat
from innumerable experiments made through dire necessity by the savages
of every land with the results handed down by tradition the
nutritious stimulating and medicinal properties of the most
unpromising plants were probably first discovered it appears for
instance at first an inexplicable fact that untutored man in three
distant quarters of the world should have discovered amongst a host
of native plants that the leaves of the teaplant and mattee and the
berries of the coffee all included a stimulating and nutritious
essence now known to be chemically the same we can also see that
savages suffering from severe constipation would naturally observe
whether any of the roots which they devoured acted as aperients we
probably owe our knowledge of the uses of almost all plants to man
having originally existed in a barbarous state and having been often
compelled by severe want to try as food almost everything which he
could chew and swallow
from what we know of the habits of savages in many quarters of the
world there is no reason to suppose that our cereal plants originally
existed in their present state so valuable to man let us look to one
continent alone namely africa barth6 states that the slaves over a
large part of the central region regularly collect the seeds of a wild
grass the pennisetum distichum in another district he saw women
collecting the seeds of a poa by swinging a sort of basket through the
rich meadowland near tete livingstone observed the natives
collecting the seeds of a wild grass and farther south as andersson
informs me the natives largely use the seed of a grass of about the
size of canaryseed which they boil in water they eat also the roots
of certain reeds and every one has read of the bushmen prowling about
and digging up with a firehardened stake various roots similar facts
with respect to the collection of seeds of wild grasses in other parts
of the world could be given7
accustomed as we are to our excellent vegetables and luscious fruits
we can hardly persuade ourselves that the stringy roots of the wild
carrot and parsnip or the little shoots of the wild asparagus or
crabs sloes etc should ever have been valued yet from what we
know of the habits of australian and south african savages we need
feel no doubt on this head the inhabitants of switzerland during the
stoneperiod largely collected wild crabs sloes bullaces hips of
roses elderberries beechmast and other wild berries and fruit8
jemmy button a fuegian on board the beagle remarked to me that the
poor and acid blackcurrants of tierra del fuego were too sweet for his
taste
the savage inhabitants of each land having found out by many and hard
trials what plants were useful or could be rendered useful by various
cooking processes would after a time take the first step in
cultivation by planting them near their usual abodes livingstone9
states that the savage batokas sometimes left wild fruittrees standing
in their gardens and occasionally even planted them a practice seen
nowhere else amongst the natives but du chaillu saw a palm and some
other wild fruittrees which had been planted and these trees were
considered private property the next step in cultivation and this
would require but little forethought would be to sow the seeds of
useful plants and as the soil near the hovels of the natives10 would
often be in some degree manured improved varieties would sooner or
later arise or a wild and unusually good variety of a native plant
might attract the attention of some wise old savage and he would
transplant it or sow its seed that superior varieties of wild
fruittrees occasionally are found is certain as in the case of the
american species of hawthorns plums cherries grapes and hickories
specified by professor asa gray11 downing also refers to certain
wild varieties of the hickory as being of much larger size and finer
flavour than the common species i have referred to american
fruittrees because we are not in this case troubled with doubts
whether or not the varieties are seedlings which have escaped from
cultivation transplanting any superior variety or sowing its seeds
hardly implies more forethought than might be expected at an early and
rude period of civilisation even the australian barbarians have a law
that no plant bearing seeds is to be dug up after it has flowered and
sir g grey12 never saw this law evidently framed for the
preservation of the plant violated we see the same spirit in the
superstitious belief of the fuegians that killing waterfowl whilst
very young will be followed by much rain snow blow much13 i may
add as showing forethought in the lowest barbarians that the fuegians
when they find a stranded whale bury large portions in the sand and
during the oftenrecurrent famines travel from great distances for the
remnants of the halfputrid mass
it has often been remarked1 that we do not owe a single useful plant
to australia or the cape of good hope countries abounding to an
unparalleled degree with endemic speciesor to new zealand or to
america south of the plata and according to some authors not to
america northward of mexico i do not believe that any edible or
valuable plant except the canarygrass has been derived from an
oceanic or uninhabited island if nearly all our useful plants natives
of europe asia and south america had originally existed in their
present condition the complete absence of similarly useful plants in
the great countries just named would be indeed a surprising fact but
if these plants have been so greatly modified and improved by culture
as no longer closely to resemble any natural species we can understand
why the abovenamed countries have given us no useful plants for they
were either inhabited by men who did not cultivate the ground at all
as in australia and the cape of good hope or who cultivated it very
imperfectly as in some parts of america these countries do yield
plants which are useful to savage man and dr hooker15 enumerates no
less than 107 such species in australia alone but these plants have
not been improved and consequently cannot compete with those which
have been cultivated and improved during thousands of years in the
civilised world
the case of new zealand to which fine island we as yet owe no widely
cultivated plant may seem opposed to this view for when first
discovered the natives cultivated several plants but all inquirers
believe in accordance with the traditions of the natives that the
early polynesian colonists brought with them seeds and roots as well
as the dog which had been wisely preserved during their long voyage
the polynesians are so frequently lost on the ocean that this degree of
prudence would occur to any wandering party hence the early colonists
of new zealand like the later european colonists would not have had
any strong inducement to cultivate the aboriginal plants according to
de candolle we owe thirtythree useful plants to mexico peru and
chile nor is this surprising when we remember the civilised state of
the inhabitants as shown by the fact of their having practised
artificial irrigation and made tunnels through hard rocks without the
use of iron or gunpowder and who as we shall see in a future chapter
fully recognised as far as animals were concerned and therefore
probably in the case of plants the important principle of selection
we owe some plants to brazil and the early voyagers namely vespucius
and cabral describe the country as thickly peopled and cultivated in
north america16 the natives cultivated maize pumpkins gourds
beans and peas all different from ours and tobacco and we are
hardly justified in assuming that none of our present plants are
descended from these north american forms had north america been
civilised for as long a period and as thickly peopled as asia or
europe it is probable that the native vines walnuts mulberries
crabs and plums would have given rise after a long course of
cultivation to a multitude of varieties some extremely different from
their parentstocks and escaped seedlings would have caused in the
new as in the old world much perplexity with respect to their
specific distinctness and parentage17
cerealiai will now enter on details the cereals cultivated in
europe consist of four generawheat rye barley and oats of wheat
the best modern authorities18 make four or five or even seven
distinct species of rye one of barley three and of oats two
three or four species so that altogether our cereals are ranked by
different authors under from ten to fifteen distinct species these
have given rise to a multitude of varieties it is a remarkable fact
that botanists are not universally agreed on the aboriginal parentform
of any one cereal plant for instance a high authority writes in
185519 we ourselves have no hesitation in stating our conviction
as the result of all the most reliable evidence that none of these
cerealia exist or have existed truly wild in their present state but
that all are cultivated varieties of species now growing in great
abundance in s europe or w asia on the other hand alph de
candolle20 has adduced abundant evidence that common wheat triticum
vulgare has been found wild in various parts of asia where it is not
likely to have escaped from cultivation and there is some force in m
godrons remark that supposing these plants to be escaped
seedlings21 as they have propagated themselves in a wild state for
several generations their continued resemblance to cultivated wheat
renders it probable that the latter has retained its aboriginal
character but the strong tendency to inheritance which most of the
varieties of wheat evince as we shall presently see is here greatly
undervalued much weight must also be attributed to a remark by
professor hildebrand22 that when the seeds or fruit of cultivated
plants possess qualities disadvantageous to them as a means of
distribution we may feel almost sure that they no longer retain their
aboriginal condition on the other hand m de candolle insists
strongly on the frequent occurrence in the austrian dominions of rye
and of one kind of oats in an apparently wild condition with the
exception of these two cases which however are rather doubtful and
with the exception of two forms of wheat and one of barley which he
believes to have been found truly wild m de candolle does not seem
fully satisfied with the other reported discoveries of the parentforms
of our other cereals with respect to oats according to mr
buckmann23 the wild english avena fatua can be converted by a few
years of careful cultivation and selection into forms almost identical
with two very distinct cultivated races the whole subject of the
origin and specific distinctness of the various cereal plants is a most
difficult one but we shall perhaps be able to judge a little better
after considering the amount of variation which wheat has undergone
metzger describes seven species of wheat godron refers to five and de
candolle to only four it is not improbable that besides the kinds
known in europe other strongly characterised forms exist in the more
distant parts of the world for loiseleurdeslongchamps24 speaks of
three new species or varieties sent to europe in 1822 from chinese
mongolia which he considers as being there indigenous moorcroft25
also speaks of hasora wheat in ladakh as very peculiar if those
botanists are right who believe that at least seven species of wheat
originally existed then the amount of variation in any important
character which wheat has undergone under cultivation has been slight
but if only four or a lesser number of species originally existed then
it is evident that varieties have arisen so strongly marked that they
have been considered by capable judges as specifically distinct but
the impossibility of deciding which forms ought to be ranked as species
and which as varieties makes it useless to specify in detail the
differences between the various kinds of wheat speaking generally the
organs of vegetation differ little26 but some kinds grow close and
upright whilst others spread and trail along the ground the straw
differs in being more or less hollow and in quality the ears27
differ in colour and in shape being quadrangular compressed or
nearly cylindrical and the florets differ in their approximation to
each other in their pubescence and in being more or less elongated
the presence or absence of barbs is a conspicuous difference and in
certain gramine serves even as a generic character28 although as
remarked by godron29 the presence of barbs is variable in certain
wild grasses and especially in those such as bromus secalinus and
lolium temulentum which habitually grow mingled with our cereal
crops and which have thus unintentionally been exposed to culture the
grains differ in size weight and colour in being more or less downy
at one end in being smooth or wrinkled in being either nearly
globular oval or elongated and finally in internal texture being
tender or hard or even almost horny and in the proportion of gluten
which they contain
nearly all the races or species of wheat vary as godron30 has
remarked in an exactly parallel mannerin the seed being downy or
glabrous and in colourand in the florets being barbed or not barbed
etc those who believe that all the kinds are descended from a single
wild species may account for this parallel variation by the inheritance
of a similar constitution and a consequent tendency to vary in the
same manner and those who believe in the general theory of descent
with modification may extend this view to the several species of wheat
if such ever existed in a state of nature
although few of the varieties of wheat present any conspicuous
difference their number is great dalbret cultivated during thirty
years from 150 to 160 kinds and excepting in the quality of the grain
they all kept true colonel le couteur possessed upwards of 150 and
philippar 322 varieties31 as wheat is an annual we thus see how
strictly many trifling differences in character are inherited through
many generations colonel le couteur insists strongly on this same
fact in his persevering and successful attempts to raise new
varieties he found that there was only one secure mode to ensure the
growth of pure sorts namely to grow them from single grains or from
single ears and to follow up the plan by afterwards sowing only the
produce of the most productive so as to form a stock but major
hallett32 has gone much farther and by the continued selection of
plants from the grains of the same ear during successive generations
has made his pedigree in wheat and other cereals now famous in many
quarters of the world the great amount of variability in the plants of
the same variety is another interesting point which would never have
been detected except by an eye long practised to the work thus colonel
le couteur relates33 that in a field of his own wheat which he
considered at least as pure as that of any of his neighbours professor
la gasca found twentythree sorts and professor henslow has observed
similar facts besides such individual variations forms sufficiently
well marked to be valued and to become widely cultivated sometimes
suddenly appear thus mr shirreff has had the good fortune to raise in
his lifetime seven new varieties which are now extensively grown in
many parts of britain34
as in the case of many other plants some varieties both old and new
are far more constant in character than others colonel le couteur was
forced to reject some of his new subvarieties which he suspected had
been produced from a cross as incorrigibly sportive on the other hand
major hallett35 has shown how wonderfully constant some varieties
are although not ancient ones and although cultivated in various
countries with respect to the tendency to vary metzger36 gives from
his own experience some interesting facts he describes three spanish
subvarieties more especially one known to be constant in spain which
in germany assumed their proper character only during hot summers
another variety kept true only in good land but after having been
cultivated for twentyfive years became more constant he mentions two
other subvarieties which were at first inconstant but subsequently
became apparently without any selection accustomed to their new
homes and retained their proper character these facts show what small
changes in the conditions of life cause variability and they further
show that a variety may become habituated to new conditions one is at
first inclined to conclude with loiseleurdeslongchamps that wheat
cultivated in the same country is exposed to remarkably uniform
conditions but manures differ seed is taken from one soil to another
and what is far more important the plants are exposed as little as
possible to struggle with other plants and are thus enabled to exist
under diversified conditions in a state of nature each plant is
confined to that particular station and kind of nutriment which it can
seize from the other plants by which it is surrounded
wheat quickly assumes new habits of life the summer and winter kinds
were classed by linnus as distinct species but m monnier37 has
proved that the difference between them is only temporary he sowed
winterwheat in spring and out of one hundred plants four alone
produced ripe seeds these were sown and resown and in three years
plants were reared which ripened all their seed conversely nearly all
the plants raised from summerwheat which was sown in autumn perished
from frost but a few were saved and produced seed and in three years
this summervariety was converted into a wintervariety hence it is
not surprising that wheat soon becomes to a certain extent
acclimatised and that seed brought from distant countries and sown in
europe vegetates at first or even for a considerable period38
differently from our european varieties in canada the first settlers
according to kalm39 found their winters too severe for winterwheat
brought from france and their summers often too short for
summerwheat and they thought that their country was useless for corn
crops until they procured summerwheat from the northern parts of
europe which succeeded well it is notorious that the proportion of
gluten differs much under different climates the weight of the grain
is also quickly affected by climate loiseleurdeslongchamps40 sowed
near paris 54 varieties obtained from the south of france and from the
black sea and 52 of these yielded seed from 10 to 40 per cent heavier
than the parentseed he then sent these heavier grains back to the
south of france but there they immediately yielded lighter seed
all those who have closely attended to the subject insist on the close
adaptation of numerous varieties of wheat to various soils and climates
even within the same country thus colonel le couteur41 says it is
the suitableness of each sort to each soil that will enable the farmer
to pay his rent by sowing one variety where he would be unable to do
so by attempting to grow another of a seemingly better sort this may
be in part due to each kind becoming habituated to its conditions of
life as metzger has shown certainly occurs but it is probably in main
part due to innate differences between the several varieties
much has been written on the deterioration of wheat that the quality
of the flour size of grain time of flowering and hardness may be
modified by climate and soil seems nearly certain but that the whole
body of any one subvariety ever becomes changed into another and
distinct subvariety there is no reason to believe what apparently
does take place according to le couteur42 is that some one
subvariety out of the many which may always be detected in the same
field is more prolific than the others and gradually supplants the
variety which was first sown
with respect to the natural crossing of distinct varieties the evidence
is conflicting but preponderates against its frequent occurrence many
authors maintain that impregnation takes place in the closed flower
but i am sure from my own observation that this is not the case at
least with those varieties to which i have attended but as i shall
have to discuss this subject in another work it may be here passed
over
in conclusion all authors admit that numerous varieties of wheat have
arisen but their differences are unimportant unless indeed some of
the socalled species are ranked as varieties those who believe that
from four to seven wild species of triticum originally existed in
nearly the same condition as at present rest their belief chiefly on
the great antiquity of the several forms43 it is an important fact
which we have recently learnt from the admirable researches of
heer44 that the inhabitants of switzerland even so early as the
neolithic period cultivated no less than ten cereal plants namely
five kinds of wheat of which at least four are commonly looked at as
distinct species three kinds of barley a panicum and a setaria if
it could be shown that at the earliest dawn of agriculture five kinds
of wheat and three of barley had been cultivated we should of course
be compelled to look at these forms as distinct species but as heer
has remarked agriculture even at the neolithic period had already
made considerable progress for besides the cereals peas poppies
flax and apparently apples were cultivated it may also be inferred
from one variety of wheat being the so called egyptian and from what
is known of the native country of the panicum and setaria as well as
from the nature of the weeds which then grew mingled with the crops
that the lakeinhabitants either still kept up commercial intercourse
with some southern people or had originally proceeded as colonists from
the south
loiseleurdeslongchamps45 has argued that if our cereal plants have
been greatly modified by cultivation the weeds which habitually grow
mingled with them would have been equally modified but this argument
shows how completely the principle of selection has been overlooked
that such weeds have not varied or at least do not vary now in any
extreme degree is the opinion of mr h c watson and professor asa
gray as they inform me but who will pretend to say that they do not
vary as much as the individual plants of the same subvariety of wheat
we have already seen that pure varieties of wheat cultivated in the
same field offer many slight variations which can be selected and
separately propagated and that occasionally more strongly pronounced
variations appear which as mr shirreff has proved are well worthy
of extensive cultivation not until equal attention be paid to the
variability and selection of weeds can the argument from their
constancy under unintentional culture be of any value in accordance
with the principles of selection we can understand how it is that in
the several cultivated varieties of wheat the organs of vegetation
differ so little for if a plant with peculiar leaves appeared it
would be neglected unless the grains of corn were at the same time
superior in quality or size the selection of seedcorn was strongly
recommended46 in ancient times by columella and celsus and as virgil
says
      ive seen the largest seeds tho viewd with care
      degenerate unless th industrious hand
      did yearly cull the largest
but whether in ancient times selection was methodically pursued we may
well doubt when we hear how laborious the work has been found by le
coutour and hallett although the principle of selection is so
important yet the little which man has effected by incessant
efforts47 during thousands of years in rendering the plants more
productive or the grains more nutritious than they were in the time of
the old egyptians would seem to speak strongly against its efficacy
but we must not forget that at each successive period the state of
agriculture and the quantity of manure supplied to the land will have
determined the maximum degree of productiveness for it would be
impossible to cultivate a highly productive variety unless the land
contained a sufficient supply of the necessary chemical elements
we now know that man was sufficiently civilised to cultivate the ground
at an immensely remote period so that wheat might have been improved
long ago up to that standard of excellence which was possible under the
then existing state of agriculture one small class of facts supports
this view of the slow and gradual improvement of our cereals in the
most ancient lakehabitations of switzerland when men employed only
flinttools the most extensively cultivated wheat was a peculiar kind
with remarkably small ears and grains48 whilst the grains of the
modern forms are in section from seven to eight millimetres in length
the larger grains from the lakehabitations are six seldom seven and
the smaller ones only four the ear is thus much narrower and the
spikelets stand out more horizontally than in our present forms so
again with barley the most ancient and most extensively cultivated
kind had small ears and the grains were smaller shorter and nearer
to each other than in that now grown without the husk they were 2
lines long and scarcely 1 broad whilst those now grown have a length
of three lines and almost the same in breadth49 these
smallgrained varieties of wheat and barley are believed by heer to be
the parentforms of certain existing allied varieties which have
supplanted their early progenitors
heer gives an interesting account of the first appearance and final
disappearance of the several plants which were cultivated in greater or
less abundance in switzerland during former successive periods and
which generally differed more or less from our existing varieties the
peculiar smalleared and smallgrained wheat already alluded to was
the commonest kind during the stone period it lasted down to the
helveticoroman age and then became extinct a second kind was rare at
first but afterwards became more frequent a third the egyptian wheat
t turgidum does not agree exactly with any existing variety and
was rare during the stone period a fourth kind t dicoccum differs
from all known varieties of this form a fifth kind t monococcum
is known to have existed during the stone period only by the presence
of a single ear a sixth kind the common t spelta was not
introduced into switzerland until the bronze age of barley besides
the shorteared and smallgrained kind two others were cultivated one
of which was very scarce and resembled our present common h
distichum during the bronze age rye and oats were introduced the
oatgrains being somewhat smaller than those produced by our existing
varieties the poppy was largely cultivated during the stone period
probably for its oil but the variety which then existed is not now
known a peculiar pea with small seeds lasted from the stone to the
bronze age and then became extinct whilst a peculiar bean likewise
having small seeds came in at the bronze period and lasted to the time
of the romans these details sound like the descriptions given by
palontologists of the first appearance the increasing rarity and
final extinction or modification of fossil species embedded in the
successive stages of a geological formation
finally every one must judge for himself whether it is more probable
that the several forms of wheat barley rye and oats are descended
from between ten and fifteen species most of which are now either
unknown or extinct or whether they are descended from between four and
eight species which may have either closely resembled our present
cultivated forms or have been so widely different as to escape
identification in this latter case we must conclude that man
cultivated the cereals at an enormously remote period and that he
formerly practised some degree of selection which in itself is not
improbable we may perhaps further believe that when wheat was first
cultivated the ears and grains increased quickly in size in the same
manner as the roots of the wild carrot and parsnip are known to
increase quickly in bulk under cultivation
maize or indian corn zea maysbotanists are nearly unanimous that
all the cultivated kinds belong to the same species it is
undoubtedly50 of american origin and was grown by the aborigines
throughout the continent from new england to chili its cultivation
must have been extremely ancient for tschudi51 describes two kinds
now extinct or not known in peru which were taken from tombs
apparently prior to the dynasty of the incas but there is even
stronger evidence of antiquity for i found on the coast of peru52
heads of maize together with eighteen species of recent seashell
embedded in a beach which had been upraised at least 85 feet above the
level of the sea in accordance with this ancient cultivation numerous
american varieties have arisen the aboriginal form has not as yet been
discovered in the wild state a peculiar kind53 in which the grains
instead of being naked are concealed by husks as much as eleven lines
in length has been stated but on insufficient evidence to grow wild
in brazil it is almost certain that the aboriginal form would have had
its grains thus protected54 but the seeds of the brazilian variety
produce as i hear from professor asa gray and as is stated in two
published accounts either common or husked maize and it is not
credible that a wild species when first cultivated should vary so
quickly and in so great a degree
maize has varied in an extraordinary and conspicuous manner
metzger55 who paid particular attention to the cultivation of this
plant makes twelve races unterart with numerous subvarieties of
the latter some are tolerably constant others quite inconstant the
different races vary in height from 1518 feet to only 1618 inches as
in a dwarf variety described by bonafous the whole ear is variable in
shape being long and narrow or short and thick or branched the ear
in one variety is more than four times as long as in a dwarf kind the
seeds are arranged in the ear in from six to even twenty rows or are
placed irregularly the seeds are colouredwhite paleyellow orange
red violet or elegantly streaked with black56 and in the same ear
there are sometimes seeds of two colours in a small collection i found
that a single grain of one variety nearly equalled in weight seven
grains of another variety the shape of the seed varies greatly being
very flat or nearly globular or oval broader than long or longer
than broad without any point or produced into a sharp tooth and this
tooth is sometimes recurved one variety the rugosa of bonafous and
which is extensively cultivated in the united states as sweet corn has
its seeds curiously wrinkled giving to the whole ear a singular
appearance another variety the cymosa of bon carries its ears so
crowded together that it is called mas  bouquet the seeds of some
varieties contain much glucose instead of starch male flowers
sometimes appear amongst the female flowers and mr j scott has
lately observed the rarer case of female flowers on a true male
panicle and likewise hermaphrodite flowers57 azara describes58 a
variety in paraguay the grains of which are very tender and he states
that several varieties are fitted for being cooked in various ways the
varieties also differ greatly in precocity and have different powers
of resisting dryness and the action of violent wind59 some of the
foregoing differences would certainly be considered of specific value
with plants in a state of nature
le comte r states that the grains of all the varieties which he
cultivated ultimately assumed a yellow colour but bonafous60 found
that most of those which he sowed for ten consecutive years kept true
to their proper tints and he adds that in the valleys of the pyrenees
and on the plains of piedmont a white maize has been cultivated for
more than a century and has undergone no change
the tall kinds grown in southern latitudes and therefore exposed to
great heat require from six to seven months to ripen their seed
whereas the dwarf kinds grown in northern and colder climates require
only from three to four months61 peter kalm62 who particularly
attended to this plant says that in the united states in proceeding
from south to north the plants steadily diminish in bulk seeds
brought from lat 37 in virginia and sown in lat 4344 in new
england produce plants which will not ripen their seed or ripen them
with the utmost difficulty so it is with seed carried from new england
to lat 4547 in canada by taking great care at first the southern
kinds after some years culture ripen their seed perfectly in their
northern homes so that this is an analogous case with that of the
conversion of summer into winter wheat and conversely when tall and
dwarf maize are planted together the dwarf kinds are in full flower
before the others have produced a single flower and in pennsylvania
they ripen their seeds six weeks earlier than the tall maize metzger
also mentions a european maize which ripens its seed four weeks earlier
than another european kind with these facts so plainly showing
inherited acclimatisation we may readily believe kalm who states that
in north america maize and some other plants have gradually been
cultivated further and further northward all writers agree that to
keep the varieties of maize pure they must be planted separately so
that they shall not cross
the effects of the climate of europe on the american varieties is
highly remarkable metzger obtained seed from various parts of america
and cultivated several kinds in germany i will give an abstract of the
changes observed63 in one case namely with a tall kind
breitkorniger mais zea altissima brought from the warmer parts of
america during the first year the plants were twelve feet high and a
few seeds were perfected the lower seeds in the ear kept true to their
proper form but the upper seeds became slightly changed in the second
generation the plants were from nine to ten feet in height and ripened
their seed better the depression on the outer side of the seed had
almost disappeared and the original beautiful white colour had become
duskier some of the seeds had even become yellow and in their now
rounded form they approached common european maize in the third
generation nearly all resemblance to the original and very distinct
american parentform was lost in the sixth generation this maize
perfectly resembled a european variety described as the second
subvariety of the fifth race when metzger published his book this
variety was still cultivated near heidelberg and could be
distinguished from the common kind only by a somewhat more vigorous
growth analogous results were obtained by the cultivation of another
american race the whitetooth corn in which the tooth nearly
disappeared even in the second generation a third race the
chickencorn did not undergo so great a change but the seeds became
less polished and pellucid in the above cases the seeds were carried
from a warm to a colder climate but fritz mller informs me that a
dwarf variety with small rounded seeds papagaienmais introduced
from germany into s brazil produces plants as tall with seeds as
flat as those of the kind commonly cultivated there
these facts afford the most remarkable instance known to me of the
direct and prompt action of climate on a plant it might have been
expected that the tallness of the stem the period of vegetation and
the ripening of the seed would have been thus affected but it is a
much more surprising fact that the seeds should have undergone so rapid
and great a change as however flowers with their product the seed
are formed by the metamorphosis of the stem and leaves any
modification in these latter organs would be apt to extend through
correlation to the organs of fructification
cabbage brassica oleraceaevery one knows how greatly the various
kinds of cabbage differ in appearance in the island of jersey from
the effects of particular culture and of climate a stalk has grown to
the height of sixteen feet and had its spring shoots at the top
occupied by a magpies nest the woody stems are not unfrequently from
ten to twelve feet in height and are there used as rafters64 and as
walkingsticks we are thus reminded that in certain countries plants
belonging to the generally herbaceous order of the crucifer are
developed into trees every one can appreciate the difference between
green or red cabbages with great single heads brusselsprouts with
numerous little heads broccolis and cauliflowers with the greater
number of their flowers in an aborted condition incapable of producing
seed and borne in a dense corymb instead of an open panicle savoys
with their blistered and wrinkled leaves and borecoles and kails
which come nearest to the wild parentform there are also various
frizzled and laciniated kinds some of such beautiful colours that
vilmorin in his catalogue of 1851 enumerates ten varieties which are
valued solely for ornament some kinds are less commonly known such as
the portuguese couve tronchuda with the ribs of its leaves greatly
thickened and the kohlrabi or chouxraves with their stems enlarged
into great turniplike masses above the ground and the recently formed
new race65 of the chouxraves already including nine subvarieties
in which the enlarged part lies beneath the ground like a turnip
although we see such great differences in the shape size colour
arrangement and manner of growth of the leaves and stem and of the
flowerstems in the broccoli and cauliflower it is remarkable that the
flowers themselves the seedpods and seeds present extremely slight
differences or none at all66 i compared the flowers of all the
principal kinds those of the couve tronchuda are white and rather
smaller than in common cabbages those of the portsmouth broccoli have
narrower sepals and smaller less elongated petals and in no other
cabbage could any difference be detected with respect to the
seedpods in the purple kohlrabi alone do they differ being a little
longer and narrower than usual i made a collection of the seeds of
twentyeight different kinds and most of them were undistinguishable
when there was any difference it was excessively slight thus the
seeds of various broccolis and cauliflowers when seen in mass are a
little redder those of the early green ulm savoy are rather smaller
and those of the breda kail slightly larger than usual but not larger
than the seeds of the wild cabbage from the coast of wales what a
contrast in the amount of difference is presented if on the one hand
we compare the leaves and stems of the various kinds of cabbage with
their flowers pods and seeds and on the other hand the corresponding
parts in the varieties of maize and wheat the explanation is obvious
the seeds alone are valued in our cereals and their variations have
been selected whereas the seeds seedpods and flowers have been
utterly neglected in the cabbage whilst many useful variations in
their leaves and stems have been noticed and preserved from an
extremely remote period for cabbages were cultivated by the old
celts67
it would be useless to give a classified description68 of the
numerous races subraces and varieties of the cabbage but it may be
mentioned that dr lindley has lately proposed69 a system founded on
the state of development of the terminal and lateral leafbuds thus
i all the leafbuds active and open as in the wildcabbage kail
etc ii all the leafbuds active but forming heads as in
brusselsprouts etc iii terminal leafbud alone active forming a
head as in common cabbages savoys etc iv terminal leafbud alone
active and open with most of the flowers abortive and succulent as
in the cauliflower and broccoli v all the leafbuds active and open
with most of the flowers abortive and succulent as in the
sproutingbroccoli this latter variety is a new one and bears the
same relation to common broccoli as brusselsprouts do to common
cabbages it suddenly appeared in a bed of common broccoli and was
found faithfully to transmit its newlyacquired and remarkable
characters
the principal kinds of cabbage existed at least as early as the
sixteenth century70 so that numerous modifications of structure have
been inherited for a long period this fact is the more remarkable as
great care must be taken to prevent the crossing of the different
kinds to give proof of this i raised 233 seedlings from cabbages of
different kinds which had purposely been planted near each other and
of the seedlings no less than 155 were plainly deteriorated and
mongrelised nor were the remaining 78 all perfectly true it may be
doubted whether many permanent varieties have been formed by
intentional or accidental crosses for such crossed plants are found to
be very inconstant one kind however called cottagers kail has
lately been produced by crossing common kail and brusselsprouts
recrossed with purple broccoli71 and is said to be true but plants
raised by me were not nearly so constant in character as any common
kind of cabbage
although most of the kinds keep true if carefully preserved from
crossing yet the seedbeds must be yearly examined and a few
seedlings are generally found false but even in this case the force of
inheritance is shown for as metzger has remarked72 when speaking of
brusselsprouts the variations generally keep to their unter art or
main race but in order that any kind may be truly propagated there
must be no great change in the conditions of life thus cabbages will
not form heads in hot countries and the same thing has been observed
with an english variety grown during an extremely warm and damp autumn
near paris73 extremely poor soil also affects the characters of
certain varieties
most authors believe that all the races are descended from the wild
cabbage found on the western shores of europe but alph de
candolle74 forcibly argues on historical and other grounds that it
is more probable that two or three closely allied forms generally
ranked as distinct species still living in the mediterranean region
are the parents now all commingled together of the various cultivated
kinds in the same manner as we have often seen with domesticated
animals the supposed multiple origin of the cabbage throws no light on
the characteristic differences between the cultivated forms if our
cabbages are the descendants of three or four distinct species every
trace of any sterility which may originally have existed between them
is now lost for none of the varieties can be kept distinct without
scrupulous care to prevent intercrossing
the other cultivated forms of the genus brassica are descended
according to the view adopted by godron and metzger75 from two
species b napus and rapa but according to other botanists from
three species whilst others again strongly suspect that all these
forms both wild and cultivated ought to be ranked as a single
species brassica napus has given rise to two large groups namely
swedish turnips believed to be of hybrid origin76 and colzas the
seeds of which yield oil brassica rapa of koch has also given rise
to two races namely common turnips and the oilgiving rape the
evidence is unusually clear that these latter plants though so
different in external appearance belong to the same species for the
turnip has been observed by koch and godron to lose its thick roots in
uncultivated soil and when rape and turnips are sown together they
cross to such a degree that scarcely a single plant comes true77
metzger by culture converted the biennial or winter rape into the
annual or summer rapevarieties which have been thought by some
authors to be specifically distinct78
in the production of large fleshy turniplike stems we have a case
of analogous variation in three forms which are generally considered as
distinct species but scarcely any modification seems so easily
acquired as a succulent enlargement of the stem or rootthat is a
store of nutriment laid up for the plants own future use we see this
in our radishes beet and in the less generally known turniprooted
celery and in the finocchio or italian variety of the common fennel
mr buckman has lately proved by his interesting experiments bow
quickly the roots of the wild parsnip can be enlarged as vilmorin
formerly proved in the case of the carrot79
this latter plant in its cultivated state differs in scarcely any
character from the wild english carrot except in general luxuriance
and in the size and quality of its roots but ten varieties differing
in the colour shape and quality of the root are cultivated in
england and come true by seed80 hence with the carrot as in so many
other cases for instance with the numerous varieties and subvarieties
of the radish that part of the plant which is valued by man falsely
appears alone to have varied the truth is that variations in this part
alone have been selected and the seedlings inheriting a tendency to
vary in the same way analogous modifications have been again and again
selected until at last a great amount of change has been effected
with respect to the radish m carrire by sowing the seed of the wild
raphanus raphanistrum in rich soil and by continued selection during
several generations raised many varieties closely like the cultivated
radish r sativus in their roots as well as the wonderful chinese
variety r caudatus see journal dagriculture pratique tom i
1869 p 159 also a separate essay origine des plantes domestiques
1869 raphanus raphanistrum and sativus have often been ranked as
distinct species and owing to differences in their fruit even as
distinct genera but professor hoffman bot zeitung 1872 p 482
has now shown that these differences remarkable as they are graduate
away the fruit of r caudatus being intermediate by cultivating r
raphanistrum during several generations ibid 1873 p 9 professor
hoffman also obtained plants bearing fruits like those of r sativus
pea pisum sativummost botanists look at the gardenpea as
specifically distinct from the fieldpea p arvense the latter
exists in a wild state in southern europe but the aboriginal parent of
the gardenpea has been found by one collector alone as he states in
the crimea81 andrew knight crossed as i am informed by the rev a
fitch the fieldpea with a wellknown garden variety the prussian
pea and the cross seems to have been perfectly fertile dr alefield
has recently studied82 the genus with care and after having
cultivated about fifty varieties concludes that certainly they all
belong to the same species it is an interesting fact already alluded
to that according to o heer83 the peas found in the
lakehabitations of switzerland of the stone and bronze ages belong to
an extinct variety with exceedingly small seeds allied to p
arvense or the fieldpea the varieties of the common gardenpea are
numerous and differ considerably from one another for comparison i
planted at the same time fortyone english and french varieties they
differed greatly in height namely from between 6 and 12 inches to 8
feet84in manner of growth and in period of maturity some differ
in general aspect even while only two or three inches in height the
stems of the prussian pea are much branched the tall kinds have
larger leaves than the dwarf kinds but not in strict proportion to
their heighthairs dwarf monmouth has very large leaves and the
pois nain hatif and the moderately tall  blue prussian have
leaves about twothirds of the size of the tallest kind in the
danecroft the leaflets are rather small and a little pointed in the
queen of dwarfs rather rounded and in the queen of england broad
and large in these three peas the slight differences in the shape of
the leaves are accompanied by slight differences in colour in the
pois gant sans parchemin which bears purple flowers the leaflets
in the young plant are edged with red and in all the peas with purple
flowers the stipules are marked with red
in the different varieties one two or several flowers in a small
cluster are borne on the same peduncle and this is a difference which
is considered of specific value in some of the leguminos in all the
varieties the flowers closely resemble each other except in colour and
size they are generally white sometimes purple but the colour is
inconstant even in the same variety in warners emperor which is a
tall kind the flowers are nearly double the size of the pois nain
hatif but hairs dwarf monmouth which has large leaves likewise
has large flowers the calyx in the victoria marrow is large and in
bishops long pod the sepals are rather narrow in no other kind is
there any difference in the flower
the pods and seeds which with natural species afford such constant
characters differ greatly in the cultivated varieties of the pea and
these are the valuable and consequently the selected parts sugar
peas or p are remarkable from their thin pods which whilst
young are cooked and eaten whole and in this group which according
to mr gordon includes eleven subvarieties it is the pod which
differs most thus lewiss negropodded pea has a straight broad
smooth and darkpurple pod with the husk not so thin as in the other
kinds the pod of another variety is extremely bowed that of the pois
gant is much pointed at the extremity and in the variety  grands
cosses the peas are seen through the husk in so conspicuous a manner
that the pod especially when dry can hardly at first be recognised as
that of a pea
in the ordinary varieties the pods also differ much in sizein colour
that of woodfords green marrow being brightgreen when dry instead
of pale brown and that of the purplepodded pea being expressed by its
namein smoothness that of danecroft being remarkably glossy
whereas that of the ne plus ultra is rugged in being either nearly
cylindrical or broad and flatin being pointed at the end as in
thurstons reliance or much truncated as in the american dwarf
in the auvergne pea the whole end of the pod is bowed upwards in the
queen of the dwarfs and in scimitar peas the pod is almost elliptic
in shape i here give drawings of the four most distinct pods produced
by the plants cultivated by me
illustration fig 41pods of the common pea
in the pea itself we have every tint between almost pure white brown
yellow and intense green in the varieties of the sugar peas we have
these same tints together with red passing through fine purple into a
dark chocolate tint these colours are either uniform or distributed in
dots stri or mosslike marks they depend in some cases on the
colour of the cotyledons seen through the skin and in other cases on
the outer coats of the pea itself in the different varieties the pods
contain according to mr gordon from eleven or twelve to only four or
five peas the largest peas are nearly twice as much in diameter as the
smallest and the latter are not always borne by the most dwarfed
kinds peas differ much in shape being smooth and spherical smooth
and oblong nearly oval in the queen of the dwarfs and nearly
cubical and crumpled in many of the larger kinds
with respect to the value of the differences between the chief
varieties it cannot be doubted that if one of the tall sugarpeas
with purple flowers thinskinned pods of an extraordinary shape
including large darkpurple peas grew wild by the side of the lowly
queen of the dwarfs with white flowers greyishgreen rounded
leaves scimitarlike pods containing oblong smooth palecoloured
peas which became mature at a different season or by the side of one
of the gigantic sorts like the champion of england with leaves of
great size pointed pods and large green crumpled almost cubical
peasall three kinds would be ranked as distinct species
andrew knight85 has observed that the varieties of peas keep very
true because they are not crossed by insects as far as the fact of
keeping true is concerned i hear from mr masters of canterbury well
known as the originator of several new kinds that certain varieties
have remained constant for a considerable timefor instance knights
blue dwarf which came out about the year 182086 but the greater
number of varieties have a singularly short existence thus loudon
remarks87 that sorts which were highly approved in 1821 are now in
1833 nowhere to be found and on comparing the lists of 1833 with
those of 1855 i find that nearly all the varieties have changed mr
masters informs me that the nature of the soil causes some varieties to
lose their character as with other plants certain varieties can be
propagated truly whilst others show a determined tendency to vary
thus two peas differing in shape one round and the other wrinkled
were found by mr masters within the same pod but the plants raised
from the wrinkled kind always evinced a strong tendency to produce
round peas mr masters also raised from a plant of another variety
four distinct subvarieties which bore blue and round white and
round blue and wrinkled and white and wrinkled peas and although he
sowed these four varieties separately during several successive years
each kind always reproduced all four kinds mixed together
with respect to the varieties not naturally intercrossing i have
ascertained that the pea which in this respect differs from some other
leguminos is perfectly fertile without the aid of insects yet i have
seen humblebees whilst sucking the nectar depress the keelpetals and
become so thickly dusted with pollen that it could hardly fail to be
left on the stigma of the next flower which was visited nevertheless
distinct varieties growing closely together rarely cross and i have
reason to believe that this is due to their stigmas being prematurely
fertilised in this country by pollen from the same flower the
horticulturists who raise seedpeas are thus enabled to plant distinct
varieties close together without any bad consequences and it is
certain as i have myself found that true seed may be saved during at
least several generations under these circumstances88 mr fitch
raised as he informs me one variety for twenty years and it always
came true though grown close to other varieties from the analogy of
kidneybeans i should have expected89 that varieties thus
circumstanced would have occasionally crossed and i shall give in the
eleventh chapter two cases of this having occurred as shown in a
manner hereafter to be explained by the pollen of the one variety
having acted directly on the seeds of the other whether many of the
new varieties which incessantly appear are due to such occasional and
accidental crosses i do not know nor do i know whether the short
existence of almost all the numerous varieties is the result of mere
change of fashion or of their having a weak constitution from being
the product of longcontinued selffertilisation it may however be
noticed that several of andrew knights varieties which have endured
longer than most kinds were raised towards the close of the last
century by artificial crosses some of them i believe were still
vigorous in 1860 but now in 1865 a writer speaking90 of knights
four kinds of marrows says they have acquired a famous history but
their glory has departed
with respect to beans faba vulgaris i will say but little dr
alefield has given91 short diagnostic characters of forty varieties
everyone who has seen a collection must have been struck with the great
difference in shape thickness proportional length and breadth
colour and size which beans present what a contrast between a windsor
and horsebean as in the case of the pea our existing varieties were
preceded during the bronze age in switzerland92 by a peculiar and now
extinct variety producing very small beans93
potato solanum tuberosumthere is little doubt about the parentage
of this plant for the cultivated varieties differ extremely little in
general appearance from the wild species which can be recognised in
its native land at the first glance94 the varieties cultivated in
britain are numerous thus lawson95 gives a description of 175 kinds
i planted eighteen kinds in adjoining rows their stems and leaves
differed but little and in several cases there was as great a
difference between the individuals of the same variety as between the
different varieties the flower varied in size and in colour between
white and purple but in no other respect except that in one kind the
sepals were somewhat elongated one strange variety has been described
which always produces two sorts of flowers the first double and
sterile the second single and fertile96 the fruit or berries also
differ but only in a slight degree97 the varieties are liable in
very different degree to the attack of the colorado potatobeetle98
the tubers on the other hand present a wonderful amount of diversity
this fact accords with the principle that the valuable and selected
parts of all cultivated productions present the greatest amount of
modification they differ much in size and shape being globular oval
flattened kidneylike or cylindrical one variety from peru is
described99 as being quite straight and at least six inches in
length though no thicker than a mans finger the eyes or buds differ
in form position and colour the manner in which the tubers are
arranged on the socalled roots or rhizomes is different thus in the
gurkenkartoffeln they form a pyramid with the apex downwards and in
another variety they bury themselves deep in the ground the roots
themselves run either near the surface or deep in the ground the
tubers also differ in smoothness and colour being externally white
red purple or almost black and internally white yellow or almost
black they differ in flavour and quality being either waxy or mealy
in their period of maturity and in their capacity for long
preservation
as with many other plants which have been long propagated by bulbs
tubers cuttings etc by which means the same individual is exposed
during a length of time to diversified conditions seedling potatoes
generally display innumerable slight differences several varieties
even when propagated by tubers are far from constant as will be seen
in the chapter on budvariation dr anderson100 procured seed from
an irish purple potato which grew far from any other kind so that it
could not at least in this generation have been crossed yet the many
seedlings varied in almost every possible respect so that scarcely
two plants were exactly alike some of the plants which closely
resembled each other above ground produced extremely dissimilar
tubers and some tubers which externally could hardly be distinguished
differed widely in quality when cooked even in this case of extreme
variability the parentstock had some influence on the progeny for
the greater number of the seedlings resembled in some degree the parent
irish potato kidney potatoes must be ranked amongst the most highly
cultivated and artificial races nevertheless their peculiarities can
often be strictly propagated by seed a great authority mr
rivers101 states that seedlings from the ashleaved kidney always
bear a strong resemblance to their parent seedlings from the
flukekidney are still more remarkable for their adherence to their
parent stock for on closely observing a great number during two
seasons i have not been able to observe the least difference either
in earliness productiveness or in the size or shape of their tubers

the vine vitis viniferathe best authorities consider all our
grapes as the descendants of one species which now grows wild in
western asia which grew wild during the bronze age in italy1 and
which has recently been found fossil in a tufaceous deposit in the
south of france2 some authors however entertain much doubt about
the single parentage of our cultivated varieties owing to the number
of semiwild forms found in southern europe especially as described by
clemente3 in a forest in spain but as the grape sows itself freely
in southern europe and as several of the chief kinds transmit their
characters by seed4 whilst others are extremely variable the
existence of many different escaped forms could hardly fail to occur in
countries where this plant has been cultivated from the remotest
antiquity that the vine varies much when propagated by seed we may
infer from the largely increased number of varieties since the earlier
historical records new hothouse varieties are produced almost every
year for instance5 a goldencoloured variety has been recently
raised in england from a black grape without the aid of a cross van
mons6 reared a multitude of varieties from the seed of one vine
which was completely separated from all others so that there could
not at least in this generation have been any crossing and the
seedlings presented les analogues de toutes les sortes and differed
in almost every possible character both in the fruits and foliage
the cultivated varieties are extremely numerous count odart says that
he will not deny that there may exist throughout the world 700 or 800
perhaps even 1000 varieties but not a third of these have any value
in the catalogue of fruit cultivated in the horticultural gardens of
london published in 1842 99 varieties are enumerated wherever the
grape is grown many varieties occur pallas describes 24 in the crimea
and burnes mentions 10 in cabool the classification of the varieties
has much perplexed writers and count odart is reduced to a
geographical system but i will not enter on this subject nor on the
many and great differences between the varieties i will merely specify
a few curious and trifling peculiarities all taken from odarts highly
esteemed work7 for the sake of showing the diversified variability of
this plant simon has classed grapes into two main divisions those
with downy leaves and those with smooth leaves but he admits that in
one variety namely the rebazo the leaves are either smooth or downy
and odart p 70 states that some varieties have the nerves alone and
other varieties their young leaves downy whilst the old ones are
smooth the pedroximenes grape odart p 397 presents a peculiarity
by which it can be at once recognised amongst a host of other
varieties namely that when the fruit is nearly ripe the nerves of the
leaves or even the whole surface becomes yellow the barbera dasti is
well marked by several characters p 426 amongst others by some of
the leaves and it is always the lowest on the branches suddenly
becoming of a dark red colour several authors in classifying grapes
have founded their main divisions on the berries being either round or
oblong and odart admits the value of this character yet there is one
variety the maccabeo p 71 which often produces small round and
large oblong berries in the same bunch certain grapes called nebbiolo
p 429 present a constant character sufficient for their
recognition namely the slight adherence of that part of the pulp
which surrounds the seeds to the rest of the berry when cut through
transversely a rhenish variety is mentioned p 228 which likes a
dry soil the fruit ripens well but at the moment of maturity if much
rain falls the berries are apt to rot on the other hand the fruit of
a swiss variety p 243 is valued for well sustaining prolonged
humidity this latter variety sprouts late in the spring yet matures
its fruit early other varieties page 362 have the fault of being too
much excited by the april sun and in consequence suffer from frost a
styrian variety p 254 has brittle footstalks so that the clusters
of fruit are often blown off this variety is said to be particularly
attractive to wasps and bees other varieties have tough stalks which
resist the wind many other variable characters could be given but the
foregoing facts are sufficient to show in how many small structural and
constitutional details the vine varies during the vine disease in
france certain old groups of varieties8 have suffered far more from
mildew than others thus the group of chasselas so rich in varieties
did not afford a single fortunate exception certain other groups
suffered much less the true old burgundy for instance was
comparatively free from disease and the carminat likewise resisted the
attack the american vines which belong to a distinct species
entirely escaped the disease in france and we thus see that those
european varieties which best resist the disease must have acquired in
a slight degree the same constitutional peculiarities as the american
species
white mulberry morus albai mention this plant because it has
varied in certain characters namely in the texture and quality of the
leaves fitting them to serve as food for the domesticated silkworm in
a manner not observed with other plants but this has arisen simply
from such variations in the mulberry having been attended to selected
and rendered more or less constant m de quatrefages9 briefly
describes six kinds cultivated in one valley in france of these the 
amourouso produces excellent leaves but is rapidly being abandoned
because it produces much fruit mingled with the leaves the antofino
yields deeply cut leaves of the finest quality but not in great
quantity the claro is much sought for because the leaves can be
easily collected lastly the roso bears strong hardy leaves
produced in large quantity but with the one inconvenience that they
are best adapted for the worms after their fourth moult mm
jacquemetbonnefont of lyon however remark in their catalogue 1862
that two subvarieties have been confounded under the name of the roso
one having leaves too thick for the caterpillars the other being
valuable because the leaves can easily be gathered from the branches
without the bark being torn
in india the mulberry has also given rise to many varieties the indian
form is thought by many botanists to be a distinct species but as
royle remarks10 so many varieties have been produced by cultivation
that it is difficult to ascertain whether they all belong to one
species they are as he adds nearly as numerous as those of the
silkworm
the orange groupwe here meet with great confusion in the specific
distinction and parentage of the several kinds gallesio11 who
almost devoted his lifetime to the subject considers that there are
four species namely sweet and bitter oranges lemons and citrons
each of which has given rise to whole groups of varieties monsters
and supposed hybrids one high authority12 believes that these four
reputed species are all varieties of the wild citrus medica but that
the shaddock citrus decumana which is not known in a wild state
is a distinct species though its distinctness is doubted by another
writer of great authority on such matters namely dr buchanan
hamilton alph de candolle13 on the other handand there cannot be
a more capable judgeadvances what he considers sufficient evidence of
the orange he doubts whether the bitter and sweet kinds are
specifically distinct the lemon and citron having been found wild
and consequently that they are distinct he mentions two other forms
cultivated in japan and java which he ranks undoubted species he
speaks rather more doubtfully about the shaddock which varies much
and has not been found wild and finally he considers some forms such
as adams apple and the bergamotte as probably hybrids
i have briefly abstracted these opinions for the sake of showing those
who have never attended to such subjects how perplexing they are it
would therefore be useless for my purpose to give a sketch of the
conspicuous differences between the several forms besides the
everrecurrent difficulty of determining whether forms found wild are
truly aboriginal or are escaped seedlings many of the forms which
must be ranked as varieties transmit their characters almost perfectly
by seed sweet and bitter oranges differ in no important respect except
in the flavour of their fruit but gallesio14 is most emphatic that
both kinds can be propagated by seed with absolute certainty
consequently in accordance with his simple rule he classes them as
distinct species as he does sweet and bitter almonds the peach and
nectarine etc he admits however that the softshelled pinetree
produces not only softshelled but some hardshelled seedlings so that
a little greater force in the power of inheritance would according to
this rule raise a softshelled pinetree into the dignity of an
aboriginally created species the positive assertion made by
macfayden15 that the pips of sweet oranges produced in jamaica
according to the nature of the soil in which they are sown either
sweet or bitter oranges is probably an error for m alph de candolle
informs me that since the publication of his great work he has received
accounts from guiana the antilles and mauritius that in these
countries sweet oranges faithfully transmit their character gallesio
found that the willowleafed and the little china oranges reproduced
their proper leaves and fruit but the seedlings were not quite equal
in merit to their parents the redfleshed orange on the other hand
fails to reproduce itself gallesio also observed that the seeds of
several other singular varieties all reproduced trees having a peculiar
physiognomy partly resembling their parentforms i can adduce another
case the myrtle leaved orange is ranked by all authors as a variety
but is very distinct in general aspect in my fathers greenhouse
during many years it rarely yielded any fruit but at last produced
one and a tree thus raised was identical with the parentform
another and more serious difficulty in determining the rank of the
several forms is that according to gallesio16 they largely
intercross without artificial aid thus he positively states that seeds
taken from lemontrees c lemonum growing mingled with the citron
c medica which is generally considered as a distinct species
produced a graduated series of varieties between these two forms
again an adams apple was produced from the seed of a sweet orange
which grew close to lemons and citrons but such facts hardly aid us in
determining whether to rank these forms as species or varieties for it
is now known that undoubted species of verbascum cistus primula
salix etc frequently cross in a state of nature if indeed it were
proved that plants of the orange tribe raised from these crosses were
even partially sterile it would be a strong argument in favour of
their rank as species gallesio asserts that this is the case but he
does not distinguish between sterility from hybridism and from the
effects of culture and he almost destroys the force of this statement
by another17 namely that when he impregnated the flowers of the
common orange with the pollen taken from undoubted varieties of the
orange monstrous fruits were produced which included little pulp
and had no seeds or imperfect seeds
in this tribe of plants we meet with instances of two highly remarkable
facts in vegetable physiology gallesio18 impregnated an orange with
pollen from a lemon and the fruit borne on the mother tree had a
raised stripe of peel like that of a lemon both in colour and taste
but the pulp was like that of an orange and included only imperfect
seeds the possibility of pollen from one variety or species directly
affecting the fruit produced by another variety of species is a
subject which i shall fully discuss in the following chapter
the second remarkable fact is that two supposed hybrids19 for their
hybrid nature was not ascertained between an orange and either a
lemon or citron produced on the same tree leaves flowers and fruit
of both pure parentforms as well as of a mixed or crossed nature a
bud taken from any one of the branches and grafted on another tree
produces either one of the pure kinds or a capricious tree reproducing
the three kinds whether the sweet lemon which includes within the
same fruit segments of differently flavoured pulp20 is an analogous
case i know not but to this subject i shall have to recur
i will conclude by giving from a risso21 a short account of a very
singular variety of the common orange it is the citrus aurantium
fructu variabili which on the young shoots produces roundedoval
leaves spotted with yellow borne on petioles with heartshaped wings
when these leaves fall off they are succeeded by longer and narrower
leaves with undulated margins of a palegreen colour embroidered with
yellow borne on footstalks without wings the fruit whilst young is
pearshaped yellow longitudinally striated and sweet but as it
ripens it becomes spherical of a reddishyellow and bitter
peach and nectarine amygdalus persicathe best authorities are
nearly unanimous that the peach has never been found wild it was
introduced from persia into europe a little before the christian era
and at this period few varieties existed alph de candolle22 from
the fact of the peach not having spread from persia at an earlier
period and from its not having pure sanscrit or hebrew names believes
that it is not an aboriginal of western asia but came from the terra
incognita of china the supposition however that the peach is a
modified almond which acquired its present character at a comparatively
late period would i presume account for these facts on the same
principle that the nectarine the offspring of the peach has few
native names and became known in europe at a still later period
illustration peach and almond stones
andrew knight23 from finding that a seedlingtree raised from a
sweet almond fertilised by the pollen of a peach yielded fruit quite
like that of a peach suspected that the peachtree is a modified
almond and in this he has been followed by various authors24 a
firstrate peach almost globular in shape formed of soft and sweet
pulp surrounding a hard much furrowed and slightly flattened stone
certainly differs greatly from an almond with its soft slightly
furrowed much flattened and elongated stone protected by a tough
greenish layer of bitter flesh mr bentham25 has particularly called
attention to the stone of the almond being so much more flattened than
that of the peach but in the several varieties of the almond the
stone differs greatly in the degree to which it is compressed in size
shape strength and in the depth of the furrows as may be seen in
fig 42 nos 4 to 8 of such kinds as i have been able to collect
with peachstones also nos 1 to 3 the degree of compression and
elongation is seen to vary so that the stone of the chinese
honeypeach no 3 is much more elongated and compressed than that of
the no 8 smyrna almond mr rivers of sawbridgeworth to whom i am
indebted for some of the specimens above figured and who has had such
great horticultural experience has called my attention to several
varieties which connect the almond and the peach in france there is a
variety called the peachalmond which mr rivers formerly cultivated
and which is correctly described in a french catalogue as being oval
and swollen with the aspect of a peach including a hard stone
surrounded by a fleshy covering which is sometimes eatable26 a
remarkable statement by m luizet has recently appeared in the revue
horticole27 namely that a peachalmond grafted on a peach bore
during 1863 and 1864 almonds alone but in 1865 bore six peaches and no
almonds m carriere in commenting on this fact cites the case of a
doubleflowered almond which after producing during several years
almonds suddenly bore for two years in succession spherical fleshy
peachlike fruits but in 1865 reverted to its former state and
produced large almonds
again as i hear from mr rivers the doubleflowering chinese peaches
resemble almonds in their manner of growth and in their flowers the
fruit is much elongated and flattened with the flesh both bitter and
sweet but not uneatable and it is said to be of better quality in
china from this stage one small step leads us to such inferior peaches
as are occasionally raised from seed for instance mr rivers sowed a
number of peachstones imported from the united states where they are
collected for raising stocks and some of the trees raised by him
produced peaches which were very like almonds in appearance being
small and hard with the pulp not softening till very late in the
autumn van mons28 also states that he once raised from a peachstone
a peach having the aspect of a wild tree with fruit like that of the
almond from inferior peaches such as these just described we may
pass by small transitions through clingstones of poor quality to our
best and most melting kinds from this gradation from the cases of
sudden variation above recorded and from the fact that the peach has
not been found wild it seems to me by far the most probable view that
the peach is the descendant of the almond improved and modified in a
marvellous manner
one fact however is opposed to this conclusion a hybrid raised by
knight from the sweet almond by the pollen of the peach produced
flowers with little or no pollen yet bore fruit having been
apparently fertilised by a neighbouring nectarine another hybrid from
a sweet almond by the pollen of a nectarine produced during the first
three years imperfect blossoms but afterwards perfect flowers with an
abundance of pollen if this slight degree of sterility cannot be
accounted for by the youth of the trees and this often causes lessened
fertility or by the monstrous state of the flowers or by the
conditions to which the trees were exposed these two cases would
afford a good argument against the peach being the descendant of the
almond
whether or not the peach has proceeded from the almond it has
certainly given rise to nectarines or smooth peaches as they are
called by the french most of the varieties both of the peach and
nectarine reproduce themselves truly by seed gallesio29 says he has
verified this with respect to eight races of the peach mr rivers30
has given some striking instances from his own experience and it is
notorious that good peaches are constantly raised in north america from
seed many of the american subvarieties come true or nearly true to
their kind such as the whiteblossom several of the yellowfruited
freestone peaches the blood clingstone the heath and the lemon
clingstone on the other hand a clingstone peach has been known to
give rise to a freestone31 in england it has been noticed that
seedlings inherit from their parents flowers of the same size and
colour some characters however contrary to what might have been
expected often are not inherited such as the presence and form of the
glands on the leaves32 with respect to nectarines both cling and
freestones are known in north america to reproduce themselves by
seed33 in england the new white nectarine was a seedling of the old
white and mr rivers34 has recorded several similar cases from this
strong tendency to inheritance which both peach and nectarine trees
exhibitfrom certain slight constitutional differences35 in their
natureand from the great difference in their fruit both in appearance
and flavour it is not surprising notwithstanding that the trees
differ in no other respects and cannot even be distinguished as i am
informed by mr rivers whilst young that they have been ranked by
some authors as specifically distinct gallesio does not doubt that
they are distinct even alph de candolle does not appear perfectly
assured of their specific identity and an eminent botanist has quite
recently36 maintained that the nectarine probably constitutes a
distinct species
hence it may be worth while to give all the evidence on the origin of
the nectarine the facts in themselves are curious and will hereafter
have to be referred to when the important subject of budvariation is
discussed it is asserted37 that the boston nectarine was produced
from a peachstone and this nectarine reproduced itself by seed38
mr rivers states39 that from stones of three distinct varieties of
the peach he raised three varieties of nectarine and in one of these
cases no nectarine grew near the parent peachtree in another instance
mr rivers raised a nectarine from a peach and in the succeeding
generation another nectarine from this nectarine40 other such
instances have been communicated to me but they need not be given of
the converse case namely of nectarinestones yielding peachtrees
both free and clingstones we have six undoubted instances recorded
by mr rivers and in two of these instances the parent nectarines had
been seedlings from other nectarines41
with respect to the more curious case of fullgrown peachtrees
suddenly producing nectarines by budvariation or sports as they are
called by gardeners the evidence is superabundant there is also good
evidence of the same tree producing both peaches and nectarines or
halfandhalf fruit by this term i mean a fruit with the onehalf a
perfect peach and the other half a perfect nectarine
peter collinson in 1741 recorded the first case of a peachtree
producing a nectarine42 and in 1766 he added two other instances in
the same work the editor sir j e smith describes the more
remarkable case of a tree in norfolk which usually bore both perfect
nectarines and perfect peaches but during two seasons some of the
fruit were half and half in nature
mr salisbury in 180843 records six other cases of peachtrees
producing nectarines three of the varieties are named viz the
alberge belle chevreuse and royal george this latter tree seldom
failed to produce both kinds of fruit he gives another case of a
halfandhalf fruit
at radford in devonshire44 a clingstone peach purchased as the
chancellor was planted in 1815 and in 1824 after having previously
produced peaches alone bore on one branch twelve nectarines in 1825
the same branch yielded twentysix nectarines and in 1826 thirtysix
nectarines together with eighteen peaches one of the peaches was
almost as smooth on one side as a nectarine the nectarines were as
dark as but smaller than the elruge
at beccles a royal george peach45 produced a fruit three parts of
it being peach and one part nectarine quite distinct in appearance as
well as in flavour the lines of division were longitudinal as
represented in the woodcut a nectarinetree grew five yards from this
tree
professor chapman states46 that he has often seen in virginia very
old peachtrees bearing nectarines
a writer in the gardeners chronicle says that a peach tree planted
fifteen years previously47 produced this year a nectarine between two
peaches a nectarinetree grew close by
in 184448 a vanguard peachtree produced in the midst of its
ordinary fruit a single red roman nectarine
mr calver is stated49 to have raised in the united states a seedling
peach which produced a mixed crop of both peaches and nectarines
near dorking50 a branch of the tton de vnus peach which reproduces
itself truly by seed51 bore its own fruit so remarkable for its
prominent point and a nectarine rather smaller but well formed and
quite round
the previous cases all refer to peaches suddenly producing nectarines
but at carclew52 the unique case occurred of a nectarinetree
raised twenty years before from seed and never grafted producing a
fruit half peach and half nectarine subsequently bore a perfect peach
to sum up the foregoing facts we have excellent evidence of
peachstones producing nectarinetrees and of nectarinestones
producing peachtreesof the same tree bearing peaches and
nectarinesof peachtrees suddenly producing by budvariation
nectarines such nectarines reproducing nectarines by seed as well as
fruit in part nectarine and in part peachand lastly of one
nectarinetree first bearing halfandhalf fruit and subsequently true
peaches as the peach came into existence before the nectarine it
might have been expected from the law of reversion that nectarines
would have given birth by budvariation or by seed to peaches oftener
than peaches to nectarines but this is by no means the case
two explanations have been suggested to account for these conversions
first that the parent trees have been in every case hybrids53
between the peach and nectarine and have reverted by budvariation or
by seed to one of their pure parent forms this view in itself is not
very improbable for the mountaineer peach which was raised by knight
from the red nutmegpeach by pollen of the violette htive
nectarine54 produces peaches but these are said sometimes to
partake of the smoothness and flavour of the nectarine but let it be
observed that in the previous list no less than six wellknown
varieties and several unnamed varieties of the peach have once suddenly
produced perfect nectarines by bud variation and it would be an
extremely rash supposition that all these varieties of the peach which
have been cultivated for years in many districts and which show not a
vestige of a mixed parentage are nevertheless hybrids a second
explanation is that the fruit of the peach has been directly affected
by the pollen of the nectarine although this certainly is possible it
cannot here apply for we have not a shadow of evidence that a branch
which has borne fruit directly affected by foreign pollen is so
profoundly modified as afterwards to produce buds which continue to
yield fruit of the new and modified form now it is known that when a
bud on a peachtree has once borne a nectarine the same branch has in
several instances gone on during successive years producing nectarines
the carclew nectarine on the other hand first produced halfandhalf
fruit and subsequently pure peaches hence we may confidently accept
the common view that the nectarine is a variety of the peach which may
be produced either by budvariation or from seed in the following
chapter many analogous cases of budvariation will he given
the varieties of the peach and the nectarine run in parallel lines in
both classes the kinds differ from each other in the flesh of the fruit
being white red or yellow in being clingstones or freestones in the
flowers being large or small with certain other characteristic
differences and in the leaves being serrated without glands or
crenated and furnished with globose or reniform glands55 we can
hardly account for this parallelism by supposing that each variety of
the nectarine is descended from a corresponding variety of the peach
for though our nectarines are certainly the descendants of several
kinds of peaches yet a large number are the descendants of other
nectarines and they vary so much when thus reproduced that we can
scarcely admit the above explanation
the varieties of the peach have largely increased in number since the
christian era when from two to five varieties were known56 and the
nectarine was unknown at the present time besides many varieties said
to exist in china downing describes in the united states
seventynine native and imported varieties of the peach and a few
years ago lindley57 enumerated one hundred and sixtyfour varieties
of the peach and nectarine grown in england i have already indicated
the chief points of difference between the several varieties
nectarines even when produced from distinct kinds of peaches always
possess their own peculiar flavour and are smooth and small
clingstone and freestone peaches which differ in the ripe flesh either
firmly adhering to the stone or easily separating from it also differ
in the character of the stone itself that of the freestones or melters
being more deeply fissured with the sides of the fissures smoother
than in clingstones in the various kinds the flowers differ not only
in size but in the larger flowers the petals are differently shaped
more imbricated generally red in the centre and pale towards the
margin whereas in the smaller flowers the margin of the petal is
usually more darkly coloured one variety has nearly white flowers the
leaves are more or less serrated and are either destitute of glands
or have globose or reniform glands58 and some few peaches such as
the brugnen bear on the same tree both globular and kidneyshaped
glands59 according to robertson60 the trees with glandular leaves
are liable to blister but not in any great degree to mildew whilst
the nonglandular trees are more subject to curl to mildew and to the
attacks of aphides the varieties differ in the period of their
maturity in the fruit keeping well and in hardinessthe latter
circumstance being especially attended to in the united states certain
varieties such as the bellegarde stand forcing in hothouses better
than other varieties the flatpeach of china is the most remarkable of
all the varieties it is so much depressed towards the summit that the
stone is here covered only by roughened skin and not by a fleshy
layer61 another chinese variety called the honeypeach is
remarkable from the fruit terminating in a long sharp point its leaves
are glandless and widely dentate62 the emperor of russia peach is a
third singular variety having deeply doubleserrated leaves the fruit
is deeply cleft with onehalf projecting considerably beyond the other
it originated in america and its seedlings inherit similar leaves63
the peach has also produced in china a small class of trees valued for
ornament namely the doubleflowered of these five varieties are now
known in england varying from pure white through rose to intense
crimson64 one of these varieties called the camelliaflowered
bears flowers above 2 inches in diameter whilst those of the
fruitbearing kinds do not at most exceed 1 inch in diameter the
flowers of the doubleflowered peaches have the singular property65
of frequently producing double or treble fruit finally there is good
reason to believe that the peach is an almond profoundly modified but
whatever its origin may have been there can be no doubt that it has
yielded during the last eighteen centuries many varieties some of them
strongly characterised belonging both to the nectarine and peach form
apricot prunus armeniacait is commonly admitted that this tree is
descended from a single species now found wild in the caucasian
region66 on this view the varieties deserve notice because they
illustrate differences supposed by some botanists to be of specific
value in the almond and plum the best monograph on the apricot is by
mr thompson67 who describes seventeen varieties we have seen that
peaches and nectarines vary in a strictly parallel manner and in the
apricot which forms a closely allied genus we again meet with
variations analogous to those of the peach as well as to those of the
plum the varieties differ considerably in the shape of their leaves
which are either serrated or crenated sometimes with earlike
appendages at their bases and sometimes with glands on the petioles
the flowers are generally alike but are small in the masculine the
fruit varies much in size shape and in having the suture little
pronounced or absent in the skin being smooth or downy as in the
orangeapricot and in the flesh clinging to the stone as in the
lastmentioned kind or in readily separating from it as in the
turkeyapricot in all these differences we see the closest analogy
with the varieties of the peach and nectarine in the stone we have
more important differences and these in the case of the plum have been
esteemed of specific value in some apricots the stone is almost
spherical in others much flattened being either sharp in front or
blunt at both ends sometimes channelled along the back or with a
sharp ridge along both margins in the moorpark and generally in the
hemskirke the stone presents a singular character in being perforated
with a bundle of fibres passing through the perforation from end to
end the most constant and important character according to thompson
is whether the kernel is bitter or sweet yet in this respect we have a
graduated difference for the kernel is very bitter in shipleys
apricot in the hemskirke less bitter than in some other kinds
slightly bitter in the royal and sweet like a hazelnut in the
breda angoumois and others in the case of the almond bitterness has
been thought by some high authorities to indicate specific difference
in n america the roman apricot endures cold and unfavourable
situations where no other sort except the masculine will succeed
and its blossoms bear quite a severe frost without injury68
according to mr rivers69 seedling apricots deviate but little from
the character of their race in france the alberge is constantly
reproduced from seed with but little variation in ladakh according to
moorcroft70 ten varieties of the apricot very different from each
other are cultivated and all are raised from seed excepting one
which is budded
illustration plum stones
plums prunus insititiaformerly the sloe p spinosa was
thought to be the parent of all our plums but now this honour is very
commonly accorded to p insititia or the bullace which is found wild
in the caucasus and nwestern india and is naturalised in
england71 it is not at all improbable in accordance with some
observations made by mr rivers72 that both these forms which some
botanists rank as a single species may be the parents of our
domesticated plums another supposed parentform the p domestica
is said to be found wild in the region of the caucasus godron
remarks73 that the cultivated varieties may be divided into two main
groups which he supposes to be descended from two aboriginal stocks
namely those with oblong fruit and stones pointed at both ends having
narrow separate petals and upright branches and those with rounded
fruit with stones blunt at both ends with rounded petals and
spreading branches from what we know of the variability of the flowers
in the peach and of the diversified manner of growth in our various
fruittrees it is difficult to lay much weight on these latter
characters with respect to the shape of the fruit we have conclusive
evidence that it is extremely variable downing74 gives outlines of
the plums of two seedlings namely the red and imperial gages raised
from the greengage and the fruit of both is more elongated than that
of the greengage the latter has a very blunt broad stone whereas the
stone of the imperial gage is oval and pointed at both ends these
trees also differ in their manner of growth the greengage is a very
shortjointed slowgrowing tree of spreading and rather dwarfish
habit whilst its offspring the imperial gage grows freely and
rises rapidly and has long dark shoots the famous washington plum
bears a globular fruit but its offspring the emerald drop is nearly
as much elongated as the most elongated plum figured by downing
namely mannings prune i have made a small collection of the stones
of twentyfive kinds and they graduate in shape from the bluntest into
the sharpest kinds as characters derived from seeds are generally of
high systematic importance i have thought it worth while to give
drawings of the most distinct kinds in my small collection and they
may be seen to differ in a surprising manner in size outline
thickness prominence of the ridges and state of surface it deserves
notice that the shape of the stone is not always strictly correlated
with that of the fruit thus the washington plum is spherical and
depressed at the pole with a somewhat elongated stone whilst the
fruit of the goliath is more elongated but the stone less so than in
the washington again denyers victoria and goliath bear fruit closely
resembling each other but their stones are widely different on the
other hand the harvest and black margate plums are very dissimilar
yet include closely similar stones
the varieties of the plum are numerous and differ greatly in size
shape quality and colourbeing bright yellow green almost white
blue purple or red there are some curious varieties such as the
double or siamese and the stoneless plum in the latter the kernel
lies in a roomy cavity surrounded only by the pulp the climate of
north america appears to be singularly favourable for the production of
new and good varieties downing describes no less than forty of which
seven of firstrate quality have been recently introduced into
england75 varieties occasionally arise having an innate adaptation
for certain soils almost as strongly pronounced as with natural
species growing on the most distinct geological formations thus in
america the imperial gage differently from almost all other kinds is
peculiarly fitted for dry light soils where many sorts drop their
fruit whereas on rich heavy soils the fruit is often insipid76 my
father could never succeed in making the winesour yield even a
moderate crop in a sandy orchard near shrewsbury whilst in some parts
of the same county and in its native yorkshire it bears abundantly one
of my relations also repeatedly tried in vain to grow this variety in a
sandy district in staffordshire
mr rivers has given77 a number of interesting facts showing how
truly many varieties can be propagated by seed he sowed the stones of
twenty bushels of the greengage for the sake of raising stocks and
closely observed the seedlings all had the smooth shoots the
prominent buds and the glossy leaves of the greengage but the greater
number had smaller leaves and thorns there are two kinds of damson
one the shropshire with downy shoots and the other the kentish with
smooth shoots and these differ but slightly in any other respect mr
rivers sowed some bushels of the kentish damson and all the seedlings
had smooth shoots but in some the fruit was oval in others round or
roundish and in a few the fruit was small and except in being sweet
closely resembled that of the wild sloe mr rivers gives several other
striking instances of inheritance thus he raised eighty thousand
seedlings from the common german quetsche plum and not one could be
found varying in the least in foliage or habit similar facts were
observed with the petite mirabelle plum yet this latter kind as well
as the quetsche is known to have yielded some wellestablished
varieties but as mr rivers remarks they all belong to the same
group with the mirabelle
cherries prunus cerasus avium etcbotanists believe that our
cultivated cherries are descended from one two four or even more
wild stocks78 that there must be at least two parent species we may
infer from the sterility of twenty hybrids raised by mr knight from
the morello fertilised by pollen of the elton cherry for these hybrids
produced in all only five cherries and one alone of these contained a
seed79 mr thompson80 has classified the varieties in an
apparently natural method in two main groups by characters taken from
the flowers fruit and leaves but some varieties which stand widely
separate in this classification are quite fertile when crossed thus
knights early black cherries are the product of a cross between two
such kinds
mr knight states that seedling cherries are more variable than those
of any other fruittree81 in the catalogue of the horticultural
society for 1842 eighty varieties are enumerated some varieties
present singular characters thus the flower of the cluster cherry
includes as many as twelve pistils of which the majority abort and
they are said generally to produce from two to five or six cherries
aggregated together and borne on a single peduncle in the ratafia
cherry several flowerpeduncles arise from a common peduncle upwards
of an inch in length the fruit of gascoignes heart has its apex
produced into a globule or drop that of the white hungarian gean has
almost transparent flesh the flemish cherry is a very oddlooking
fruit much flattened at the summit and base with the latter deeply
furrowed and borne on a stout very short footstalk in the kentish
cherry the stone adheres so firmly to the footstalk that it could be
drawn out of the flesh and this renders the fruit well fitted for
drying the tobaccoleaved cherry according to sageret and thompson
produces gigantic leaves more than a foot and sometimes even eighteen
inches in length and half a foot in breadth the weeping cherry on
the other hand is valuable only as an ornament and according to
downing is a charming little tree with slender weeping branches
clothed with small almost myrtlelike foliage there is also a
peachleaved variety
sageret describes a remarkable variety le griottier de la toussaint
which bears at the same time even as late as september flowers and
fruit of all degrees of maturity the fruit which is of inferior
quality is borne on long very thin footstalks but the extraordinary
statement is made that all the leafbearing shoots spring from old
flowerbuds lastly there is an important physiological distinction
between those kinds of cherries which bear fruit on young or on old
wood but sageret positively asserts that a bigarreau in his garden
bore fruit on wood of both ages82
apple pyrus malusthe one source of doubt felt by botanists with
respect to the parentage of the apple is whether besides p malus
two or three other closely allied wild forms namely p acerba and 
prcox or paradisiaca do not deserve to be ranked as distinct
species the p prcox is supposed by some authors83 to be the
parent of the dwarf paradise stock which owing to the fibrous roots
not penetrating deeply into the ground is so largely used for
grafting but the paradise stocks it is asserted84 cannot be
propagated true by seed the common wild crab varies considerably in
england but many of the varieties are believed to be escaped
seedlings85 every one knows the great difference in the manner of
growth in the foliage flowers and especially in the fruit between
the almost innumerable varieties of the apple the pips or seeds as i
know by comparison likewise differ considerably in shape size and
colour the fruit is adapted for eating or for cooking in various ways
and keeps for only a few weeks or for nearly two years some few kinds
have the fruit covered with a powdery secretion called bloom like
that on plums and it is extremely remarkable that this occurs almost
exclusively among varieties cultivated in russia86 another russian
apple the white astracan possesses the singular property of becoming
transparent when ripe like some sorts of crabs the api toil has
five prominent ridges hence its name the api noir is nearly black
the twin cluster pippin often bears fruit joined in pairs87 the
trees of the several sorts differ greatly in their periods of leafing
and flowering in my orchard the court pendu plat produces leaves so
late that during several springs i thought that it was dead the
tiffin apple scarcely bears a leaf when in full bloom the cornish
crab on the other hand bears so many leaves at this period that the
flowers can hardly be seen88 in some kinds the fruit ripens in
midsummer in others late in the autumn these several differences in
leafing flowering and fruiting are not at all necessarily
correlated for as andrew knight has remarked89 no one can judge
from the early flowering of a new seedling or from the early shedding
or change of colour of the leaves whether it will mature its fruit
early in the season
the varieties differ greatly in constitution it is notorious that our
summers are not hot enough for the newtown pippin90 which is the
glory of the orchards near new york and so it is with several
varieties which we have imported from the continent on the other hand
our court of wick succeeds well under the severe climate of canada the
caville rouge de micoud occasionally bears two crops during the same
year the burr knot is covered with small excrescences which emit
roots so readily that a branch with blossombuds may be stuck in the
ground and will root and bear a few fruit even during the first
year91 mr rivers has recently described92 some seedlings valuable
from their roots running near the surface one of these seedlings was
remarkable from its extremely dwarfed size forming itself into a bush
only a few inches in height many varieties are particularly liable to
canker in certain soils but perhaps the strangest constitutional
peculiarity is that the winter majetin is not attacked by the mealy bug
or coccus lindley93 states that in an orchard in norfolk infested
with these insects the majetin was quite free though the stock on
which it was grafted was affected knight makes a similar statement
with respect to a cider apple and adds that he only once saw these
insects just above the stock but that three days afterwards they
entirely disappeared this apple however was raised from a cross
between the golden harvey and the siberian crab and the latter i
believe is considered by some authors as specifically distinct
the famous st valery apple must not be passed over the flower has a
double calyx with ten divisions and fourteen styles surmounted by
conspicuous oblique stigmas but is destitute of stamens or corolla
the fruit is constricted round the middle and is formed of five
seedcells surmounted by nine other cells94 not being provided with
stamens the tree requires artificial fertilisation and the girls of
st valery annually go to faire ses pommes each marking her own
fruit with a ribbon and as different pollen is used the fruit differs
and we here have an instance of the direct action of foreign pollen on
the mother plant these monstrous apples include as we have seen
fourteen seedcells the pigeonapple95 on the other hand has only
four instead of as with all common apples five cells and this
certainly is a remarkable difference
in the catalogue of apples published in 1842 by the horticultural
society 897 varieties are enumerated but the differences between most
of them are of comparatively little interest as they are not strictly
inherited no one can raise for instance from the seed of the ribston
pippin a tree of the same kind and it is said that the sister
ribston pippin was a white semitransparent sourfleshed apple or
rather large crab96 yet it was a mistake to suppose that with most
varieties the characters are not to a certain extent inherited in two
lots of seedlings raised from two wellmarked kinds many worthless
crablike seedlings will appear but it is now known that the two lots
not only usually differ from each other but resemble to a certain
extent their parents we see this indeed in the several subgroups of
russetts sweetings codlins pearmains reinettes etc97 which are
all believed and many are known to be descended from other varieties
bearing the same names
pears pyrus communisi need say little on this fruit which varies
much in the wild state and to an extraordinary degree when cultivated
in its fruit flowers and foliage one of the most celebrated
botanists in europe m decaisne has carefully studied the many
varieties98 although he formerly believed that they were derived
from more than one species he now thinks that all belong to one he
has arrived at this conclusion from finding in the several varieties a
perfect gradation between the most extreme characters so perfect is
this gradation that he maintains it to be impossible to classify the
varieties by any natural method m decaisne raised many seedlings from
four distinct kinds and has carefully recorded the variations in each
notwithstanding this extreme degree of variability it is now
positively known that many kinds reproduce by seed the leading
characters of their race99
strawberries fragariathis fruit is remarkable on account of the
number of species which have been cultivated and from their rapid
improvement within the last fifty or sixty years let any one compare
the fruit of one of the largest varieties exhibited at our shows with
that of the wild wood strawberry or which will be a fairer
comparison with the somewhat larger fruit of the wild american
virginian strawberry and he will see what prodigies horticulture has
effected100 the number of varieties has likewise increased in a
surprisingly rapid manner only three kinds were known in france in
1746 where this fruit was early cultivated in 1766 five species had
been introduced the same which are now cultivated but only five
varieties of fragaria vesca with some subvarieties had been
produced at the present day the varieties of the several species are
almost innumerable the species consist of firstly the wood or alpine
cultivated strawberries descended from f vesca a native of europe
and of north america there are eight wild european varieties as
ranked by duchesne of f vesca but several of these are considered
species by some botanists secondly the green strawberries descended
from the european f collina and little cultivated in england
thirdly the hautbois from the european f elatior fourthly the
scarlets descended from f virginiana a native of the whole breadth
of north america fifthly the chili descended from f chiloensis
an inhabitant of the west coast of the temperate parts both of north
and south america lastly the pines or carolinas including the old
blacks which have been ranked by most authors under the name of f
grandiflora as a distinct species said to inhabit surinam but this
is a manifest error this form is considered by the highest authority
m gay to be merely a strongly marked race of f chiloensis101
these five or six forms have been ranked by most botanists as
specifically distinct but this may be doubted for andrew knight102
who raised no less than 400 crossed strawberries asserts that the  f
virginiana chiloensis and grandiflora may be made to breed
together indiscriminately and he found in accordance with the
principle of analogous variation that similar varieties could be
obtained from the seeds of any one of them
since knights time there is abundant and additional evidence103 of
the extent to which the american forms spontaneously cross we owe
indeed to such crosses most of our choicest existing varieties knight
did not succeed in crossing the european woodstrawberry with the
american scarlet or with the hautbois mr williams of pitmaston
however succeeded but the hybrid offspring from the hautbois though
fruiting well never produced seed with the exception of a single one
which reproduced the parent hybrid form104 major r trevor clarke
informs me that he crossed two members of the pine class myatts b
queen and keens seedling with the wood and hautbois and that in each
case he raised only a single seedling one of these fruited but was
almost barren mr w smith of york has raised similar hybrids with
equally poor success105 we thus see106 that the european and
american species can with some difficulty be crossed but it is
improbable that hybrids sufficiently fertile to be worth cultivation
will ever be thus produced this fact is surprising as these forms
structurally are not widely distinct and are sometimes connected in
the districts where they grow wild as i hear from professor asa gray
by puzzling intermediate forms
the energetic culture of the strawberry is of recent date and the
cultivated varieties can in most cases be classed under some one of the
above native stocks as the american strawberries cross so freely and
spontaneously we can hardly doubt that they will ultimately become
inextricably confused we find indeed that horticulturists at present
disagree under which class to rank some few of the varieties and a
writer in the bon jardinier of 1840 remarks that formerly it was
possible to class all of them under some one species but that now this
is quite impossible with the american forms the new english varieties
having completely filled up the gaps between them107 the blending
together of two or more aboriginal forms which there is every reason
to believe has occurred with some of our anciently cultivated
productions we see now actually occurring with our strawberries
the cultivated species offer some variations worth notice the black
prince a seedling from keens imperial this latter being a seedling
of a very white strawberry the white carolina is remarkable from
its peculiar dark and polished surface and from presenting an
appearance entirely unlike that of any other kind108 although the
fruit in the different varieties differs so greatly in form size
colour and quality the socalled seed which corresponds with the
whole fruit in the plum with the exception of being more or less
deeply embedded in the pulp is according to de jonghe109
absolutely the same in all and this no doubt may be accounted for by
the seed being of no value and consequently not having been subjected
to selection the strawberry is properly threeleaved but in 1761
duchesne raised a singleleaved variety of the european
woodstrawberry which linnus doubtfully raised to the rank of a
species seedlings of this variety like those of most varieties not
fixed by longcontinued selection often revert to the ordinary form
or present intermediate states110 a variety raised by mr
myatt111 apparently belonging to one of the american forms presents
a variation of an opposite nature for it has five leaves godron and
lambertye also mention a fiveleaved variety of f collina
the red bush alpine strawberry one of the f vesca section does not
produce stolons or runners and this remarkable deviation of structure
is reproduced truly by seed another subvariety the white bush
alpine is similarly characterised but when propagated by seed it
often degenerates and produces plants with runners112 a strawberry
of the american pine section is also said to make but few runners113
much has been written on the sexes of strawberries the true hautbois
properly bears the male and female organs on separate plants114 and
was consequently named by duchesne dioica but it frequently produces
hermaphrodites and lindley115 by propagating such plants by
runners at the same time destroying the males soon raised a
selfprolific stock the other species often showed a tendency towards
an imperfect separation of the sexes as i have noticed with plants
forced in a hothouse several english varieties which in this country
are free from any such tendency when cultivated in rich soils under
the climate of north america116 commonly produce plants with separate
sexes thus a whole acre of keens seedlings in the united states has
been observed to be almost sterile from the absence of male flowers
but the more general rule is that the male plants overrun the females
some members of the cincinnati horticultural society especially
appointed to investigate this subject report that few varieties have
the flowers perfect in both sexual organs etc the most successful
cultivators in ohio plant for every seven rows of pistillata or
female plants one row of hermaphrodites which afford pollen for both
kinds but the hermaphrodites owing to their expenditure in the
production of pollen bear less fruit than the female plants
the varieties differ in constitution some of our best english kinds
such as keens seedlings are too tender for certain parts of north
america where other english and many american varieties succeed
perfectly that splendid fruit the british queen can be cultivated
but in few places either in england or france but this apparently
depends more on the nature of the soil than on the climate a famous
gardener says that no mortal could grow the british queen at shrubland
park unless the whole nature of the soil was altered117 la
constantine is one of the hardiest kinds and can withstand russian
winters but it is easily burnt by the sun so that it will not succeed
in certain soils either in england or the united states118 the
filbert pine strawberry requires more water than any other variety
and if the plants once suffer from drought they will do little or no
good afterwards119 cuthills black prince strawberry evinces a
singular tendency to mildew no less than six cases have been recorded
of this variety suffering severely whilst other varieties growing
close by and treated in exactly the same manner were not at all
infested by this fungus120 the time of maturity differs much in the
different varieties some belonging to the wood or alpine section
produce a succession of crops throughout the summer
gooseberry ribes grossulariano one i believe has hitherto
doubted that all the cultivated kinds are sprung from the wild plant
bearing this name which is common in central and northern europe
therefore it will be desirable briefly to specify all the points
though not very important which have varied if it be admitted that
these differences are due to culture authors perhaps will not be so
ready to assume the existence of a large number of unknown wild
parentstocks for our other cultivated plants the gooseberry is not
alluded to by writers of the classical period turner mentions it in
1573 and parkinson specifies eight varieties in 1629 the catalogue of
the horticultural society for 1842 gives 149 varieties and the lists
of the lancashire nurserymen are said to include above 300 names121
in the gooseberry growers register for 1862 i find that 243 distinct
varieties have won prizes at various periods so that a vast number
must have been exhibited no doubt the difference between many of the
varieties is very small but mr thompson in classifying the fruit for
the horticultural society found less confusion in the nomenclature of
the gooseberry than of any other fruit and he attributes this to the
great interest which the prizegrowers have taken in detecting sorts
with wrong names and this shows that all the kinds numerous as they
are can be recognised with certainty
the bushes differ in their manner of growth being erect or spreading
or pendulous the periods of leafing and flowering differ both
absolutely and relatively to each other thus the whitesmith produces
early flowers which from not being protected by the foliage as it is
believed continually fail to produce fruit122 the leaves vary in
size tint and in depth of lobes they are smooth downy or hairy on
the upper surface the branches are more or less downy or spinose the
hedgehog has probably derived its name from the singular bristly
condition of its shoots and fruit the branches of the wild
gooseberry i may remark are smooth with the exception of thorns at
the bases of the buds the thorns themselves are either very small few
and single or very large and triple they are sometimes reflexed and
much dilated at their bases in the different varieties the fruit
varies in abundance in the period of maturity in hanging until
shrivelled and greatly in size some sorts having their fruit large
during a very early period of growth whilst others are small until
nearly ripe the fruit varies also much in colour being red yellow
green and whitethe pulp of one darkred gooseberry being tinged with
yellow in flavour in being smooth or downyfew however of the red
gooseberries whilst many of the socalled whites are downy or in
being so spinose that one kind is called hendersons porcupine two
kinds acquire when mature a powdery bloom on their fruit the fruit
varies in the thickness and veining of the skin and lastly in shape
being spherical oblong oval or obovate123
i cultivated fiftyfour varieties and considering how greatly the
fruit differs it was curious how closely similar the flowers were in
all these kinds in only a few i detected a trace of difference in the
size or colour of the corolla the calyx differed in a rather greater
degree for in some kinds it was much redder than in others and in one
smooth white gooseberry it was unusually red the calyx also differed
in the basal part being smooth or woolly or covered with glandular
hairs it deserves notice as being contrary to what might have been
expected from the law of correlation that a smooth red gooseberry had
a remarkably hairy calyx the flowers of the sportsman are furnished
with very large coloured bracte and this is the most singular
deviation of structure which i have observed these same flowers also
varied much in the number of the petals and occasionally in the number
of the stamens and pistils so that they were semimonstrous in
structure yet they produced plenty of fruit mr thompson remarks that
in the pastime gooseberry extra bracts are often attached to the sides
of the fruit124
the most interesting point in the history of the gooseberry is the
steady increase in the size of the fruit manchester is the metropolis
of the fanciers and prizes from five shillings to five or ten pounds
are yearly given for the heaviest fruit the gooseberry growers
register is published annually the earliest known copy is dated 1786
but it is certain that meetings for the adjudication of prizes were
held some years previously125 the register for 1845 gives an
account of 171 gooseberry shows held in different places during that
year and this fact shows on how large a scale the culture has been
carried on the fruit of the wild gooseberry is said126 to weigh
about a quarter of an ounce or 5 dwts that is 120 grains about the
year 1786 gooseberries were exhibited weighing 10 dwts so that the
weight was then doubled in 1817 26 dwts 17 grs was attained there
was no advance till 1825 when 31 dwts 16 grs was reached in 1830
teazer weighed 32 dwts 13 grs in 1841 wonderful weighed 32 dwts
16 grs in 1844 london weighed 35 dwts 12 grs and in the
following year 36 dwts 16 grs and in 1852 in staffordshire the
fruit of the same variety reached the astonishing weight of 37 dwts 7
grs127 or 896 grs that is between seven or eight times the weight
of the wild fruit i find that a small apple 6 inches in
circumference has exactly this same weight the london gooseberry
which in 1852 had altogether gained 333 prizes has up to the present
year of 1875 never reached a greater weight than that attained in
1852 perhaps the fruit of the gooseberry has now reached the greatest
possible weight unless in the course of time some new and distinct
variety shall arise
this gradual and on the whole steady increase of weight from the
latter part of the last century to the year 1852 is probably in large
part due to improved methods of cultivation for extreme care is now
taken the branches and roots are trained composts are made the soil
is mulched and only a few berries are left on each bush128 but the
increase no doubt is in main part due to the continued selection of
seedlings which have been found to be more and more capable of yielding
such extraordinary fruit assuredly the highwayman in 1817 could not
have produced fruit like that of the roaring lion in 1825 nor could
the roaring lion though it was grown by many persons in many places
gain the supreme triumph achieved in 1852 by the london gooseberry
walnut juglans regiathis tree and the common nut belong to a
widely different order from the foregoing fruits and are therefore
here noticed the walnut grows wild on the caucasus and in the
himalaya where dr hooker129 found the fruit of full size but as
hard as a hickorynut it has been found fossil as m de saporta
informs me in the tertiary formation of france
in england the walnut presents considerable differences in the shape
and size of the fruit in the thickness of the husk and in the
thinness of the shell this latter quality has given rise to a variety
called the thinshelled which is valuable but suffers from the
attacks of titmice130 the degree to which the kernel fills the
shell varies much in france there is a variety called the grape or
clusterwalnut in which the nuts grow in bunches of ten fifteen or
even twenty together there is another variety which bears on the same
tree differently shaped leaves like the heterophyllous hornbeam this
tree is also remarkable from having pendulous branches and bearing
elongated large thinshelled nuts131 m cardan has minutely
described132 some singular physiological peculiarities in the
juneleafing variety which produces its leaves and flowers four or
five weeks later than the common varieties and although in august it
is apparently in exactly the same state of forwardness as the other
kinds it retains its leaves and fruit much later in the autumn these
constitutional peculiarities are strictly inherited lastly
walnuttrees which are properly monoicous sometimes entirely fail to
produce male flowers133
nuts corylus avellanamost botanists rank all the varieties under
the same species the common wild nut134 the husk or involucre
differs greatly being extremely short in barrs spanish and extremely
long in filberts in which it is contracted so as to prevent the nut
falling out this kind of husk also protects the nut from birds for
titmice parus have been observed 135 to pass over filberts and
attack cobs and common nuts growing in the same orchard in the
purplefilbert the husk is purple and in the frizzledfilbert it is
curiously laciniated in the redfilbert the pellicle of the kernel is
red the shell is thick in some varieties but is thin in
cosfordsnut and in one variety is of a bluish colour the nut itself
differs much in size and shape being ovate and compressed in filberts
nearly round and of great size in cobs and spanish nuts oblong and
longitudinally striated in cosfords and obtusely foursided in the
downton square nut
cucurbitaceous plantsthese plants have been for a long period the
opprobrium of botanists numerous varieties have been ranked as
species and what happens more rarely forms which now must be
considered as species have been classed as varieties owing to the
admirable experimental researches of a distinguished botanist m
naudin136 a flood of light has recently been thrown on this group of
plants m naudin during many years observed and experimented on
above 1200 living specimens collected from all quarters of the world
six species are now recognised in the genus cucurbita but three alone
have been cultivated and concern us namely c maxima and pepo
which include all pumpkins gourds squashes and the vegetable marrow
and c moschata these three species are not known in a wild state
but asa gray137 gives good reason for believing that some pumpkins
are natives of n america
these three species are closely allied and have the same general
habit but their innumerable varieties can always be distinguished
according to naudin by certain almost fixed characters and what is
still more important when crossed they yield no seed or only sterile
seed whilst the varieties spontaneously intercross with the utmost
freedom naudin insists strongly p 15 that though these three
species have varied greatly in many characters yet it has been in so
closely an analogous manner that the varieties can he arranged in
almost parallel series as we have seen with the forms of wheat with
the two main races of the peach and in other cases though some of the
varieties are inconstant in character yet others when grown
separately under uniform conditions of life are as naudin repeatedly
pp 6 16 35 urges doues dune stabilit presque comparable 
celle des espces les mieux caractrises one variety lorangin pp
43 63 has such prepotency in transmitting its character that when
crossed with other varieties a vast majority of the seedlings come
true naudin referring p 47 to c pepo says that its races ne
different des espces veritables quen ce quelles peuvent sallier les
unes aux autres par voie dhybridit sans que leur descendance perde
la facult de se perptuer if we were to trust to external
differences alone and give up the test of sterility a multitude of
species would have to be formed out of the varieties of these three
species of cucurbita many naturalists at the present day lay far too
little stress in my opinion on the test of sterility yet it is not
improbable that distinct species of plants after a long course of
cultivation and variation may have their mutual sterility eliminated
as we have every reason to believe has occurred with domesticated
animals nor in the case of plants under cultivation should we be
justified in assuming that varieties never acquire a slight degree of
mutual sterility as we shall more fully see in a future chapter when
certain facts are given on the high authority of grtner and
klreuter138
the forms of c pepo are classed by naudin under seven sections each
including subordinate varieties he considers this plant as probably
the most variable in the world the fruit of one variety pp 33 46
exceeds in value that of another by more than two thousand fold when
the fruit is of very large size the number produced is few p 45
when of small size many are produced no less astonishing p 33 is
the variation in the shape of the fruit the typical form apparently is
egglike but this becomes either drawn out into a cylinder or
shortened into a flat disc we have also an almost infinite diversity
in the colour and state of surface of the fruit in the hardness both
of the shell and of the flesh and in the taste of the flesh which is
either extremely sweet farinaceous or slightly bitter the seeds also
differ in a slight degree in shape and wonderfully in size p 34
namely from six or seven to more than twentyfive millimtres in
length
in the varieties which grow upright or do not run and climb the
tendrils though useless p 31 are either present or are represented
by various semimonstrous organs or are quite absent the tendrils are
even absent in some running varieties in which the stems are much
elongated it is a singular fact that p 31 in all the varieties with
dwarfed stems the leaves closely resemble each other in shape
those naturalists who believe in the immutability of species often
maintain that even in the most variable forms the characters which
they consider of specific value are unchangeable to give an example
from a conscientious writer139 who relying on the labours of m
naudin and referring to the species of cucurbita says au milieu de
toutes les variations du fruit les tiges les feuilles les calices
les corolles les tamines restent invariables dans chacune delles
yet m naudin in describing  cucurbita pepo p 30 says ici
dailleurs ce ne sont pas seulement les fruits qui varient cest
aussi le feuillage et tout le port de la plante nanmoins je crois
quon la distinguera toujours facilement des deux autres espces si
lon veut ne pas perdre de vue les caractres diffrentiels que je
mefforce de faire ressortir ces caractres sont quelquefois peu
marqus il arrive meme que plusieurs dentre eux seffacent presque
entirement mais ii en reste toujours quelquesuns qui remettent
lobservateur sur la voie now let it be noted what a difference with
regard to the immutability of the socalled specific characters this
paragraph produces on the mind from that above quoted from m godron
i will add another remark naturalists continually assert that no
important organ varies but in saying this they unconsciously argue in
a vicious circle for if an organ let it be what it may is highly
variable it is regarded as unimportant and under a systematic point
of view this is quite correct but as long as constancy is thus taken
as the criterion of importance it will indeed be long before an
important organ can be shown to be inconstant the enlarged form of the
stigmas and their sessile position on the summit of the ovary must be
considered as important characters and were used by gasparini to
separate certain pumpkins as a distinct genus but naudin says p
20 these parts have no constancy and in the flowers of the turban
varieties of c maxima they sometimes resume their ordinary
structure again in c maxima the carpels p 19 which form the
turban project even as much as twothirds of their length out of the
receptacle and this latter part is thus reduced to a sort of platform
but this remarkable structure occurs only in certain varieties and
graduates into the common form in which the carpels are almost entirely
enveloped within the receptacle in  c moschata the ovarium p 50
varies greatly in shape being oval nearly spherical or cylindrical
more or less swollen in the upper part or constricted round the
middle and either straight or curved when the ovarium is short and
oval the interior structure does not differ from that of c maxima
and pepo but when it is elongated the carpels occupy only the
terminal and swollen portion i may add that in one variety of the
cucumber cucumis sativus the fruit regularly contains five carpels
instead of three140 i presume that it will not be disputed that we
here have instances of great variability in organs of the highest
physiological importance and with most plants of the highest
classificatory importance
sageret141 and naudin found that the cucumber c sativus could
not be crossed with any other species of the genus therefore no doubt
it is specifically distinct from the melon this will appear to most
persons a superfluous statement yet we hear from naudin142 that
there is a race of melons in which the fruit is so like that of the
cucumber both externally and internally that it is hardly possible
to distinguish the one from the other except by the leaves the
varieties of the melon seem to be endless for naudin after six years
study had not come to the end of them he divides them into ten
sections including numerous subvarieties which all intercross with
perfect ease143 of the forms considered by naudin to be varieties
botanists have made thirty distinct species and they had not the
slightest acquaintance with the multitude of new forms which have
appeared since their time nor is the creation of so many species at
all surprising when we consider how strictly their characters are
transmitted by seed and how wonderfully they differ in appearance
mira est quidem foliorum et habitus diversitas sed multo magis
fructuum says naudin the fruit is the valuable part and this in
accordance with the common rule is the most modified part some melons
are only as large as small plums others weigh as much as sixtysix
pounds one variety has a scarlet fruit another is not more than an
inch in diameter but sometimes more than a yard in length twisting
about in all directions like a serpent it is a singular fact that in
this latter variety many parts of the plant namely the stems the
footstalks of the female flowers the middle lobe of the leaves and
especially the ovarium as well as the mature fruit all show a strong
tendency to become elongated several varieties of the melon are
interesting from assuming the characteristic features of distinct
species and even of distinct though allied genera thus the
serpentmelon has some resemblance to the fruit of trichosanthes
anguina we have seen that other varieties closely resemble cucumbers
some egyptian varieties have their seeds attached to a portion of the
pulp and this is characteristic of certain wild forms lastly a
variety of melon from algiers is remarkable from announcing its
maturity by a spontaneous and almost sudden dislocation when deep
cracks suddenly appear and the fruit falls to pieces and this occurs
with the wild c momordica finally m naudin well remarks that this
extraordinary production of races and varieties by a single species
and their permanence when not interfered with by crossing are
phenomena well calculated to cause reflection
      useful and ornamental trees
trees deserve a passing notice on account of the numerous varieties
which they present differing in their precocity in their manner of
growth their foliage and bark thus of the common ash fraxinus
excelsior the catalogue of messrs lawson of edinburgh includes
twentyone varieties some of which differ much in their bark there is
a yellow a streaked reddishwhite a purple a wartbarked and a
fungousbarked variety144 of hollies no less than eightyfour
varieties are grown alongside each other in mr pauls nursery145 in
the case of trees all the recorded varieties as far as i can find
out have been suddenly produced by one single act of variation the
length of time required to raise many generations and the little value
set on the fanciful varieties explains how it is that successive
modifications have not been accumulated by selection hence also it
follows that we do not here meet with subvarieties subordinate to
varieties and these again subordinate to higher groups on the
continent however where the forests are more carefully attended to
than in england alph de candolle146 says that there is not a
forester who does not search for seeds from that variety which he
esteems the most valuable
our useful trees have seldom been exposed to any great change of
conditions they have not been richly manured and the english kinds
grow under their proper climate yet in examining extensive beds of
seedlings in nurserygardens considerable differences may be generally
observed in them and whilst touring in england i have been surprised
at the amount of difference in the appearance of the same species in
our hedgerows and woods but as plants vary so much in a truly wild
state it would be difficult for even a skilful botanist to pronounce
whether as i believe to be the case hedgerow trees vary more than
those growing in a primeval forest trees when planted by man in woods
or hedges do not grow where they would naturally be able to hold their
place against a host of competitors and are therefore exposed to
conditions not strictly natural even this slight change would probably
suffice to cause seedlings raised from such trees to be variable
whether or not our halfwild english trees as a general rule are more
variable than trees growing in their native forests there can hardly
be a doubt that they have yielded a greater number of stronglymarked
and singular variations of structure
in manner of growth we have weeping or pendulous varieties of the
willow ash elm oak and yew and other trees and this weeping habit
is sometimes inherited though in a singularly capricious manner in
the lombardy poplar and in certain fastigiate or pyramidal varieties
of thorns junipers oaks etc we have an opposite kind of growth
the hessian oak147 which is famous from its fastigiate habit and
size bears hardly any resemblance in general appearance to a common
oak its acorns are not sure to produce plants of the same habit
some however turn out the same as the parenttree another
fastigiate oak is said to have been found wild in the pyrenees and
this is a surprising circumstance it generally comes so true by seed
that de candolle considered it as specifically distinct148 the
fastigiate juniper j suecica likewise transmits its character by
seed149 dr falconer informs me that in the botanic gardens at
calcutta the great heat caused appletrees to become fastigiate and we
thus see the same result following from the effects of climate and from
some unknown cause150
in foliage we have variegated leaves which are often inherited dark
purple or red leaves as in the hazel barberry and beech the colour
in these two latter trees being sometimes strongly and sometimes weakly
inherited151 deeplycut leaves and leaves covered with prickles as
in the variety of the holly well called  ferox which is said to
reproduce itself by seed152 in fact nearly all the peculiar
varieties evince a tendency more or less strongly marked to reproduce
themselves by seed153 this is to a certain extent the case
according to bosc154 with three varieties of the elm namely the
broadleafed limeleafed and twisted elm in which latter the fibres
of the wood are twisted even with the heterophyllous hornbeam
carpinus betulus which bears on each twig leaves of two shapes
several plants raised from seed all retained the same
peculiarity155 i will add only one other remarkable case of
variation in foliage namely the occurrence of two subvarieties of
the ash with simple instead of pinnated leaves and which generally
transmit their character by seed156 the occurrence in trees
belonging to widely different orders of weeping and fastigiate
varieties and of trees bearing deeply cut variegated and purple
leaves shows that these deviations of structure must result from some
very general physiological laws
differences in general appearance and foliage not more strongly marked
than those above indicated have led good observers to rank as distinct
species certain forms which are now known to be mere varieties thus a
planetree long cultivated in england was considered by almost every
one as a north american species but is now ascertained by old records
as i am informed by dr hooker to be a variety so again the thuja
pendula or filiformis was ranked by such good observers as lambert
wallich and others as a true species but it is now known that the
original plants five in number suddenly appeared in a bed of
seedlings raised at mr loddiges nursery from t orientalis and
dr hooker has adduced excellent evidence that at turin seeds of t
pendula have reproduced the parent form t orientalis157
every one must have noticed how certain individual trees regularly put
forth and shed their leaves earlier or later than others of the same
species there is a famous horsechestnut in the tuileries which is
named from leafing so much earlier than the others there is also an
oak near edinburgh which retains its leaves to a very late period
these differences have been attributed by some authors to the nature of
the soil in which the trees grow but archbishop whately grafted an
early thorn on a late one and vice versa and both grafts kept to
their proper periods which differed by about a fortnight as if they
still grew on their own stocks158 there is a cornish variety of the
elm which is almost an evergreen and is so tender that the shoots are
often killed by the frost and the varieties of the turkish oak q
cerris may be arranged as deciduous subevergreen and
evergreen159
scotch fir pinus sylvestrisi allude to this tree as it bears on
the question of the greater variability of our hedgerow trees compared
with those under strictly natural conditions a wellinformed
writer160 states that the scotch fir presents few varieties in its
native scotch forests but that it varies much in figure and foliage
and in the size shape and colour of its cones when several
generations have been produced away from its native locality there is
little doubt that the highland and lowland varieties differ in the
value of their timber and that they can be propagated truly by seed
thus justifying loudons remark that a variety is often of as much
importance as a species and sometimes far more so161 i may mention
one rather important point in which this tree occasionally varies in
the classification of the conifer sections are founded on whether
two three or five leaves are included in the same sheath the scotch
fir has properly only two leaves thus enclosed but specimens have been
observed with groups of three leaves in a sheath162 besides these
differences in the semicultivated scotch fir there are in several
parts of europe natural or geographical races which have been ranked
by some authors as distinct species163 loudon164 considers p
pumilio with its several subvarieties as mughus nana etc
which differ much when planted in different soils and only come
tolerably true from seed as alpine varieties of the scotch fir if
this were proved to be the case it would be an interesting fact as
showing that dwarfing from long exposure to a severe climate is to a
certain extent inherited
the hawthorn cratgus oxyacantha has varied much besides endless
slighter variations in the form of the leaves and in the size
hardness fleshiness and shape of the berries loudon165 enumerates
twentynine wellmarked varieties besides those cultivated for their
pretty flowers there are others with goldenyellow black and whitish
berries others with woolly berries and others with recurved thorns
loudon truly remarks that the chief reason why the hawthorn has yielded
more varieties than most other trees is that nurserymen select any
remarkable variety out of the immense beds of seedlings which are
annually raised for making hedges the flowers of the hawthorn usually
include from one to three pistils but in two varieties named monogyna
and sibirica there is only a single pistil and dasso states that the
common thorn in spain is constantly in this state166 there is also a
variety which is apetalous or has its petals reduced to mere
rudiments the famous glastonbury thorn flowers and leafs towards the
end of december at which time it bears berries produced from an
earlier crop of flowers167 it is worth notice that several varieties
of the hawthorn as well as of the lime and juniper are very distinct
in their foliage and habit whilst young but in the course of thirty or
forty years become extremely like each other168 thus reminding us of
the wellknown fact that the deodar the cedar of lebanon and that of
the atlas are distinguished with the greatest ease whilst young but
with difficulty when old

i shall not for several reasons treat the variability of plants which
are cultivated for their flowers alone at any great length many of our
favourite kinds in their present state are the descendants of two or
more species crossed and commingled together and this circumstance
alone would render it difficult to detect the difference due to
variation for instance our roses petunias calceolarias fuchsias
verbenas gladioli pelargoniums etc certainly have had a multiple
origin a botanist well acquainted with the parentforms would probably
detect some curious structural differences in their crossed and
cultivated descendant and he would certainly observe many new and
remarkable constitutional peculiarities i will give a few instances
all relating to the pelargonium and taken chiefly from mr beck169
a famous cultivator of this plant some varieties require more water
than others some are very impatient of the knife if too greedily used
in making cuttings some when potted scarcely show a root at the
outside of the ball of the earth one variety requires a certain
amount of confinement in the pot to make it throw up a flowerstem
some varieties bloom well at the commencement of the season others at
the close one variety is known170 which will stand even pineapple
top and bottom heat without looking any more drawn than if it had
stood in a common greenhouse and blanche fleur seems as if made on
purpose for growing in winter like many bulbs and to rest all
summer these odd constitutional peculiarities would enable a plant in
a state of nature to become adapted to widely different circumstances
and climates
flowers possess little interest under our present point of view
because they have been almost exclusively attended to and selected for
their beautiful colour size perfect outline and manner of growth in
these particulars hardly one longcultivated flower can be named which
has not varied greatly what does a florist care for the shape and
structure of the organs of fructification unless indeed they add to
the beauty of the flower when this is the case flowers become
modified in important points stamens and pistils may be converted into
petals and additional petals may be developed as in all double
flowers the process of gradual selection by which flowers have been
rendered more and more double each step in the process of conversion
being inherited has been recorded in several instances in the
socalled double flowers of the composit the corollas of the central
florets are greatly modified and the modifications are likewise
inherited in the columbine aquilegia vulgaris some of the stamens
are converted into petals having the shape of nectaries one neatly
fitting into the other but in one variety they are converted into
simple petals171 in the hose in hose primul the calyx becomes
brightly coloured and enlarged so as to resemble a corolla and mr w
wooler informs me that this peculiarity is transmitted for he crossed
a common polyanthus with one having a coloured calyx172 and some of
the seedlings inherited the coloured calyx during at least six
generations in the henandchicken daisy the main flower is
surrounded by a brood of small flowers developed from buds in the axils
of the scales of the involucre a wonderful poppy has been described
in which the stamens are converted into pistils and so strictly was
this peculiarity inherited that out of 154 seedlings one alone
reverted to the ordinary and common type173 of the cockscomb
celosia cristata which is an annual there are several races in
which the flowerstem is wonderfully fasciated or compressed and one
has been exhibited174 actually eighteen inches in breadth peloric
races of gloxinia speciosa and antirrhinum majus can be propagated
by seed and they differ in a wonderful manner from the typical form
both in structure and appearance
a much more remarkable modification has been recorded by sir william
and dr hooker175 in begonia frigida this plant properly produces
male and female flowers on the same fascicles and in the female
flowers the perianth is superior but a plant at kew produced besides
the ordinary flowers others which graduated towards a perfect
hermaphrodite structure and in these flowers the perianth was
inferior to show the importance of this modification under a
classificatory point of view i may quote what prof harvey says
namely that had it occurred in a state of nature and had a botanist
collected a plant with such flowers he would not only have placed it
in a distinct genus from begonia but would probably have considered it
as the type of a new natural order this modification cannot in one
sense be considered as a monstrosity for analogous structures
naturally occur in other orders as with saxifrag and aristolochiace
the interest of the case is largely added to by mr c w crockers
observation that seedlings from the normal flowers produced plants
which bore in about the same proportion as the parentplant
hermaphrodite flowers having inferior perianths the hermaphrodite
flowers fertilised with their own pollen were sterile
if florists had attended to selected and propagated by seed other
modifications of structure besides those which are beautiful a host of
curious varieties would certainly have been raised and they would
probably have transmitted their characters so truly that the cultivator
would have felt aggrieved as in the case of culinary vegetables if
his whole bed had not presented a uniform appearance florists have
attended in some instances to the leaves of their plant and have thus
produced the most elegant and symmetrical patterns of white red and
green which as in the case of the pelargonium are sometimes strictly
inherited176 any one who will habitually examine highlycultivated
flowers in gardens and greenhouses will observe numerous deviations in
structure but most of these must be ranked as mere monstrosities and
are only so far interesting as showing how plastic the organisation
becomes under high cultivation from this point of view such works as
professor moquintandons tratologie are highly instructive
rosesthese flowers offer an instance of a number of forms generally
ranked as species namely r centifolia gallica alba damascena
spinosissima bracteata indica semperflorens moschata etc which
have largely varied and been intercrossed the genus rosa is a
notoriously difficult one and though some of the above forms are
admitted by all botanists to be distinct species others are doubtful
thus with respect to the british forms babington makes seventeen and
bentham only five species the hybrids from some of the most distinct
formsfor instance from r indica fertilised by the pollen of r
centifoliaproduce an abundance of seed i state this on the authority
of mr rivers177 from whose work i have drawn most of the following
statements as almost all the aboriginal forms brought from different
countries have been crossed and recrossed it is no wonder that
targionitozzetti in speaking of the common roses of the italian
gardens remarks that the native country and precise form of the wild
type of most of them are involved in much uncertainty178
nevertheless mr rivers in referring to r indica p 68 says that
the descendants of each group may generally be recognised by a close
observer the same author often speaks of roses as having been a little
hybridised but it is evident that in very many cases the differences
due to variation and to hybridisation can now only be conjecturally
distinguished
the species have varied both by seed and by bud such modified buds
being often called by gardeners sports in the following chapter i
shall fully discuss this latter subject and shall show that
budvariations can be propagated not only by grafting and budding but
often by seed whenever a new rose appears with any peculiar character
however produced if it yields seed mr rivers p 4 fully expects it
to become the parenttype of a new family the tendency to vary is so
strong in some kinds as in the village maid rivers p 16 that when
grown in different soils it varies so much in colour that it has been
thought to form several distinct kinds altogether the number of kinds
is very great thus m desportes in his catalogue for 1829 enumerates
2562 as cultivated in france but no doubt a large proportion of these
are merely nominal
it would be useless to specify the many points of difference between
the various kinds but some constitutional peculiarities may be
mentioned several french roses rivers p 12 will not succeed in
england and an excellent horticulturist179 remarks that even in
the same garden you will find that a rose that will do nothing under a
south wall will do well under a north one that is the case with paul
joseph here it grows strongly and blooms beautifully close to a north
wall for three years seven plants have done nothing under a south
wall many roses can be forced many are totally unfit for forcing
among which is general jacqueminot180 from the effects of crossing
and variation mr rivers enthusiastically anticipates p 87 that the
day will come when all our roses even mossroses will have evergreen
foliage brilliant and fragrant flowers and the habit of blooming from
june till november a distant view this seems but perseverance in
gardening will yet achieve wonders as assuredly it has already
achieved wonders
it may be worth while briefly to give the wellknown history of one
class of roses in 1793 some wild scotch roses r spinosissima were
transplanted into a garden181 and one of these bore flowers slightly
tinged with red from which a plant was raised with semimonstrous
flowers also tinged with red seedlings from this flower were
semidouble and by continued selection in about nine or ten years
eight subvarieties were raised in the course of less than twenty
years these double scotch roses had so much increased in number and
kind that twentysix wellmarked varieties classed in eight sections
were described by mr sabine in 1841182 it is said that three
hundred varieties could be procured in the nurserygardens near
glasgow and these are described as blush crimson purple red
marbled twocoloured white and yellow and as differing much in the
size and shape of the flower
pansy or heartsease viola tricolor etcthe history of this
flower seems to be pretty well known it was grown in evelyns garden
in 1687 but the varieties were not attended to till 18101812 when
lady monke together with mr lee the wellknown nurseryman
energetically commenced their culture and in the course of a few years
twenty varieties could be purchased183 at about the same period
namely in 1813 or 1814 lord gambier collected some wild plants and
his gardener mr thomson cultivated them together with some common
garden varieties and soon effected a great improvement the first
great change was the conversion of the dark lines in the centre of the
flower into a dark eye or centre which at that period had never been
seen but is now considered one of the chief requisites of a firstrate
flower in 1835 a book entirely devoted to this flower was published
and four hundred named varieties were on sale from these circumstances
this plant seemed to me worth studying more especially from the great
contrast between the small dull elongated irregular flowers of the
wild pansy and the beautiful flat symmetrical circular velvetlike
flowers more than two inches in diameter magnificently and variously
coloured which are exhibited at our shows but when i came to enquire
more closely i found that though the varieties were so modern yet
that much confusion and doubt prevailed about their parentage florists
believe that the varieties184 are descended from several wild stocks
namely v tricolor lutea grandiflora amna and altaica more
or less intercrossed and when i looked to botanical works to ascertain
whether these forms ought to be ranked as species i found equal doubt
and confusion viola altaica seems to be a distinct form but what
part it has played in the origin of our varieties i know not it is
said to have been crossed with v lutea viola amna185 is now
looked at by all botanists as a natural variety of v grandiflora
and this and v sudetica have been proved to be identical with v
lutea the latter and v tricolor including its admitted variety
v arvensis are ranked as distinct species by babington and
likewise by m gay186 who has paid particular attention to the
genus but the specific distinction between v lutea and tricolor
is chiefly grounded on the one being strictly and the other not
strictly perennial as well as on some other slight and unimportant
differences in the form of the stem and stipules bentham unites these
two forms and a high authority on such matters mr h c watson187
says that while v tricolor passes into v arvensis on the one
side it approximates so much towards v lutea and v curtisii on
the other side that a distinction becomes scarcely more easy between
them
hence after having carefully compared numerous varieties i gave up
the attempt as too difficult for any one except a professed botanist
most of the varieties present such inconstant characters that when
grown in poor soil or when flowering out of their proper season they
produced differently coloured and much smaller flowers cultivators
speak of this or that kind as being remarkably constant or true but by
this they do not mean as in other cases that the kind transmits its
character by seed but that the individual plant does not change much
under culture the principle of inheritance however does hold good to
a certain extent even with the fleeting varieties of the heartsease
for to gain good sorts it is indispensable to sow the seed of good
sorts nevertheless in almost every large seedbed a few almost wild
seedlings reappear through reversion on comparing the choicest
varieties with the nearest allied wild forms besides the difference in
the size outline and colour of the flowers the leaves sometimes
differ in shape as does the calyx occasionally in the length and
breadth of the sepals the differences in the form of the nectary more
especially deserve notice because characters derived from this organ
have been much used in the discrimination of most of the species of
viola in a large number of flowers compared in 1842 i found that in
the greater number the nectary was straight in others the extremity
was a little turned upwards or downwards or inwards so as to be
completely hooked in others instead of being hooked it was first
turned rectangularly downwards and then backwards and upwards in
others the extremity was considerably enlarged and lastly in some
the basal part was depressed becoming as usual laterally compressed
towards the extremity in a large number of flowers on the other hand
examined by me in 1856 from a nurserygarden in a different part of
england the nectary hardly varied at all now m gay says that in
certain districts especially in auvergne the nectary of the wild v
grandiflora varies in the manner just described must we conclude from
this that the cultivated varieties first mentioned were all descended
from v grandiflora and that the second lot though having the same
general appearance were descended from v tricolor of which the
nectary according to m gay is subject to little variation or is it
not more probable that both these wild forms would be found under other
conditions to vary in the same manner and degree thus showing that
they ought not to be ranked as specifically distinct
the dahlia has been referred to by almost every author who has
written on the variation of plants because it is believed that all the
varieties are descended from a single species and because all have
arisen since 1802 in france and since 1804 in england188 mr sabine
remarks that it seems as if some period of cultivation had been
required before the fixed qualities of the native plant gave way and
began to sport into those changes which now so delight us189 the
flowers have been greatly modified in shape from a flat to a globular
form anemone and ranunculuslike races190 which differ in the form
and arrangement of the florets have arisen also dwarfed races one of
which is only eighteen inches in height the seeds vary much in size
the petals are uniformly coloured or tipped or striped and present an
almost infinite diversity of tints seedlings of fourteen different
colours191 have been raised from the same plant yet as mr sabine
has remarked many of the seedlings follow their parents in colour
the period of flowering has been considerably hastened and this has
probably been effected by continued selection salisbury writing 1808
says that they then flowered from september to november in 1828 some
new dwarf varieties began flowering in june192 and mr grieve
informs me that the dwarf purple zelinda in his garden is in full bloom
by the middle of june and sometimes even earlier slight constitutional
differences have been observed between certain varieties thus some
kinds succeed much better in one part of england than in another193
and it has been noticed that some varieties require much more moisture
than others194
such flowers as the carnation common tulip and hyacinth which are
believed to be descended each from a single wild form present
innumerable varieties differing almost exclusively in the size form
and colour of the flowers these and some other anciently cultivated
plants which have been long propagated by offsets pipings bulbs
etc become so excessively variable that almost each new plant raised
from seed forms a new variety all of which to describe particularly
as old gerarde wrote in 1597 were to roll sisyphuss stone or to
number the sands
hyacinth hyacinthus orientalisit may however be worth while to
give a short account of this plant which was introduced into england
in 1596 from the levant195 the petals of the original flower says
mr paul were narrow wrinkled pointed and of a flimsy texture now
they are broad smooth solid and rounded the erectness breadth and
length of the whole spike and the size of the flowers have all
increased the colours have been intensified and diversified gerarde
in 1597 enumerates four and parkinson in 1629 eight varieties now
the varieties are very numerous and they were still more numerous a
century ago mr paul remarks that it is interesting to compare the
hyacinths of 1629 with those of 1864 and to mark the improvement two
hundred and thirtyfive years have elapsed since then and this simple
flower serves well to illustrate the great fact that the original forms
of nature do not remain fixed and stationary at least when brought
under cultivation while looking at the extremes we must not however
forget that there are intermediate stages which are for the most part
lost to us nature will sometimes indulge herself with a leap but as a
rule her march is slow and gradual he adds that the cultivator should
have in his mind an ideal of beauty for the realisation of which he
works with head and hand we thus see how clearly mr paul an
eminently successful cultivator of this flower appreciates the action
of methodical selection
in a curious and apparently trustworthy treatise published at
amsterdam196 in 1768 it is stated that nearly 2000 sorts were then
known but in 1864 mr paul found only 700 in the largest garden at
haarlem in this treatise it is said that not an instance is known of
any one variety reproducing itself truly by seed the white kinds
however now197 almost always yield white hyacinths and the yellow
kinds come nearly true the hyacinth is remarkable from having given
rise to varieties with bright blue pink and distinctly yellow
flowers these three primary colours do not occur in the varieties of
any other species nor do they often all occur even in the distinct
species of the same genus although the several kinds of hyacinths
differ but slightly from each other except in colour yet each kind has
its own individual character which can be recognised by a highly
educated eye thus the writer of the amsterdam treatise asserts p 43
that some experienced florists such as the famous g voorhelm seldom
failed in a collection of above twelve hundred sorts to recognise each
variety by the bulb alone this same writer mentions some few singular
variations for instance the hyacinth commonly produces six leaves
but there is one kind p 35 which scarcely ever has more than three
leaves another never more than five whilst others regularly produce
either seven or eight leaves a variety called la coryphee invariably
produces p 116 two flowerstems united together and covered by one
skin the flowerstem in another kind p 128 comes out of the ground
in a coloured sheath before the appearance of the leaves and is
consequently liable to suffer from frost another variety always pushes
a second flowerstem after the first has begun to develop itself
lastly white hyacinths with red purple or violet centres p 129
are the most liable to rot thus the hyacinth like so many previous
plants when long cultivated and closely watched is found to offer
many singular variations
in the two last chapters i have given in some detail the range of
variation and the history as far as known of a considerable number
of plants which have been cultivated for various purposes but some of
the most variable plants such as kidneybeans capsicum millets
sorghum etc have been passed over for botanists are not at all
agreed which kinds ought to rank as species and which as varieties and
the wild parentspecies are unknown198 many plants long cultivated
in tropical countries such as the banana have produced numerous
varieties but as these have never been described with even moderate
care they are here also passed over nevertheless a sufficient and
perhaps more than sufficient number of cases have been given so that
the reader may be enabled to judge for himself on the nature and great
amount of variation which cultivated plants have undergone

chapter xi on budvariation and on certain anomalous modes of
reproduction and variation
budvariation in the peach plum cherry vine gooseberry currant
and banana as shown by the modified fruitin flowers camellias
azaleas chrysanthemums roses etcon the running of the colour in
carnationsbudvariations in leavesvariations by suckers tubers and
bulbson the breaking of tulipsbudvariations graduate into changes
consequent on changed conditions of lifegrafthybridson the
segregation of the parental characters in seminal hybrids by
budvariationon the direct or immediate action of foreign pollen on
the motherplanton the effects in female animals of a previous
impregnation on the subsequent offspringconclusion and summary
this chapter will be chiefly devoted to a subject in many respects
important namely budvariation by this term i include all those
sudden changes in structure or appearance which occasionally occur in
fullgrown plants in their flowerbuds or leafbuds gardeners call
such changes sports but this as previously remarked is an
illdefined expression as it has often been applied to strongly marked
variations in seedling plants the difference between seminal and bud
reproduction is not so great as it at first appears for each bud is in
one sense a new and distinct individual but such individuals are
produced through the formation of various kinds of buds without the aid
of any special apparatus whilst fertile seeds are produced by the
concourse of the two sexual elements the modifications which arise
through budvariation can generally be propagated to any extent by
grafting budding cuttings bulbs etc and occasionally even by
seed some few of our most beautiful and useful productions have arisen
by budvariation
budvariations have as yet been observed only in the vegetable kingdom
but it is probable that if compound animals such as corals etc had
been subjected to a long course of domestication they would have
varied by buds for they resemble plants in many respects for
instance any new or peculiar character presented by a compound animal
is propagated by budding as occurs with differently coloured hydras
and as mr gosse has shown to be the case with a singular variety of a
true coral varieties of the hydra have also been grafted on other
varieties and have retained their character
i will in the first place give all the cases of bud variations which i
have been able to collect and afterwards show their importance1
these cases prove that those authors who like pallas attribute all
variability to the crossing either of distinct races or of distinct
individuals belonging to the same race but somewhat different from each
other are in error as are those authors who attribute all variability
to the mere act of sexual union nor can we account in all cases for
the appearance through budvariation of new characters by the principle
of reversion to longlost characters he who wishes to judge how far
the conditions of life directly cause each particular variation ought
to reflect well on the cases immediately to be given i will commence
with budvariations as exhibited in the fruit and then pass on to
flowers and finally to leaves
peach amygdalus persicain the last chapter i gave two cases of a
peachalmond and a doubleflowered almond which suddenly produced fruit
closely resembling true peaches i have also given many cases of
peachtrees producing buds which when developed into branches have
yielded nectarines we have seen that no less than six named and
several unnamed varieties of the peach have thus produced several
varieties of nectarine i have shown that it is highly improbable that
all these peachtrees some of which are old varieties and have been
propagated by the million are hybrids from the peach and nectarine
and that it is opposed to all analogy to attribute the occasional
production of nectarines on peachtrees to the direct action of pollen
from some neighbouring nectarinetree several of the cases are highly
remarkable because firstly the fruit thus produced has sometimes
been in part a nectarine and in part a peach secondly because
nectarines thus suddenly produced have reproduced themselves by seed
and thirdly because nectarines are produced from peachtrees from seed
as well as from buds the seed of the nectarine on the other hand
occasionally produces peaches and we have seen in one instance that a
nectarinetree yielded peaches by budvariation as the peach is
certainly the oldest or primary variety the production of peaches from
nectarines either by seeds or buds may perhaps be considered as a
case of reversion certain trees have also been described as
indifferently bearing peaches or nectarines and this may be considered
as budvariation carried to an extreme degree
the grosse mignonne peach at montreuil produced from a sporting
branch the grosse mignonne tardive a most excellent variety
which ripens its fruit a fortnight later than the parent tree and is
equally good2 this same peach has likewise produced by budvariation
the early grosse mignonne hunts large tawny nectarine originated
from hunts small tawny nectarine but not through seminal
reproduction3
plumsmr knight states that a tree of the yellow magnum bonum plum
forty years old which had always borne ordinary fruit produced a
branch which yielded red magnum bonums4 mr rivers of
sawbridgeworth informs me jan 1863 that a single tree out of 400 or
500 trees of the early prolific plum which is a purple kind descended
from an old french variety bearing purple fruit produced when about
ten years old bright yellow plums these differed in no respect except
colour from those on the other trees but were unlike any other known
kind of yellow plum5
cherry prunus cerasusmr knight has recorded ibid the case of
a branch of a mayduke cherry which though certainly never grafted
always produced fruit ripening later and more oblong than the fruit
on the other branches another account has been given of two mayduke
cherrytrees in scotland with branches bearing oblong and very fine
fruit which invariably ripened as in knights case a fortnight later
than the other cherries6 m carrire gives p 37 numerous
analogous cases and one of the same tree bearing three kinds of fruit
grapes vitis viniferathe black or purple frontignan in one case
produced during two successive years and no doubt permanently spurs
which bore white frontignan grapes in another case on the same
footstalk the lower berries were wellcoloured black frontignans
those next the stalk were white with the exception of one black and
one streaked berry and altogether there were fifteen black and twelve
white berries on the same stalk in another kind of grape black and
ambercoloured berries were produced in the same cluster7 count
odart describes a variety which often bears on the same stalk small
round and large oblong berries though the shape of the berry is
generally a fixed character8 here is another striking case given on
the excellent authority of m carrire9 a black hamburg grape
frankenthal was cut down and produced three suckers one of these
was layered and after a time produced much smaller berries which
always ripened at least a fortnight earlier than the others of the
remaining two suckers one produced every year fine grapes whilst the
other although it set an abundance of fruit matured only a few and
these of inferior quality
gooseberry ribes grossulariaa remarkable case has been described
by dr lindley10 of a bush which bore at the same time no less than
four kinds of berries namely hairy and redsmooth small and
redgreenand yellow tinged with buff the two latter kinds had a
different flavour from the red berries and their seeds were coloured
red three twigs on this bush grew close together the first bore three
yellow berries and one red the second twig bore four yellow and one
red and the third four red and one yellow mr laxton also informs me
that he has seen a red warrington gooseberry bearing both red and
yellow fruit on the same branch
currant ribes rubruma bush purchased as the champagne which is a
variety that bears blushcoloured fruit intermediate between red and
white produced during fourteen years on separate branches and mingled
on the same branch berries of the red white and champagne kinds11
the suspicion naturally arises that this variety may have originated
from a cross between a red and white variety and that the above
transformation may be accounted for by reversion to both parentforms
but from the foregoing complex case of the gooseberry this view is
doubtful in france a branch of a redcurrant bush about ten years
old produced near the summit five white berries and lower down
amongst the red berries one berry half red and half white12
alexander braun13 also has often seen branches on white curranttrees
bearing red berries
pear pyrus communisdureau de la malle states that the flowers on
some trees of an ancient variety the doyenn galeux were destroyed
by frost other flowers appeared in july which produced six pears
these exactly resembled in their skin and taste the fruit of a distinct
variety the gros doyenne blanc but in shape were like the
bonchrtien it was not ascertained whether this new variety could
be propagated by budding or grafting the same author grafted a
bonchrtien on a quince and it produced besides its proper fruit
an apparently new variety of a peculiar form with thick and rough
skin14
apple pyrus malusin canada a tree of the variety called pound
sweet produced15 between two of its proper fruit an apple which
was well russeted small in size different in shape and with a short
peduncle as no russet apple grew anywhere near this case apparently
cannot be accounted for by the direct action of foreign pollen m
carrire p 38 mentions an analogous instance i shall hereafter give
cases of appletrees which regularly produce fruit of two kinds or
halfandhalf fruit these trees are generally supposed and probably
with truth to be of crossed parentage and that the fruit reverts to
both parentforms
banana musa sapientiumsir r schomburgk states that he saw in st
domingo a raceme on the fig banana which bore towards the base 125
fruits of the proper kind and these were succeeded as is usual
higher up the raceme by barren flowers and these by 420 fruits
having a widely different appearance and ripening earlier than the
proper fruit the abnormal fruit closely resembled except in being
smaller that of the musa chinensis or cavendishii which has
generally been ranked as a distinct species16
flowersmany cases have been recorded of a whole plant or single
branch or bud suddenly producing flowers different from the proper
type in colour form size doubleness or other character half the
flower or a smaller segment sometimes changes colour
camelliathe myrtleleaved species c myrtifolia and two or
three varieties of the common species have been known to produce
hexagonal and imperfectly quadrangular flowers and the branches
producing such flowers have been propagated by grafting17 the pompon
variety often bears four distinguishable kinds of flowersthe pure
white and the redeyed which appear promiscuously the brindled pink
and the rosecoloured which may be kept separate with tolerable
certainty by grafting from the branches that bear them a branch
also on an old tree of the rosecoloured variety has been seen to
revert to the pure white colour an occurrence less common than the
departure from it18
cratgus oxyacanthaa dark pink hawthorn has been known to throw out
a single tuft of pure white blossoms19 and mr a clapham
nurseryman of bedford informs me that his father had a deep crimson
thorn grafted on a white thorn which during several years always
bore high above the graft bunches of white pink and deep crimson
flowers
azalea indica is well known often to produce new varieties by buds i
have myself seen several cases a plant of azalea indica variegata
has been exhibited bearing a truss of flowers of a ind gledstanesii
as true as could possibly be produced thus evidencing the origin of
that fine variety on another plant of a ind variegata a perfect
flower of a ind lateritia was produced so that both 
gledstanesii and lateritia no doubt originally appeared as sporting
branches of a ind variegata20
hibiscus paritium tricuspisa seedling of this plant when some
years old produced at saharunpore21 some branches which bore
leaves and flowers widely different from the normal form the
abnormal leaf is much less divided and not acuminated the petals are
considerably larger and quite entire there is also in the fresh state
a conspicuous large oblong gland full of a viscid secretion on the
back of each of the calycine segments dr king who subsequently had
charge of these gardens informs me that a tree of paritium tricuspis
probably the very same plant growing there had a branch buried in
the ground apparently by accident and this branch changed its
character wonderfully growing like a bush and producing flowers and
leaves resembling in shape those of another species viz  p
tiliaceum a small branch springing from this bush near the ground
reverted to the parentform both forms were extensively propagated
during several years by cuttings and kept perfectly true
altha roseaa double yellow hollyhock suddenly turned one year into
a pure white single kind subsequently a branch bearing the original
double yellow flowers reappeared in the midst of the branches of the
single white kind22
pelargoniumthese highly cultivated plants seem eminently liable to
budvariation i will give only a few wellmarked cases grtner has
seen23 a plant of p zonale with a branch having white edges which
remained constant for years and bore flowers of a deeper red than
usual generally speaking such branches present little or no
difference in their flowers thus a writer24 pinched off the leading
shoot of a seedling p zonale and it threw out three branches which
differed in the size and colour of their leaves and stems but on all
three branches the flowers were identical except in being largest in
the greenstemmed variety and smallest in that with variegated
foliage these three varieties were subsequently propagated and
distributed many branches and some whole plants of a variety called
compactum which bears orangescarlet flowers have been seen to
produce pink flowers25 hills hector which is a pale red variety
produced a branch with lilac flowers and some trusses with both red
and lilac flowers this apparently is a case of reversion for hills
hector was a seedling from a lilac variety26 here is a better case
of reversion a variety produced from a complicated cross after having
been propagated for five generations by seed yielded by budvariation
three very distinct varieties which were undistinguishable from plants
known to have been at some time ancestors of the plant in
question27 of all pelargoniums rollissons unique seems to be the
most sportive its origin is not positively known but is believed to
be from a cross mr salter of hammersmith states28 that he has
himself known this purple variety to produce the lilac the
rosecrimson or conspicuum and the red or coccineum varieties the
latter has also produced the rose damour so that altogether four
varieties have originated by bud variation from rollissons unique mr
salter remarks that these four varieties may now be considered as
fixed although they occasionally produce flowers of the original
colour this year  coccineum has pushed flowers of three different
colours red rose and lilac upon the same truss and upon other
trusses are flowers half red and half lilac besides these four
varieties two other scarlet uniques are known to exist both of which
occasionally produce lilac flowers identical with rollissons
unique29 but one at least of these did not arise through
budvariation but is believed to be a seedling from rollissons
unique30 there are also in the trade31 two other slightly
different varieties of unknown origin of rollissons unique so that
altogether we have a curiously complex case of variation both by buds
and seeds32 here is a still more complex case m rafarin states
that a pale rosecoloured variety produced a branch bearing deep red
flowers cuttings were taken from this sport from which 20 plants
were raised which flowered in 1867 when it was found that scarcely
two were alike some resembled the parentform some resembled the
sport some bore both kinds of flowers and even some of the petals on
the same flower were rosecoloured and others red33 an english wild
plant the geranium pratense when cultivated in a garden has been
seen to produce on the same plant both blue and white and striped blue
and white flowers34
chrysanthemumthis plant frequently sports both by its lateral
branches and occasionally by suckers a seedling raised by mr salter
has produced by budvariation six distinct sorts five different in
colour and one in foliage all of which are now fixed35 a variety
called cedo nulli bears small yellow flowers but habitually produces
branches with white flowers and a specimen was exhibited which prof
t dyer saw before the horticultural society the varieties which were
first introduced from china were so excessively variable that it was
extremely difficult to tell which was the original colour of the
variety and which was the sport the same plant would produce one
year only buffcoloured and next year only rosecoloured flowers and
then would change again or produce at the same time flowers of both
colours these fluctuating varieties are now all lost and when a
branch sports into a new variety it can generally be propagated and
kept true but as mr salter remarks every sport should be
thoroughly tested in different soils before it can be really considered
as fixed as many have been known to run back when planted in rich
compost but when sufficient care and time are expended in proving
there will exist little danger of subsequent disappointment mr
salter informs me that with all the varieties the commonest kind of
budvariation is the production of yellow flowers and as this is the
primordial colour these cases may be attributed to reversion mr
salter has given me a list of seven differently coloured
chrysanthemums which have all produced branches with yellow flowers
but three of them have also sported into other colours with any change
of colour in the flower the foliage generally changes in a
corresponding manner in lightness or darkness
another compositous plant namely centauria cyanus when cultivated in
a garden not unfrequently produces on the same root flowers of four
different colours viz blue white darkpurple and
particoloured36 the flowers of anthemis also vary on the same
plant37
rosesmany varieties of the rose are known or are believed to have
originated by budvariation38 the common double mossrose was
imported into england from italy about the year 173539 its origin is
unknown but from analogy it probably arose from the provence rose r
centifolia by budvariation for the branches of the common mossrose
have several times been known to produce provence roses wholly or
partially destitute of moss i have seen one such instance and several
others have been recorded40 mr rivers also informs me that he
raised two or three roses of the provence class from seed of the old
single mossrose41 and this latter kind was produced in 1807 by
budvariation from the common mossrose the white mossrose was also
produced in 1788 by an offset from the common red mossrose it was at
first pale blushcoloured but became white by continued budding on
cutting down the shoots which had produced this white mossrose two
weak shoots were thrown up and buds from these yielded the beautiful
striped mossrose the common mossrose has yielded by budvariation
besides the old single red mossrose the old scarlet semidouble
mossrose and the sageleaf mossrose which has a delicate
shelllike form and is of a beautiful blush colour it is now 1852
nearly extinct42 a white mossrose has been seen to bear a flower
half white and half pink43 although several mossroses have thus
certainly arisen by budvariation the greater number probably owe
their origin to seed of mossroses for mr rivers informs me that his
seedlings from the old single mossrose almost always produced
mossroses and the old single mossrose was as we have seen the
product by budvariation of the double mossrose originally imported
from italy that the original mossrose was the product of
budvariation is probable from the facts above given and from the de
meaux mossrose also a variety of r centifolia44 having appeared
as a sporting branch on the common rose de meaux prof caspary has
carefully described45 the case of a sixyearold white mossrose
which sent up several suckers one of which was thorny and produced
red flowers destitute of moss exactly like those of the provence rose
r centifolia another shoot bore both kinds of flowers and in
addition longitudinally striped flowers as this white mossrose had
been grafted on the provence rose prof caspary attributes the above
changes to the influence of the stock but from the facts already
given and from others to be given budvariation with reversion is
probably a sufficient explanation
many other instances could be added of roses varying by buds the white
provence rose apparently originated in this way46 m carrire states
p 36 that he himself knows of five varieties thus produced by the
baronne prvost the double and highlycoloured belladonna rose has
produced by suckers both semidouble and almost single white roses47
whilst suckers from one of these semidouble white roses reverted to
perfectly characterised belladonnas in st domingo varieties of the
china rose propagated by cuttings often revert after a year or two into
the old china rose48 many cases have been recorded of roses suddenly
becoming striped or changing their character by segments some plants
of the comtesse de chabrillant which is properly rosecoloured were
exhibited in 186249 with crimson flakes on a rose ground i have
seen the beauty of billiard with a quarter and with half the flower
almost white the austrian bramble r lutea not rarely50 produces
branches with pure yellow flowers and prof henslow has seen exactly
half the flower of a pure yellow and i have seen narrow yellow streaks
on a single petal of which the rest was of the usual copper colour
the following cases are highly remarkable mr rivers as i am informed
by him possessed a new french rose with delicate smooth shoots pale
glaucousgreen leaves and semidouble pale fleshcoloured flowers
striped with dark red and on branches thus characterised there
suddenly appeared in more than one instance the famous old rose called
the baronne prevost with its stout thorny shoots and immense
uniformly and richly coloured double flowers so that in this case the
shoots leaves and flowers all at once changed their character by
budvariation according to m verlot51 a variety called rosa
cannabifolia which has peculiarly shaped leaflets and differs from
every member of the family in the leaves being opposite instead of
alternate suddenly appeared on a plant of r alba in the gardens of
the luxembourg lastly a running shoot was observed by mr h
curtis52 on the old aime vibert noisette and he budded it on
celine thus a climbing aime vibert was first produced and afterwards
propagated
dianthusit is quite common with the sweet william d barbatus
to see differently coloured flowers on the same root and i have
observed on the same truss four differently coloured and shaded
flowers carnations and pinks d caryophyllus etc occasionally
vary by layers and some kinds are so little certain in character that
they are called by floriculturists catchflowers53 mr dickson has
ably discussed the running of particoloured or striped carnations
and says it cannot be accounted for by the compost in which they are
grown layers from the same clean flower would come part of them clean
and part foul even when subjected to precisely the same treatment and
frequently one flower alone appears influenced by the taint the
remainder coming perfectly clean54 this running of the
particoloured flowers apparently is a case of reversion by buds to the
original uniform tint of the species
i will briefly mention some other cases of budvariation to show how
many plants belonging to many orders have varied in their flowers and
many others might be added i have seen on a snapdragon antirrhinum
majus white pink and striped flowers on the same plant and
branches with striped flowers on a redcoloured variety on a double
stock matthiola incana i have seen a branch bearing single flowers
and on a dingypurple double variety of the wallflower cheiranthus
cheiri a branch which had reverted to the ordinary copper colour on
other branches of the same plant some flowers were exactly divided
across the middle one half being purple and the other coppery but
some of the smaller petals towards the centre of these same flowers
were purple longitudinally streaked with coppery colour or coppery
streaked with purple a cyclamen55 has been observed to bear white
and pink flowers of two forms the one resembling the persicum strain
and the other the coum strain oenothera biennis has been seen56
bearing flowers of three different colours the hybrid gladiolus
colvilii occasionally bears uniformly coloured flowers and one case
is recorded57 of all the flowers on a plant thus changing colour a
fuchsia has been seen58 bearing two kinds of flowers  mirabilis
jalapa is eminently sportive sometimes bearing on the same root pure
red yellow and white flowers and others striped with various
combinations of these three colours59 the plants of the mirabilis
which bear such extraordinarily variable flowers in most probably in
all cases owe their origin as shown by prof lecoq to crosses
between differently coloured varieties
leaves and shootschanges through budvariation in fruits and
flowers have hitherto been treated of incidentally some remarkable
modifications in the leaves and shoots of the rose and paritium and in
a lesser degree in the foliage of the pelargonium and chrysanthemum
have been noticed i will now add a few more cases of variation in
leafbuds verlot60 states that on aralia trifoliata which
properly has leaves with three leaflets branches frequently appear
bearing simple leaves of various forms these can be propagated by buds
or by grafting and have given rise as he states to several nominal
species
with respect to trees the history of but few of the many varieties
with curious or ornamental foliage is known but several probably have
originated by budvariation here is one casean old ashtree
fraxinus excelsior in the grounds of necton as mr mason states
for many years has had one bough of a totally different character to
the rest of the tree or of any other ashtree which i have seen being
shortjointed and densely covered with foliage it was ascertained
that this variety could be propagated by grafts61 the varieties of
some trees with cut leaves as the oakleaved laburnum the
parsleyleaved vine and especially the fernleaved beech are apt to
revert by buds to the common forms62 the fernlike leaves of the
beech sometimes revert only partially and the branches display here
and there sprouts bearing common leaves fernlike and variously
shaped leaves such cases differ but little from the socalled
heterophyllus varieties in which the tree habitually bears leaves of
various forms but it is probable that most heterophyllous trees have
originated as seedlings there is a subvariety of the weeping willow
with leaves rolled up into a spiral coil and mr masters states that a
tree of this kind kept true in his garden for twentyfive years and
then threw out a single upright shoot bearing flat leaves63
i have often noticed single twigs and branches on beech and other trees
with their leaves fully expanded before those on the other branches had
opened and as there was nothing in their exposure or character to
account for this difference i presume that they had appeared as
budvariations like the early and late fruitmaturing varieties of the
peach and nectarine
cryptogamic plants are liable to budvariation for fronds on the same
fern often display remarkable deviations of structure spores which
are of the nature of buds taken from such abnormal fronds reproduce
with remarkable fidelity the same variety after passing through the
sexual stage64
with respect to colour leaves often become by budvariation zoned
blotched or spotted with white yellow and red and this occasionally
occurs even with plants in a state of nature variegation however
appears still more frequently in plants produced from seed even the
cotyledons or seedleaves being thus affected65 there have been
endless disputes whether variegation should be considered as a disease
in a future chapter we shall see that it is much influenced both in
the case of seedlings and of mature plants by the nature of the soil
plants which have become variegated as seedlings generally transmit
their character by seed to a large proportion of their progeny and mr
salter has given me a list of eight genera in which this occurred66
sir f pollock has given me more precise information he sowed seed
from a variegated plant of ballota nigra which was found growing
wild and thirty per cent of the seedlings were variegated seed from
these latter being sown sixty per cent came up variegated when
branches become variegated by budvariation and the variety is
attempted to be propagated by seed the seedlings are rarely
variegated mr salter found this to be the case with plants belonging
to eleven genera in which the greater number of the seedlings proved
to be greenleaved yet a few were slightly variegated or were quite
white but none were worth keeping variegated plants whether
originally produced from seeds or buds can generally be propagated by
budding grafting etc but all are apt to revert by budvariation to
their ordinary foliage this tendency however differs much in the
varieties of even the same species for instance the goldenstriped
variety of euonymus japonicus is very liable to run back to the
greenleaved while the silverstriped variety hardly ever
changes67 i have seen a variety of the holly with its leaves
having a central yellow patch which had everywhere partially reverted
to the ordinary foliage so that on the same small branch there were
many twigs of both kinds in the pelargonium and in some other plants
variegation is generally accompanied by some degree of dwarfing as is
well exemplified in the dandy pelargonium when such dwarf varieties
sport back by buds or suckers to the ordinary foliage the dwarfed
stature still remains68 it is remarkable that plants propagated from
branches which have reverted from variegated to plain leaves69 do not
always or never as one observer asserts perfectly resemble the
original plainleaved plant from which the variegated branch arose it
seems that a plant in passing by budvariation from plain leaves to
variegated and back again from variegated to plain is generally in
some degree affected so as to assume a slightly different aspect
budvariation by suckers tubers and bulbsall the cases hitherto
given of budvariation in fruits flowers leaves and shoots have
been confined to buds on the stems or branches with the exception of a
few cases incidentally noticed of varying suckers in the rose
pelargonium and chrysanthemum i will now give a few instances of
variation in subterranean buds that is by suckers tubers and bulbs
not that there is any essential difference between buds above and
beneath the ground mr salter informs me that two variegated varieties
of phlox originated as suckers but i should not have thought these
worth mentioning had not mr salter found after repeated trials that
he could not propagate them by rootjoints whereas the variegated
tussilago farfara can thus be safely propagated70 but this latter
plant may have originated as a variegated seedling which would account
for its greater fixedness of character the barberry berberis
vulgaris offers an analogous case there is a wellknown variety with
seedless fruit which can be propagated by cuttings or layers but
suckers always revert to the common form which produces fruit
containing seeds71 my father repeatedly tried this experiment and
always with the same result i may here mention that maize and wheat
sometimes produce new varieties from the stock or root as does the
sugarcane72
turning now to tubers in the common potato solanum tuberosum a
single bud or eye sometimes varies and produces a new variety or
occasionally and this is a much more remarkable circumstance all the
eyes in a tuber vary in the same manner and at the same time so that
the whole tuber assumes a new character for instance a single eye in
a tuber of the old fortyfold potato which is a purple variety was
observed73 to become white this eye was cut out and planted
separately and the kind has since been largely propagated kemps
potato is properly white but a plant in lancashire produced two
tubers which were red and two which were white the red kind was
propagated in the usual manner by eyes and kept true to its new
colour and being found a more productive variety soon became widely
known under the name of  taylors fortyfold74 the old fortyfold
potato as already stated is a purple variety but a plant long
cultivated on the same ground produced not as in the case above
given a single white eye but a whole white tuber which has since
been propagated and keeps true75 several cases have been recorded of
large portions of whole rows of potatoes slightly changing their
character76
dahlias propagated by tubers under the hot climate of st domingo vary
much sir r schomburgk gives the case of the butterfly variety
which the second year produced on the same plant double and single
flowers here white petals edged with maroon there of a uniform deep
maroon77 mr bree also mentions a plant which bore two different
kinds of selfcoloured flowers as well as a third kind which partook
of both colours beautifully intermixed78 another case is described
of a dahlia with purple flowers which bore a white flower streaked with
purple79
considering how long and extensively many bulbous plants have been
cultivated and how numerous are the varieties produced from seed
these plants have not perhaps varied so much by offsetsthat is by
the production of new bulbsas might have been expected with the
hyacinth however several instances have been given by m carrire a
case also has been recorded of a blue variety which for three
successive years gave offsets producing white flowers with a red
centre80 another hyacinth bore81 on the same truss a perfectly
pink and a perfectly blue flower i have seen a bulb producing at the
same time one stalk or truss with fine blue flowers another with fine
red flowers and a third with blue flowers on one side and red on the
other several of the flowers being also longitudinally striped red and
blue
mr john scott informs me that in 1862 imatophyllum miniatum in the
botanic gardens of edinburgh threw up a sucker which differed from the
normal form in the leaves being tworanked instead of fourranked the
leaves were also smaller with the upper surface raised instead of
being channelled
in the propagation of tulips seedlings are raised called selfs or
breeders which consist of one plain colour on a white or yellow
bottom these being cultivated on a dry and rather poor soil become
broken or variegated and produce new varieties the time that elapses
before they break varies from one to twenty years or more and
sometimes this change never takes place82 the broken or variegated
colours which give value to all tulips are due to budvariation for
although the bybloemens and some other kinds have been raised from
several distinct breeders yet all the baguets are said to have come
from a single breeder or seedling this budvariation in accordance
with the views of mm vilmorin and verlot83 is probably an attempt
to revert to that uniform colour which is natural to the species a
tulip however which has already become broken when treated with too
strong manure is liable to flush or lose by a second act of reversion
its variegated colours some kinds as imperatrix florum are much more
liable than others to flushing and mr dickson maintains84 that this
can no more be accounted for than the variation of any other plant he
believes that english growers from care in choosing seed from broken
flowers instead of from plain flowers have to a certain extent
diminished the tendency in flowers already broken to flushing or
secondary reversion iris xiphium according to m carrire p 65
behaves in nearly the same manner as do so many tulips
during two consecutive years all the early flowers in a bed of
tigridia conchiflora85 resembled those of the old t pavonia but
the later flowers assumed their proper colour of fine yellow spotted
with crimson an apparently authentic account has been published86 of
two forms of hemerocallis which have been universally considered as
distinct species changing into each other for the roots of the
largeflowered tawny h fulva being divided and planted in a
different soil and place produced the smallflowered h flava as
well as some intermediate forms it is doubtful whether such cases as
these latter as well as the flushing of broken tulips and the
running of particoloured carnationsthat is their more or less
complete return to a uniform tintought to be classed under
budvariation or ought to be retained for the chapter in which i treat
of the direct action of the conditions of life on organic beings these
cases however have this much in budvariation that the change is
effected through buds and not through seminal reproduction but on the
other hand there is this differencethat in ordinary cases of
budvariation one bud alone changes whilst in the foregoing cases all
the buds on the same plant were modified together with the potato we
have seen an intermediate case for all the eyes in one tuber
simultaneously changed their character
i will conclude with a few allied cases which may be ranked either
under budvariation or under the direct action of the conditions of
life when the common hepatica is transplanted from its native woods
the flowers change colour even during the first year87 it is
notorious that the improved varieties of the heartsease viola
tricolor when transplanted often produce flowers widely different
in size form and colour for instance i transplanted a large
uniformlycoloured dark purple variety whilst in full flower and it
then produced much smaller more elongated flowers with the lower
petals yellow these were succeeded by flowers marked with large purple
spots and ultimately towards the end of the same summer by the
original large dark purple flowers the slight changes which some
fruittrees undergo from being grafted and regrafted on various
stocks88 were considered by andrew knight89 as closely allied to
sporting branches or budvariations again we have the case of
young fruittrees changing their character as they grow old seedling
pears for instance lose with age their spines and improve in the
flavour of their fruit weeping birchtrees when grafted on the common
variety do not acquire a perfect pendulous habit until they grow old
on the other hand i shall hereafter give the case of some weeping
ashes which slowly and gradually assumed an upright habit of growth
all such changes dependent on age may be compared with the changes
alluded to in the last chapter which many trees naturally undergo as
in the case of the deodar and cedar of lebanon which are unlike in
youth whilst they closely resemble each other in old age and as with
certain oaks and with some varieties of the lime and hawthorn90
grafthybridsbefore giving a summary on budvariation i will
discuss some singular and anomalous cases which are more or less
closely related to this same subject i will begin with the famous case
of adams laburnum or cytisus adami a form or hybrid intermediate
between two very distinct species namely c laburnum and
purpureus the common and purple laburnum but as this tree has often
been described i will be as brief as i can
throughout europe in different soils and under different climates
branches on this tree have repeatedly and suddenly reverted to the two
parent species in their flowers and leaves to behold mingled on the
same tree tufts of dingyred bright yellow and purple flowers borne
on branches having widely different leaves and manner of growth is a
surprising sight the same raceme sometimes bears two kinds of flowers
and i have seen a single flower exactly divided into halves one side
being bright yellow and the other purple so that one half of the
standardpetal was yellow and of larger size and the other half purple
and smaller in another flower the whole corolla was bright yellow but
exactly half the calyx was purple in another one of the dingyred
wingpetals had a narrow bright yellow stripe on it and lastly in
another flower one of the stamens which had become slightly
foliaceous was half yellow and half purple so that the tendency to
segregation of character or reversion affects even single parts and
organs91 the most remarkable fact about this tree is that in its
intermediate state even when growing near both parentspecies it is
quite sterile but when the flowers become pure yellow or pure purple
they yield seed i believe that the pods from the yellow flowers yield
a full complement of seed they certainly yield a larger number two
seedlings raised by mr herbert from such seed92 exhibited a purple
tinge on the stalks of their flowers but several seedlings raised by
myself resembled in every character the common laburnum with the
exception that some of them had remarkably long racemes these
seedlings were perfectly fertile that such purity of character and
fertility should be suddenly reacquired from so hybridised and sterile
a form is an astonishing phenomenon the branches with purple flowers
appear at first sight exactly to resemble those of c purpureus but
on careful comparison i found that they differed from the pure species
in the shoots being thicker the leaves a little broader and the
flowers slightly shorter with the corolla and calyx less brightly
purple the basal part of the standardpetal also plainly showed a
trace of the yellow stain so that the flowers at least in this
instance had not perfectly recovered their true character and in
accordance with this they were not perfectly fertile for many of the
pods contained no seed some produced one and very few contained as
many as two seeds whilst numerous pods on a tree of the pure c
purpureus in my garden contained three four and five fine seeds the
pollen moreover was very imperfect a multitude of grains being small
and shrivelled and this is a singular fact for as we shall
immediately see the pollengrains in the dingyred and sterile flowers
on the parenttree were in external appearance in a much better
state and included very few shrivelled grains although the pollen of
the reverted purple flowers was in so poor a condition the ovules were
well formed and the seeds when mature germinated freely with me mr
herbert raised plants from seeds of the reverted purple flowers and
they differed a very little from the usual state of c purpureus
some which i raised in the same manner did not differ at all either in
the character of their flowers or of the whole bush from the pure c
purpureus
prof caspary has examined the ovules of the dingyred and sterile
flowers in several plants of c adami on the continent93 and finds
them generally monstrous in three plants examined by me in england
the ovules were likewise monstrous the nucleus varying much in shape
and projecting irregularly beyond the proper coats the pollen grains
on the other hand judging from their external appearance were
remarkably good and readily protruded their tubes by repeatedly
counting under the microscope the proportional number of bad grains
prof caspary ascertained that only 25 per cent were bad which is a
less proportion than in the pollen of three pure species of cytisus in
their cultivated state viz c purpureus laburnum and alpinus
although the pollen of c adami is thus in appearance good it does
not follow according to m naudins observation94 on mirabilis that
it would be functionally effective the fact of the ovules of c
adami being monstrous and the pollen apparently sound is all the
more remarkable because it is opposed to what usually occurs not only
with most hybrids95 but with two hybrids in the same genus namely
in c purpureoelongatus and c alpinolaburnum in both these
hybrids the ovules as observed by prof caspary and myself were
wellformed whilst many of the pollengrains were illformed in the
latter hybrid 203 per cent and in the former no less than 848 per
cent of the grains were ascertained by prof caspary to be bad this
unusual condition of the male and female reproductive elements in c
adami has been used by prof caspary as an argument against this plant
being considered as an ordinary hybrid produced from seed but we
should remember that with hybrids the ovules have not been examined
nearly so frequently as the pollen and they may be much oftener
imperfect than is generally supposed dr e bornet of antibes
informs me through mr j traherne moggridge that with hybrid cisti
the ovarium is frequently deformed the ovules being in some cases
quite absent and in other cases incapable of fertilisation
several theories have been propounded to account for the origin of c
adami and for the transformations which it undergoes the whole case
has been attributed by some authors to budvariation but considering
the wide difference between c laburnum and purpureus both of
which are natural species and considering the sterility of the
intermediate form this view may be summarily rejected we shall
presently see that with hybrid plants two embryos differing in their
characters may be developed within the same seed and cohere and it has
been supposed that c adami thus originated many botanists maintain
that c adami is a hybrid produced in the common way by seed and
that it has reverted by buds to its two parentforms negative results
are not of much value but reisseck caspary and myself tried in vain
to cross c laburnum and purpureus when i fertilised the former
with pollen of the latter i had the nearest approach to success for
pods were formed but in sixteen days after the withering of the
flowers they fell off nevertheless the belief that c adami is a
spontaneously produced hybrid between these two species is supported by
the fact that such hybrids have arisen in this genus in a bed of
seedlings from c elongatus which grew near to c purpureus and
was probably fertilised by it through the agency of insects for these
as i know by experiment play an important part in the fertilisation of
the laburnum the sterile hybrid c purpureoelongatus appeared96
thus also waterers laburnum the c alpinolaburnum97
spontaneously appeared as i am informed by mr waterer in a bed of
seedlings
on the other hand we have a clear and distinct account given to
poiteau98 by m adam who raised the plant showing that c adami
is not an ordinary hybrid but is what may be called a grafthybrid
that is one produced from the united cellular tissue of two distinct
species m adam inserted in the usual manner a shield of the bark of
c purpureus into a stock of c laburnum and the bud lay dormant
as often happens for a year the shield then produced many buds and
shoots one of which grew more upright and vigorous with larger leaves
than the shoots of c purpureus and was consequently propagated now
it deserves especial notice that these plants were sold by m adam as
a variety of c purpureus before they had flowered and the account
was published by poiteau after the plants had flowered but before they
had exhibited their remarkable tendency to revert into the two parent
species so that there was no conceivable motive for falsification and
it is difficult to see how there could have been any error99 if we
admit as true m adams account we must admit the extraordinary fact
that two distinct species can unite by their cellular tissue and
subsequently produce a plant bearing leaves and sterile flowers
intermediate in character between the scion and stock and producing
buds liable to reversion in short resembling in every important
respect a hybrid formed in the ordinary way by seminal reproduction
i will therefore give all the facts which i have been able to collect
on the formation of hybrids between distinct species or varieties
without the intervention of the sexual organs for if as i am now
convinced this is possible it is a most important fact which will
sooner or later change the views held by physiologists with respect to
sexual reproduction a sufficient body of facts will afterwards be
adduced showing that the segregation or separation of the characters
of the two parentforms by budvariation as in the case of cytisus
adami is not an unusual though a striking phenomenon we shall
further see that a whole bud may thus revert or only half or some
smaller segment
the famous bizzarria orange offers a strictly parallel case to that
of cytisus adami the gardener who in 1644 in florence raised this
tree declared that it was a seedling which had been grafted and after
the graft had perished the stock sprouted and produced the bizzarria
gallesio who carefully examined several living specimens and compared
them with the description given by the original describer p
nato100 states that the tree produces at the same time leaves
flowers and fruit identical with the bitter orange and with the citron
of florence and likewise compound fruit with the two kinds either
blended together both externally and internally or segregated in
various ways this tree can be propagated by cuttings and retains its
diversified character the socalled trifacial orange of alexandria and
smyrna101 resembles in its general nature the bizzarria and differs
only in the orange being of the sweet kind this and the citron are
blended together in the same fruit or are separately produced on the
same tree nothing is known of its origin in regard to the bizzarria
many authors believe that it is a grafthybrid gallesio on the other
hand thinks that it is an ordinary hybrid with the habit of partially
reverting by buds to the two parentforms and we have seen that the
species in this genus often cross spontaneously
it is notorious that when the variegated jessamine is budded on the
common kind the stock sometimes produces buds bearing variegated
leaves mr rivers as he informs me has seen instances of this the
same thing occurs with the oleander102 mr rivers on the authority
of a trustworthy friend states that some buds of a goldenvariegated
ash which were inserted into common ashes all died except one but
the ashstocks were affected103 and produced both above and below
the points of insertion of the plates of bark bearing the dead buds
shoots which bore variegated leaves mr j anderson henry has
communicated to me a nearly similar case mr brown of perth observed
many years ago in a highland glen an ashtree with yellow leaves and
buds taken from this tree were inserted into common ashes which in
consequence were affected and produced the blotched breadalbane ash
this variety has been propagated and has preserved its character
during the last fifty years weeping ashes also were budded on the
affected stocks and became similarly variegated it has been
repeatedly proved that several species of abutilon on which the
variegated a thompsonii has been grafted become variegated104
many authors consider variegation as the result of disease and the
foregoing cases may be looked at as the direct result of the
inoculation of a disease or some weakness this has been almost proved
to be the case by morren in the excellent paper just referred to who
shows that even a leaf inserted by its footstalk into the bark of the
stock is sufficient to communicate variegation to it though the leaf
soon perishes even fully formed leaves on the stock of abutilon are
sometimes affected by the graft and become variegated variegation is
much influenced as we shall hereafter see by the nature of the soil
in which the plants are grown and it does not seem improbable that
whatever change in the sap or tissues certain soils induce whether or
not called a disease might spread from the inserted piece of bark to
the stock but a change of this kind cannot be considered to be of the
nature of a grafthybrid
there is a variety of the hazel with darkpurple leaves like those of
the copperbeech no one has attributed this colour to disease and it
apparently is only an exaggeration of a tint which may often be seen on
the leaves of the common hazel when this variety is grafted on the
common hazel105 it sometimes colours as has been asserted the
leaves below the graft although negative evidence is not of much
value i may add that mr rivers who has possessed hundreds of such
grafted trees has never seen an instance
grtner106 quotes two separate accounts of branches of dark and
whitefruited vines which had been united in various ways such as
being split longitudinally and then joined etc and these branches
produced distinct bunches of grapes of the two colours and other
bunches with berries either striped or of an intermediate and new
tint even the leaves in one case were variegated these facts are the
more remarkable because andrew knight never succeeded in raising
variegated grapes by fertilising white kinds by pollen of dark kinds
though as we have seen he obtained seedlings with variegated fruits
and leaves by fertilising a white variety by the already variegated
dark aleppo grape grtner attributes the abovequoted cases merely to
budvariation but it is a strange coincidence that the branches which
had been grafted in a peculiar manner should alone thus have varied
and h adorne de tscharner positively asserts that he produced the
described result more than once and could do so at will by splitting
and uniting the branches in the manner described by him
i should not have quoted the following case had not the author of des
jacinthes107 impressed me with the belief not only of his extensive
knowledge but of his truthfulness he says that bulbs of blue and red
hyacinths may be cut in two and that they will grow together and throw
up a united stem and this i have myself seen with flowers of the two
colours on the opposite sides but the remarkable point is that
flowers are sometimes produced with the two colours blended together
which makes the case closely analogous with that of the blended colours
of the grapes on the united vine branches
in the case of roses it is supposed that several grafthybrids have
been formed but there is much doubt about these cases owing to the
frequency of ordinary budvariations the most trustworthy instance
known to me is one recorded by mr poynter108 who assures me in a
letter of the entire accuracy of the statement  rosa devoniensis had
been budded some years previously on a white banksian rose and from
the much enlarged point of junction whence the devoniensis and
banksian still continued to grow a third branch issued which was
neither pure banksian nor pure devoniensis but partook of the
character of both the flowers resembled but were superior in
character to those of the variety called lamarque one of the
noisettes while the shoots were similar in their manner of growth to
those of the banksian rose with the exception that the longer and more
robust shoots were furnished with prickles this rose was exhibited
before the floral committee of the horticultural society of london dr
lindley examined it and concluded that it had certainly been produced
by the mingling of r banksi with some rose like r devoniensis
for while it was very greatly increased in vigour and in size of all
the parts the leaves were halfway between a banksian and teascented
rose it appears that rosegrowers were previously aware that the
banksian rose sometimes affects other roses as mr poynters new
variety is intermediate in its fruit and foliage between the stock and
scion and as it arose from the point of junction between the two it
is very improbable that it owes its origin to mere budvariation
independently of the mutual influence of the stock and scion
lastly with respect to potatoes mr r trail stated in 1867 before
the botanical society of edinburgh and has since given me fuller
information that several years ago he cut about sixty blue and white
potatoes into halves through the eyes or buds and then carefully
joined them destroying at the same time the other eyes some of these
united tubers produced white and others blue tubers some however
produced tubers partly white and partly blue and the tubers from about
four or five were regularly mottled with the two colours in these
latter cases we may conclude that a stem had been formed by the union
of the bisected buds that is by grafthybridisation
in the botanische zeitung may 16 1868 professor hildebrand gives
an account with a coloured figure of his experiments on two varieties
which were found during the same season to be constant in character
namely a somewhat elongated roughskinned red potato and a rounded
smooth white one he inserted buds reciprocally into both kinds
destroying the other buds he thus raised two plants and each of these
produced a tuber intermediate in character between the two
parentforms that from the red bud grafted into the white tuber was
at one end red and rough as the whole tuber ought to have been if not
affected in the middle it was smooth with red stripes and at the
other end smooth and altogether white like that of the stock
mr taylor who had received several accounts of potatoes having been
grafted by wedgeshaped pieces of one variety inserted into another
though sceptical on the subject made twentyfour experiments which he
described in detail before the horticultural society109 he thus
raised many new varieties some like the graft or like the stock
others having an intermediate character several persons witnessed the
digging up of the tubers from these grafthybrids and one of them mr
jameson a large dealer in potatoes writes thus they were such a
mixed lot as i have never before or since seen they were of all
colours and shapes some very ugly and some very handsome another
witness says some were round some kidney pinkeyed kidney piebald
and mottled red and purple of all shapes and sizes some of these
varieties have been found valuable and have been extensively
propagated mr jameson took away a large piebald potato which he cut
into five sets and propagated these yielded round white red and
piebald potatoes
mr fitzpatrick followed a different plan110 he grafted together not
the tubers but the young stems of varieties producing black white and
red potatoes the tubers borne by three of these twin or united plants
were coloured in an extraordinary manner one was almost exactly half
black and half white so that some persons on seeing it thought that
two potatoes had been divided and rejoined other tubers were half red
and half white or curiously mottled with red and white or with red
and black according to the colours of the graft and stock
the testimony of mr fenn is of much value as he is a well known
potatogrower who has raised many new varieties by crossing different
kinds in the ordinary manner he considers it demonstrated that new
intermediate varieties can be produced by grafting the tubers though
he doubts whether such will prove valuable111 he made many trials
and laid the results exhibiting specimens before the horticultural
society not only were the tubers affected some being smooth and white
at one end and rough and red at the other but the stems and leaves
were modified in their manner of growth colour and precocity some of
these grafthybrids after being propagated for three years still showed
in their haulms their new character different from that of the kind
from which the eyes had been taken mr fenn gave twelve of the tubers
of the third generation to mr alex dean who grew them and was thus
converted into a believer in grafthybridisation having previously
been a complete sceptic for comparison he planted the pure
parentforms alongside the twelve tubers and found that many of the
plants from the latter112 were intermediate between the two
parentforms in precocity in the tallness uprightness jointing and
robustness of the stems and in the size and colour of the leaves
another experimentalist mr rintoul grafted no less than fiftynine
tubers which differed in shape some being kidneys in smoothness and
colour113 and many of the plants thus raised were intermediate in
the tubers as well as in the haulms he describes the more striking
cases
in 1871 i received a letter from mr merrick of boston usa who
states that mr fearing burr a very careful experimenter and author
of a much valued book the garden vegetables of america has succeeded
in producing distinctly mottled and most curious potatoesevidently
grafthybrids by inserting eyes from blue or red potatoes into the
substance of white ones after removing the eyes of the latter i have
seen the potatoes and they are very curious
we will now turn to the experiments made in germany since the
publication of prof hildebrands paper herr magnus relates114 the
results of numerous trials made by herren reuter and lindemuth both
attached to the royal gardens of berlin they inserted the eyes of red
potatoes into white ones and vice versa many different forms
partaking of the characters of the inserted bud and of the stock were
thus obtained for instance some of the tubers were white with red
eyes
herr magnus also exhibited in the following year before the same
society nov 19 1872 the produce of grafts between black white
and red potatoes made by dr neubert these were made by uniting not
the tubers but the young stems as was done by mr fitzpatrick the
result was remarkable inasmuch as all the tubers thus produced were
intermediate in character though in a variable degree those between
the black and the white or the red were the most striking in
appearance some from between the white and red had one half of one
colour and the other half of the other colour
at the next meeting of the society herr magnus communicated the results
of dr heimanns experiments in grafting together the tubers of red
saxon blue and elongated white potatoes the eyes were removed by a
cylindrical instrument and inserted into corresponding holes in other
varieties the plants thus produced yielded a great number of tubers
which were intermediate between the two parentforms in shape and in
the colour both of the flesh and skin
herr reuter experimented115 by inserting wedges of the elongated
white mexican potato into a black kidney potato both sorts are known
to be very constant and differ much not only in form and colour but
in the eyes of the black kidney being deeply sunk whereas those of the
white mexican are superficial and of a different shape the tubers
produced by these hybrids were intermediate in colour and form and
some which resembled in form the graft ie the mexican had eyes
deeply sunk and of the same shape as in the stock or black kidney
any one who will attentively consider the abstract now given of the
experiments made by many observers in several countries will i think
be convinced that by grafting two varieties of the potato together in
various ways hybridised plants can be produced it should be observed
that several of the experimentalists are scientific horticulturists
and some of them potatogrowers on a large scale who though
beforehand sceptical have been fully convinced of the possibility
even of the ease of making grafthybrids the only way of escaping
from this conclusion is to attribute all the many recorded cases to
simple budvariation undoubtedly the potato as we have seen in this
chapter does sometimes though not often vary by buds but it should
be especially noted that it is experienced potatogrowers whose
business it is to look out for new varieties who have expressed
unbounded astonishment at the number of new forms produced by
grafthybridisation it may be argued that it is merely the operation
of grafting and not the union of two kinds which causes so
extraordinary an amount of budvariation but this objection is at once
answered by the fact that potatoes are habitually propagated by the
tubers being cut into pieces and the sole difference in the case of
grafthybrids is that either a half or a smaller segment or a cylinder
is placed in close opposition with the tissue of another variety
moreover in two cases the young stems were grafted together and the
plants thus united yielded the same results as when the tubers were
united it is an argument of the greatest weight that when varieties
are produced by simple budvariation they frequently present quite new
characters whereas in all the numerous cases above given as herr
magnus likewise insists the grafthybrids are intermediate in
character between the two forms employed that such a result should
follow if the one kind did not affect the other is incredible
characters of all kinds are affected by graft hybridisation in
whatever way the grafting may have been effected the plants thus
raised yield tubers which partake of the widely different colours
form state of surface position and shape of the eye of the parents
and according to two careful observers they are also intermediate in
certain constitutional peculiarities but we should bear in mind that
in all the varieties of the potato the tubers differ much more than
any other part
the potato affords the best evidence of the possibility of the
formation of grafthybrids but we must not overlook the account given
of the origin of the famous cytisus adami by m adam who had no
conceivable motive for deception and the exactly parallel account of
the origin of the bizzarria orange namely by grafthybridisation nor
must the cases be undervalued in which different varieties or species
of vines hyacinths and roses have been grafted together and have
yielded intermediate forms it is evident that grafthybrids can be
made much more easily with some plants as the potato than with
others for instance our common fruit trees for these latter have been
grafted by the million during many centuries and though the graft is
often slightly affected it is very doubtful whether this may not be
accounted for merely by a more or less free supply of nutriment
nevertheless the cases above given seem to me to prove that under
certain unknown conditions grafthybridisation can be effected
herr magnus asserts with much truth that grafthybrids resemble in all
respects seminal hybrids including their great diversity of character
there is however a partial exception inasmuch as the characters of
the two parent forms are not often homogeneously blended together in
grafthybrids they much more commonly appear in a segregated
conditionthat is in segments either at first or subsequently
through reversion it would seem that the reproductive elements are not
so completely blended by grafting as by sexual generation but
segregation of this kind occurs by no means rarely as will be
immediately shown in seminal hybrids finally it must i think be
admitted that we learn from the foregoing cases a highly important
physiological fact namely that the elements that go to the production
of a new being are not necessarily formed by the male and female
organs they are present in the cellular tissue in such a state that
they can unite without the aid of the sexual organs and thus give rise
to a new bud partaking of the characters of the two parentforms
on the segregation of the parental characters in seminal hybrids by
budvariationi will now give a sufficient number of cases to show
that segregation of this kind namely by buds may occur in ordinary
hybrids raised from seed
hybrids were raised by grtner between tropolum minus and
majus116 which at first produced flowers intermediate in size
colour and structure between their two parents but later in the
season some of these plants produced flowers in all respects like those
of the motherform mingled with flowers still retaining the usual
intermediate condition a hybrid cereus between c speciosissimus and
phyllanthus117 plants which are widely different in appearance
produced for the first three years angular fivesided stems and then
some flat stems like those of c phyllanthus klreuter also gives
cases of hybrid lobelias and verbascums which at first produced
flowers of one colour and later in the season flowers of a different
colour118 naudin119 raised forty hybrids from datura lvis
fertilised by d stramonium and three of these hybrids produced many
capsules of which a half or quarter or lesser segment was smooth and
of small size like the capsule of the pure d lvis the remaining
part being spinose and of larger size like the capsule of the pure d
stramonium from one of these composite capsules plants perfectly
resembling both parentforms were raised
turning now to varieties a  seedling apple conjectured to be of
crossed parentage has been described in france120 which bears fruit
with one half larger than the other of a red colour acid taste and
peculiar odour the other side being greenishyellow and very sweet it
is said scarcely ever to include perfectly developed seed i suppose
that this is not the same tree as that which gaudichaud121 exhibited
before the french institute bearing on the same branch two distinct
kinds of apples one a reinette rouge and the other like a reinette
canada jauntre this doublebearing variety can be propagated by
grafts and continues to produce both kinds its origin is unknown the
rev j d la touche sent me a coloured drawing of an apple which he
brought from canada of which half surrounding and including the whole
of the calyx and the insertion of the footstalk is green the other
half being brown and of the nature of the pomme gris apple with the
line of separation between the two halves exactly defined the tree was
a grafted one and mr la touche thinks that the branches which bore
this curious apple sprung from the point of junction of the graft and
stock had this fact been ascertained the case would probably have
come into the class of grafthybrids already given but the branch may
have sprung from the stock which no doubt was a seedling
prof h lecoq who has made a great number of crossings between the
differently coloured varieties of mirabilis jalapa122 finds that
in the seedlings the colours rarely combine but form distinct stripes
or half the flower is of one colour and half of a different colour
some varieties regularly bear flowers striped with yellow white and
red but plants of such varieties occasionally produce on the same root
branches with uniformly coloured flowers of all three tints and other
branches with halfandhalf coloured flowers and others with marbled
flowers gallesio123 crossed reciprocally white and red carnations
and the seedlings were striped but some of the striped plants also
bore entirely white and entirely red flowers some of these plants
produced one year red flowers alone and in the following year striped
flowers or conversely some plants after having borne for two or
three years striped flowers would revert and bear exclusively red
flowers it may be worth mentioning that i fertilised the purple
sweetpea lathyrus odoratus with pollen from the lightcoloured
painted lady seedlings raised from the same pod were not
intermediate in character but perfectly resembled either parent later
in the summer the plants which had at first borne flowers identical
with those of the painted lady produced flowers streaked and
blotched with purple showing in these darker marks a tendency to
reversion to the mothervariety andrew knight124 fertilised two
white grapes with pollen of the aleppo grape which is darkly
variegated both in its leaves and fruit the result was that the young
seedlings were not at first variegated but all became variegated
during the succeeding summer besides this many produced on the same
plant bunches of grapes which were all black or all white or
leadcoloured striped with white or white dotted with minute black
stripes and grapes of all these shades could frequently be found on
the same footstalk
i will append a very curious case not of budvariation but of two
cohering embryos different in character and contained within the same
seed a distinguished botanist mr g h thwaites125 states that a
seed from fuchsia coccinea fertilised by f fulgens contained two
embryos and was a true vegetable twin the two plants produced from
the two embryos were extremely different in appearance and character
though both resembled other hybrids of the same parentage produced at
the same time these twin plants were closely coherent below the two
pairs of cotyledonleaves into a single cylindrical stem so that they
had subsequently the appearance of being branches on one trunk had
the two united stems grown up to their full height instead of dying a
curiously mixed hybrid would have been produced a mongrel melon
described by sageret126 may perhaps have thus originated for the two
main branches which arose from two cotyledonbuds produced very
different fruiton the one branch like that of the paternal variety
and on the other branch like to a certain extent that of the maternal
variety the melon of china
in most of these cases of crossed varieties and in some of the cases
of crossed species the colours proper to both parents appeared in the
seedlings as soon as they first flowered in the form of stripes or
larger segments or as whole flowers or fruit of different kinds borne
on the same plant and in this case the appearance of the two colours
cannot strictly be said to be due to reversion but to some incapacity
of fusion when however the later flowers or fruit produced during
the same season or during a succeeding year or generation become
striped or halfandhalf etc the segregation of the two colours is
strictly a case of reversion by budvariation whether all the many
recorded cases of striped flowers and fruit are due to previous
hybridisation and reversion is by no means clear for instance with
peaches and nectarines mossroses etc in a future chapter i shall
show that with animals of crossed parentage the same individual has
been known to change its character during growth and to revert to one
of its parents which it did not at first resemble finally from the
various facts now given there can be no doubt that the same individual
plant whether a hybrid or a mongrel sometimes returns in its leaves
flowers and fruit either wholly or by segments to both parentforms
on the direct or immediate action of the male element on the mother
formanother remarkable class of facts must be here considered
firstly because they have a high physiological importance and
secondly because they have been supposed to account for some cases of
budvariation i refer to the direct action of the male element not in
the ordinary way on the ovules but on certain parts of the female
plant or in case of animals on the subsequent progeny of the female by
a second male i may premise that with plants the ovarium and the coats
of the ovules are obviously parts of the female and it could not have
been anticipated that they would have been affected by the pollen of a
foreign variety or species although the development of the embryo
inside the embryonic sack inside the ovule and ovarium of course
depends on the male element
even as long ago as 1729 it was observed127 that white and blue
varieties of the pea when planted near each other mutually crossed
no doubt through the agency of bees and in the autumn blue and white
peas were found within the same pods wiegmann made an exactly similar
observation in the present century the same result has followed
several times when a variety with peas of one colour has been
artificially crossed by a differentlycoloured variety128 these
statements led grtner who was highly sceptical on the subject
carefully to try a long series of experiments he selected the most
constant varieties and the result conclusively showed that the colour
of the skin of the pea is modified when pollen of a differently
coloured variety is used this conclusion has since been confirmed by
experiments made by the rev j m berkeley129
mr laxton of stamford whilst making experiments on peas for the
express purpose of ascertaining the influence of foreign pollen on the
motherplant has recently130 observed an important additional fact
he fertilised the tall sugarpea which bears very thin green pods
becoming brownishwhite when dry with pollen of the purplepodded pea
which as its name expresses has darkpurple pods with very thick
skin becoming pale reddish purple when dry mr laxton has cultivated
the tall sugarpea during twenty years and has never seen or heard of
it producing a purple pod nevertheless a flower fertilised by pollen
from the purplepod yielded a pod clouded with purplishred which mr
laxton kindly gave to me a space of about two inches in length towards
the extremity of the pod and a smaller space near the stalk were thus
coloured on comparing the colour with that of the purple pod both
pods having been first dried and then soaked in water it was found to
be identically the same and in both the colour was confined to the
cells lying immediately beneath the outer skin of the pod the valves
of the crossed pod were also decidedly thicker and stronger than those
of the pods of the motherplant but this may possibly have been an
accidental circumstance for i know not how far their thickness is a
variable character in the tall sugarpea
the peas of the tall sugarpea when dry are pale greenishbrown
thickly covered with dots of dark purple so minute as to be visible
only through a lens and mr laxton has never seen or heard of this
variety producing a purple pea but in the crossed pod one of the peas
was of a uniform beautiful violetpurple tint and a second was
irregularly clouded with pale purple the colour lies in the outer of
the two coats which surround the pea as the peas of the purplepodded
variety when dry are of a pale greenishbuff it would at first appear
that this remarkable change of colour in the peas in the crossed pod
could not have been caused by the direct action of the pollen of the
purplepod but when we bear in mind that this latter variety has
purple flowers purple marks on its stipules and purple pods and that
the tall sugarpea likewise has purple flowers and stipules and
microscopically minute purple dots on the peas we can hardly doubt
that the tendency to the production of purple in both parents has in
combination modified the colour of the peas in the crossed pod after
having examined these specimens i crossed the same two varieties and
the peas in one pod but not the pods themselves were clouded and
tinted with purplishred in a much more conspicuous manner than the
peas in the uncrossed pods produced at the same time by the same
plants i may notice as a caution that mr laxton sent me various other
crossed peas slightly or even greatly modified in colour but the
change in these cases was due as had been suspected by mr laxton to
the altered colour of the cotyledons seen through the transparent
coats of the peas and as the cotyledons are parts of the embryo these
cases are not in any way remarkable
turning now to the genus matthiola the pollen of one kind of stock
sometimes affects the colour of the seeds of another kind used as the
motherplant i give the following case the more readily as grtner
doubted similar statements previously made with respect to the stock by
other observers a wellknown horticulturist major trevor clarke
informs me131 that the seeds of the large redflowered biennial
stock matthiola annua cocardeau of the french are light brown
and those of the purple branching queen stock m incana are
violetblack and he found that when flowers of the red stock were
fertilised by pollen from the purple stock they yielded about fifty
per cent of black seeds he sent me four pods from a red flowered
plant two of which had been fertilised by their own pollen and they
included pale brown seed and two which had been crossed by pollen from
the purple kind and they included seeds all deeply tinged with black
these latter seeds yielded purpleflowered plants like their father
whilst the pale brown seeds yielded normal redflowered plants and
major clarke by sowing similar seeds has observed on a greater scale
the same result the evidence in this case of the direct action of the
pollen of one species on the colour of the seeds of another species
appears to me conclusive
gallesio132 fertilised the flowers of an orange with pollen from the
lemon and one fruit thus produced bore a longitudinal stripe of peel
having the colour flavour and other characters of the lemon mr
anderson133 fertilised a greenfleshed melon with pollen from a
scarletfleshed kind in two of the fruits a sensible change was
perceptible and four other fruits were somewhat altered both
internally and externally the seeds of the two firstmentioned fruits
produced plants partaking of the good properties of both parents in
the united states where cucurbitace are largely cultivated it is the
popular belief134 that the fruit is thus directly affected hy foreign
pollen and i have received a similar statement with respect to the
cucumber in england it is believed that grapes have been thus affected
in colour size and shape in france a palecoloured grape had its
juice tinted by the pollen of the darkcoloured teinturier in germany
a variety bore berries which were affected by the pollen of two
adjoining kinds some of the berries being only partially affected or
mottled135
as long ago as 1751136 it was observed that when
differentlycoloured varieties of maize grew near each other they
mutually affected each others seeds and this is now a popular belief
in the united states dr savi137 tried the experiment with care he
sowed yellow and blackseeded maize together and on the same ear some
of the seeds were yellow some black and some mottled the differently
coloured seeds being arranged irregularly or in rows prof hildebrand
has repeated the experiment138 with the precaution of ascertaining
that the motherplant was true a kind bearing yellow grains was
fertilised with pollen of a kind having brown grains and two ears
produced yellow grains mingled with others of a dirty violet tint a
third ear had only yellow grains but one side of the spindle was
tinted of a reddishbrown so that here we have the important fact of
the influence of the foreign pollen extending to the axis mr arnold
in canada varied the experiment in an interesting manner a female
flower was subjected first to the action of pollen from a yellow
variety and then to that from a white variety the result was an ear
each grain of which was yellow below and white above139 with other
plants it has occasionally been observed that the crossed offspring
showed the influence of two kinds of pollen but in this case the two
kinds affected the motherplant
mr sabine states140 that he has seen the form of the nearly globular
seedcapsule of amaryllis vittata altered by the application of the
pollen of another species of which the capsule has gibbous angles
with an allied genus a wellknown botanist maximowicz has described
in detail the striking results of reciprocally fertilising lilium
bulbiferum and  davuricum with each others pollen each species
produced fruit not like its own but almost identical with that of the
pollenbearing species but from an accident only the fruit of the
latter species was carefully examined the seeds were intermediate in
the development of their wings141
fritz mller fertilised cattleya leopoldi with pollen of epidendron
cinnabarinum and the capsules contained very few seeds but these
presented a most wonderful appearance which from the description
given two botanists hildebrand and maximowicz attribute to the
direct action of the pollen of the epidendron142
mr j anderson henry143 crossed rhododendron dalhousi with the
pollen of r nuttallii which is one of the largestflowered and
noblest species of the genus the largest pod produced by the former
species when fertilised with its own pollen measured 1 inch in
length and 1 in girth whilst three of the pods which had been
fertilised by pollen of r nuttallii measured 158 inch in length
and no less than 2 inches in girth here the effect of the foreign
pollen was apparently confined to increasing the size of the ovarium
but we must be cautious in assuming as the following case shows that
size had been transferred from the male parent to the capsule of the
female plant mr henry fertilised arabis blepharophylla with pollen
of a soyeri and the pods thus produced of which he was so kind as
to send me detailed measurements and sketches were much larger in all
their dimensions than those naturally produced by either the male or
female parentspecies in a future chapter we shall see that the organs
of vegetation in hybrid plants independently of the character of
either parent are sometimes developed to a monstrous size and the
increased size of the pods in the foregoing cases may be an analogous
fact on the other hand m de saporta informs me that an isolated
female plant of pistacia vera is very apt to be fertilised by the
pollen of neighbouring plants of p terebinthus and in this case the
fruits are only half their proper size which he attributes to the
influence of the pollen of p terebinthus
no case of the direct action of the pollen of one variety on another is
better authenticated or more remarkable than that of the common apple
the fruit here consists of the lower part of the calyx and of the upper
part of the flowerpeduncle144 in a metamorphosed condition so that
the effect of the foreign pollen has extended even beyond the limits of
the ovarium cases of apples thus affected were recorded by bradley in
the early part of the last century and other cases are given in old
volumes of the philosophical transactions145 in one of these a
russeting apple and an adjoining kind mutually affected each others
fruit and in another case a smooth apple affected a roughcoated kind
another instance has been given146 of two very different appletrees
growing close to each other which bore fruit resembling each other
but only on the adjoining branches it is however almost superfluous
to adduce these or other cases after that of the st valery apple the
flowers which from the abortion of the stamens do not produce pollen
but are fertilised by the girls of the neighbourhood with pollen of
many kinds and they bear fruit differing from one another in size
flavour and colour but resembling in character the hermaphrodite
kinds by which they have been fertilised147
i have now shown on the authority of several excellent observers in
the case of plants belonging to widely different orders that the
pollen of one species or variety when applied to the female of a
distinct form occasionally causes the coats of the seeds the ovarium
or fruit including even the calyx and upper part of the peduncle of
the apple and the axis of the ear in maize to be modified sometimes
the whole ovarium or all the seeds are thus affected sometimes only a
certain number of the seeds as in the case of the pea or only a part
of the ovarium as with the striped orange mottled grapes and maize
is thus affected it must not be supposed that any direct or immediate
effect invariably follows the use of foreign pollen this is far from
being the case nor is it known on what conditions the result depends
mr knight148 expressly states that he has never seen the fruit thus
affected though he crossed thousands of apple and other fruittrees
there is not the least reason to believe that a branch which has borne
seed or fruit directly modified by foreign pollen is itself affected
so as afterwards to produce modified buds such an occurrence from the
temporary connection of the flower with the stem would be hardly
possible hence but very few if any of the cases of budvariation in
the fruit of trees given in the early part of this chapter can be
accounted for by the action of foreign pollen for such fruits have
commonly been propagated by budding or grafting it is also obvious
that changes of colour in flowers which necessarily supervene long
before they are ready for fertilisation and changes in the shape or
colour of leaves when due to the appearance of modified buds can have
no relation to the action of foreign pollen
the proofs of the action of foreign pollen on the motherplant have
been given in considerable detail because this action as we shall see
in a future chapter is of the highest theoretical importance and
because it is in itself a remarkable and apparently anomalous
circumstance that it is remarkable under a physiological point of view
is clear for the male element not only affects in accordance with its
proper function the germ but at the same time various parts of the
motherplant in the same manner as it affects the same part in the
seminal offspring from the same two parents we thus learn that an
ovule is not indispensable for the reception of the influence of the
male element but this direct action of the male element is not so
anomalous as it at first appears for it comes into play in the
ordinary fertilisation of many flowers grtner gradually increased the
number of pollen grains until he succeeded in fertilising a malva and
has149 proved that many grains are first expended in the development
or as he expresses it in the satiation of the pistil and ovarium
again when one plant is fertilised by a widely distinct species it
often happens that the ovarium is fully and quickly developed without
any seeds being formed or the coats of the seeds are formed without
any embryo being developed within prof hildebrand also has lately
shown150 that in the normal fertilisation of several orchide the
action of the plants own pollen is necessary for the development of
the ovarium and that this development takes place not only long before
the pollentubes have reached the ovules but even before the placent
and ovules have been formed so that with these orchids the pollen acts
directly on the ovarium on the other hand we must not overrate the
efficacy of pollen in the case of hybridised plants for an embryo may
be formed and its influence excite the surrounding tissues of the
motherplant and then perish at a very early age and be thus
overlooked again it is well known that with many plants the ovarium
may be fully developed though pollen be wholly excluded lastly mr
smith the late curator at kew as i hear through dr hooker observed
with an orchid the bonatea speciosa the singular fact that the
development of the ovarium could be effected by the mechanical
irritation of the stigma nevertheless from the number of the
pollengrains expended in the satiation of the ovarium and
pistilfrom the generality of the formation of the ovarium and
seedcoats in hybridised plants which produce no seedsand from dr
hildebrands observations on orchids we may admit that in most cases
the swelling of the ovarium and the formation of the seedcoats are at
least aided if not wholly caused by the direct action of the pollen
independently of the intervention of the fertilised germ therefore in
the previously given cases we have only to believe in the further power
of pollen when applied to a distinct species or variety to influence
the shape size colour texture etc of certain parts of the
motherplant
turning now to the animal kingdom if we could imagine the same flower
to yield seeds during successive years then it would not be very
surprising that a flower of which the ovarium had been modified by
foreign pollen should next year produce when selffertilised
offspring modified by the previous male influence closely analogous
cases have actually occurred with animals in the case often quoted
from lord morton151 a nearly purelybred arabian chestnut mare bore
a hybrid to a quagga she was subsequently sent to sir gore ouseley
and produced two colts by a black arabian horse these colts were
partially duncoloured and were striped on the legs more plainly than
the real hybrid or even than the quagga one of the two colts had its
neck and some other parts of its body plainly marked with stripes
stripes on the body not to mention those on the legs are extremely
rarei speak after having long attended to the subjectwith horses of
all kinds in europe and are almost unknown in the case of arabians
but what makes the case still more striking is that in these colts the
hair of the mane resembled that of the quagga being short stiff and
upright hence there can be no doubt that the quagga affected the
character of the offspring subsequently begot by the black arabian
horse mr jenner weir informs me of a strictly parallel case his
neighbour mr lethbridge of blackheath has a horse bred by lord
mostyn which had previously borne a foal by a quagga this horse is
dun with a dark stripe down the back faint stripes on the forehead
between the eyes plain stripes on the inner side of the forelegs and
rather more faint ones on the hindlegs with no shoulderstripe the
mane grows much lower on the forehead than in the horse but not so low
as in the quagga or zebra the hoofs are proportionally longer than in
the horseso much so that the farrier who first shod this animal and
knew nothing of its origin said had i not seen i was shoeing a
horse i should have thought i was shoeing a donkey
with respect to the varieties of our domesticated animals many similar
and wellauthenticated facts have been published152 and others have
been communicated to me plainly showing the influence of the first
male on the progeny subsequently borne by the mother to other males it
will suffice to give a single instance recorded in the philosophical
transactions in a paper following that by lord morton mr giles put
a sow of lord westerns black and white essex breed to a wild boar of a
deep chestnut colour and the pigs produced partook in appearance of
both boar and sow but in some the chestnut colour of the boar strongly
prevailed after the boar had long been dead the sow was put to a
boar of her own black and white breeda kind which is well known to
breed very true and never to show any chestnut colouryet from this
union the sow produced some young pigs which were plainly marked with
the same chestnut tint as in the first litter similar cases have so
frequently occurred that careful breeders avoid putting a choice
female of any animal to an inferior male on account of the injury to
her subsequent progeny which may be expected to follow
some physiologists have attempted to account for these remarkable
results from a previous impregnation by the imagination of the mother
having been strongly affected but it will hereafter be seen that there
are very slight grounds for any such belief other physiologists
attribute the result to the close attachment and freely
intercommunicating bloodvessels between the modified embryo and
mother but the analogy from the action of foreign pollen on the
ovarium seedcoats and other parts of the motherplant strongly
supports the belief that with animals the male element acts directly on
the female and not through the crossed embryo with birds there is no
close connection between the embryo and mother yet a careful observer
dr chapuis states153 that with pigeons the influence of a first
male sometimes makes itself perceived in the succeeding broods but
this statement requires confirmation
conclusion and summary of the chapterthe facts given in the latter
half of this chapter are well worthy of consideration as they show us
in how many extraordinary modes the union of one form with another may
lead to the modification of the seminal offspring or of the buds
afterwards produced
there is nothing surprising in the offspring of species or varieties
crossed in the ordinary manner being modified but the case of two
plants within the same seed which cohere and differ from each other
is curious when a bud is formed after the cellular tissue of two
species or two varieties have been united and it partakes of the
characters of both parents the case is wonderful but i need not here
repeat what has been so lately said on this subject we have also seen
that in the case of plants the male element may affect in a direct
manner the tissues of the mother and with animals may lead to the
modification of her future progeny in the vegetable kingdom the
offspring from a cross between two species or varieties whether
effected by seminal generation or by grafting often revert to a
greater or less degree in the first or in a succeeding generation to
the two parentforms and this reversion may affect the whole flower
fruit or leafbud or only the half or a smaller segment of a single
organ in some cases however such segregation of character apparently
depends on an incapacity for union rather than on reversion for the
flowers or fruit which are first produced display by segments the
characters of both parents the various facts here given ought to be
well considered by any one who wishes to embrace under a single point
of view the many modes of reproduction by gemmation division and
sexual union the reparation of lost parts variation inheritance
reversion and other such phenomena towards the close of the second
volume i shall attempt to connect these facts together by the
hypothesis of pangenesis
in the early half of the present chapter i have given a long list of
plants in which through budvariation that is independently of
reproduction by seed the fruit has suddenly become modified in size
colour flavour hairiness shape and time of maturity flowers have
similarly changed in shape colour in being double and greatly in the
character of the calyx young branches or shoots have changed in
colour in bearing spines and in habit of growth as in climbing or in
weeping leaves have changed in becoming variegated in shape period
of unfolding and in their arrangement on the axis buds of all kinds
whether produced on ordinary branches or on subterranean stems whether
simple or much modified and supplied with a stock of nutriment as in
tubers and bulbs are all liable to sudden variations of the same
general nature
in the list many of the cases are certainly due to reversion to
characters not acquired from a cross but which were formerly present
and have since been lost for a longer or shorter timeas when a bud on
a variegated plant produces plain leaves or when the
variouslycoloured flowers of the chrysanthemum revert to the
aboriginal yellow tint many other cases included in the list are
probably due to the plants being of crossed parentage and to the buds
reverting either completely or by segments to one of the two
parentforms154
we may suspect that the strong tendency in the chrysanthemum to produce
by budvariation differentlycoloured flowers results from the
varieties having been at some time intentionally or accidentally
crossed and this is certainly the case with some kinds of pelargonium
so it may be to a large extent with the budvarieties of the dahlia
and with the broken colours of tulips when however a plant reverts
by budvariation to its two parent forms or to one of them it
sometimes does not revert perfectly but assumes a somewhat new
characterof which fact instances have been given and carrire
gives155 another in the cherry
many cases of budvariation however cannot be attributed to
reversion but to socalled spontaneous variability as is so common
with cultivated plants raised from seed as a single variety of the
chrysanthemum has produced by buds six other varieties and as one
variety of the gooseberry has borne at the same time four distinct
kinds of fruit it is scarcely possible to believe that all these
variations are due to reversion we can hardly believe as remarked in
a previous chapter that all the many peaches which have yielded
nectarinebuds are of crossed parentage lastly in such cases as that
of the mossrose with its peculiar calyx and of the rose which bears
opposite leaves in that of the imatophyllum etc there is no known
natural species or variety from which the characters in question could
have been derived by a cross we must attribute all such cases to the
appearance of absolutely new characters in the buds the varieties
which have thus arisen cannot be distinguished by any external
character from seedlings this is notoriously the case with the
varieties of the rose azalea and many other plants it deserves
notice that all the plants which have yielded budvariations have
likewise varied greatly by seed
the plants which have varied by buds belong to so many orders that we
may infer that almost every plant would be liable to variation if
placed under the proper exciting conditions these conditions as far
as we can judge mainly depend on longcontinued and high cultivation
for almost all the plants in the foregoing list are perennials and
have been largely propagated in many soils under different climates
by cuttings offsets bulbs tubers and especially by budding or
grafting the instances of annuals varying by buds or producing on the
same plant differently coloured flowers are comparatively rare
hopkirk156 has seen this with  convolvulus tricolor and it is not
uncommon with the balsam and annual delphinium according to sir r
schomburgk plants from the warmer temperate regions when cultivated
under the hot climate of st domingo are eminently liable to
budvariation i am informed by mr sedgwick that mossroses which have
often been taken to calcutta always there lose their mossiness but
change of climate is by no means a necessary contingent as we see with
the gooseberry currant and in many other cases plants living under
their natural conditions are very rarely subject to budvariation
variegated leaves have however been observed under such
circumstances and i have given an instance of variation by buds on an
ashtree planted in ornamental grounds but it is doubtful whether such
a tree can be considered as living under strictly natural conditions
grtner has seen white and darkred flowers produced from the same root
of the wild achillea millefolium and prof caspary has seen a
completely wild  viola lutea bearing flowers of two different colours
and sizes157
as wild plants are so rarely liable to budvariation whilst highly
cultivated plants long propagated by artificial means have yielded many
varieties by this form of reproduction we are led through a series
such as the followingnamely all the eyes in the same tuber of the
potato varying in the same mannerall the fruit on a purple plumtree
suddenly becoming yellowall the fruit on a doubleflowered almond
suddenly becoming peach likeall the buds on grafted trees being in a
very slight degree affected by the stock on which they have been
workedall the flowers on a transplanted heartsease changing for a
time in colour size and shapewe are led by such a series to look at
every case of budvariation as the direct result of the conditions of
life to which the plant has been exposed on the other hand plants of
the same variety may be cultivated in two adjoining beds apparently
under exactly the same conditions and those in the one bed as
carrire insists158 will produce many budvariations and those in
the other not a single one again if we look to such cases as that of
a peachtree which after having been cultivated by tens of thousands
during many years in many countries and after having annually produced
millions of buds all of which have apparently been exposed to
precisely the same conditions yet at last suddenly produces a single
bud with its whole character greatly transformed we are driven to the
conclusion that the transformation stands in no direct relation to
the conditions of life
we have seen that varieties produced from seeds and from buds resemble
each other so closely in general appearance that they cannot be
distinguished just as certain species and groups of species when
propagated by seed are more variable than other species or genera so
it is in the case of certain budvarieties thus the queen of england
chrysanthemum has produced by this latter process no less than six and
rollissons unique pelargonium four distinct varieties mossroses have
also produced several other mossroses the rosace have varied by buds
more than any other group of plants but this may be in large part due
to so many members having been long cultivated but within this same
group the peach has often varied by buds whilst the apple and pear
both grafted trees extensively cultivated have afforded as far as i
can ascertain extremely few instances of budvariation
the law of analogous variation holds good with varieties produced by
buds as with those produced from seed more than one kind of rose has
sported into a mossrose more than one kind of camellia has assumed an
hexagonal form and at least seven or eight varieties of the peach have
produced nectarines
the laws of inheritance seem to be nearly the same with seminal and
budvarieties we know how commonly reversion comes into play with
both and it may affect the whole or only segments of a leaf flower
or fruit when the tendency to reversion affects many buds on the same
tree it becomes covered with different kinds of leaves flowers or
fruit but there is reason to believe that such fluctuating varieties
have generally arisen from seed it is well known that out of a number
of seedling varieties some transmit their character much more truly by
seed than others so with budvarieties some retain their character by
successive buds more truly than others of which instances have been
given with two kinds of variegated euonymus and with certain kinds of
tulips and pelargoniums notwithstanding the sudden production of
budvarieties the characters thus acquired are sometimes capable of
transmission by seminal reproduction mr rivers has found that
mossroses generally reproduce themselves by seed and the mossy
character has been transferred by crossing from one species of rose to
another the boston nectarine which appeared as a budvariation
produced by seed a closely allied nectarine on the other hand
seedlings from some budvariations have proved variable to an extreme
degree159 we have also heard on the authority of mr salter that
seeds taken from a branch with leaves variegated through budvariation
transmit this character very feebly whilst many plants which were
variegated as seedlings transmit variegation to a large proportion of
their progeny
although i have been able to collect a good many cases of
budvariation as shown in the previous lists and might probably by
searching foreign horticultural works have collected very many more
cases yet their total number is as nothing in comparison with that of
seminal varieties with seedlings raised from the more variable
cultivated plants the variations are almost infinitely numerous but
their differences are generally slight only at long intervals of time
a strongly marked modification appears on the other hand it is a
singular and inexplicable fact that when plants vary by buds the
variations though they occur with comparative rarity are often or
even generally strongly pronounced it struck me that this might
perhaps be a delusion and that slight changes often occurred in buds
but were overlooked or not recorded from being of no value
accordingly i applied to two great authorities on this subject
namely to mr rivers with respect to fruittrees and to mr salter
with respect to flowers mr rivers is doubtful but does not remember
having noticed very slight variations in fruitbuds mr salter informs
me that with flowers such do occur but if propagated they generally
lose their new character in the following year yet he concurs with me
that budvariations usually at once assume a decided and permanent
character we can hardly doubt that this is the rule when we reflect
on such cases as that of the peach which has been so carefully
observed and of which such trifling seminal varieties have been
propagated yet this tree has repeatedly produced by budvariation
nectarines and only twice as far as i can learn any other variety
namely the early and late grosse mignonne peaches and these differ
from the parenttree in hardly any character except the period of
maturity
to my surprise i hear from mr salter that he brings the principle of
selection to bear on variegated plants propagated by buds and has thus
greatly improved and fixed several varieties he informs me that at
first a branch often produces variegated leaves on one side alone and
that the leaves are marked only with an irregular edging or with a few
lines of white and yellow to improve and fix such varieties he finds
it necessary to encourage the buds at the bases of the most distinctly
marked leaves and to propagate from them alone by following with
perseverance this plan during three or four successive seasons a
distinct and fixed variety can generally be secured
finally the facts given in this chapter prove in how close and
remarkable a manner the germ of a fertilised seed and the small
cellular mass forming a bud resemble each other in all their
functionsin their power of inheritance with occasional reversionand
in their capacity for variation of the same general nature in
obedience to the same laws this resemblance or rather identity of
character is shown in the most striking manner by the fact that the
cellular tissue of one species or variety when budded or grafted on
another may give rise to a bud having an intermediate character we
have seen that variability does not depend on sexual generation though
much more frequently its concomitant than of bud reproduction we have
seen that budvariability is not solely dependent on reversion or
atavism to longlost characters or to those formerly acquired from a
cross but appears often to be spontaneous but when we ask ourselves
what is the cause of any particular budvariation we are lost in
doubt being driven in some cases to look to the direct action of the
external conditions of life as sufficient and in other cases to feel a
profound conviction that these have played a quite subordinate part of
not more importance than the nature of the spark which ignites a mass
of combustible matter

 with  short brown hair the next time she was put to a black
 hairless barbary dog but the mischief had been implanted in the
 mother and again about half the litter looked like pure barbarys and
 the other half like the shorthaired progeny of the first father i

 1868 nov 17th p 143 it is worth notice that farmers in s brazil
 as i hear from fritz mller and at the c of good hope as i have
 heard from two trustworthy persons are convinced that mares which
 have once borne mules when subsequently put to horses are extremely
 liable to produce colts striped like a mule dr wilckens of
 pogarth gives jahrbuch landwirthschaft ii 1869 p 325 a
 striking and analogous case a merino ram having two small lappets or
 flaps of skin on the neck was in the winter of 186162 put to several
 merino ewes all of whom bore lambs with similar flaps on their necks
 the ram was killed in the spring of 1862 and subsequently to his death
 the ewes were put to other merino rams and in 1863 to southdown rams
 none of whom ever have neck lappets nevertheless even as long
 afterwards as 1867 several of these ewes produced lambs bearing these
 appendages

 154 it may be worth while to call attention to the several means by
 which flowers and fruit become striped or mottled firstly by the
 direct action of the pollen of another variety or species as in the
 cases given of oranges and maize secondly in crosses of the first
 generation when the colours of the two parents do not readily unite
 as with mirabilis and dianthus thirdly in crossed plants of a
 subsequent generation by reversion through either bud or seminal
 generation fourthly by reversion to a character not originally
 gained by a cross but which had long been lost as with
 whiteflowered varieties which we shall hereafter see often become
 striped with some other colour lastly there are cases as when
 peaches are produced with a half or quarter of the fruit like a
 nectarine in which the change is apparently due to mere variation
 through either bud or seminal generation

habits overborne by hostile conditions of life by incessantly
recurring variability and by reversionconclusion
the subject of inheritance is an immense one and has been treated by
many authors one work alone de lhrdit naturelle by dr prosper
lucas runs to the length of 1562 pages we must confine ourselves to
certain points which have an important bearing on the general subject
of variation both with domestic and natural productions it is obvious
that a variation which is not inherited throws no light on the
derivation of species nor is of any service to man except in the case
of perennial plants which can be propagated by buds
if animals and plants had never been domesticated and wild ones alone
had been observed we should probably never have heard the saying that
like begets like the proposition would have been as selfevident as
that all the buds on the same tree are alike though neither
proposition is strictly true for as has often been remarked probably
no two individuals are identically the same all wild animals recognise
each other which shows that there is some difference between them and
when the eye is well practised the shepherd knows each sheep and man
can distinguish a fellowman out of millions on millions of other men
some authors have gone so far as to maintain that the production of
slight differences is as much a necessary function of the powers of
generation as the production of offspring like their parents this
view as we shall see in a future chapter is not theoretically
probable though practically it holds good the saying that like
begets like has in fact arisen from the perfect confidence felt by
breeders that a superior or inferior animal will generally reproduce
its kind but this very superiority or inferiority shows that the
individual in question has departed slightly from its type
the whole subject of inheritance is wonderful when a new character
arises whatever its nature may be it generally tends to be inherited
at least in a temporary and sometimes in a most persistent manner what
can be more wonderful than that some trifling peculiarity not
primordially attached to the species should be transmitted through the
male or female sexual cells which are so minute as not to be visible
to the naked eye and afterwards through the incessant changes of a
long course of development undergone either in the womb or in the egg
and ultimately appear in the offspring when mature or even when quite
old as in the case of certain diseases or again what can be more
wonderful than the wellascertained fact that the minute ovule of a
good milking cow will produce a male from whom a cell in union with
an ovule will produce a female and she when mature will have large
mammary glands yielding an abundant supply of milk and even milk of a
particular quality nevertheless the real subject of surprise is as
sir h holland has well remarked1 not that a character should be
inherited but that any should ever fail to be inherited in a future
chapter devoted to an hypothesis which i have termed pangenesis an
attempt will be made to show the means by which characters of all kinds
are transmitted from generation to generation
some writers2 who have not attended to natural history have
attempted to show that the force of inheritance has been much
exaggerated the breeders of animals would smile at such simplicity
and if they condescended to make any answer might ask what would be
the chance of winning a prize if two inferior animals were paired
together they might ask whether the halfwild arabs were led by
theoretical notions to keep pedigrees of their horses why have
pedigrees been scrupulously kept and published of the shorthorn cattle
and more recently of the hereford breed is it an illusion that these
recently improved animals safely transmit their excellent qualities
even when crossed with other breeds have the shorthorns without good
reason been purchased at immense prices and exported to almost every
quarter of the globe a thousand guineas having been given for a bull
with greyhounds pedigrees have likewise been kept and the names of
such dogs as snowball major etc are as well known to coursers as
those of eclipse and herod on the turf even with the gamecock
pedigrees of famous strains were formerly kept and extended back for a
century with pigs the yorkshire and cumberland breeders preserve and
print pedigrees and to show how such highlybred animals are valued
i may mention that mr brown who won all the first prizes for small
breeds at birmingham in 1850 sold a young sow and boar of his breed to
lord ducie for 43 guineas the sow alone was afterwards sold to the
rev f thursby for 65 guineas who writes she paid me very well
having sold her produce for 300 pounds and having now four breeding
sows from her3 hard cash paid down over and over again is an
excellent test of inherited superiority in fact the whole art of
breeding from which such great results have been attained during the
present century depends on the inheritance of each small detail of
structure but inheritance is not certain for if it were the
breeders art4 would be reduced to a certainty and there would be
little scope left for that wonderful skill and perseverance shown by
the men who have left an enduring monument of their success in the
present state of our domesticated animals
it is hardly possible within a moderate compass to impress on the
mind of those who have not attended to the subject the full conviction
of the force of inheritance which is slowly acquired by rearing
animals by studying the many treatises which have been published on
the various domestic animals and by conversing with breeders i will
select a few facts of the kind which as far as i can judge have most
influenced my own mind with man and the domestic animals certain
peculiarities have appeared in an individual at rare intervals or
only once or twice in the history of the world but have reappeared in
several of the children and grandchildren thus lambert the
porcupineman whose skin was thickly covered with warty projections
which were periodically moulted had all his six children and two
grandsons similarly affected5 the face and body being covered with
long hair accompanied by deficient teeth to which i shall hereafter
refer occurred in three successive generations in a siamese family
but this case is not unique as a woman6 with a completely hairy face
who was exhibited in london in 1663 and another instance has recently
occurred colonel hallam7 has described a race of twolegged pigs
the hinder extremities being entirely wanting and this deficiency
was transmitted through three generations in fact all races
presenting any remarkable peculiarity such as solidhoofed swine
mauchamp sheep niata cattle etc are instances of the longcontinued
inheritance of rare deviations of structure
when we reflect that certain extraordinary peculiarities have thus
appeared in a single individual out of many millions all exposed in
the same country to the same general conditions of life and again
that the same extraordinary peculiarity has sometimes appeared in
individuals living under widely different conditions of life we are
driven to conclude that such peculiarities are not directly due to the
action of the surrounding conditions but to unknown laws acting on the
organisation or constitution of the individualthat their production
stands in hardly closer relation to the conditions of life than does
life itself if this be so and the occurrence of the same unusual
character in the child and parent cannot be attributed to both having
been exposed to the same unusual conditions then the following problem
is worth consideration as showing that the result cannot be due as
some authors have supposed to mere coincidence but must be consequent
on the members of the same family inheriting something in common in
their constitution let it be assumed that in a large population a
particular affection occurs on an average in one out of a million so
that the  priori chance that an individual taken at random will be
so affected is only one in a million let the population consist of
sixty millions composed we will assume of ten million families each
containing six members on these data professor stokes has calculated
for me that the odds will be no less than 8333 millions to 1 that in
the ten million families there will not be even a single family in
which one parent and two children will be affected by the peculiarity
in question but numerous instances could be given in which several
children have been affected by the same rare peculiarity with one of
their parents and in this case more especially if the grandchildren
be included in the calculation the odds against mere coincidence
become something prodigious almost beyond enumeration
in some respects the evidence of inheritance is more striking when we
consider the reappearance of trifling peculiarities dr hodgkin
formerly told me of an english family in which for many generations
some members had a single lock differently coloured from the rest of
the hair i knew an irish gentleman who on the right side of his
head had a small white lock in the midst of his dark hair he assured
me that his grandmother had a similar lock on the same side and his
mother on the opposite side but it is superfluous to give instances
every shade of expression which may often be seen alike in parents and
children tells the same story on what a curious combination of
corporeal structure mental character and training handwriting
depends yet every one must have noted the occasional close similarity
of the handwriting in father and son although the father had not
taught his son a great collector of autographs assured me that in his
collection there were several signatures of father and son hardly
distinguishable except by their dates hofacker in germany remarks on
the inheritance of handwriting and it has even been asserted that
english boys when taught to write in france naturally cling to their
english manner of writing but for so extraordinary a statement more
evidence is requisite8 gait gestures voice and general bearing
are all inherited as the illustrious hunter and sir a carlisle have
insisted9 my father communicated to me some striking instances in
one of which a man died during the early infancy of his son and my
father who did not see this son until grown up and out of health
declared that it seemed to him as if his old friend had risen from the
grave with all his highly peculiar habits and manners peculiar
manners pass into tricks and several instances could be given of their
inheritance as in the case often quoted of the father who generally
slept on his back with his right leg crossed over the left and whose
daughter whilst an infant in the cradle followed exactly the same
habit though an attempt was made to cure her10 i will give one
instance which has fallen under my own observation and which is
curious from being a trick associated with a peculiar state of mind
namely pleasureable emotion a boy had the singular habit when
pleased of rapidly moving his fingers parallel to each other and
when much excited of raising both hands with the fingers still
moving to the sides of his face on a level with the eyes when this
boy was almost an old man he could still hardly resist this trick when
much pleased but from its absurdity concealed it he had eight
children of these a girl when pleased at the age of four and a half
years moved her fingers in exactly the same way and what is still
odder when much excited she raised both her hands with her fingers
still moving to the sides of her face in exactly the same manner as
her father had done and sometimes even still continued to do so when
alone i never heard of any one excepting this one man and his little
daughter who had this strange habit and certainly imitation was in
this instance out of the question
some writers have doubted whether those complex mental attributes on
which genius and talent depend are inherited even when both parents
are thus endowed but he who will study mr galtons able work on
hereditary genius will have its doubts allayed
unfortunately it matters not as far as inheritance is concerned how
injurious a quality or structure may be if compatible with life no one
can read the many treatises11 on hereditary disease and doubt this
the ancients were strongly of this opinion or as ranchin expresses
it omnes grci arabes et latini in eo consentiunt a long
catalogue could be given of all sorts of inherited malformations and of
predisposition to various diseases with gout fifty per cent of the
cases observed in hospital practice are according to dr garrod
inherited and a greater percentage in private practice every one
knows how often insanity runs in families and some of the cases given
by mr sedgwick are awfulas of a surgeon whose brother father and
four paternal uncles were all insane the latter dying by suicide of a
jew whose father mother and six brothers and sisters were all mad
and in some other cases several members of the same family during
three or four successive generations have committed suicide striking
instances have been recorded of epilepsy consumption asthma stone in
the bladder cancer profuse bleeding from the slightest injuries of
the mother not giving milk and of bad parturition being inherited in
this latter respect i may mention an odd case given by a good
observer12 in which the fault lay in the offspring and not in the
mother in a part of yorkshire the farmers continued to select cattle
with large hindquarters until they made a strain called
dutchbuttocked and the monstrous size of the buttocks of the calf
was frequently fatal to the cow and numbers of cows were annually lost
in calving
instead of giving numerous details on various inherited malformations
and diseases i will confine myself to one organ that which is the
most complex delicate and probably bestknown in the human frame
namely the eye with its accessory parts13 to begin with the
latter i have received an account of a family in which one parent and
the children are affected by drooping eyelids in so peculiar a manner
that they cannot see without throwing their heads backwards mr wade
of wakefield has given me an analogous case of a man who had not his
eyelids thus affected at birth nor owed their state as far as was
known to inheritance but they began to droop whilst he was an infant
after suffering from fits and he has transmitted the affection to two
out of his three children as was evident in the photographs of the
whole family sent to me together with this account sir a carlisle14
specifies a pendulous fold to the eyelids as inherited in a family
says sir h holland15 where the father had a singular elongation of
the upper eyelid seven or eight children were born with the same
deformity two or three other children having it not many persons as
i hear from sir j paget have two or three hairs in their eyebrows
much longer than the others and even so trifling a peculiarity as this
certainly runs in families
with respect to the eye itself the highest authority in england mr
bowman has been so kind as to give me the following remarks on certain
inherited imperfections first hypermetropia or morbidly long sight
in this affection the organ instead of being spherical is too flat
from front to back and is often altogether too small so that the
retina is brought too forward for the focus of the humours
consequently a convex glass is required for clear vision of near
objects and frequently even of distant ones this state occurs
congenitally or at a very early age often in several children of the
same family where one of the parents has presented it16 secondly
myopia or shortsight in which the eye is eggshaped and too long
from front to back the retina in this case lies behind the focus and
is therefore fitted to see distinctly only very near objects this
condition is not commonly congenital but comes on in youth the
liability to it being well known to be transmissible from parent to
child the change from the spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the
immediate consequence of something like inflammation of the coats
under which they yield and there is ground for believing that it may
often originate in causes acting on the individual affected17 and
may thenceforward become transmissible when both parents are myopic
mr bowman has observed the hereditary tendency in this direction to be
heightened and some of the children to be myopic at an earlier age or
in a higher degree than their parents thirdly squinting is a familiar
example of hereditary transmission it is frequently a result of such
optical defects as have been above mentioned but the more primary and
uncomplicated forms of it are also sometimes in a marked degree
transmitted in a family fourthly cataract or opacity of the
crystalline lens is commonly observed in persons whose parents have
been similarly affected and often at an earlier age in the children
than in the parents occasionally more than one child in a family is
thus afflicted one of whose parents or other relations presents the
senile form of the complaint when cataract affects several members of
a family in the same generation it is often seen to commence at about
the same age in each eg in one family several infants or young
persons may suffer from it in another several persons of middle age
mr bowman also informs me that he has occasionally seen in several
members of the same family various defects in either the right or left
eye and mr white cooper has often seen peculiarities of vision
confined to one eye reappearing in the same eye in the offspring18
the following cases are taken from an able paper by mr w sedgwick
and from dr prosper lucas19 amaurosis either congenital or coming
on late in life and causing total blindness is often inherited it
has been observed in three successive generations congenital absence
of the iris has likewise been transmitted for three generations a
cleftiris for four generations being limited in this latter case to
the males of the family opacity of the cornea and congenital smallness
of the eyes have been inherited portal records a curious case in
which a father and two sons were rendered blind whenever the head was
bent downwards apparently owing to the crystalline lens with its
capsule slipping through an unusually large pupil into the anterior
chamber of the eye dayblindness or imperfect vision under a bright
light is inherited as is nightblindness or an incapacity to see
except under a strong light a case has been recorded by m cunier of
this latter defect having affected eightyfive members of the same
family during six generations the singular incapacity of
distinguishing colours which has been called daltonism is
notoriously hereditary and has been traced through five generations
in which it was confined to the female sex
with respect to the colour of the iris deficiency of colouring matter
is well known to be hereditary in albinoes the iris of one eye being
of different colour from that of the other and the iris being spotted
are cases which have been inherited mr sedgwick gives in addition
on the authority of dr osborne20 the following curious instance of
strong inheritance a family of sixteen sons and five daughters all had
eyes resembling in miniature the markings on the back of a
tortoiseshell cat the mother of this large family had three sisters
and a brother all similarly marked and they derived this peculiarity
from their mother who belonged to a family notorious for transmitting
it to their posterity
finally dr lucas emphatically remarks that there is not one single
faculty of the eye which is not subject to anomalies and not one which
is not subjected to the principle of inheritance mr bowman agrees
with the general truth of this proposition which of course does not
imply that all malformations are necessarily inherited this would not
even follow if both parents were affected by an anomaly which in most
cases was transmissible
even if no single fact had been known with respect to the inheritance
of disease and malformations by man the evidence would have been ample
in the case of the horse and this might have been expected as horses
breed much quicker than man are matched with care and are highly
valued i have consulted many works and the unanimity of the belief by
veterinaries of all nations in the transmission of various morbid
tendencies is surprising authors who have had wide experience give in
detail many singular cases and assert that contracted feet with the
numerous contingent evils of ringbones curbs splints spavin
founder and weakness of the front legs roaring or broken and thick
wind melanosis specific ophthalmia and blindness the great french
veterinary huzard going so far as to say that a blind race could soon
be formed cribbiting jibbing and illtemper are all plainly
hereditary youatt sums up by saying there is scarcely a malady to
which the horse is subject which is not hereditary and m bernard
adds that the doctrine that there is scarcely a disease which does not
run in the stock is gaining new advocates every day21 so it is in
regard to cattle with consumption good and bad teeth fine skin etc
etc but enough and more than enough has been said on disease andrew
knight from his own experience asserts that disease is hereditary
with plants and this assertion is endorsed by lindley22
seeing how hereditary evil qualities are it is fortunate that good
health vigour and longevity are equally inherited it was formerly a
wellknown practice when annuities were purchased to be received
during the lifetime of a nominee to search out a person belonging to
a family of which many members had lived to extreme old age as to the
inheritance of vigour and endurance the english racehorse offers an
excellent instance eclipse begot 334 and king herod 497 winners a
cocktail is a horse not purely bred but with only oneeighth or
onesixteenth impure blood in his veins yet very few instances have
ever occurred of such horses having won a great race they are
sometimes as fleet for short distances as thoroughbreds but as mr
robson the great trainer asserts they are deficient in wind and
cannot keep up the pace mr lawrence also remarks perhaps no
instance has ever occurred of a threepartbred horse saving his 
distance in running two miles with thoroughbred racers it has been
stated by cecil that when unknown horses whose parents were not
celebrated have unexpectedly won great races as in the case of priam
they can always be proved to be descended on both sides through many
generations from firstrate ancestors on the continent baron
cameronn challenges in a german veterinary periodical the opponents
of the english racehorse to name one good horse on the continent
which has not some english raceblood in his veins23
with respect to the transmission of the many slight but infinitely
diversified characters by which the domestic races of animals and
plants are distinguished nothing need be said for the very existence
of persistent races proclaims the power of inheritance
a few special cases however deserve some consideration it might have
been anticipated that deviations from the law of symmetry would not
have been inherited but anderson24 states that a rabbit produced in
a litter a young animal having only one ear and from this animal a
breed was formed which steadily produced oneeared rabbits he also
mentions a bitch with a single leg deficient and she produced several
puppies with the same deficiency from hofackers account25 it
appears that a onehorned stag was seen in 1781 in a forest in germany
in 1788 two and afterwards from year to year many were observed with
only one horn on the right side of the head a cow lost a horn by
suppuration26 and she produced three calves which had on the same
side of the head instead of a horn a small bony lump attached merely
to the skin but we here encroach on the subject of inherited
mutilations a man who is lefthanded and a shell in which the spire
turns in the wrong directions are departures from the normal
asymmetrical condition and they are wellknown to be inherited
polydactylismsupernumerary fingers and toes are eminently liable
as various authors have insisted to be inherited polydactylism
graduates27 by multifarious steps from a mere cutaneous appendage
not including any bone to a double hand but an additional digit
supported on a metacarpal bone and furnished with all the proper
muscles nerves and vessels is sometimes so perfect that it escapes
detection unless the fingers are actually counted occasionally there
are several supernumerary digits but usually only one making the
total number six this one may be attached to the inner or outer margin
of the hand representing either a thumb or little finger the latter
being the more frequent generally through the law of correlation
both hands and both feet are similarly affected dr burt wilder has
tabulated28 a large number of cases and finds that supernumerary
digits are more common on the hands than on the feet and that men are
affected oftener than women both these facts can be explained on two
principles which seem generally to hold good firstly that of two
parts the more specialised one is the more variable and the arm is
more highly specialised than the leg and secondly that male animals
are more variable than females
the presence of a greater number of digits than five is a great
anomaly for this number is not normally exceeded by any existing
mammal bird or reptile nevertheless supernumerary digits are
strongly inherited they have been transmitted through five
generations and in some cases after disappearing for one two or
even three generations have reappeared through reversion these facts
are rendered as professor huxley has observed more remarkable from
its being known in most cases that the affected person has not married
one similarly affected in such cases the child of the fifth generation
would have only 132nd part of the blood of his first sedigitated
ancestor other cases are rendered remarkable by the affection
gathering force as dr struthers has shown in each generation though
in each the affected person married one not affected moreover such
additional digits are often amputated soon after birth and can seldom
have been strengthened by use dr struthers gives the following
instance in the first generation an additional digit appeared on one
hand in the second on both hands in the third three brothers had
both hands and one of the brothers a foot affected and in the fourth
generation all four limbs were affected yet we must not overestimate
the force of inheritance dr struthers asserts that cases of
noninheritance and of the first appearance of additional digits in
unaffected families are much more frequent than cases of inheritance
many other deviations of structure of a nature almost as anomalous as
supernumerary digits such as deficient phalanges29 thickened
joints crooked fingers etc are in like manner strongly inherited
and are equally subject to intermission together with reversion
though in such cases there is no reason to suppose that both parents
had been similarly affected30
additional digits have been observed in negroes as well as in other
races of man and in several of the lower animals and have been
inherited six toes have been described on the hind feet of the newt
salamandra cristata and are said to have occurred with the frog
it deserves notice that the sixtoed newt though adult preserved
some of its larval characters for part of the hyoidal apparatus which
is properly absorbed during the act of metamorphosis was retained it
is also remarkable that in the case of man various structures in an
embryonic or arrested state of development such as a cleftpalate
bifid uterus etc are often accompanied by polydactylism31 six
toes on the hinder feet are known to have been inherited for three
generations of cats in several breeds of the fowl the hinder toe is
double and is generally transmitted truly as is well shown when
dorkings are crossed with common fourtoed breeds32 with animals
which have properly less than five digits the number is sometimes
increased to five especially on the front legs though rarely carried
beyond that number but this is due to the development of a digit
already existing in a more or less rudimentary state thus the dog has
properly four toes behind but in the larger breeds a fifth toe is
commonly though not perfectly developed horses which properly have
one toe alone fully developed with rudiments of the others have been
described with each foot bearing two or three small separate hoofs
analogous facts have been noticed with cows sheep goats and
pigs33
there is a famous case described by mr white of a child three years
old with a thumb double from the first joint he removed the lesser
thumb which was furnished with a nail but to his astonishment it grew
again and reproduced a nail the child was then taken to an eminent
london surgeon and the newlygrown thumb was removed by its
socketjoint but again it grew and reproduced a nail dr struthers
mentions a case of the partial regrowth of an additional thumb
amputated when a child was three months old and the late dr falconer
communicated to me an analogous instance in the last edition of this
work i also gave a case of the regrowth of a supernumerary
littlefinger after amputation but having been informed by dr
bachmaier that several eminent surgeons expressed at a meeting of the
anthropological society of munich great doubt about my statements i
have made more particular inquiries the full information thus gained
together with a tracing of the hand in its present state has been laid
before sir j paget and he has come to the conclusion that the degree
of regrowth in this case is not greater than sometimes occurs with
normal bones especially with the humerus when amputated at an early
age he further does not feel fully satisfied about the facts recorded
by mr white this being so it is necessary for me to withdraw the
view which i formerly advanced with much hesitation chiefly on the
ground of the supposed regrowth of additional digits namely that
their occasional development in man is a case of reversion to a lowly
organised progenitor provided with more than five digits
i may here allude to a class of facts closely allied to but somewhat
different from ordinary cases of inheritance sir h holland34
states that brothers and sisters of the same family are frequently
affected often at about the same age by the same peculiar disease
not known to have previously occurred in the family he specifies the
occurrence of diabetes in three brothers under ten years old he also
remarks that children of the same family often exhibit in common
infantile diseases the same peculiar symptoms my father mentioned to
me the case of four brothers who died between the ages of sixty and
seventy in the same highly peculiar comatose state an instance has
already been given of supernumerary digits appearing in four children
out of six in a previously unaffected family dr devay states35 that
two brothers married two sisters their firstcousins none of the four
nor any relation being an albino but the seven children produced from
this double marriage were all perfect albinoes some of these cases as
mr sedgwick36 has shown are probably the result of reversion to a
remote ancestor of whom no record had been preserved and all these
cases are so far directly connected with inheritance that no doubt the
children inherited a similar constitution from their parents and from
being exposed to nearly similar conditions of life it is not
surprising that they should be affected in the same manner and at the
same period of life
most of the facts hitherto given have served to illustrate the force of
inheritance but we must now consider cases grouped as well as the
subject allows into classes showing how feeble capricious or
deficient the power of inheritance sometimes is when a new peculiarity
first appears we can never predict whether it will be inherited if
both parents from their birth present the same peculiarity the
probability is strong that it will be transmitted to at least some of
their offspring we have seen that variegation is transmitted much more
feebly by seed taken from a branch which had become variegated through
budvariation than from plants which were variegated as seedlings
with most plants the power of transmission notoriously depends on some
innate capacity in the individual thus vilmorin37 raised from a
peculiarly coloured balsam some seedlings which all resembled their
parent but of these seedlings some failed to transmit the new
character whilst others transmitted it to all their descendants during
several successive generations so again with a variety of the rose
two plants alone out of six were found by vilmorin to be capable of
transmitting the desired character numerous analogous cases could be
given
the weeping or pendulous growth of trees is strongly inherited in some
cases and without any assignable reason feebly in other cases i
have selected this character as an instance of capricious inheritance
because it is certainly not proper to the parentspecies and because
both sexes being borne on the same tree both tend to transmit the same
character even supposing that there may have been in some instances
crossing with adjoining trees of the same species it is not probable
that all the seedlings would have been thus affected at moccas court
there is a famous weeping oak many of its branches are 30 feet long
and no thicker in any part of this length than a common rope this
tree transmits its weeping character in a greater or less degree to
all its seedlings some of the young oaks being so flexible that they
have to be supported by props others not showing the weeping tendency
till about twenty years old38 mr rivers fertilised as he informs
me the flowers of a new belgian weeping thorn cratgus oxyacantha
with pollen from a crimson notweeping variety and three young trees
now six or seven years old show a decided tendency to be pendulous
but as yet are not so much so as the motherplant according to mr
macnab39 seedlings from a magnificent weeping birch betula alba
in the botanic garden at edinburgh grew for the first ten or fifteen
years upright but then all became weepers like their parent a peach
with pendulous branches like those of the weeping willow has been
found capable of propagation by seed40 lastly a weeping or rather a
prostrate yew taxus baccata was found in a hedge in shropshire it
was a male but one branch bore female flowers and produced berries
these being sown produced seventeen trees all of which had exactly
the same peculiar habit with the parenttree41
these facts it might have been thought would have been sufficient to
render it probable that a pendulous habit would in all cases be
strictly inherited but let us look to the other side mr macnab42
sowed seeds of the weeping beech fagus sylvatica but succeeded in
raising only common beeches mr rivers at my request raised a number
of seedlings from three distinct varieties of weeping elm and at least
one of the parenttrees was so situated that it could not have been
crossed by any other elm but none of the young trees now about a foot
or two in height show the least signs of weeping mr rivers formerly
sowed above twenty thousand seeds of the weeping ash fraxinus
excelsior and not a single seedling was in the least degree
pendulous in germany m borchmeyer raised a thousand seedlings with
the same result nevertheless mr anderson of the chelsea botanic
garden by sowing seed from a weeping ash which was found before the
year 1780 in cambridgeshire raised several pendulous trees43
professor henslow also informs me that some seedlings from a female
weeping ash in the botanic garden at cambridge were at first a little
pendulous but afterwards became quite upright it is probable that
this latter tree which transmits to a certain extent its pendulous
habit was derived by a bud from the same original cambridgeshire
stock whilst other weeping ashes may have had a distinct origin but
the crowning case communicated to me by mr rivers which shows how
capricious is the inheritance of a pendulous habit is that a variety
of another species of ash f lentiscifolia now about twenty years
old which was formerly pendulous has long lost this habit every
shoot being remarkably erect but seedlings formerly raised from it
were perfectly prostrate the stems not rising more than two inches
above the ground thus the weeping variety of the common ash which
has been extensively propagated by buds during a long period did not
with mr rivers transmit its character to one seedling out of above
twenty thousand whereas the weeping variety of a second species of
ash which could not whilst grown in the same garden retain its own
weeping character transmitted to its character the pendulous habit in
excess
many analogous facts could be given showing how apparently capricious
is the principle of inheritance all the seedlings from a variety of
the barberry b vulgaris with red leaves inherited the same
character only about onethird of the seedlings of the copper beech
fagus sylvatica had purple leaves not one out of a hundred
seedlings of a variety of the cerasus padus with yellow fruit bore
yellow fruit onetwelfth of the seedlings of the variety of cornus
mascula with yellow fruit came true44 and lastly all the trees
raised by my father from a yellowberried holly ilex aquifolium
found wild produced yellow berries vilmorin45 observed in a bed of
saponaria calabrica an extremely dwarf variety and raised from it a
large number of seedlings some of these partially resembled their
parent and he selected their seed but the grandchildren were not in
the least dwarfed on the other hand he observed a stunted and bushy
variety of tagetes signata growing in the midst of the common
varieties by which it was probably crossed for most of the seedlings
raised from this plant were intermediate in character only two
perfectly resembling their parent but seed saved from these two plants
reproduced the new variety so truly that hardly any selection has
since been necessary
flowers transmit their colour truly or most capriciously many annuals
come true thus i purchased german seeds of thirtyfour named
subvarieties of one race of tenweek stocks matthiola annua and
raised a hundred and forty plants all of which with the exception of
a single plant came true in saying this however it must be
understood that i could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the
thirtyfour named subvarieties nor did the colour of the flower
always correspond with the name affixed to the packet but i say that
they came true because in each of the thirtysix short rows every
plant was absolutely alike with the one single exception again i
procured packets of german seed of twentyfive named varieties of
common and quilled asters and raised a hundred and twentyfour plants
of these all except ten were true in the above limited sense and i
considered even a wrong shade of colour as false
it is a singular circumstance that white varieties generally transmit
their colour much more truly than any other variety this fact probably
stands in close relation with one observed by verlot46 namely that
flowers which are normally white rarely vary into any other colour i
have found that the white varieties of delphinium consolida and of
the stock are the truest it is indeed sufficient to look through a
nurserymans seedlist to see the large number of white varieties
which can be propagated by seed the several coloured varieties of the
sweetpea lathyrus odoratus are very true but i hear from mr
masters of canterbury who has particularly attended to this plant
that the white variety is the truest the hyacinth when propagated by
seed is extremely inconstant in colour but white hyacinths almost
always give by seed whiteflowered plants47 and mr masters informs
me that the yellow varieties also reproduce their colour but of
different shades on the other hand pink and blue varieties the
latter being the natural colour are not nearly so true hence as mr
masters has remarked to me we see that a garden variety may acquire a
more permanent habit than a natural species but it should have been
added that this occurs under cultivation and therefore under changed
conditions
with many flowers especially perennials nothing can be more
fluctuating than the colour of the seedlings as is notoriously the
case with verbenas carnations dahlias cinerarias and others48 i
sowed seed of twelve named varieties of snapdragon antirrhinum
majus and utter confusion was the result in most cases the
extremely fluctuating colour of seedling plants is probably in chief
part due to crosses between differentlycoloured varieties during
previous generations it is almost certain that this is the case with
the polyanthus and coloured primrose primula veris and vulgaris
from their reciprocally dimorphic structure49 and these are plants
which florists speak of as never coming true by seed but if care be
taken to prevent crossing neither species is by any means very
inconstant in colour thus i raised twentythree plants from a purple
primrose fertilised by mr j scott with its pollen and eighteen came
up purple of different shades and only five reverted to the ordinary
yellow colour again i raised twenty plants from a brightred cowslip
similarly treated by mr scott and every one perfectly resembled its
parent in colour as likewise did with the exception of a single
plant 72 grandchildren even with the most variable flowers it is
probable that each delicate shade of colour might be permanently fixed
so as to be transmitted by seed by cultivation in the same soil by
longcontinued selection and especially by the prevention of crosses
i infer this from certain annual larkspurs delphinium consolida and
ajacis of which common seedlings present a greater diversity of
colour than any other plant known to me yet on procuring seed of five
named german varieties of d consolida only nine plants out of
ninetyfour were false and the seedlings of six varieties of d
ajacis were true in the same manner and degree as with the stocks
above described a distinguished botanist maintains that the annual
species of delphinium are always selffertilised therefore i may
mention that thirtytwo flowers on a branch of  d consolida
enclosed in a net yielded twentyseven capsules with an average of
172 seed in each whilst five flowers under the same net which were
artificially fertilised in the same manner as must be effected by bees
during their incessant visits yielded five capsules with an average of
352 fine seed and this shows that the agency of insects is necessary
for the full fertility of this plant analogous facts could be given
with respect to the crossing of many other flowers such as carnations
etc of which the varieties fluctuate much in colour
as with flowers so with our domesticated animals no character is more
variable than colour and probably in no animal more so than with the
horse yet with a little care in breeding it appears that races of
any colour might soon be formed hofacker gives the result of matching
two hundred and sixteen mares of four different colours with
likecoloured stallions without regard to the colour of their
ancestors and of the two hundred and sixteen colts born eleven alone
failed to inherit the colour of their parents autenrieth and ammon
assert that after two generations colts of a uniform colour are
produced with certainty50
in a few rare cases peculiarities fail to be inherited apparently from
the force of inheritance being too strong i have been assured by
breeders of the canarybird that to get a good jonquilcoloured bird it
does not answer to pair two jonquils as the colour then comes out too
strong or is even brown but this statement is disputed by other
breeders so again if two crested canaries are paired the young birds
rarely inherit this character51 for in crested birds a narrow space
of bare skin is left on the back of the head where the feathers are
upturned to form the crest and when both parents are thus
characterised the bareness becomes excessive and the crest itself
fails to be developed mr hewitt speaking of laced sebright bantams
says52 that why this should be so i know not but i am confident
that those that are best laced frequently produce offspring very far
from perfect in their markings whilst those exhibited by myself which
have so often proved successful were bred from the union of
heavilylaced birds with those that were scarcely sufficiently laced
it is a singular fact that although several deafmutes often occur in
the same family and though their cousins and other relations are often
in the same condition yet their parents are rarely deafmutes to give
a single instance not one scholar out of 148 who were at the same
time in the london institution was the child of parents similarly
affected so again when a male or female deafmute marries a sound
person their children are most rarely affected in ireland out of 203
children thus produced one alone was mute even when both parents have
been deafmutes as in the case of fortyone marriages in the united
states and of six in ireland only two deaf and dumb children were
produced mr sedgwick53 in commenting on this remarkable and
fortunate failure in the power of transmission in the direct line
remarks that it may possibly be owing to excess having reversed the
action of some natural law in development but it is safer in the
present state of our knowledge to look at the whole case as simply
unintelligible
although many congenital monstrosities are inherited of which examples
have already been given and to which may be added the lately recorded
case of the transmission during a century of harelip with a
cleftpalate in the writers own family54 yet other malformations
are rarely or never inherited of these latter cases many are probably
due to injuries in the womb or egg and would come under the head of
noninherited injuries or mutilations with plants a long catalogue of
inherited monstrosities of the most serious and diversified nature
could easily be given and with plants there is no reason to suppose
that monstrosities are caused by direct injuries to the seed or embryo
with respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated by injuries or
altered by disease it was until lately difficult to come to any
definite conclusion some mutilations have been practised for a vast
number of generations without any inherited result godron remarks55
that different races of man have from time immemorial knocked out their
upper incisors cut off joints of their fingers made holes of immense
size through the lobes of their ears or through their nostrils tatooed
themselves made deep gashes in various parts of their bodies and
there is no reason to suppose that these mutilations have ever been
inherited56 adhesions due to inflammation and pits from the
smallpox and formerly many consecutive generations must have been
thus pitted are not inherited with respect to jews i have been
assured by three medical men of the jewish faith that circumcision
which has been practised for so many ages has produced no inherited
effect blumenbach however asserts57 that jews are often born in
germany in a condition rendering circumcision difficult so that a name
is given them signifying born circumcised and professor preyer
informs me that this is the case in bonn such children being
considered the special favourites of jehovah i have also heard from
dr a newman of guys hospital of the grandson of a circumcised jew
the father not having been circumcised in a similar condition but it
is possible that all these cases may be accidental coincidence for sir
j paget has seen five sons of a lady and one son of her sister with
adherent prepuces and one of these boys was affected in a manner
which might be considered like that commonly produced by
circumcision yet there was no suspicion of jewish blood in the family
of these two sisters circumcision is practised by mahomedans but at a
much later age than by jews and dr riedel assistant resident in
north celebes writes to me that the boys there go naked until from six
to ten years old and he has observed that many of them though not
all have their prepuces much reduced in length and this he attributes
to the inherited effects of the operation in the vegetable kingdom
oaks and other trees have borne galls from primeval times yet they do
not produce inherited excrescences and many other such facts could be
adduced
notwithstanding the above several negative cases we now possess
conclusive evidence that the effects of operations are sometimes
inherited dr brownsquard58 gives the following summary of his
observations on guineapigs and this summary is so important that i
will quote the whole
1st appearance of epilepsy in animals born of parents having been
rendered epileptic by an injury to the spinal cord
2nd appearance of epilepsy also in animals born of parents having
been rendered epileptic by the section of the sciatic nerve
3rd a change in the shape of the ear in animals born of parents in
which such a change was the effect of a division of the cervical
sympathetic nerve
4th partial closure of the eyelids in animals born of parents in
which that state of the eyelids had been caused either by the section
of the cervical sympathetic nerve or the removal of the superior
cervical ganglion
5th exophthalmia in animals born of parents in which an injury to the
restiform body had produced that protrusion of the eyeball this
interesting fact i have witnessed a good many times and i have seen
the transmission of the morbid state of the eye continue through four
generations in these animals modified by heredity the two eyes
generally protruded although in the parents usually only one showed
exophthalmia the lesion having been made in most cases only on one of
the corpora restiformia
6th hmatoma and dry gangrene of the ears in animals born of parents
in which these earalterations had been caused by an injury to the
restiform body near the nib of the calamus
7th absence of two toes out of the three of the hind leg and
sometimes of the three in animals whose parents had eaten up their
hindleg toes which had become ansthetic from a section of the sciatic
nerve alone or of that nerve and also of the crural sometimes
instead of complete absence of the toes only a part of one or two or
three was missing in the young although in the parent not only the
toes but the whole foot was absent partly eaten off partly destroyed
by inflammation ulceration or gangrene
8th appearance of various morbid states of the skin and hair of the
neck and face in animals born of parents having had similar alterations
in the same parts as effects of an injury to the sciatic nerve
it should be especially observed that brownsquard has bred during
thirty years many thousand guineapigs from animals which had not been
operated upon and not one of these manifested the epileptic tendency
nor has he ever seen a guineapig born without toes which was not the
offspring of parents which had gnawed off their own toes owing to the
sciatic nerve having been divided of this latter fact thirteen
instances were carefully recorded and a greater number were seen yet
brownsquard speaks of such cases as one of the rarer forms of
inheritance it is a still more interesting fact
that the sciatic nerve in the congenitally toeless animal has
inherited the power of passing through all the different morbid states
which have occurred in one of its parents from the time of the division
till after its reunion with the peripheric end it is not therefore
simply the power of performing an action which is inherited but the
power of performing a whole series of actions in a certain order
in most of the cases of inheritance recorded by brownsquard only one
of the two parents had been operated upon and was affected he
concludes by expressing his belief that what is transmitted is the
morbid state of the nervous system due to the operation performed on
the parents
with the lower animals dr prosper lucas has collected a long list of
inherited injuries a few instances will suffice a cow lost a horn
from an accident with consequent suppuration and she produced three
calves which were hornless on the same side of the head with the
horse there seems hardly a doubt that exostoses on the legs caused by
too much travelling on hard roads are inherited blumenbach records
the case of a man who had his little finger on the right hand almost
cut off and which in consequence grew crooked and his sons had the
same finger on the same hand similarly crooked a soldier fifteen
years before his marriage lost his left eye from purulent ophthalmia
and his two sons were microphthalmic on the same side59 in all cases
in which a parent has had an organ injured on one side and two or more
of the offspring are born with the same organ affected on the same
side the chances against mere coincidence are almost infinitely great
even when only a single child is born having exactly the same part of
the body affected as that of his injured parent the chances against
coincidence are great and professor rolleston has given me two such
cases which have fallen under his own observationnamely of two men
one of whom had his knee and the other his cheek severely cut and both
had children born with exactly the same spot marked or scarred many
instances have been recorded of cats dogs and horses which have had
their tails legs etc amputated or injured producing offspring with
the same parts illformed but as it is not very rare for similar
malformations to appear spontaneously all such cases may be due to
coincidence it is however an argument on the other side that under
the old excise laws the shepherddog was only exempt from tax when
without a tail and for this reason it was always removed60 and
there still exist breeds of the shepherddog which are always born
destitute of a tail finally it must be admitted more especially
since the publication of brownsquards observations that the effects
of injuries especially when followed by disease or perhaps
exclusively when thus followed are occasionally inherited61
      causes of noninheritance
a large number of cases of noninheritance are intelligible on the
principle that a strong tendency to inheritance does exist but that
it is overborne by hostile or unfavourable conditions of life no one
would expect that our improved pigs if forced during several
generations to travel about and root in the ground for their own
subsistence would transmit as truly as they now do their short
muzzles and legs and their tendency to fatten drayhorses assuredly
would not long transmit their great size and massive limbs if
compelled to live on a cold damp mountainous region we have indeed
evidence of such deterioration in the horses which have run wild on the
falkland islands european dogs in india often fail to transmit their
true character our sheep in tropical countries lose their wool in a
few generations there seems also to be a close relation between
certain peculiar pastures and the inheritance of an enlarged tail in
fattailed sheep which form one of the most ancient breeds in the
world with plants we have seen that tropical varieties of maize lose
their proper character in the course of two or three generations when
cultivated in europe and conversely so it is with european varieties
cultivated in brazil our cabbages which here come so true by seed
cannot form heads in hot countries according to carrire62 the
purpleleafed beech and barberry transmit their character by seed far
less truly in certain districts than in others under changed
circumstances periodical habits of life soon fail to be transmitted
as the period of maturity in summer and winter wheat barley and
vetches so it is with animals for instance a person whose statement
i can trust procured eggs of aylesbury ducks from that town where
they are kept in houses and are reared as early as possible for the
london market the ducks bred from these eggs in a distant part of
england hatched their first brood on january 24th whilst common
ducks kept in the same yard and treated in the same manner did not
hatch till the end of march and this shows that the period of hatching
was inherited but the grandchildren of these aylesbury ducks
completely lost their habit of early incubation and hatched their eggs
at the same time with the common ducks of the same place
many cases of noninheritance apparently result from the conditions of
life continually inducing fresh variability we have seen that when the
seeds of pears plums apples etc are sown the seedlings generally
inherit some degree of family likeness mingled with these seedlings a
few and sometimes many worthless wildlooking plants commonly
appear and their appearance may be attributed to the principle of
reversion but scarcely a single seedling will be found perfectly to
resemble the parentform and thus may be accounted for by constantly
recurring variability induced by the conditions of life i believe in
this because it has been observed that certain fruittrees truly
propagate their kind whilst growing on their own roots but when
grafted on other stocks and by this process their natural state is
manifestly affected they produce seedlings which vary greatly
departing from the parental type in many characters63 metzger as
stated in the ninth chapter found that certain kinds of wheat brought
from spain and cultivated in germany failed during many years to
reproduce themselves truly but at last when accustomed to their new
conditions they ceased to be variablethat is they became amenable
to the power of inheritance nearly all the plants which cannot be
propagated with any approach to certainty by seed are kinds which have
been long propagated by buds cuttings offsets tubers etc and have
in consequence been frequently exposed during what may be called their
individual lives to widely diversified conditions of life plants thus
propagated become so variable that they are subject as we have seen
in the last chapter even to budvariation our domesticated animals
on the other hand are not commonly exposed during the life of the
individual to such extremely diversified conditions and are not liable
to such extreme variability therefore they do not lose the power of
transmitting most of their characteristic features in the foregoing
remarks on noninheritance crossed breeds are of course excluded as
their diversity mainly depends on the unequal development of character
derived from either parent or their ancestors
      conclusion
it has been shown in the early part of this chapter how commonly new
characters of the most diversified nature whether normal or abnormal
injurious or beneficial whether affecting organs of the highest or
most trifling importance are inherited it is often sufficient for the
inheritance of some peculiar character that one parent alone should
possess it as in most cases in which the rarer anomalies have been
transmitted but the power of transmission is extremely variable in a
number of individuals descended from the same parents and treated in
the same manner some display this power in a perfect manner and in
some it is quite deficient and for this difference no reason can be
assigned the effects of injuries or mutilations are occasionally
inherited and we shall see in a future chapter that the longcontinued
use and disuse of parts produces an inherited effect even those
characters which are considered the most fluctuating such as colour
are with rare exceptions transmitted much more forcibly than is
generally supposed the wonder indeed in all cases is not that any
character should be transmitted but that the power of inheritance
should ever fail the checks to inheritance as far as we know them
are firstly circumstances hostile to the particular character in
question secondly conditions of life incessantly inducing fresh
variability and lastly the crossing of distinct varieties during some
previous generation together with reversion or atavismthat is the
tendency in the child to resemble its grandparents or more remote
ancestors instead of its immediate parents this latter subject will be
discussed in the following chapter

some cases to reversion
the great principle of inheritance to be discussed in this chapter has
been recognised by agriculturists and authors of various nations as
shown by the scientific term  atavism derived from atavus an
ancestor by the english terms of reversion or throwingback by
the french  pasenarrire and by the german rckschlag or
rckschritt when the child resembles either grandparent more closely
than its immediate parents our attention is not much arrested though
in truth the fact is highly remarkable but when the child resembles
some remote ancestor or some distant member in a collateral lineand
in the last case we must attribute this to the descent of all the
members from a common progenitorwe feel a just degree of
astonishment when one parent alone displays some newlyacquired and
generally inheritable character and the offspring do not inherit it
the cause may lie in the other parent having the power of prepotent
transmission but when both parents are similarly characterised and
the child does not whatever the cause may be inherit the character in
question but resembles its grandparents we have one of the simplest
cases of reversion we continually see another and even more simple
case of atavism though not generally included under this head namely
when the son more closely resembles his maternal than his paternal
grandsire in some male attribute as in any peculiarity in the beard
of man the horns of the bull the hackles or comb of the cock or as
in certain diseases necessarily confined to the male sex for as the
mother cannot possess or exhibit such male attributes the child must
inherit them through her blood from his maternal grandsire
 the cases of reversion may be divided into two main classes which
 however in some instances blend into one another namely first
 those occurring in a variety or race which has not been crossed but
 has lost by variation some character that it formerly possessed and
 which afterwards reappears the second class includes all cases in
 which an individual with some distinguishable character a race or
 species has at some former period been crossed and a character
 derived from this cross after having disappeared during one or
 several generations suddenly reappears a third class differing only
 in the manner of reproduction might be formed to include all cases of
 reversion effected by means of buds and therefore independent of true
 or seminal generation perhaps even a fourth class might be
 instituted to include reversions by segments in the same individual
 flower or fruit and in different parts of the body in the same
 individual animal as it grows old but the two first main classes will
 be sufficient for our purpose
reversion to lost characters by pure or uncrossed formsstriking
instances of this first class of cases were given in the sixth chapter
namely of the occasional reappearance in variouslycoloured breeds of
the pigeon of blue birds with all the marks characteristic of the wild
columba livia similar cases were given in the case of the fowl with
the common ass as the legs of the wild progenitor are almost always
striped we may feel assured that the occasional appearance of such
stripes in the domestic animal is a case of simple reversion but i
shall be compelled to refer again to these cases and therefore here
pass them over
the aboriginal species from which our domesticated cattle and sheep are
descended no doubt possessed horns but several hornless breeds are
now well established yet in thesefor instance in southdown sheepit
is not unusual to find among the male lambs some with small horns the
horns which thus occasionally reappear in other polled breeds either
grow to the full size or are curiously attached to the skin alone
and hang loosely down or drop off1 the galloways and suffolk
cattle have been hornless for the last 100 or 150 years but a horned
calf with the horn often loosely attached is occasionally
produced2
there is reason to believe that sheep in their early domesticated
condition were brown or dingy black but even in the time of david
certain flocks were spoken of as white as snow during the classical
period the sheep of spain are described by several ancient authors as
being black red or tawny3 at the present day notwithstanding the
great care which is taken to prevent it particoloured lambs and some
entirely black are occasionally or even frequently dropped by our
most highly improved and valued breeds such as the southdowns since
the time of the famous bakewell during the last century the leicester
sheep have been bred with the most scrupulous care yet occasionally
greyfaced or blackspotted or wholly black lambs appear4 this
occurs still more frequently with the less improved breeds such as the
norfolks5 as bearing on this tendency in sheep to revert to dark
colours i may state though in doing so i trench on the reversion of
crossed breeds and likewise on the subject of prepotency that the
rev w d fox was informed that seven white southdown ewes were put to
a socalled spanish ram which had two small black spots on his sides
and they produced thirteen lambs all perfectly black mr fox believes
that this ram belonged to a breed which he has himself kept and which
is always spotted with black and white and he finds that leicester
sheep crossed by rams of this breed always produce black lambs he has
gone on recrossing these crossed sheep with pure white leicesters
during three successive generations but always with the same result
mr fox was also told by the friend from whom the spotted breed was
procured that he likewise had gone on for six or seven generations
crossing with white sheep but still black lambs were invariably
produced
similar facts could be given with respect to tailless breeds of various
animals for instance mr hewitt6 states that chickens bred from
some rumpless fowls which were reckoned so good that they won a prize
at an exhibition in a considerable number of instances were furnished
with fully developed tailfeathers on inquiry the original breeder
of these fowls stated that from the time when he had first kept them
they had often produced fowls furnished with tails but that these
latter would again reproduce rumpless chickens
analogous cases of reversion occur in the vegetable kingdom thus from
seeds gathered from the finest cultivated varieties of heartsease
viola tricolor plants perfectly wild both in their foliage and
their flowers are frequently produced7 but the reversion in this
instance is not to a very ancient period for the best existing
varieties of the heartsease are of comparatively modern origin with
most of our cultivated vegetables there is some tendency to reversion
to what is known to be or may be presumed to be their aboriginal
state and this would be more evident if gardeners did not generally
look over their beds of seedlings and pull up the false plants or
rogues as they are called it has already been remarked that some
few seedling apples and pears generally resemble but apparently are
not identical with the wild trees from which they are descended in
our turnip8 and carrotbeds a few plants often break that is
flower too soon and their roots are generally hard and stringy as in
the parentspecies by the aid of a little selection carried on during
a few generations most of our cultivated plants could probably be
brought back without any great change in their conditions of life to
a wild or nearly wild condition mr buckman has effected this with the
parsnip9 and mr hewett c watson as he informs me selected
during three generations the most diverging plants of scotch kail
perhaps one of the least modified varieties of the cabbage and in the
third generation some of the plants came very close to the forms now
established in england about old castlewalls and called indigenous
reversion in animals and plants which have run wildin the cases
hitherto considered the reverting animals and plants have not been
exposed to any great or abrupt change in their conditions of life which
could have induced this tendency but it is very different with animals
and plants which have become feral or run wild it has been repeatedly
asserted in the most positive manner by various authors that feral
animals and plants invariably return to their primitive specific type
it is curious on what little evidence this belief rests many of our
domesticated animals could not subsist in a wild state thus the more
highly improved breeds of the pigeon will not field or search for
their own food sheep have never become feral and would be destroyed
by almost every beast of prey10 in several cases we do not know the
aboriginal parentspecies and cannot possibly tell whether or not
there has been any close degree of reversion it is not known in any
instance what variety was first turned out several varieties have
probably in some cases run wild and their crossing alone would tend to
obliterate their proper character our domesticated animals and plants
when they run wild must always be exposed to new conditions of life
for as mr wallace11 has well remarked they have to obtain their
own food and are exposed to competition with the native productions
under these circumstances if our domesticated animals did not undergo
change of some kind the result would be quite opposed to the
conclusions arrived at in this work nevertheless i do not doubt that
the simple fact of animals and plants becoming feral does cause some
tendency to reversion to the primitive state though this tendency has
been much exaggerated by some authors
i will briefly run through the recorded cases with neither horses nor
cattle is the primitive stock known and it has been shown in former
chapters that they have assumed different colours in different
countries thus the horses which have run wild in south america are
generally brownishbay and in the east duncoloured their heads have
become larger and coarser and this may be due to reversion no careful
description has been given of the feral goat dogs which have run wild
in various countries have hardly anywhere assumed a uniform character
but they are probably descended from several domestic races and
aboriginally from several distinct species feral cats both in europe
and la plata are regularly striped in some cases they have grown to
an unusually large size but do not differ from the domestic animal in
any other character when variouslycoloured tame rabbits are turned
out in europe they generally reacquire the colouring of the wild
animal there can be no doubt that this does really occur but we
should remember that oddlycoloured and conspicuous animals would
suffer much from beasts of prey and from being easily shot this at
least was the opinion of a gentleman who tried to stock his woods with
a nearly white variety if thus destroyed they would be supplanted by
instead of being transformed into the common rabbit we have seen that
the feral rabbits of jamaica and especially of porto santo have
assumed new colours and other new characters the best known case of
reversion and that on which the widely spread belief in its
universality apparently rests is that of pigs these animals have run
wild in the west indies south america and the falkland islands and
have everywhere acquired the dark colour the thick bristles and great
tusks of the wild boar and the young have reacquired longitudinal
stripes but even in the case of the pig roulin describes the
halfwild animals in different parts of south america as differing in
several respects in louisiana the pig12 has run wild and is said to
differ a little in form and much in colour from the domestic animal
yet does not closely resemble the wild boar of europe with pigeons and
fowls13 it is not known what variety was first turned out nor what
character the feral birds have assumed the guineafowl in the west
indies when feral seems to vary more than in the domesticated state
with respect to plants run wild dr hooker14 has strongly insisted
on what slight evidence the common belief in their reversion to a
primitive state rests godron15 describes wild turnips carrots and
celery but these plants in their cultivated state hardly differ from
their wild prototypes except in the succulency and enlargement of
certain parts characters which would certainly be lost by plants
growing in poor soil and struggling with other plants no cultivated
plant has run wild on so enormous a scale as the cardoon cynara
cardunculus in la plata every botanist who has seen it growing
there in vast beds as high as a horses back has been struck with
its peculiar appearance but whether it differs in any important point
from the cultivated spanish form which is said not to be prickly like
its american descendant or whether it differs from the wild
mediterranean species which is said not to be social though this may
be due merely to the nature of the conditions i do not know
reversion to characters derived from a cross in the case of
subvarieties races and specieswhen an individual having some
recognisable peculiarity unites with another of the same subvariety
not having the peculiarity in question it often reappears in the
descendants after an interval of several generations every one must
have noticed or heard from old people of children closely resembling
in appearance or mental disposition or in so small and complex a
character as expression one of their grandparents or some more
distant collateral relation very many anomalies of structure and
diseases16 of which instances have been given in the last chapter
have come into a family from one parent and have reappeared in the
progeny after passing over two or three generations the following case
has been communicated to me on good authority and may i believe be
fully trusted a pointerbitch produced seven puppies four were marked
with blue and white which is so unusual a colour with pointers that
she was thought to have played false with one of the greyhounds and
the whole litter was condemned but the gamekeeper was permitted to
save one as a curiosity two years afterwards a friend of the owner saw
the young dog and declared that he was the image of his old
pointerbitch sappho the only blue and white pointer of pure descent
which he had ever seen this led to close inquiry and it was proved
that he was the greatgreatgrandson of sappho so that according to
the common expression he had only 116th of her blood in his veins i
may give one other instance on the authority of mr r walker a large
cattlebreeder in kincardineshire he bought a black bull the son of a
black cow with white legs white belly and part of the tail white and
in 1870 a calf the grgrgrgrgrandchild of this cow was born
coloured in the same very peculiar manner all the intermediate
offspring having been black in these cases there can hardly be a doubt
that a character derived from a cross with an individual of the same
variety reappeared after passing over three generations in the one
case and five in the other
when two distinct races are crossed it is notorious that the tendency
in the offspring to revert to one or both parentforms is strong and
endures for many generations i have myself seen the clearest evidence
of this in crossed pigeons and with various plants mr sidney17
states that in a litter of essex pigs two young ones appeared which
were the image of the berkshire boar that had been used twentyeight
years before in giving size and constitution to the breed i observed
in the farmyard at betley hall some fowls showing a strong likeness to
the malay breed and was told by mr tollet that he had forty years
before crossed his birds with malays and that though he had at first
attempted to get rid of this strain he had subsequently given up the
attempt in despair as the malay character would reappear
this strong tendency in crossed breeds to revert has given rise to
endless discussions in how many generations after a single cross
either with a distinct breed or merely with an inferior animal the
breed may be considered as pure and free from all danger of reversion
no one supposes that less than three generations suffices and most
breeders think that six seven or eight are necessary and some go to
still greater lengths18 but neither in the case of a breed which has
been contaminated by a single cross nor when in the attempt to form
an intermediate breed halfbred animals have been matched together
during many generations can any rule be laid down how soon the
tendency to reversion will be obliterated it depends on the difference
in the strength or prepotency of transmission in the two parentforms
on their actual amount of difference and on the nature of the
conditions of life to which the crossed offspring are exposed but we
must be careful not to confound these cases of reversion to characters
which were gained by a cross with those under the first class in
which characters originally common to both parents but lost at some
former period reappear for such characters may recur after an almost
indefinite number of generations
the law of reversion is as powerful with hybrids when they are
sufficiently fertile to breed together or when they are repeatedly
crossed with either pure parentform as in the case of mongrels it is
not necessary to give instances with plants almost every one who has
worked on this subject from the time of klreuter to the present day
has insisted on this tendency grtner has recorded some good
instances but no one has given more striking ones than naudin19 the
tendency differs in degree or strength in different groups and partly
depends as we shall presently see on whether the parentplants have
been long cultivated although the tendency to reversion is extremely
general with nearly all mongrels and hybrids it cannot be considered
as invariably characteristic of them it may also be mastered by
longcontinued selection but these subjects will more properly be
discussed in a future chapter on crossing from what we see of the
power and scope of reversion both in pure races and when varieties or
species are crossed we may infer that characters of almost every kind
are capable of reappearing after having been lost for a great length of
time but it does not follow from this that in each particular case
certain characters will reappear for instance this will not occur
when a race is crossed with another endowed with prepotency of
transmission sometimes the power of reversion wholly fails without
our being able to assign any cause for the failure thus it has been
stated that in a french family in which 85 out of above 600 members
during six generations had been subject to nightblindness there has
not been a single example of this affection in the children of parents
who were themselves free from it20
reversion through budpropagationpartial reversion by segments in
the same flower or fruit or in different parts of the body in the same
individual animalin the eleventh chapter many cases of reversion by
buds independently of seminal generation were givenas when a
leafbud on a variegated a curled or laciniated variety suddenly
reassumes its proper character or as when a provencerose appears on a
mossrose or a peach on a nectarinetree in some of these cases only
half the flower or fruit or a smaller segment or mere stripes
reassume their former character and here we have reversion by
segments vilmorin21 has also recorded several cases with plants
derived from seed of flowers reverting by stripes or blotches to their
primitive colours he states that in all such cases a white or
palecoloured variety must first be formed and when this is
propagated for a length of time by seed striped seedlings occasionally
make their appearance and these can afterwards by care be multiplied
by seed
the stripes and segments just referred to are not due as far as is
known to reversion to characters derived from a cross but to
characters lost by variation these cases however as naudin22
insists in his discussion on disjunction of character are closely
analogous with those given in the eleventh chapter in which crossed
plants have been known to produce halfandhalf or striped flowers and
fruit or distinct kinds of flowers on the same root resembling the two
parentforms many piebald animals probably come under this same head
such cases as we shall see in the chapter on crossing apparently
result from certain characters not readily blending together and as a
consequence of this incapacity for fusion the offspring either
perfectly resemble one of their two parents or resemble one parent in
one part and the other parent in another part or whilst young are
intermediate in character but with advancing age revert wholly or by
segments to either parentform or to both thus young trees of the
cytisus adami are intermediate in foliage and flowers between the two
parentforms but when older the buds continually revert either
partially or wholly to both forms the cases given in the eleventh
chapter on the changes which occurred during growth in crossed plants
of tropolum cereus datura and lathyrus are all analogous as
however these plants are hybrids of the first generation and as their
buds after a time come to resemble their parents and not their
grandparents these cases do not at first appear to come under the law
of reversion in the ordinary sense of the word nevertheless as the
change is effected through a succession of budgenerations on the same
plant they may be thus included
analogous facts have been observed in the animal kingdom and are more
remarkable as they occur in the same individual in the strictest
sense and not as with plants through a succession of budgenerations
with animals the act of reversion if it can be so designated does not
pass over a true generation but merely over the early stages of growth
in the same individual for instance i crossed several white hens with
a black cock and many of the chickens were during the first year
perfectly white but acquired during the second year black feathers on
the other hand some of the chickens which were at first black became
during the second year piebald with white a great breeder23 says
that a pencilled brahma hen which has any of the blood of the light
brahma in her will occasionally produce a pullet well pencilled
during the first year but she will most likely moult brown on the
shoulders and become quite unlike her original colours in the second
year the same thing occurs with light brahmas if of impure blood i
have observed exactly similar cases with the crossed offspring from
differently coloured pigeons but here is a more remarkable fact i
crossed a turbit which has a frill formed by the feathers being
reversed on its breast with a trumpeter and one of the young pigeons
thus raised at first showed not a trace of the frill but after
moulting thrice a small yet unmistakably distinct frill appeared on
its breast according to girou24 calves produced from a red cow by a
black bull or from a black cow by a red bull are not rarely born red
and subsequently become black i possess a dog the daughter of a white
terrier by a foxcoloured bulldog as a puppy she was quite white but
when about six months old a black spot appeared on her nose and brown
spots on her ears when a little older she was badly wounded on the
back and the hair which grew on the cicatrix was of a brown colour
apparently derived from her father this is the more remarkable as
with most animals having coloured hair that which grows on a wounded
surface is white
in the foregoing cases the characters which with advancing age
reappeared were present in the immediately preceding generations but
characters sometimes reappear in the same manner after a much longer
interval of time thus the calves of a hornless race of cattle which
originated in corrientes though at first quite hornless as they
become adult sometimes acquire small crooked and loose horns and
these in succeeding years occasionally become attached to the
skull25 white and black bantams both of which generally breed true
sometimes assume as they grow old a saffron or red plumage for
instance a firstrate black bantam has been described which during
three seasons was perfectly black but then annually became more and
more red and it deserves notice that this tendency to change whenever
it occurs in a bantam is almost certain to prove hereditary26 the
cuckoo or bluemottled dorking cock when old is liable to acquire
yellow or orange hackles in place of his proper bluishgrey
hackles27 now as gallus bankiva is coloured red and orange and as
dorking fowls and bantams are descended from this species we can
hardly doubt that the change which occasionally occurs in the plumage
of these birds as their age advances results from a tendency in the
individual to revert to the primitive type
crossing as a direct cause of reversionit has long been notorious
that hybrids and mongrels often revert to both or to one of their
parentforms after an interval of from two to seven or eight or
according to some authorities even a greater number of generations
but that the act of crossing in itself gives an impulse towards
reversion as shown by the reappearance of longlost characters has
never i believe been hitherto proved the proof lies in certain
peculiarities which do not characterise the immediate parents and
therefore cannot have been derived from them frequently appearing in
the offspring of two breeds when crossed which peculiarities never
appear or appear with extreme rarity in these same breeds as long as
they are precluded from crossing as this conclusion seems to me highly
curious and novel i will give the evidence in detail
my attention was first called to this subject and i was led to make
numerous experiments by mm boitard and corbie having stated that
when they crossed certain breeds of pigeons birds coloured like the
wild c livia or the common dovecotenamely slatyblue with double
black wingbars sometimes chequered with black white loins the tail
barred with black with the outer feathers edged with whitewere
almost invariably produced the breeds which i crossed and the
remarkable results attained have been fully described in the sixth
chapter i selected pigeons belonging to true and ancient breeds which
had not a trace of blue or any of the above specified marks but when
crossed and their mongrels recrossed young birds were often produced
more or less plainly coloured slatyblue with some or all of the
proper characteristic marks i may recall to the readers memory one
case namely that of a pigeon hardly distinguishable from the wild
shetland species the grandchild of a redspot white fantail and two
black barbs from any of which when purelybred the production of a
pigeon coloured like the wild c livia would have been almost a
prodigy
i was thus led to make the experiments recorded in the seventh
chapter on fowls i selected longestablished pure breeds in which
there was not a trace of red yet in several of the mongrels feathers
of this colour appeared and one magnificent bird the offspring of a
black spanish cock and white silk hen was coloured almost exactly like
the wild gallus bankiva all who know anything of the breeding of
poultry will admit that tens of thousands of pure spanish and of pure
white silk fowls might have been reared without the appearance of a red
feather the fact given on the authority of mr tegetmeier of the
frequent appearance in mongrel fowls of pencilled or
transverselybarred feathers like those common to many gallinaceous
birds is likewise apparently a case of reversion to a character
formerly possessed by some ancient progenitor of the family i owe to
the kindness of this excellent observer the opportunity of inspecting
some neckhackles and tailfeathers from a hybrid between the common
fowl and a very distinct species the gallus varius and these feathers
are transversely striped in a conspicuous manner with dark metallic
blue and grey a character which could not have been derived from
either immediate parent
i have been informed by mr b p brent that he crossed a white
aylesbury drake and a black socalled labrador duck both of which are
true breeds and he obtained a young drake closely like the mallard
a boschas of the muskduck cairina moschata linn there are
two subbreeds namely white and slatecoloured and these i am
informed breed true or nearly true but the rev w d fox tells me
that by putting a white drake to a slatecoloured duck black birds
pied with white like the wild muskduck were always produced i hear
from mr blyth that hybrids from the canary and goldfinch almost
always have streaked feathers on their backs and this streaking must
be derived from the original wild canary
we have seen in the fourth chapter that the socalled himalayan
rabbit with its snowwhite body black ears nose tail and feet
breeds perfectly true this race is known to have been formed by the
union of two varieties of silvergrey rabbits now when a himalayan
doe was crossed by a sandycoloured buck a silvergrey rabbit was
produced and this is evidently a case of reversion to one of the
parent varieties the young of the himalayan rabbit are born
snowwhite and the dark marks do not appear until some time
subsequently but occasionally young himalayan rabbits are born of a
light silvergrey which colour soon disappears so that here we have a
trace of reversion during an early period of life to the parent
varieties independently of any recent cross
in the third chapter it was shown that at an ancient period some breeds
of cattle in the wilder parts of britain were white with dark ears and
that the cattle now kept half wild in certain parks and those which
have run quite wild in two distant parts of the world are likewise
thus coloured now an experienced breeder mr j beasley of
northamptonshire28 crossed some carefully selected west highland
cows with purelybred shorthorn bulls the bulls were red red and
white or dark roan and the highland cows were all of a red colour
inclining to a light or yellow shade but a considerable number of the
offspringand mr beasley calls attention to this as a remarkable
factwere white or white with red ears bearing in mind that none of
the parents were white and that they were purelybred animals it is
highly probable that here the offspring reverted in consequence of the
cross to the colour of some ancient and halfwild parentbreed the
following case perhaps comes under the same head cows in their
natural state have their udders but little developed and do not yield
nearly so much milk as our domesticated animals now there is some
reason to believe29 that crossbred animals between two kinds both
of which are good milkers such as alderneys and shorthorns often turn
out worthless in this respect
in the chapter on the horse reasons were assigned for believing that
the primitive stock was striped and duncoloured and details were
given showing that in all parts of the world stripes of a dark colour
frequently appear along the spine across the legs and on the
shoulders where they are occasionally double or treble and even
sometimes on the face and body of horses of all breeds and of all
colours but the stripes appear most frequently on the various kinds of
duns in foals they are sometimes plainly seen and subsequently
disappear the duncolour and the stripes are strongly transmitted when
a horse thus characterised is crossed with any other but i was not
able to prove that striped duns are generally produced from the
crossing of two distinct breeds neither of which are duns though this
does sometimes occur
the legs of the ass are often striped and this may be considered as a
reversion to the wild parent form the equus tniopus of
abyssinia30 which is generally thus striped in the domestic animal
the stripes on the shoulder are occasionally double or forked at the
extremity as in certain zebrine species there is reason to believe
that the foal is more frequently striped on the legs than the adult
animal as with the horse i have not acquired any distinct evidence
that the crossing of differentlycoloured varieties of the ass brings
out the stripes
but now let us turn to the result of crossing the horse and ass
although mules are not nearly so numerous in england as asses i have
seen a much greater number with striped legs and with the stripes far
more conspicuous than in either parentform such mules are generally
lightcoloured and might be called fallowduns the shoulderstripe in
one instance was deeply forked at the extremity and in another
instance was double though united in the middle mr martin gives a
figure of a spanish mule with strong zebralike marks on its legs31
and remarks that mules are particularly liable to be thus striped on
their legs in south america according to roulin32 such stripes are
more frequent and conspicuous in the mule than in the ass in the
united states mr gosse33 speaking of these animals says that in
a great number perhaps in nine out of every ten the legs are banded
with transverse dark stripes
many years ago i saw in the zoological gardens a curious triple hybrid
from a bay mare by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra this
animal when old had hardly any stripes but i was assured by the
superintendent that when young it had shoulderstripes and faint
stripes on its flanks and legs i mention this case more especially as
an instance of the stripes being much plainer during youth than in old
age
as the zebra has such a conspicuously striped body and legs it might
have been expected that the hybrids from this animal and the common ass
would have had their legs in some degree striped but it appears from
the figures given in dr grays knowsley gleanings and still more
plainly from that given by geoffroy and f cuvier34 that the legs
are much more conspicuously striped than the rest of the body and this
fact is intelligible only on the belief that the ass aids in giving
through the power of reversion this character to its hybrid offspring
the quagga is banded over the whole front part of its body like a
zebra but has no stripes on its legs or mere traces of them but in
the famous hybrid bred by lord morton35 from a chestnut nearly
purelybred arabian mare by a male quagga the stripes were more
strongly defined and darker than those on the legs of the quagga the
mare was subsequently put to a black arabian horse and bore two colts
both of which as formerly stated were plainly striped on the legs
and one of them likewise had stripes on the neck and body
the equus indicus36 is characterised by a spinal stripe without
shoulder or leg stripes but traces of these latter stripes may
occasionally be seen even in the adult37 and colonel s poole who
has had ample opportunities for observation informs me that in the
foal when first born the head and legs are often striped but the
shoulderstripe is not so distinct as in the domestic ass all these
stripes excepting that along the spine soon disappear now a hybrid
raised at knowsley38 from a female of this species by a male domestic
ass had all four legs transversely and conspicuously striped had
three short stripes on each shoulder and had even some zebralike
stripes on its face dr gray informs me that he has seen a second
hybrid of the same parentage similarly striped
from these facts we see that the crossing of the several equine species
tends in a marked manner to cause stripes to appear on various parts of
the body especially on the legs as we do not know whether the
parentform of the genus was striped the appearance of the stripes can
only hypothetically be attributed to reversion but most persons after
considering the many undoubted cases of variously coloured marks
reappearing by reversion in my experiments on crossed pigeons and
fowls will come to the same conclusion with respect to the
horsegenus and if so we must admit that the progenitor of the group
was striped on the legs shoulders face and probably over the whole
body like a zebra
lastly professor jaeger has given39 a good case with pigs he
crossed the japanese or masked breed with the common german breed and
the offspring were intermediate in character he then recrossed one of
these mongrels with the pure japanese and in the litter thus produced
one of the young resembled in all its characters a wild pig it had a
long snout and upright ears and was striped on the back it should be
borne in mind that the young of the japanese breed are not striped and
that they have a short muzzle and ears remarkably dependent
a similar tendency to the recovery of long lost characters holds good
even with the instincts of crossed animals there are some breeds of
fowls which are called everlasting layers because they have lost the
instinct of incubation and so rare is it for them to incubate that i
have seen notices published in works on poultry when hens of such
breeds have taken to sit40 yet the aboriginal species was of course
a good incubator and with birds in a state of nature hardly any
instinct is so strong as this now so many cases have been recorded of
the crossed offspring from two races neither of which are incubators
becoming firstrate sitters that the reappearance of this instinct
must be attributed to reversion from crossing one author goes so far
as to say that a cross between two nonsitting varieties almost
invariably produces a mongrel that becomes broody and sits with
remarkable steadiness41 another author after giving a striking
example remarks that the fact can be explained only on the principle
that two negatives make a positive it cannot however be maintained
that hens produced from a cross between two nonsitting breeds
invariably recover their lost instinct any more than that crossed
fowls or pigeons invariably recover the red or blue plumage of their
prototypes thus i raised several chickens from a polish hen by a
spanish cockbreeds which do not incubateand none of the young hens
at first showed any tendency to sit but one of themthe only one which
was preservedin the third year sat well on her eggs and reared a brood
of chickens so that here we have the reappearance with advancing age
of a primitive instinct in the same manner as we have seen that the
red plumage of the gallus bankiva is sometimes reacquired both by
crossed and purelybred fowls of various kinds as they grow old
the parents of all our domesticated animals were of course aboriginally
wild in disposition and when a domesticated species is crossed with a
distinct species whether this is a domesticated or only a tamed
animal the hybrids are often wild to such a degree that the fact is
intelligible only on the principle that the cross has caused a partial
return to a primitive disposition thus the earl of powis formerly
imported some thoroughly domesticated humped cattle from india and
crossed them with english breeds which belong to a distinct species
and his agent remarked to me without any question having been asked
how oddly wild the crossbred animals were the european wild boar and
the chinese domesticated pig are almost certainly specifically
distinct sir f darwin crossed a sow of the latter breed with a wild
alpine boar which had become extremely tame but the young though
having halfdomesticated blood in their veins were extremely wild in
confinement and would not eat swill like common english pigs captain
hutton in india crossed a tame goat with a wild one from the
himalaya and he remarked to me how surprisingly wild the offspring
were mr hewitt who has had great experience in crossing tame
cockpheasants with fowls belonging to five breeds gives as the
character of all extraordinary wildness42 but i have myself seen
one exception to this rule mr s j salter43 who raised a large
number of hybrids from a bantamhen by gallus sonneratii states that
all were exceedingly wild mr waterton44 bred some wild ducks from
eggs hatched under a common duck and the young were allowed to cross
freely both amongst themselves and with the tame ducks they were half
wild and half tame they came to the windows to be fed but still they
had a wariness about them quite remarkable
on the other hand mules from the horse and ass are certainly not in
the least wild though notorious for obstinacy and vice mr brent who
has crossed canarybirds with many kinds of finches has not observed
as he informs me that the hybrids were in any way remarkably wild but
mr jenner weir who has had still greater experience is of a directly
opposite opinion he remarks that the siskin is the tamest of finches
but its mules are as wild when young as newly caught birds and are
often lost through their continued efforts to escape hybrids are often
raised between the common and musk duck and i have been assured by
three persons who have kept these crossed birds that they were not
wild but mr garnett45 observed that his hybrids were wild and
exhibited migratory propensities of which there is not a vestige in
the common or musk duck no case is known of this latter bird having
escaped and become wild in europe or asia except according to pallas
on the caspian sea and the common domestic duck only occasionally
becomes wild in districts where large lakes and fens abound
nevertheless a large number of cases have been recorded46 of hybrids
from these two ducks having been shot in a completely wild state
although so few are reared in comparison with purelybred birds of
either species it is improbable that any of these hybrids could have
acquired their wildness from the muskduck having paired with a truly
wild duck and this is known not to be the case in north america hence
we must infer that they have reacquired through reversion their
wildness as well as renewed powers of flight
these latter facts remind us of the statements so frequently made by
travellers in all parts of the world on the degraded state and savage
disposition of crossed races of man that many excellent and
kindhearted mulattos have existed no one will dispute and a more mild
and gentle set of men could hardly be found than the inhabitants of the
island of chiloe who consist of indians commingled with spaniards in
various proportions on the other hand many years ago long before i
had thought of the present subject i was struck with the fact that in
south america men of complicated descent between negroes indians and
spaniards seldom had whatever the cause might be a good
expression47 livingstoneand a more unimpeachable authority cannot
be quotedafter speaking of a halfcaste man on the zambesi described
by the portuguese as a rare monster of inhumanity remarks it is
unaccountable why halfcastes such as he are so much more cruel than
the portuguese but such is undoubtedly the case an inhabitant
remarked to livingstone god made white men and god made black men
but the devil made halfcastes48 when two races both low in the
scale are crossed the progeny seems to be eminently bad thus the
noblehearted humboldt who felt no prejudice against the inferior
races speaks in strong terms of the bad and savage disposition of
zambos or halfcastes between indians and negroes and this conclusion
has been arrived at by various observers49 from these facts we may
perhaps infer that the degraded state of so many halfcastes is in part
due to reversion to a primitive and savage condition induced by the
act of crossing even if mainly due to the unfavourable moral
conditions under which they are generally reared
summary on the proximate causes leading to reversionwhen
purelybred animals or plants reassume longlost characterswhen the
common ass for instance is born with striped legs when a pure race
of black or white pigeons throws a slatyblue bird or when a
cultivated heartsease with large and rounded flowers produces a
seedling with small and elongated flowerswe are quite unable to
assign any proximate cause when animals run wild the tendency to
reversion which though it has been greatly exaggerated no doubt
exists is sometimes to a certain extent intelligible thus with feral
pigs exposure to the weather will probably favour the growth of the
bristles as is known to be the case with the hair of other
domesticated animals and through correlation the tusks will tend to be
redeveloped but the reappearance of coloured longitudinal stripes on
young feral pigs cannot be attributed to the direct action of external
conditions in this case and in many others we can only say that any
change in the habits of life apparently favour a tendency inherent or
latent in the species to return to the primitive state
it will be shown in a future chapter that the position of flowers on
the summit of the axis and the position of seeds within the capsule
sometimes determine a tendency towards reversion and this apparently
depends on the amount of sap or nutriment which the flowerbuds and
seeds receive the position also of buds either on branches or on
roots sometimes determines as was formerly shown the transmission of
the character proper to the variety or its reversion to a former
state
we have seen in the last section that when two races or species are
crossed there is the strongest tendency to the reappearance in the
offspring of longlost characters possessed by neither parent nor
immediate progenitor when two white or red or black pigeons of
wellestablished breeds are united the offspring are almost sure to
inherit the same colours but when differentlycoloured birds are
crossed the opposed forces of inheritance apparently counteract each
other and the tendency which is inherent in both parents to produce
slatyblue offspring becomes predominant so it is in several other
cases but when for instance the ass is crossed with e indicus or
with the horseanimals which have not striped legsand the hybrids have
conspicuous stripes on their legs and even on their faces all that can
be said is that an inherent tendency to reversion is evolved through
some disturbance in the organisation caused by the act of crossing
another form of reversion is far commoner indeed is almost universal
with the offspring from a cross namely to the characters proper to
either pure parentform as a general rule crossed offspring in the
first generation are nearly intermediate between their parents but the
grandchildren and succeeding generations continually revert in a
greater or lesser degree to one or both of their progenitors several
authors have maintained that hybrids and mongrels include all the
characters of both parents not fused together but merely mingled in
different proportions in different parts of the body or as naudin50
has expressed it a hybrid is a living mosaicwork in which the eye
cannot distinguish the discordant elements so completely are they
intermingled we can hardly doubt that in a certain sense this is
true as when we behold in a hybrid the elements of both species
segregating themselves into segments in the same flower or fruit by a
process of selfattraction or selfaffinity this segregation taking
place either by seminal or budpropagation naudin further believes
that the segregation of the two specific elements or essences is
eminently liable to occur in the male and female reproductive matter
and he thus explains the almost universal tendency to reversion in
successive hybrid generations for this would be the natural result of
the union of pollen and ovules in both of which the elements of the
same species had been segregated by selfaffinity if on the other
hand pollen which included the elements of one species happened to
unite with ovules including the elements of the other species the
intermediate or hybrid state would still be retained and there would
be no reversion but it would as i suspect be more correct to say
that the elements of both parentspecies exist in every hybrid in a
double state namely blended together and completely separate how
this is possible and what the term specific essence or element may be
supposed to express i shall attempt to show in the chapter on the
hypothesis of pangenesis
but naudins view as propounded by him is not applicable to the
reappearance of characters lost long ago by variation and it is hardly
applicable to races or species which after having been crossed at some
former period with a distinct form and having since lost all traces of
the cross nevertheless occasionally yield an individual which reverts
as in the case of the greatgreatgrandchild of the pointer sappho to
the crossing form the most simple case of reversion namely of a
hybrid or mongrel to its grandparents is connected by an almost
perfect series with the extreme case of a purelybred race recovering
characters which had been lost during many ages and we are thus led to
infer that all the cases must be related by some common bond
grtner believed that only highly sterile hybrid plants exhibit any
tendency to reversion to their parentforms this erroneous belief may
perhaps be accounted for by the nature of the genera crossed by him
for he admits that the tendency differs in different genera the
statement is also directly contradicted by naudins observations and
by the notorious fact that perfectly fertile mongrels exhibit the
tendency in a high degreeeven in a higher degree according to
grtner himself than hybrids51
grtner further states that reversions rarely occur with hybrid plants
raised from species which have not been cultivated whilst with those
which have been long cultivated they are of frequent occurrence this
conclusion explains a curious discrepancy max wichura52 who worked
exclusively on willows which had not been subjected to culture never
saw an instance of reversion and he goes so far as to suspect that the
careful gartner had not sufficiently protected his hybrids from the
pollen of the parentspecies naudin on the other hand who chiefly
experimented on cucurbitaceous and other cultivated plants insists
more strenuously than any other author on the tendency to reversion in
all hybrids the conclusion that the condition of the parentspecies
as affected by culture is one of the proximate causes leading to
reversion agrees well with the converse case of domesticated animals
and cultivated plants being liable to reversion when they become feral
for in both cases the organisation or constitution must be disturbed
though in a very different way53
finally we have seen that characters often reappear in purelybred
races without our being able to assign any proximate cause but when
they become feral this is either indirectly or directly induced by the
change in their conditions of life with crossed breeds the act of
crossing in itself certainly leads to the recovery of longlost
characters as well as of those derived from either parentform
changed conditions consequent on cultivation and the relative
position of buds flowers and seeds on the plant all apparently aid
in giving this same tendency reversion may occur either through
seminal or bud generation generally at birth but sometimes only with
an advance of age segments or portions of the individual may alone be
thus affected that a being should be born resembling in certain
characters an ancestor removed by two or three and in some cases by
hundreds or even thousands of generations is assuredly a wonderful
fact in these cases the child is commonly said to inherit such
characters directly from its grandparent or more remote ancestors but
this view is hardly conceivable if however we suppose that every
character is derived exclusively from the father or mother but that
many characters lie latent or dormant in both parents during a long
succession of generations the foregoing facts are intelligible in
what manner characters may be conceived to lie latent will be
considered in a future chapter to which i have lately alluded
latent charactersbut i must explain what is meant by characters
lying latent the most obvious illustration is afforded by secondary
sexual characters in every female all the secondary male characters
and in every male all the secondary female characters apparently exist
in a latent state ready to be evolved under certain conditions it is
well known that a large number of female birds such as fowls various
pheasants partridges peahens ducks etc when old or diseased or
when operated on assume many or all of the secondary male characters
of their species in the case of the henpheasant this has been
observed to occur far more frequently during certain years than during
others54 a duck ten years old has been known to assume both the
perfect winter and summer plumage of the drake55 waterton56 gives
a curious case of a hen which had ceased laying and had assumed the
plumage voice spurs and warlike disposition of the cock when
opposed to an enemy she would erect her hackles and show fight thus
every character even to the instinct and manner of fighting must have
lain dormant in this hen as long as her ovaria continued to act the
females of two kinds of deer when old have been known to acquire
horns and as hunter has remarked we see something of an analogous
nature in the human species
on the other hand with male animals it is notorious that the
secondary sexual characters are more or less completely lost when they
are subjected to castration thus if the operation be performed on a
young cock he never as yarrell states crows again the comb
wattles and spurs do not grow to their full size and the hackles
assume an intermediate appearance between true hackles and the feathers
of the hen cases are recorded of confinement which often affects the
reproductive system causing analogous results but characters properly
confined to the female are likewise acquired by the male the capon
takes to sitting on eggs and will bring up chickens and what is more
curious the utterly sterile male hybrids from the pheasant and the
fowl act in the same manner their delight being to watch when the
hens leave their nests and to take on themselves the office of a
sitter57 that admirable observer reaumur58 asserts that a cock
by being long confined in solitude and darkness can be taught to take
charge of young chickens he then utters a peculiar cry and retains
during his whole life this newly acquired maternal instinct the many
wellascertained cases of various male mammals giving milk shows that
their rudimentary mammary glands retain this capacity in a latent
condition
we thus see that in many probably in all cases the secondary
characters of each sex lie dormant or latent in the opposite sex ready
to be evolved under peculiar circumstances we can thus understand how
for instance it is possible for a good milking cow to transmit her
good qualities through her male offspring to future generations for we
may confidently believe that these qualities are present though
latent in the males of each generation so it is with the gamecock
who can transmit his superiority in courage and vigour through his
female to his male offspring and with man it is known59 that
diseases such as hydrocele necessarily confined to the male sex can
be transmitted through the female to the grandson such cases as these
offer as was remarked at the commencement of this chapter the
simplest possible examples of reversion and they are intelligible on
the belief that characters common to the grandparent and grandchild of
the same sex are present though latent in the intermediate parent of
the opposite sex
the subject of latent characters is so important as we shall see in a
future chapter that i will give another illustration many animals
have the right and left sides of their body unequally developed this
is well known to be the case with flatfish in which the one side
differs in thickness and colour and in the shape of the fins from the
other and during the growth of the young fish one eye is gradually
twisted from the lower to the upper surface60 in most flatfishes
the left is the blind side but in some it is the right though in both
cases reversed or wrong fishes are occasionally developed and in
platessa flesus the right or left side is indifferently the upper
one with gasteropods or shellfish the right and left sides are
extremely unlike the far greater number of species are dextral with
rare and occasional reversals of development and some few are normally
sinistral but certain species of bulimus and many achatinell61 are
as often sinistral as dextral i will give an analogous case in the
great articulate kingdom the two sides of verruca62 are so
wonderfully unlike that without careful dissection it is extremely
difficult to recognise the corresponding parts on the opposite sides of
the body yet it is apparently a mere matter of chance whether it be
the right or the left side that undergoes so singular amount of change
one plant is known to me63 in which the flower according as it
stands on the one or other side of the spike is unequally developed
in all the foregoing cases the two sides are perfectly symmetrical at
an early period of growth now whenever a species is as liable to be
unequally developed on the one as on the other side we may infer that
the capacity for such development is present though latent in the
undeveloped side and as a reversal of development occasionally occurs
in animals of many kinds this latent capacity is probably very common
the best yet simplest cases of characters lying dormant are perhaps
those previously given in which chickens and young pigeons raised
from a cross between differently coloured birds are at first of one
colour but in a year or two acquire feathers of the colour of the
other parent for in this case the tendency to a change of plumage is
clearly latent in the young bird so it is with hornless breeds of
cattle some of which acquire small horns as they grow old purely bred
black and white bantams and some other fowls occasionally assume
with advancing years the red feathers of the parentspecies i will
here add a somewhat different case as it connects in a striking manner
latent characters of two classes mr hewitt64 possessed an excellent
sebright goldlaced bantam hen which as she became old grew diseased
in her ovaria and assumed male characters in this breed the males
resemble the females in all respects except in their combs wattles
spurs and instincts hence it might have been expected that the
diseased hen would have assumed only those masculine characters which
are proper to the breed but she acquired in addition wellarched
tail sicklefeathers quite a foot in length saddlefeathers on the
loins and hackles on the neckornaments which as mr hewitt remarks
would be held as abominable in this breed the sebright bantam is
known65 to have originated about the year 1800 from a cross between a
common bantam and a polish fowl recrossed by a hentailed bantam and
carefully selected hence there can hardly be a doubt that the
sicklefeathers and hackles which appeared in the old hen were derived
from the polish fowl or common bantam and we thus see that not only
certain masculine characters proper to the sebright bantam but other
masculine characters derived from the first progenitors of the breed
removed by a period of above sixty years were lying latent in this
henbird ready to be evolved as soon as her ovaria became diseased
from these several facts it must be admitted that certain characters
capacities and instincts may lie latent in an individual and even in
a succession of individuals without our being able to detect the least
sign of their presence when fowls pigeons or cattle of different
colours are crossed and their offspring change colour as they grow
old or when the crossed turbit acquired the characteristic frill after
its third moult or when rarelybred bantams partially assume the red
plumage of their prototype we cannot doubt that these qualities were
from the first present though latent in the individual animal like
the characters of a moth in the caterpillar now if these animals had
produced offspring before they had acquired with advancing age their
new characters nothing is more probable than that they would have
transmitted them to some of their offspring who in this case would in
appearance have received such characters from their grandparents or
more distant progenitors we should then have had a case of reversion
that is of the reappearance in the child of an ancestral character
actually present though during youth completely latent in the parent
and this we may safely conclude is what occurs in all reversions to
progenitors however remote
this view of the latency in each generation of all the characters which
appear through reversion is also supported by their actual presence in
some cases during early youth alone or by their more frequent
appearance and greater distinctness at this age than during maturity
we have seen that this is often the case with the stripes on the legs
and faces of the several species of the horse genus the himalayan
rabbit when crossed sometimes produces offspring which revert to the
parent silvergrey breed and we have seen that in purely bred animals
palegrey fur occasionally reappears during early youth black cats we
may feel assured would occasionally produce by reversion tabbies and
on young black kittens with a pedigree66 known to have been long
pure faint traces of stripes may almost always be seen which
afterwards disappear hornless suffolk cattle occasionally produce by
reversion horned animals and youatt67 asserts that even in hornless
individuals the rudiment of a horn may be often felt at an early age
no doubt it appears at first sight in the highest degree improbable
that in every horse of every generation there should be a latent
capacity and tendency to produce stripes though these may not appear
once in a thousand generations that in every white black or other
coloured pigeon which may have transmitted its proper colour during
centuries there should be a latent capacity in the plumage to become
blue and to be marked with certain characteristic bars that in every
child in a sixfingered family there should be the capacity for the
production of an additional digit and so in other cases nevertheless
there is no more inherent improbability in this being the case than in
a useless and rudimentary organ or even in only a tendency to the
production of a rudimentary organ being inherited during millions of
generations as is well known to occur with a multitude of organic
beings there is no more inherent improbability in each domestic pig
during a thousand generations retaining the capacity and tendency to
develop great tusks under fitting conditions than in the young calf
having retained for an indefinite number of generations rudimentary
incisor teeth which never protrude through the gums
i shall give at the end of the next chapter a summary of the three
preceding chapters but as isolated and striking cases of reversion
have here been chiefly insisted on i wish to guard the reader against
supposing that reversion is due to some rare or accidental combination
of circumstances when a character lost during hundreds of
generations suddenly reappears no doubt some such combination must
occur but reversions to the immediately preceding generations may be
constantly observed at least in the offspring of most unions this
has been universally recognised in the case of hybrids and mongrels
but it has been recognised simply from the difference between the
united forms rendering the resemblance of the offspring to their
grandparents or more remote progenitors of easy detection reversion is
likewise almost invariably the rule as mr sedgwick has shown with
certain diseases hence we must conclude that a tendency to this
peculiar form of transmission is an integral part of the general law of
inheritance
monstrositiesa large number of monstrous growths and of lesser
anomalies are admitted by every one to be due to an arrest of
development that is to the persistence of an embryonic condition but
many monstrosities cannot be thus explained for parts of which no
trace can be detected in the embryo but which occur in other members
of the same class of animals occasionally appear and these may
probably with truth be attributed to reversion as however i have
treated this subject as fully as i could in my descent of man ch 1
2nd edition i will not here recur to it
when flowers which have normally an irregular structure become regular
or peloric the change is generally looked at by botanists as a return
to the primitive state but dr maxwell masters68 who has ably
discussed this subject remarks that when for instance all the sepals
of a tropolum become green and of the same shape instead of being
coloured with one prolonged into a spur or when all the petals of a
linaria become simple and regular such cases may be due merely to an
arrest of development for in these flowers all the organs during their
earliest condition are symmetrical and if arrested at this stage of
growth they would not become irregular if moreover the arrest were
to take place at a still earlier period of development the result
would be a simple tuft of green leaves and no one probably would call
this a case of reversion dr masters designates the cases first
alluded to as regular peloria and others in which all the
corresponding parts assume a similar form of irregularity as when all
the petals in a linaria become spurred as irregular peloria we have
no right to attribute these latter cases to reversion until it can be
shown that the parentform for instance of the genus linaria had had
all its petals spurred for a chance of this nature might result from
the spreading of an anomalous structure in accordance with the law to
be discussed in a future chapter of homologous parts tending to vary
in the same manner but as both forms of peloria frequently occur on
the same individual plant of the linaria69 they probably stand in
some close relation to one another on the doctrine that peloria is
simply the result of an arrest of development it is difficult to
understand how an organ arrested at a very early period of growth
should acquire its full functional perfectionhow a petal supposed to
be thus arrested should acquire its brilliant colours and serve as an
envelope to the flower or a stamen produce efficient pollen yet this
occurs with many peloric flowers that pelorism is not due to mere
chance variability but either to an arrest of development or to
reversion we may infer from an observation made by ch morren70
namely that families which have irregular flowers often return by
these monstrous growths to their regular form whilst we never see a
regular flower realise the structure of an irregular one
some flowers have almost certainly become more or less completely
peloric through reversion as the following interesting case shows
corydalis tuberosa properly has one of its two nectaries colourless
destitute of nectar only half the size of the other and therefore to
a certain extent in a rudimentary state the pistil is curved towards
the perfect nectary and the hood formed of the inner petals slips
off the pistil and stamen in one direction alone so that when a bee
sucks the perfect nectary the stigma and stamens are exposed and
rubbed against the insects body in several closely allied genera as
in dielytra etc there are two perfect nectaries the pistil is
straight and the hood slips off on either side according as the bee
sucks either nectary now i have examined several flowers of
corydalis tuberosa in which both nectaries were equally developed
and contained nectar in this we see only the redevelopment of a
partially aborted organ but with this redevelopment the pistil becomes
straight and the hood slips off in either direction so that these
flowers have acquired the perfect structure so well adapted for insect
agency of dielytra and its allies we cannot attribute these coadapted
modifications to chance or to correlated variability we must
attribute them to reversion to a primordial condition of the species
the peloric flowers of pelargonium have their five petals in all
respects alike and there is no nectary so that they resemble the
symmetrical flowers of the closely allied genus geranium but the
alternate stamens are also sometimes destitute of anthers the
shortened filaments being left as rudiments and in this respect they
resemble the symmetrical flowers of the closely allied genus erodium
hence we may look at the peloric flowers of pelargonium as having
reverted to the state of some primordial form the progenitor of the
three closely related genera of pelargonium geranium and erodium
in the peloric form of antirrhinum majus appropriately called the
wonder the tubular and elongated flowers differ wonderfully from
those of the common snapdragon the calyx and the mouth of the corolla
consist of six equal lobes and include six equal instead of four
unequal stamens one of the two additional stamens is manifestly formed
by the development of a microscopically minute papilla which may be
found at the base of the upper lip of the flower of the common
snapdragons in the nineteen plants examined by me that this papilla is
a rudiment of a stamen was well shown by its various degrees of
development in crossed plants between the common and the peloric
antirrhinum again a peloric galeobdolon luteum growing in my
garden had five equal petals all striped like the ordinary lower lip
and included five equal instead of four unequal stamens but mr r
keeley who sent me this plant informs me that the flowers vary
greatly having from four to six lobes to the corolla and from three
to six stamens71 now as the members of the two great families to
which the antirrhinum and galeobdolon belong are properly pentamerous
with some of the parts confluent and others suppressed we ought not to
look at the sixth stamen and the sixth lobe to the corolla in either
case as due to reversion any more than the additional petals in double
flowers in these same two families but the case is different with the
fifth stamen in the peloric antirrhinum which is produced by the
redevelopment of a rudiment always present and which probably reveals
to us the state of the flower as far as the stamens are concerned at
some ancient epoch it is also difficult to believe that the other four
stamens and the petals after an arrest of development at a very early
embryonic age would have come to full perfection in colour structure
and function unless these organs had at some former period normally
passed through a similar course of growth hence it appears to me
probable that the progenitor of the genus antirrhinum must at some
remote epoch have included five stamens and borne flowers in some
degree resembling those now produced by the peloric form the
conclusion that peloria is not a mere monstrosity irrespective of any
former state of the species is supported by the fact that this
structure is often strongly inherited as in the case of the peloric
antirrhinum and gloxinia and sometimes in that of the peloric
corydalis solida72
lastly i may add that many instances have been recorded of flowers not
generally considered as peloric in which certain organs are abnormally
augmented in number as an increase of parts cannot be looked at as an
arrest of development nor as due to the redevelopment of rudiments
for no rudiments are present and as these additional parts bring the
plant into closer relationship with its natural allies they ought
probably to be viewed as reversions to a primordial condition
these several facts show us in an interesting manner how intimately
certain abnormal states are connected together namely arrests of
development causing parts to become rudimentary or to be wholly
suppressedthe redevelopment of parts now in a more or less
rudimentary conditionthe reappearance of organs of which not a
vestige can be detectedand to these may be added in the case of
animals the presence during youth and subsequent disappearance of
certain characters which occasionally are retained throughout life
some naturalists look at all such abnormal structures as a return to
the ideal state of the group to which the affected being belongs but
it is difficult to conceive what is meant to be conveyed by this
expression other naturalists maintain with greater probability and
distinctness of view that the common bond of connection between the
several foregoing cases is an actual though partial return to the
structure of the ancient progenitor of the group if this view be
correct we must believe that a vast number of characters capable of
evolution lie hidden in every organic being but it would be a mistake
to suppose that the number is equally great in all beings we know for
instance that plants of many orders occasionally become peloric but
many more cases have been observed in the labiat and scrophulariace
than in any other order and in one genus of the scrophulariace
namely linaria no less than thirteen species have been described in
this condition73 on this view of the nature of peloric flowers and
bearing in mind certain monstrosities in the animal kingdom we must
conclude that the progenitors of most plants and animals have left an
impression capable of redevelopment on the germs of their
descendants although these have since been profoundly modified
the fertilised germ of one of the higher animals subjected as it is to
so vast a series of changes from the germinal cell to old
ageincessantly agitated by what quatrefages well calls the
tourbillon vitalis perhaps the most wonderful object in nature it
is probable that hardly a change of any kind affects either parent
without some mark being left on the germ but on the doctrine of
reversion as given in this chapter the germ becomes a far more
marvellous object for besides the visible changes which it undergoes
we must believe that it is crowded with invisible characters proper to
both sexes to both the right and left side of the body and to a long
line of male and female ancestors separated by hundreds or even
thousands of generations from the present time and these characters
like those written on paper with invisible ink lie ready to be evolved
whenever the organisation is disturbed by certain known or unknown
conditions

diseases sometimes supervening earlier in the child than in the
parentsummary of the three preceding chapters
in the last two chapters the nature and force of inheritance the
circumstances which interfere with its power and the tendency to
reversion with its many remarkable contingencies were discussed in
the present chapter some other related phenomena will be treated of as
fully as my materials permit
      fixedness of character
it is a general belief amongst breeders that the longer any character
has been transmitted by a breed the more fully it will continue to be
transmitted i do not wish to dispute the truth of the proposition that
inheritance gains strength simply through long continuance but i doubt
whether it can be proved in one sense the proposition is little better
than a truism if any character has remained constant during many
generations it will be likely to continue so if the conditions of
life remain the same so again in improving a breed if care be taken
for a length of time to exclude all inferior individuals the breed
will obviously tend to become truer as it will not have been crossed
during many generations by an inferior animal we have previously seen
but without being able to assign any cause that when a new character
appears it is occasionally from the first constant or fluctuates
much or wholly fails to be transmitted so it is with the aggregate of
slight differences which characterise a new variety for some propagate
their kind from the first much truer than others even with plants
multiplied by bulbs layers etc which may in one sense be said to
form parts of the same individual it is well known that certain
varieties retain and transmit through successive budgenerations their
newlyacquired characters more truly than others in none of these nor
in the following cases does there appear to be any relation between
the force with which a character is transmitted and the length of time
during which it has been transmitted some varieties such as white and
yellow hyacinths and white sweetpeas transmit their colours more
faithfully than do the varieties which have retained their natural
colour in the irish family mentioned in the twelfth chapter the
peculiar tortoiseshelllike colouring of the eyes was transmitted far
more faithfully than any ordinary colour ancon and mauchamp sheep and
niata cattle which are all comparatively modern breeds exhibit
remarkably strong powers of inheritance many similar cases could be
adduced
as all domesticated animals and cultivated plants have varied and yet
are descended from aboriginally wild forms which no doubt had retained
the same character from an immensely remote epoch we see that scarcely
any degree of antiquity ensures a character being transmitted perfectly
true in this case however it may be said that changed conditions of
life induce certain modifications and not that the power of
inheritance fails but in every case of failure some cause either
internal or external must interfere it will generally be found that
the organs or parts which in our domesticated productions have varied
or which still continue to varythat is which fail to retain their
former stateare the same with the parts which differ in the natural
species of the same genus as on the theory of descent with
modification the species of the same genus have been modified since
they branched off from a common progenitor it follows that the
characters by which they differ from one another have varied whilst
other parts of the organisation have remained unchanged and it might
be argued that these same characters now vary under domestication or
fail to be inherited from their lesser antiquity but variation in a
state of nature seems to stand in some close relation with changed
conditions of life and characters which have already varied under such
conditions would be apt to vary under the still greater changes
consequent on domestication independently of their greater or less
antiquity
fixedness of character or the strength of inheritance has often been
judged of by the preponderance of certain characters in the crossed
offspring between distinct races but prepotency of transmission here
comes into play and this as we shall immediately see is a very
different consideration from the strength or weakness of
inheritance1 it has often been observed that breeds of animals
inhabiting wild and mountainous countries cannot be permanently
modified by our improved breeds and as these latter are of modern
origin it has been thought that the greater antiquity of the wilder
breeds has been the cause of their resistance to improvement by
crossing but it is more probably due to their structure and
constitution being better adapted to the surrounding conditions when
plants are first subjected to culture it has been found that during
several generations they transmit their characters truly that is do
not vary and this has been attributed to ancient characters being
strongly inherited but it may with equal or greater probability be
consequent on changed conditions of life requiring a long time for
their cumulative action notwithstanding these considerations it would
perhaps be rash to deny that characters become more strongly fixed the
longer they are transmitted but i believe that the proposition
resolves itself into thisthat characters of all kinds whether new or
old tend to be inherited and that those which have already withstood
all counteracting influences and been truly transmitted will as a
general rule continue to withstand them and consequently be
faithfully inherited
prepotency in the transmission of character
when individuals belonging to the same family but distinct enough to
be recognised or when two wellmarked races or two species are
crossed the usual result as stated in the previous chapter is that
the offspring in the first generation are intermediate between their
parents or resemble one parent in one part and the other parent in
another part but this is by no means the invariable rule for in many
cases it is found that certain individuals races and species are
prepotent in transmitting their likeness this subject has been ably
discussed by prosper lucas2 but is rendered extremely complex by the
prepotency sometimes running equally in both sexes and sometimes more
strongly in one sex than in the other it is likewise complicated by
the presence of secondary sexual characters which render the
comparison of crossed breeds with their parents difficult
it would appear that in certain families some one ancestor and after
him others in the same family have had great power in transmitting
their likeness through the male line for we cannot otherwise
understand how the same features should so often be transmitted after
marriages with many females as in the case of the austrian emperors
and so it was according to niebuhr with the mental qualities of
certain roman families3 the famous bull favourite is believed4 to
have had a prepotent influence on the shorthorn race it has also been
observed5 with english racehorses that certain mares have generally
transmitted their own character whilst other mares of equally pure
blood have allowed the character of the sire to prevail a famous black
greyhound bedlamite as i hear from mr c m brown invariably got
all his puppies black no matter what was the colour of the bitch but
then bedlamite had a preponderance of black in his blood both on the
sire and dam side
the truth of the principle of prepotency comes out more clearly when
distinct races are crossed the improved shorthorns notwithstanding
that the breed is comparatively modern are generally acknowledged to
possess great power in impressing their likeness on all other breeds
and it is chiefly in consequence of this power that they are so highly
valued for exportation6 godine has given a curious case of a ram of
a goatlike breed of sheep from the cape of good hope which produced
offspring hardly to be distinguished from himself when crossed with
ewes of twelve other breeds but two of these halfbred ewes when put
to a merino ram produced lambs closely resembling the merino breed
girou de buzareingues7 found that of two races of french sheep the
ewes of one when crossed during successive generations with merino
rams yielded up their character far sooner than the ewes of the other
race sturm and girou have given analogous cases with other breeds of
sheep and with cattle the prepotency running in these cases through
the male side but i was assured on good authority in south america
that when niata cattle are crossed with common cattle though the niata
breed is prepotent whether males or females are used yet that the
prepotency is strongest through the female line the manx cat is
tailless and has long hind legs dr wilson crossed a male manx with
common cats and out of twentythree kittens seventeen were destitute
of tails but when the female manx was crossed by common male cats all
the kittens had tails though they were generally short and
imperfect8
in making reciprocal crosses between pouter and fantail pigeons the
pouterrace seemed to be prepotent through both sexes over the fantail
but this is probably due to weak power in the fantail rather than to
any unusually strong power in the pouter for i have observed that
barbs also preponderate over fantails this weakness of transmission in
the fantail though the breed is an ancient one is said9 to be
general but i have observed one exception to the rule namely in a
cross between a fantail and laugher the most curious instance known to
me of weak power in both sexes is in the trumpeter pigeon this breed
has been well known for at least 130 years it breeds perfectly true
as i have been assured by those who have long kept many birds it is
characterised by a peculiar tuft of feathers over the beak by a crest
on the head by a singular coo quite unlike that of any other breed
and by muchfeathered feet i have crossed both sexes with turbits of
two subbreeds with almond tumblers spots and runts and reared many
mongrels and recrossed them and though the crest on the head and
feathered feet were inherited as is generally the case with most
breeds i have never seen a vestige of the tuft over the beak or heard
the peculiar coo boitard and corbi10 assert that this is the
invariable result of crossing trumpeters with other breeds
neumeister11 however states that in germany mongrels have been
obtained though very rarely which were furnished with the tuft and
would trumpet but a pair of these mongrels with a tuft which i
imported never trumpeted mr brent states12 that the crossed
offspring of a trumpeter were crossed with trumpeters for three
generations by which time the mongrels had 78ths of this blood in
their veins yet the tuft over the beak did not appear at the fourth
generation the tuft appeared but the birds though now having 1516ths
trumpeters blood still did not trumpet this case well shows the wide
difference between inheritance and prepotency for here we have a
wellestablished old race which transmits its characters faithfully
but which when crossed with any other race has the feeblest power of
transmitting its two chief characteristic qualities
i will give one other instance with fowls and pigeons of weakness and
strength in the transmission of the same character to their crossed
offspring the silk fowl breeds true and there is reason to believe is
a very ancient race but when i reared a large number of mongrels from
a silk hen by a spanish cock not one exhibited even a trace of the
socalled silkiness mr hewitt also asserts that in no instance are
the silky feathers transmitted by this breed when crossed with any
other variety but three birds out of many raised by mr orton from a
cross between a silk cock and a bantam hen had silky feathers13 so
that it is certain that this breed very seldom has the power of
transmitting its peculiar plumage to its crossed progeny on the other
hand there is a silk subvariety of the fantail pigeon which has its
feathers in nearly the same state as in the silk fowl now we have
already seen that fantails when crossed possess singularly weak power
in transmitting their general qualities but the silk subvariety when
crossed with any other smallsized race invariably transmits its silky
feathers14
the wellknown horticulturist mr paul informs me that he fertilised
the black prince hollyhock with pollen of the white globe and the
lemonade and black prince hollyhocks reciprocally but not one seedling
from these three crosses inherited the black colour of the black
prince so again mr laxton who has had such great experience in
crossing peas writes to me that whenever a cross has been effected
between a whiteblossomed and a purpleblossomed pea or between a
whiteseeded and a purplespotted brown or mapleseeded pea the
offspring seems to lose nearly all the characteristics of the
whiteflowered and whiteseeded varieties and this result follows
whether these varieties have been used as the pollenbearing or
seedproducing parents
the law of prepotency comes into action when species are crossed as
with races and individuals grtner has unequivocally shown15 that
this is the case with plants to give one instance when nicotiana
paniculata and  vincflora are crossed the character of n
paniculata is almost completely lost in the hybrid but if  n
quadrivalvis be crossed with n vincflora this latter species
which was before so prepotent now in its turn almost disappears under
the power of n quadrivalvis it is remarkable that the prepotency of
one species over another in transmission is quite independent as shown
by grtner of the greater or less facility with which the one
fertilises the other
with animals the jackal is prepotent over the dog as is stated by
flourens who made many crosses between these animals and this was
likewise the case with a hybrid which i once saw between a jackal and a
terrier i cannot doubt from the observations of colin and others
that the ass is prepotent over the horse the prepotency in this
instance running more strongly through the male than through the female
ass so that the mule resembles the ass more closely than does the
hinny16 the male pheasant judging from mr hewitts
descriptions17 and from the hybrids which i have seen preponderates
over the domestic fowl but the latter as far as colour is concerned
has considerable power of transmission for hybrids raised from five
differently coloured hens differed greatly in plumage i formerly
examined some curious hybrids in the zoological gardens between the
penguin variety of the common duck and the egyptian goose anser
gyptiacus and although i will not assert that the domesticated
variety preponderated over the natural species yet it had strongly
impressed its unnatural upright figure on these hybrids
i am aware that such cases as the foregoing have been ascribed by
various authors not to one species race or individual being
prepotent over the other in impressing its character on its crossed
offspring but to such rules as that the father influences the external
characters and the mother the internal or vital organs but the great
diversity of the rules given by various authors almost proves their
falseness dr prosper lucas has fully discussed this point and has
shown18 that none of the rules and i could add others to those
quoted by him apply to all animals similar rules have been announced
for plants and have been proved by grtner19 to be all erroneous if
we confine our view to the domesticated races of a single species or
perhaps even to the species of the same genus some such rules may hold
good for instance it seems that in reciprocally crossing various
breeds of fowls the male generally gives colour20 but conspicuous
exceptions have passed under my own eyes it seems that the ram usually
gives its peculiar horns and fleece to its crossed offspring and the
bull the presence or absence of horns
in the following chapter on crossing i shall have occasion to show that
certain characters are rarely or never blended by crossing but are
transmitted in an unmodified state from either parentform i refer to
this fact here because it is sometimes accompanied on the one side by
prepotency which thus acquires the false appearance of unusual
strength in the same chapter i shall show that the rate at which a
species or breed absorbs and obliterates another by repeated crosses
depends in chief part on prepotency in transmission
in conclusion some of the cases above givenfor instance that of the
trumpeter pigeonprove that there is a wide difference between mere
inheritance and prepotency this latter power seems to us in our
ignorance to act in most cases quite capriciously the very same
character even though it be an abnormal or monstrous one such as
silky feathers may be transmitted by different species when crossed
either with prepotent force or singular feebleness it is obvious that
a purelybred form of either sex in all cases in which prepotency does
not run more strongly in one sex than the other will transmit its
character with prepotent force over a mongrelised and already variable
form21 from several of the abovegiven cases we may conclude that
mere antiquity of character does not by any means necessarily make it
prepotent in some cases prepotency apparently depends on the same
character being present and visible in one of the two breeds which are
crossed and latent or invisible in the other breed and in this case
it is natural that the character which is potentially present in both
breeds should be prepotent thus we have reason to believe that there
is a latent tendency in all horses to be duncoloured and striped and
when a horse of this kind is crossed with one of any other colour it
is said that the offspring are almost sure to be striped sheep have a
similar latent tendency to become darkcoloured and we have seen with
what prepotent force a ram with a few black spots when crossed with
white sheep of various breeds coloured its offspring all pigeons have
a latent tendency to become slatyblue with certain characteristic
marks and it is known that when a bird thus coloured is crossed with
one of any other colour it is most difficult afterwards to eradicate
the blue tint a nearly parallel case is offered by those black bantams
which as they grow old develop a latent tendency to acquire red
feathers but there are exceptions to the rule hornless breeds of
cattle possess a latent capacity to reproduce horns yet when crossed
with horned breeds they do not invariably produce offspring bearing
horns
we meet with analogous cases with plants striped flowers though they
can be propagated truly by seed have a latent tendency to become
uniformly coloured but when once crossed by a uniformly coloured
variety they ever afterwards fail to produce striped seedlings22
another case is in some respects more curious plants bearing peloric
flowers have so strong a latent tendency to reproduce their normally
irregular flowers that this often occurs by buds when a plant is
transplanted into poorer or richer soil23 now i crossed the peloric
snapdragon antirrhinum majus described in the last chapter with
pollen of the common form and the latter reciprocally with peloric
pollen i thus raised two great beds of seedlings and not one was
peloric naudin24 obtained the same result from crossing a peloric
linaria with the common form i carefully examined the flowers of
ninety plants of the crossed antirrhinum in the two beds and their
structure had not been in the least affected by the cross except that
in a few instances the minute rudiment of the fifth stamen which is
always present was more fully or even completely developed it must
not be supposed that this entire obliteration of the peloric structure
in the crossed plants can be accounted for by any incapacity of
transmission for i raised a large bed of plants from the peloric
antirrhinum artificially fertilised by its own pollen and sixteen
plants which alone survived the winter were all as perfectly peloric
as the parentplant here we have a good instance of the wide
difference between the inheritance of a character and the power of
transmitting it to crossed offspring the crossed plants which
perfectly resembled the common snapdragon were allowed to sow
themselves and out of a hundred and twentyseven seedlings
eightyeight proved to be common snapdragons two were in an
intermediate condition between the peloric and normal state and
thirtyseven were perfectly peloric having reverted to the structure
of their one grandparent this case seems at first sight to offer an
exception to the rule just given namely that a character which is
present in one form and latent in the other is generally transmitted
with prepotent force when the two forms are crossed for in all the
scrophulariace and especially in the genera antirrhinum and linaria
there is as was shown in the last chapter a strong latent tendency to
become peloric but there is also as we have seen a still stronger
tendency in all peloric plants to reacquire their normal irregular
structure so that we have two opposed latent tendencies in the same
plants now with the crossed antirrhinums the tendency to produce
normal or irregular flowers like those of the common snapdragon
prevailed in the first generation whilst the tendency to pelorism
appearing to gain strength by the intermission of a generation
prevailed to a large extent in the second set of seedlings how it is
possible for a character to gain strength by the intermission of a
generation will be considered in the chapter on pangenesis
on the whole the subject of prepotency is extremely intricatefrom
its varying so much in strength even in regard to the same character
in different animalsfrom its running either equally in both sexes
or as frequently is the case with animals but not with plants much
stronger in one sex than the otherfrom the existence of secondary
sexual charactersfrom the transmission of certain characters being
limited as we shall immediately see by sexfrom certain characters
not blending togetherand perhaps occasionally from the effects of a
previous fertilisation on the mother it is therefore not surprising
that no one has hitherto succeeded in drawing up general rules on the
subject of prepotency
      inheritance as limited by sex
new characters often appear in one sex and are afterwards transmitted
to the same sex either exclusively or in a much greater degree than to
the other this subject is important because with animals of many
kinds in a state of nature both high and low in the scale secondary
sexual characters not directly connected with the organs of
reproduction are conspicuously present with our domesticated animals
characters of this kind often differ widely from those distinguishing
the two sexes of the parent species and the principle of inheritance
as limited by sex explains how this is possible
dr p lucas has shown25 that when a peculiarity in no manner
connected with the reproductive organs appears in either parent it is
often transmitted exclusively to the offspring of the same sex or to a
much greater number of them than of the opposite sex thus in the
family of lambert the hornlike projections on the skin were
transmitted from the father to his sons and grandsons alone so it has
been with other cases of ichthyosis with supernumerary digits with a
deficiency of digits and phalanges and in a lesser degree with various
diseases especially with colourblindness and the hmorrhagic
diathesis that is an extreme liability to profuse and uncontrollable
bleeding from trifling wounds on the other hand mothers have
transmitted during several generations to their daughters alone
supernumerary and deficient digits colourblindness and other
peculiarities so that the very same peculiarity may become attached to
either sex and be long inherited by that sex alone but the attachment
in certain cases is much more frequent to one than the other sex the
same peculiarities also may be promiscuously transmitted to either sex
dr lucas gives other cases showing that the male occasionally
transmits his peculiarities to his daughters alone and the mother to
her sons alone but even in this case we see that inheritance is to a
certain extent though inversely regulated by sex dr lucas after
weighing the whole evidence comes to the conclusion that every
peculiarity tends to be transmitted in a greater or lesser degree to
that sex in which it first appears but a more definite rule as i have
elsewhere shown26 generally holds good namely that variations which
first appear in either sex at a late period of life when the
reproductive functions are active tend to be developed in that sex
alone whilst variations which first appear early in life in either sex
are commonly transmitted to both sexes i am however far from
supposing that this is the sole determining cause
a few details from the many cases collected by mr sedgwick27 may be
here given colourblindness from some unknown cause shows itself
much oftener in males than in females in upwards of two hundred cases
collected by mr sedgwick ninetenths related to men but it is
eminently liable to be transmitted through women in the case given by
dr earle members of eight related families were affected during five
generations these families consisted of sixtyone individuals namely
of thirtytwo males of whom ninesixteenths were incapable of
distinguishing colour and of twentynine females of whom only
onefifteenth were thus affected although colourblindness thus
generally clings to the male sex nevertheless in one instance in
which it first appeared in a female it was transmitted during five
generations to thirteen individuals all of whom were females the
hmorrhagic diathesis often accompanied by rheumatism has been known
to affect the males alone during five generations being transmitted
however through the females it is said that deficient phalanges in
the fingers have been inherited by the females alone during ten
generations in another case a man thus deficient in both hands and
feet transmitted the peculiarity to his two sons and one daughter but
in the third generationout of nineteen grandchildren twelve sons had
the family defect whilst the seven daughters were free in ordinary
cases of sexual limitation the sons or daughters inherit the
peculiarity whatever it may be from their father or mother and
transmit it to their children of the same sex but generally with the
hmorrhagic diathesis and often with colourblindness and in some
other cases the sons never inherit the peculiarity directly from their
fathers but the daughters alone transmit the latent tendency so that
the sons of the daughters alone exhibit it thus the father grandson
and greatgreatgrandson will exhibit a peculiaritythe grandmother
daughter and greatgranddaughter having transmitted it in a latent
state hence we have as mr sedgwick remarks a double kind of atavism
or reversion each grandson apparently receiving and developing the
peculiarity from his grandfather and each daughter apparently
receiving the latent tendency from her grandmother
from the various facts recorded by dr prosper lucas mr sedgwick and
others there can be no doubt that peculiarities first appearing in
either sex though not in any way necessarily or invariably connected
with that sex strongly tend to be inherited by the offspring of the
same sex but are often transmitted in a latent state through the
opposite sex
turning now to domesticated animals we find that certain characters
not proper to the parent species are often confined to and inherited
by one sex alone but we do not know the history of the first
appearance of such characters in the chapter on sheep we have seen
that the males of certain races differ greatly from the females in the
shape of their horns these being absent in the ewes of some breeds
they differ also in the development of fat in the tail and in the
outline of the forehead these differences judging from the character
of the allied wild species cannot be accounted for by supposing that
they have been derived from distinct parent forms there is also a
great difference between the horns of the two sexes in one indian breed
of goats the bull zebu is said to have a larger hump than the cow in
the scotch deerhound the two sexes differ in size more than in any
other variety of the dog28 and judging from analogy more than in
the aboriginal parentspecies the peculiar colour called
tortoiseshell is very rarely seen in a male cat the males of this
variety being of a rusty tint
in various breeds of the fowl the males and females often differ
greatly and these differences are far from being the same with those
which distinguish the two sexes of the parentspecies the gallus
bankiva and consequently have originated under domestication in
certain subvarieties of the game race we have the unusual case of the
hens differing from each other more than the cocks in an indian breed
of a white colour shaded with black the hens invariably have black
skins and their bones are covered by a black periosteum whilst the
cocks are never or most rarely thus characterised pigeons offer a more
interesting case for throughout the whole great family the two sexes
do not often differ much and the males and females of the parentform
the c livia are undistinguishable yet we have seen that with
pouters the male has the characteristic quality of pouting more
strongly developed than the female and in certain subvarieties the
males alone are spotted or striated with black or otherwise differ in
colour when male and female english carrierpigeons are exhibited in
separate pens the difference in the development of the wattle over the
beak and round the eyes is conspicuous so that here we have instances
of the appearance of secondary sexual characters in the domesticated
races of a species in which such differences are naturally quite
absent
on the other hand secondary sexual characters which belong to the
species in a state of nature are sometimes quite lost or greatly
diminished under domestication we see this in the small size of the
tusks in our improved breeds of the pig in comparison with those of
the wild boar there are subbreeds of fowls in which the males have
lost the fineflowing tailfeathers and hackles and others in which
there is no difference in colour between the two sexes in some cases
the barred plumage which in gallinaceous birds is commonly the
attribute of the hen has been transferred to the cock as in the
cuckoo subbreeds in other cases masculine characters have been partly
transferred to the female as with the splendid plumage of the
goldenspangled hamburgh hen the enlarged comb of the spanish hen the
pugnacious disposition of the game hen and as in the welldeveloped
spurs which occasionally appear in the hens of various breeds in
polish fowls both sexes are ornamented with a topknot that of the male
being formed of hacklelike feathers and this is a new male character
in the genus gallus on the whole as far as i can judge new
characters are more apt to appear in the males of our domesticated
animals than in the females29 and afterwards to be inherited
exclusively or more strongly by the males finally in accordance with
the principle of inheritance as limited by sex the preservation and
augmentation of secondary sexual characters in natural species offers
no especial difficulty as this would follow through that form of
selection which i have called sexual selection
      inheritance at corresponding periods of life
this is an important subject since the publication of my origin of
species i have seen no reason to doubt the truth of the explanation
there given of one of the most remarkable facts in biology namely the
difference between the embryo and the adult animal the explanation is
that variations do not necessarily or generally occur at a very early
period of embryonic growth and that such variations are inherited at a
corresponding age as a consequence of this the embryo even after the
parentform has undergone great modification is left only slightly
modified and the embryos of widelydifferent animals which are
descended from a common progenitor remain in many important respects
like one another and probably like their common progenitor we can thus
understand why embryology throws a flood of light on the natural system
of classification as this ought to be as far as possible genealogical
when the embryo leads an independent life that is becomes a larva it
has to be adapted to the surrounding conditions in its structure and
instincts independently of those of its parents and the principle of
inheritance at corresponding periods of life renders this possible
this principle is indeed in one way so obvious that it escapes
attention we possess a number of races of animals and plants which
when compared with one another and with their parentforms present
conspicuous differences both in their immature and mature states look
at the seeds of the several kinds of peas beans maize which can be
propagated truly and see how they differ in size colour and shape
whilst the fullgrown plants differ but little cabbages on the other
hand differ greatly in foliage and manner of growth but hardly at all
in their seeds and generally it will be found that the differences
between cultivated plants at different periods of growth are not
necessarily closely connected together for plants may differ much in
their seeds and little when fullgrown and conversely may yield seeds
hardly distinguishable yet differ much when fullgrown in the several
breeds of poultry descended from a single species differences in the
eggs and chickens whilst covered with down in the plumage at the first
and subsequent moults as well as in the comb and wattles are all
inherited with man peculiarities in the milk and second teeth of
which i have received the details are inheritable and longevity is
often transmitted so again with our improved breeds of cattle and
sheep early maturity including the early development of the teeth
and with certain breeds of fowl the early appearance of secondary
sexual characters all come under the same head of inheritance at
corresponding periods
numerous analogous facts could be given the silkmoth perhaps offers
the best instance for in the breeds which transmit their characters
truly the eggs differ in size colour and shape the caterpillars
differ in moulting three or four times in colour even in having a
darkcoloured mark like an eyebrow and in the loss of certain
instinctsthe cocoons differ in size shape and in the colour and
quality of the silk these several differences being followed by slight
or barely distinguishable differences in the mature moth
but it may be said that if in the above cases a new peculiarity is
inherited it must be at the corresponding stage of development for an
egg or seed can resemble only an egg or seed and the horn in a
fullgrown ox can resemble only a horn the following cases show
inheritance at corresponding periods more plainly because they refer
to peculiarities which might have supervened as far as we can see
earlier or later in life yet are inherited at the same period at which
they first appeared
in the lambert family the porcupinelike excrescences appeared in the
father and sons at the same age namely about nine weeks after
birth30 in the extraordinary hairy family described by mr
crawfurd31 children were produced during three generations with
hairy ears in the father the hair began to grow over his body at six
years old in his daughter somewhat earlier namely at one year and
in both generations the milk teeth appeared late in life the permanent
teeth being afterwards singularly deficient greyness of hair at an
unusually early age has been transmitted in some families these cases
border on diseases inherited at corresponding periods of life to which
i shall immediately refer
it is a wellknown peculiarity with almondtumbler pigeons that the
full beauty and peculiar character of the plumage does not appear until
the bird has moulted two or three times neumeister describes and
figures a brace of pigeons in which the whole body is white except the
breast neck and head but in their first plumage all the white
feathers have coloured edges another breed is more remarkable its
first plumage is black with rustyred wingbars and a crescentshaped
mark on the breast these marks then become white and remain so during
three or four moults but after this period the white spreads over the
body and the bird loses its beauty32 prize canarybirds have their
wings and tail black this colour however is only retained until the
first moult so that they must be exhibited ere the change takes place
once moulted the peculiarity has ceased of course all the birds
emanating from this stock have black wings and tails the first
year33 a curious and somewhat analogous account has been given34
of a family of wild pied rooks which were first observed in 1798 near
chalfont and which every year from that date up to the period of the
published notice viz 1837 have several of their brood
particoloured black and white this variegation of the plumage
however disappears with the first moult but among the next young
families there are always a few pied ones these changes of plumage
which are inherited at various corresponding periods of life in the
pigeon canarybird and rook are remarkable because the
parentspecies passes through no such change
inherited diseases afford evidence in some respects of less value than
the foregoing cases because diseases are not necessarily connected
with any change in structure but in other respects of more value
because the periods have been more carefully observed certain diseases
are communicated to the child apparently by a process like inoculation
and the child is from the first affected such cases may be here passed
over large classes of diseases usually appear at certain ages such as
st vituss dance in youth consumption in early midlife gout later
and apoplexy still later and these are naturally inherited at the same
period but even in diseases of this class instances have been
recorded as with st vituss dance showing that an unusually early or
late tendency to the disease is inheritable35 in most cases the
appearance of any inherited disease is largely determined by certain
critical periods in each persons life as well as by unfavourable
conditions there are many other diseases which are not attached to
any particular period but which certainly tend to appear in the child
at about the same age at which the parent was first attacked an array
of high authorities ancient and modern could be given in support of
this proposition the illustrious hunter believed in it and piorry36
cautions the physician to look closely to the child at the period when
any grave inheritable disease attacked the parent dr prosper
lucas37 after collecting facts from every source asserts that
affections of all kinds though not related to any particular period of
life tend to reappear in the offspring at whatever period of life they
first appeared in the progenitor
as the subject is important it may be well to give a few instances
simply as illustrations not as proof for proof recourse must be had
to the authorities above quoted some of the following cases have been
selected for the sake of showing that when a slight departure from the
rule occurs the child is affected somewhat earlier in life than the
parent in the family of le compte blindness was inherited through
three generations and no less than twentyseven children and
grandchildren were all affected at about the same age their blindness
in general began to advance about the fifteenth or sixteenth year and
ended in total deprivation of sight at the age of about twentytwo38
in another case a father and his four children all became blind at
twentyone years old in another a grandmother grew blind at
thirtyfive her daughter at nineteen and three grandchildren at the
ages of thirteen and eleven39 so with deafness two brothers their
father and paternal grandfather all became deaf at the age of
forty40
esquirol gives several striking instances of insanity coming on at the
same age as that of a grandfather father and son who all committed
suicide near their fiftieth year many other cases could be given as
of a whole family who became insane at the age of forty41 other
cerebral affections sometimes follow the same rulefor instance
epilepsy and apoplexy a woman died of the latter disease when
sixtythree years old one of her daughters at fortythree and the
other at sixtyseven the latter had twelve children who all died from
tubercular meningitis42 i mention this latter case because it
illustrates a frequent occurrence namely a change in the precise
nature of an inherited disease though still affecting the same organ
asthma has attacked several members of the same family when forty years
old and other families during infancy the most different diseases
such as angina pectoris stone in the bladder and various affections
of the skin have appeared in successive generations at nearly the same
age the little finger of a man began from some unknown cause to grow
inwards and the same finger in his two sons began at the same age to
bend inwards in a similar manner strange and inexplicable neuralgic
affections have caused parents and children to suffer agonies at about
the same period of life43
i will give only two other cases which are interesting as illustrating
the disappearance as well as the appearance of disease at the same age
two brothers their father their paternal uncles seven cousins and
their paternal grandfather were all similarly affected by a
skindisease called pityriasis versicolor the disease strictly
limited to the males of the family though transmitted through the
females usually appeared at puberty and disappeared at about the age
of forty or fortyfive years the second case is that of four
brothers who when about twelve years old suffered almost every week
from severe headaches which were relieved only by a recumbent position
in a dark room their father paternal uncles paternal grandfather
and granduncles all suffered in the same way from headaches which
ceased at the age of fiftyfour or fiftyfive in all those who lived so
long none of the females of the family were affected44
it is impossible to read the foregoing accounts and the many others
which have been recorded of diseases coming on during three or even
more generations in several members of the same family at the same age
especially in the case of rare affections in which the coincidence
cannot be attributed to chance and to doubt that there is a strong
tendency to inheritance in disease at corresponding periods of life
when the rule fails the disease is apt to come on earlier in the child
than in the parent the exceptions in the other direction being very
much rarer dr lucas45 alludes to several cases of inherited
diseases coming on at an earlier period i have already given one
striking instance with blindness during three generations and mr
bowman remarks that this frequently occurs with cataract with cancer
there seems to be a peculiar liability to earlier inheritance sir j
paget who has particularly attended to this subject and tabulated a
large number of cases informs me that he believes that in nine cases
out of ten the later generation suffers from the disease at an earlier
period than the previous generation he adds in the instances in
which the opposite relation holds and the members of later generations
have cancer at a later age than their predecessors i think it will be
found that the noncancerous parents have lived to extreme old ages
so that the longevity of a nonaffected parent seems to have the power
of influencing the fatal period in the offspring and we thus
apparently get another element of complexity in inheritance
the facts showing that with certain diseases the period of inheritance
occasionally or even frequently advances are important with respect to
the general descenttheory for they render it probable that the same
thing would occur with ordinary modifications of structure the final
result of a long series of such advances would be the gradual
obliteration of characters proper to the embryo and larva which would
thus come to resemble more and more closely the mature parentform but
any structure which was of service to the embryo or larva would be
preserved by the destruction at this stage of growth of each individual
which manifested any tendency to lose its proper character at too early
an age
finally from the numerous races of cultivated plants and domestic
animals in which the seeds or eggs the young or old differ from one
another and from those of the parentspeciesfrom the cases in which
new characters have appeared at a particular period and afterwards
been inherited at the same periodand from what we know with respect
to disease we must believe in the truth of the great principle of
inheritance at corresponding periods of life
summary of the three preceding chaptersstrong as is the force of
inheritance it allows the incessant appearance of new characters
these whether beneficial or injuriousof the most trifling
importance such as a shade of colour in a flower a coloured lock of
hair or a mere gestureor of the highest importance as when
affecting the brain or an organ so perfect and complex as the eyeor
of so grave a nature as to deserve to be called a monstrosityor so
peculiar as not to occur normally in any member of the same natural
classoften inherited by man by the lower animals and plants in
numberless cases it suffices for the inheritance of a peculiarity that
one parent alone should be thus characterised inequalities in the two
sides of the body though opposed to the law of symmetry may be
transmitted there is ample evidence that the effects of mutilations
and of accidents especially or perhaps exclusively when followed by
disease are occasionally inherited there can be no doubt that the
evil effects of the longcontinued exposure of the parent to injurious
conditions are sometimes transmitted to the offspring so it is as we
shall see in a future chapter with the effects of the use and disuse
of parts and of mental habits periodical habits are likewise
transmitted but generally as it would appear with little force
hence we are led to look at inheritance as the rule and
noninheritance as the anomaly but this power often appears to us in
our ignorance to act capriciously transmitting a character with
inexplicable strength or feebleness the very same peculiarity as the
weeping habit of trees silky feathers etc may be inherited either
firmly or not at all by different members of the same group and even
by different individuals of the same species though treated in the
same manner in this latter case we see that the power of transmission
is a quality which is merely individual in its attachment as with
single characters so it is with the several concurrent slight
differences which distinguish subvarieties or races for of these
some can be propagated almost as truly as species whilst others cannot
be relied on the same rule holds good with plants when propagated by
bulbs offsets etc which in one sense still form parts of the same
individual for some varieties retain or inherit through successive
budgenerations their character far more truly than others
some characters not proper to the parentspecies have certainly been
inherited from an extremely remote epoch and may therefore be
considered as firmly fixed but it is doubtful whether length of
inheritance in itself gives fixedness of character though the chances
are obviously in favour of any character which has long been
transmitted true or unaltered still being transmitted true as long as
the conditions of life remain the same we know that many species
after having retained the same character for countless ages whilst
living under their natural conditions when domesticated have varied in
the most diversified manner that is have failed to transmit their
original form so that no character appears to be absolutely fixed we
can sometimes account for the failure of inheritance by the conditions
of life being opposed to the development of certain characters and
still oftener as with plants cultivated by grafts and buds by the
conditions causing new and slight modifications incessantly to appear
in this latter case it is not that inheritance wholly fails but that
new characters are continually superadded in some few cases in which
both parents are similarly characterised inheritance seems to gain so
much force by the combined action of the two parents that it
counteracts its own power and a new modification is the result
in many cases the failure of the parents to transmit their likeness is
due to the breed having been at some former period crossed and the
child takes after his grandparent or more remote ancestor of foreign
blood in other cases in which the breed has not been crossed but
some ancient character has been lost through variation it occasionally
reappears through reversion so that the parents apparently fail to
transmit their own likeness in all cases however we may safely
conclude that the child inherits all its characters from its parents
in whom certain characters are latent like the secondary sexual
characters of one sex in the other when after a long succession of
budgenerations a flower or fruit becomes separated into distinct
segments having the colours or other attributes of both parentforms
we cannot doubt that these characters were latent in the earlier buds
though they could not then be detected or could be detected only in an
intimately commingled state so it is with animals of crossed
parentage which with advancing years occasionally exhibit characters
derived from one of their two parents of which not a trace could at
first be perceived certain monstrosities which resemble what
naturalists call the typical form of the group in question apparently
come under the same law of reversion it is assuredly an astonishing
fact that the male and female sexual elements that buds and even
fullgrown animals should retain characters during several
generations in the case of crossed breeds and during thousands of
generations in the case of pure breeds written as it were in invisible
ink yet ready at any time to be evolved under certain conditions
what these conditions precisely are we do not know but any cause
which disturbs the organisation or constitution seems to be sufficient
a cross certainly gives a strong tendency to the reappearance of
longlost characters both corporeal and mental in the case of plants
this tendency is much stronger with those species which have been
crossed after long cultivation and which therefore have had their
constitutions disturbed by this cause as well as by crossing than with
species which have always lived under their natural conditions and have
then been crossed a return also of domesticated animals and
cultivated plants to a wild state favours reversion but the tendency
under these circumstances has been much exaggerated
when individuals of the same family which differ somewhat and when
races or species are crossed the one is often prepotent over the other
in transmitting its character a race may possess a strong power of
inheritance and yet when crossed as we have seen with
trumpeterpigeons yield to the prepotency of every other race
prepotency of transmission may be equal in the two sexes of the same
species but often runs more strongly in one sex it plays an important
part in determining the rate at which one race can be modified or
wholly absorbed by repeated crosses with another we can seldom tell
what makes one race or species prepotent over another but it sometimes
depends on the same character being present and visible in one parent
and latent or potentially present in the other
characters may first appear in either sex but oftener in the male than
in the female and afterwards be transmitted to the offspring of the
same sex in this case we may feel confident that the peculiarity in
question is really present though latent in the opposite sex hence the
father may transmit through his daughter any character to his grandson
and the mother conversely to her granddaughter we thus learn and the
fact is an important one that transmission and development are
distinct powers occasionally these two powers seem to be antagonistic
or incapable of combination in the same individual for several cases
have been recorded in which the son has not directly inherited a
character from his father or directly transmitted it to his son but
has received it by transmission through his nonaffected mother and
transmitted it through his nonaffected daughter owing to inheritance
being limited by sex we see how secondary sexual characters may have
arisen under nature their preservation and accumulation being
dependent on their service to either sex
at whatever period of life a new character first appears it generally
remains latent in the offspring until a corresponding age is attained
and then is developed when this rule fails the child generally
exhibits the character at an earlier period than the parent on this
principle of inheritance at corresponding periods we can understand
how it is that most animals display from the germ to maturity such a
marvellous succession of characters
finally though much remains obscure with respect to inheritance we
may look at the following laws as fairly well established firstly a
tendency in every character new and old to be transmitted by seminal
and bud generation though often counteracted by various known and
unknown causes secondly reversion or atavism which depends on
transmission and development being distinct powers it acts in various
degrees and manners through both seminal and bud generation thirdly
prepotency of transmission which may be confined to one sex or be
common to both sexes fourthly transmission as limited by sex
generally to the same sex in which the inherited character first
appeared and this in many probably most cases depends on the new
character having first appeared at a rather late period of life
fifthly inheritance at corresponding periods of life with some
tendency to the earlier development of the inherited character in
these laws of inheritance as displayed under domestication we see an
ample provision for the production through variability and natural
selection of new specific forms

chapter xv on crossing
free intercrossing obliterates the differences between allied
breedswhen the numbers of two commingling breeds are unequal one
absorbs the otherthe rate of absorption determined by prepotency of
transmission by the conditions of life and by natural selectionall
organic beings occasionally intercross apparent exceptionson certain
characters incapable of fusion chiefly or exclusively those which have
suddenly appeared in the individualon the modification of old races
and the formation of new races by crossingsome crossed races have bred
true from their first productionon the crossing of distinct species in
relation to the formation of domestic races
in the two previous chapters when discussing reversion and prepotency
i was necessarily led to give many facts on crossing in the present
chapter i shall consider the part which crossing plays in two opposed
directionsfirstly in obliterating characters and consequently in
preventing the formation of new races and secondly in the
modification of old races or in the formation of new and intermediate
races by a combination of characters i shall also show that certain
characters are incapable of fusion
the effects of free or uncontrolled breeding between the members of the
same variety or of closely allied varieties are important but are so
obvious that they need not be discussed at much length it is free
intercrossing which chiefly gives uniformity both under nature and
under domestication to the individuals of the same species or variety
when they live mingled together and are not exposed to any cause
inducing excessive variability the prevention of free crossing and
the intentional matching of individual animals are the cornerstones
of the breeders art no man in his senses would expect to improve or
modify a breed in any particular manner or keep an old breed true and
distinct unless he separated his animals the killing of inferior
animals in each generation comes to the same thing as their separation
in savage and semicivilised countries where the inhabitants have not
the means of separating their animals more than a single breed of the
same species rarely or never exists in former times even in the
united states there were no distinct races of sheep for all had been
mingled together1 the celebrated agriculturist marshall2 remarks
that sheep that are kept within fences as well as shepherded flocks
in open countries have generally a similarity if not a uniformity of
character in the individuals of each flock for they breed freely
together and are prevented from crossing with other kinds whereas in
the unenclosed parts of england the unshepherded sheep even of the
same flock are far from true or uniform owing to various breeds
having mingled and crossed we have seen that the halfwild cattle in
each of the several british parks are nearly uniform in character but
in the different parks from not having mingled and crossed during many
generations they differ to a certain small extent
we cannot doubt that the extraordinary number of varieties and
subvarieties of the pigeon amounting to at least one hundred and
fifty is partly due to their remaining differently from other
domesticated birds paired for life once matched on the other hand
breeds of cats imported into this country soon disappear for their
nocturnal and rambling habits render it hardly possible to prevent free
crossing rengger3 gives an interesting case with respect to the cat
in paraguay in all the distant parts of the kingdom it has assumed
apparently from the effects of the climate a peculiar character but
near the capital this change has been prevented owing as he asserts
to the native animal frequently crossing with cats imported from
europe in all cases like the foregoing the effects of an occasional
cross will be augmented by the increased vigour and fertility of the
crossed offspring of which fact evidence will hereafter be given for
this will lead to the mongrels increasing more rapidly than the pure
parentbreeds
when distinct breeds are allowed to cross freely the result will be a
heterogeneous body for instance the dogs in paraguay are far from
uniform and can no longer be affiliated to their parentraces4 the
character which a crossed body of animals will ultimately assume must
depend on several contingenciesnamely on the relative members of the
individuals belonging to the two or more races which are allowed to
mingle on the prepotency of one race over the other in the
transmission of character and on the conditions of life to which they
are exposed when two commingled breeds exist at first in nearly equal
numbers the whole will sooner or later become intimately blended but
not so soon both breeds being equally favoured in all respects as
might have been expected the following calculation5 shows that this
is the case if a colony with an equal number of black and white men
were founded and we assume that they marry indiscriminately are
equally prolific and that one in thirty annually dies and is born
then in 65 years the number of blacks whites and mulattoes would be
equal in 91 years the whites would be 110th the blacks 110th and
the mulattoes or people of intermediate degrees of colour 810ths of
the whole number in three centuries not 1100th part of the whites
would exist
when one of two mingled races exceed the other greatly in number the
latter will soon be wholly or almost wholly absorbed and lost6
thus european pigs and dogs have been largely introduced in the islands
of the pacific ocean and the native races have been absorbed and lost
in the course of about fifty or sixty years7 but the imported races
no doubt were favoured rats may be considered as semidomesticated
animals some snakerats mus alexandrinus escaped in the zoological
gardens of london and for a long time afterwards the keepers
frequently caught crossbred rats at first halfbreds afterwards with
less of the character of the snakerat till at length all traces of it
disappeared8 on the other hand in some parts of london especially
near the docks where fresh rats are frequently imported an endless
variety of intermediate forms may be found between the brown black
and snake rat which are all three usually ranked as distinct species
how many generations are necessary for one species or race to absorb
another by repeated crosses has often been discussed9 and the
requisite number has probably been much exaggerated some writers have
maintained that a dozen or score or even more generations are
necessary but this in itself is improbable for in the tenth
generation there would be only 11024th part of foreign blood in the
offspring grtner found10 that with plants one species could be
made to absorb another in from three to five generations and he
believes that this could always be effected in from six to seven
generations in one instance however kolreuter11 speaks of the
offspring of mirabilis vulgaris crossed during eight successive
generations by m longiflora as resembling this latter species so
closely that the most scrupulous observer could detect vix aliquam
notabilem differentiam or as he says he succeeded ad plenariam
fere transmutationem but this expression shows that the act of
absorption was not even then absolutely complete though these crossed
plants contained only the 1256th part of m vulgaris the
conclusions of such accurate observers as grtner and klreuter are of
far higher worth than those made without scientific aim by breeders
the most precise account which i have met with is given by
stonehenge12 and is illustrated by photographs mr hanley crossed a
greyhound bitch with a bulldog the offspring in each succeeding
generation being recrossed with firstrate greyhounds as stonehenge
remarks it might naturally be supposed that it would take several
crosses to get rid of the heavy form of the bulldog but hysterics the
grgrgranddaughter of a bulldog showed no trace whatever of this
breed in external form she and all of the same litter however were
remarkably deficient in stoutness though fast as well as clever i
believe clever refers to skill in turning hysterics was put to a son
of bedlamite but the result of the fifth cross is not as yet i
believe more satisfactory than that of the fourth on the other hand
with sheep fleischmann13 shows how persistent the effects of a
single cross may be he says that the original coarse sheep of
germany have 5500 fibres of wool on a square inch grades of the third
or fourth merino cross produced about 8000 the twentieth cross 27000
the perfect pure merino blood 40000 to 48000 so that common german
sheep crossed twenty times successively with merino did not by any
means acquire wool as fine as that of the pure breed but in all cases
the rate of absorption will depend largely on the conditions of life
being favourable to any particular character and we may suspect that
there would be a constant tendency to degeneration in the wool of
merinos under the climate of germany unless prevented by careful
selection and thus perhaps the foregoing remarkable case may be
explained the rate of absorption must also depend on the amount of
distinguishable difference between the two forms which are crossed and
especially as grtner insists on prepotency of transmission in the
one form over the other we have seen in the last chapter that one of
two french breeds of sheep yielded up its character when crossed with
merinos very much more slowly than the other and the common german
sheep referred to by fleischmann may be in this respect analogous in
all cases there will be more or less liability to reversion during many
subsequent generations and it is this fact which has probably led
authors to maintain that a score or more of generations are requisite
for one race to absorb another in considering the final result of the
commingling of two or more breeds we must not forget that the act of
crossing in itself tends to bring back longlost characters not proper
to the immediate parentforms
with respect to the influence of the conditions of life on any two
breeds which are allowed to cross freely unless both are indigenous
and have long been accustomed to the country where they live they
will in all probability be unequally affected by the conditions and
this will modify the result even with indigenous breeds it will
rarely or never occur that both are equally well adapted to the
surrounding circumstances more especially when permitted to roam
freely and not carefully tended as is generally the case with breeds
allowed to cross as a consequence of this natural selection will to a
certain extent come into action and the best fitted will survive and
this will aid in determining the ultimate character of the commingled
body
how long a time it would require before such a crossed body of animals
would assume a uniform character within a limited area no one can say
that they would ultimately become uniform from free intercrossing and
from the survival of the fittest we may feel assured but the
characters thus acquired would rarely or never as may be inferred from
the previous considerations be exactly intermediate between those of
the two parentbreeds with respect to the very slight differences by
which the individuals of the same subvariety or even of allied
varieties are characterised it is obvious that free crossing would
soon obliterate such small distinctions the formation of new
varieties independently of selection would also thus be prevented
except when the same variation continually recurred from the action of
some strongly predisposing cause we may therefore conclude that free
crossing has in all cases played an important part in giving uniformity
of character to all the members of the same domestic race and of the
same natural species though largely governed by natural selection and
by the direct action of the surrounding conditions
on the possibility of all organic beings occasionally
intercrossingbut it may be asked can free crossing occur with
hermaphrodite animals and plants all the higher animals and the few
insects which have been domesticated have separate sexes and must
inevitably unite for each birth with respect to the crossing of
hermaphrodites the subject is too large for the present volume but in
the origin of species i have given a short abstract of the reasons
which induce me to believe that all organic beings occasionally cross
though perhaps in some cases only at long intervals of time14 i will
merely recall the fact that many plants though hermaphrodite in
structure are unisexual in functionsuch as those called by ck
sprengel dichogamous in which the pollen and stigma of the same
flower are matured at different periods or those called by me
reciprocally dimorphic in which the flowers own pollen is not
fitted to fertilise its own stigma or again the many kinds in which
curious mechanical contrivances exist effectually preventing
selffertilisation there are however many hermaphrodite plants which
are not in any way specially constructed to favour intercrossing but
which nevertheless commingle almost as freely as animals with separated
sexes this is the case with cabbages radishes and onions as i know
from having experimented on them even the peasants of liguria say that
cabbages must be prevented from falling in love with each other in
the orange tribe gallesio15 remarks that the amelioration of the
various kinds is checked by their continual and almost regular
crossing so it is with numerous other plants
on the other hand some cultivated plants rarely or never intercross
for instance the common pea and sweetpea lathyrus odoratus yet
their flowers are certainly adapted for cross fertilisation the
varieties of the tomato and aubergine solanum and the pimenta
pimenta vulgaris are said16 never to cross even when growing
alongside one another but it should be observed that these are all
exotic plants and we do not know how they would behave in their native
country when visited by the proper insects with respect to the common
pea i have ascertained that it is rarely crossed in this country owing
to premature fertilisation there exist however some plants which
under their natural conditions appear to be always selffertilised
such as the bee ophrys ophrys apifera and a few other orchids yet
these plants exhibit the plainest adaptations for crossfertilisation
again some few plants are believed to produce only closed flowers
called cleistogene which cannot possibly be crossed this was long
thought to be the case with the leersia oryzoides17 but this grass
is now known occasionally to produce perfect flowers which set seed
although some plants both indigenous and naturalised rarely or never
produce flowers or if they flower never produce seeds yet no one
doubts that phanerogamic plants are adapted to produce flowers and the
flowers to produce seed when they fail we believe that such plants
under different conditions would perform their proper function or that
they formerly did so and will do so again on analogous grounds i
believe that the flowers in the above specified anomalous cases which
do not now intercross either would do so occasionally under different
conditions or that they formerly did sothe means for affecting this
being generally still retainedand will again intercross at some future
period unless indeed they become extinct on this view alone many
points in the structure and action of the reproductive organs in
hermaphrodite plants and animals are intelligiblefor instance the
fact of the male and female organs never being so completely enclosed
as to render access from without impossible hence we may conclude that
the most important of all the means for giving uniformity to the
individuals of the same species namely the capacity of occasionally
intercrossing is present or has been formerly present with all
organic beings except perhaps some of the lowest
on certain characters not blendingwhen two breeds are crossed their
characters usually become intimately fused together but some
characters refuse to blend and are transmitted in an unmodified state
either from both parents or from one when grey and white mice are
paired the young are piebald or pure white or grey but not of an
intermediate tint so it is when white and common collared turtledoves
are paired in breeding game fowls a great authority mr j douglas
remarks i may here state a strange fact if you cross a black with a
white game you get birds of both breeds of the clearest colour sir
r heron crossed during many years white black brown and
fawncoloured angora rabbits and never once got these colours mingled
in the same animal but often all four colours in the same litter18
from cases like these in which the colours of the two parents are
transmitted quite separately to the offspring we have all sorts of
gradations leading to complete fusion i will give an instance a
gentleman with a fair complexion light hair but dark eyes married a
lady with dark hair and complexion their three children have very
light hair but on careful search about a dozen black hairs were found
scattered in the midst of the light hair on the heads of all three
when turnspit dogs and ancon sheep both of which have dwarfed limbs
are crossed with common breeds the offspring are not intermediate in
structure but take after either parent when tailless or hornless
animals are crossed with perfect animals it frequently but by no
means invariably happens that the offspring are either furnished with
these organs in a perfect state or are quite destitute of them
according to rengger the hairless condition of the paraguay dog is
either perfectly or not at all transmitted to its mongrel offspring
but i have seen one partial exception in a dog of this parentage which
had part of its skin hairy and part naked the parts being distinctly
separated as in a piebald animal when dorking fowls with five toes are
crossed with other breeds the chickens often have five toes on one
foot and four on the other some crossed pigs raised by sir r heron
between the solidhoofed and common pig had not all four feet in an
intermediate condition but two feet were furnished with properly
divided and two with united hoofs
analogous facts have been observed with plants major trevor clarke
crossed the little glabrousleaved annual stock matthiola with
pollen of a large redflowered roughleaved biennial stock called
cocardeau by the french and the result was that half the seedlings
had glabrous and the other half rough leaves but none had leaves in an
intermediate state that the glabrous seedlings were the product of the
roughleaved variety and not accidentally of the motherplants own
pollen was shown by their tall and strong habit of growth19 in the
succeeding generations raised from the roughleaved crossed seedlings
some glabrous plants appeared showing that the glabrous character
though incapable of blending with and modifying the rough leaves was
all the time latent in this family of plants the numerous plants
formerly referred to which i raised from reciprocal crosses between
the peloric and common antirrhinum offer a nearly parallel case for
in the first generation all the plants resembled the common form and
in the next generation out of one hundred and thirtyseven plants two
alone were in an intermediate condition the others perfectly
resembling either the peloric or common form major trevor clarke also
fertilised the abovementioned redflowered stock with pollen from the
purple queen stock and about half the seedlings scarcely differed in
habit and not at all in the red colour of the flower from the
motherplant the other half bearing blossoms of a rich purple closely
like those of the paternal plant grtner crossed many white and
yellowflowered species and varieties of verbascum and these colours
were never blended but the offspring bore either pure white or pure
yellow blossoms the former in the larger proportion20 dr herbert
raised many seedlings as he informed me from swedish turnips crossed
by two other varieties and these never produced flowers of an
intermediate tint but always like one of their parents i fertilised
the purple sweetpea lathyrus odoratus which has a dark
reddishpurple standardpetal and violetcoloured wings and keel with
pollen of the painted lady sweetpea which has a pale cherrycoloured
standard and almost white wings and keel and from the same pod i
twice raised plants perfectly resembling both sorts the greater number
resembling the father so perfect was the resemblance that i should
have thought there had been some mistake if the plants which were at
first identical with the paternal variety namely the paintedlady
had not later in the season produced as mentioned in a former chapter
flowers blotched and streaked with dark purple i raised grandchildren
and greatgrandchildren from these crossed plants and they continued
to resemble the paintedlady but during later generations became
rather more blotched with purple yet none reverted completely to the
original motherplant the purple sweetpea the following case is
slightly different but still shows the same principle naudin21
raised numerous hybrids between the yellow linaria vulgaris and the
purple l purpurea and during three successive generations the
colours kept distinct in different parts of the same flower
from cases such as the foregoing in which the offspring of the first
generation perfectly resemble either parent we come by a small step to
those cases in which differently coloured flowers borne on the same
root resemble both parents and by another step to those in which the
same flower or fruit is striped or blotched with the two parental
colours or bears a single stripe of the colour or other characteristic
quality of one of the parentforms with hybrids and mongrels it
frequently or even generally happens that one part of the body
resembles more or less closely one parent and another part the other
parent and here again some resistence to fusion or what comes to the
same thing some mutual affinity between the organic atoms of the same
nature apparently comes into play for otherwise all parts of the body
would be equally intermediate in character so again when the
offspring of hybrids or mongrels which are themselves nearly
intermediate in character revert either wholly or by segments to their
ancestors the principle of the affinity of similar or the repulsion
of dissimilar atoms must come into action to this principle which
seems to be extremely general we shall recur in the chapter on
pangenesis
it is remarkable as has been strongly insisted upon by isidore
geoffroy st hilaire in regard to animals that the transmission of
characters without fusion occurs very rarely when species are crossed
i know of one exception alone namely with the hybrids naturally
produced between the common and hooded crow corvus corone and
cornix which however are closely allied species differing in
nothing except colour nor have i met with any wellascertained cases
of transmission of this kind even when one form is strongly prepotent
over another when two races are crossed which have been slowly formed
by mans selection and therefore resemble to a certain extent natural
species such cases as puppies in the same litter closely resembling
two distinct breeds are probably due to superfoetationthat is to
the influence of two fathers all the characters above enumerated
which are transmitted in a perfect state to some of the offspring and
not to others such as distinct colours nakedness of skin smoothness
of leaves absence of horns or tail additional toes pelorism dwarfed
structure etchave all been known to appear suddenly in individual
animals and plants from this fact and from the several slight
aggregated differences which distinguish domestic races and species
from one another not being liable to this peculiar form of
transmission we may conclude that it is in some way connected with the
sudden appearance of the characters in question
on the modification of old races and the formation of new races by
crossingwe have hitherto chiefly considered the effects of crossing
in giving uniformity of character we must now look to an opposite
result there can be no doubt that crossing with the aid of rigorous
selection during several generations has been a potent means in
modifying old races and in forming new ones lord orford crossed his
famous stud of greyhounds once with the bulldog in order to give them
courage and perseverance certain pointers have been crossed as i hear
from the rev w d fox with the foxhound to give them dash and
speed certain strains of dorking fowls have had a slight infusion of
game blood and i have known a great fancier who on a single occasion
crossed his turbitpigeons with barbs for the sake of gaining greater
breadth of beak
in the foregoing cases breeds have been crossed once for the sake of
modifying some particular character but with most of the improved
races of the pig which now breed true there have been repeated
crossesfor instance the improved essex owes its excellence to
repeated crosses with the neapolitan together probably with some
infusion of chinese blood22 so with our british sheep almost all
the races except the southdown have been largely crossed this in
fact has been the history of our principal breeds23 to give an
example the oxfordshire downs now rank as an established breed24
they were produced about the year 1830 by crossing hampshire and in
some instances southdown ewes with cotswold rams now the hampshire
ram was itself produced by repeated crosses between the native
hampshire sheep and southdowns and the longwoolled cotswold were
improved by crosses with the leicester which latter again is believed
to have been a cross between several longwoolled sheep mr spooner
after considering the various cases which have been carefully recorded
concludes that from a judicious pairing of crossbred animals it is
practicable to establish a new breed on the continent the history of
several crossed races of cattle and of other animals has been well
ascertained to give one instance the king of wurtemburg after
twentyfive years careful breeding that is after six or seven
generations made a new breed of cattle from a cross between a dutch
and a swiss breed combined with other breeds25 the sebright bantam
which breeds as true as any other kind of fowl was formed about sixty
years ago by a complicated cross26 dark brahmas which are believed
by some fanciers to constitute a distinct species were undoubtedly
formed27 in the united states within a recent period by a cross
between chittagongs and cochins with plants there is little doubt that
the swedeturnip originated from a cross and the history of a variety
of wheat raised from two very distinct varieties and which after six
years culture presented an even sample has been recorded on good
authority28
until lately cautious and experienced breeders though not averse to a
single infusion of foreign blood were almost universally convinced
that the attempt to establish a new race intermediate between two
widely distinct races was hopeless they clung with superstitious
tenacity to the doctrine of purity of blood believing it to be the ark
in which alone true safety could be found29 nor was this conviction
unreasonable when two distinct races are crossed the offspring of the
first generation are generally nearly uniform in character but even
this sometimes fails to be the case especially with crossed dogs and
fowls the young of which from the first are sometimes much
diversified as crossbred animals are generally of large size and
vigorous they have been raised in great numbers for immediate
consumption but for breeding they are found utterly useless for
though they may themselves be uniform in character they yield during
many generations astonishingly diversified offspring the breeder is
driven to despair and concludes that he will never form an
intermediate race but from the cases already given and from others
which have been recorded it appears that patience alone is necessary
as mr spooner remarks nature opposes no barrier to successful
admixture in the course of time by the aid of selection and careful
weeding it is practicable to establish a new breed after six or
seven generations the hopedfor result will in most cases be obtained
but even then an occasional reversion or failure to keep true may be
expected the attempt however will assuredly fail if the conditions
of life be decidedly unfavourable to the characters of either
parentbreed30
although the grandchildren and succeeding generations of crossbred
animals are generally variable in an extreme degree some curious
exceptions to the rule have been observed both with crossed races and
species thus boitard and corbi31 assert that from a pouter and a
runt a cavalier will appear which we have classed amongst pigeons of
pure race because it transmits all its qualities to its posterity
the editor of the poultry chronicle32 bred some bluish fowls from a
black spanish cock and a malay hen and these remained true to colour
generation after generation the himalayan breed of rabbits was
certainly formed by crossing two subvarieties of the silvergrey
rabbit although it suddenly assumed its present character which
differs much from that of either parentbreed yet it has ever since
been easily and truly propagated i crossed some labrador and penguin
ducks and recrossed the mongrels with penguins afterwards most of the
ducks reared during three generations were nearly uniform in character
being brown with a white crescentic mark on the lower part of the
breast and with some white spots at the base of the beak so that by
the aid of a little selection a new breed might easily have been
formed with regard to crossed varieties of plants mr beaton33
remarks that melvilles extraordinary cross between the scotch kale
and an early cabbage is as true and genuine as any on record but in
this case no doubt selection was practised grtner34 has given five
cases of hybrids in which the progeny kept constant and hybrids
between dianthus armeria and deltoides remained true and uniform to
the tenth generation dr herbert likewise showed me a hybrid from two
species of loasa which from its first production had kept constant
during several generations
we have seen in the first chapter that the several kinds of dogs are
almost certainly descended from more than one species and so it is
with cattle pigs and some other domesticated animals hence the
crossing of aboriginally distinct species probably came into play at an
early period in the formation of our present races from rutimeyers
observations there can be little doubt that this occurred with cattle
but in most cases one form will probably have absorbed and obliterated
the other for it is not likely that semicivilised men would have
taken the necessary pains to modify by selection their commingled
crossed and fluctuating stock nevertheless those animals which were
best adapted to their conditions of life would have survived through
natural selection and by this means crossing will often have
indirectly aided in the formation of primeval domesticated breeds
within recent times as far as animals are concerned the crossing of
distinct species has done little or nothing towards the formation or
modification of our races it is not yet known whether the several
species of silkmoth which have been recently crossed in france will
yield permanent races with plants which can be multiplied by buds and
cuttings hybridisation has done wonders as with many kinds of roses
rhododendrons pelargoniums calceolarias and petunias nearly all
these plants can be propagated by seed most of them freely but
extremely few or none come true by seed
some authors believe that crossing is the chief cause of
variabilitythat is of the appearance of absolutely new characters
some have gone so far as to look at it as the sole cause but this
conclusion is disproved by the facts given in the chapter on
budvariation the belief that characters not present in either parent
or in their ancestors frequently originate from crossing is doubtful
that they occasionally do so is probable but this subject will be more
conveniently discussed in a future chapter on the causes of
variability
a condensed summary of this and of the three following chapters
together with some remarks on hybridism will be given in the
nineteenth chapter

chapter xvi causes which interfere with the free crossing of
varietiesinfluence of domestication on fertility
difficulties in judging of the fertility of varieties when crossed
various causes which keep varieties distinct as the period of breeding
and sexual preferencevarieties of wheat said to be sterile when
crossedvarieties of maize verbascum hollyhock gourds melons and
tobacco rendered in some degree mutually steriledomestication
eliminates the tendency to sterility natural to species when crossedon
the increased fertility of uncrossed animals and plants from
domestication and cultivation
the domesticated races of both animals and plants when crossed are
with extremely few exceptions quite prolificin some cases even more
so than the purelybred parentraces the offspring also raised from
such crosses are likewise as we shall see in the following chapter
generally more vigorous and fertile than their parents on the other
hand species when crossed and their hybrid offspring are almost
invariably in some degree sterile and here there seems to exist a
broad and insuperable distinction between races and species the
importance of this subject as bearing on the origin of species is
obvious and we shall hereafter recur to it
it is unfortunate how few precise observations have been made on the
fertility of mongrel animals and plants during several successive
generations dr broca1 has remarked that no one has observed
whether for instance mongrel dogs bred inter se are indefinitely
fertile yet if a shade of infertility be detected by careful
observation in the offspring of natural forms when crossed it is
thought that their specific distinction is proved but so many breeds
of sheep cattle pigs dogs and poultry have been crossed and
recrossed in various ways that any sterility if it had existed would
from being injurious almost certainly have been observed in
investigating the fertility of crossed varieties many sources of doubt
occur whenever the least trace of sterility between two plants
however closely allied was observed by kolreuter and more especially
by grtner who counted the exact number of seed in each capsule the
two forms were at once ranked as distinct species and if this rule be
followed assuredly it will never be proved that varieties when crossed
are in any degree sterile we have formerly seen that certain breeds of
dogs do not readily pair together but no observations have been made
whether when paired they produce the full number of young and
whether the latter are perfectly fertile inter se but supposing
that some degree of sterility were found to exist naturalists would
simply infer that these breeds were descended from aboriginally
distinct species and it would be scarcely possible to ascertain
whether or not this explanation was the true one
the sebright bantam is much less prolific than any other breed of
fowls and is descended from a cross between two very distinct breeds
recrossed by a third subvariety but it would be extremely rash to
infer that the loss of fertility was in any manner connected with its
crossed origin for it may with more probability be attributed either
to longcontinued close interbreeding or to an innate tendency to
sterility correlated with the absence of hackles and sickle
tailfeathers
before giving the few recorded cases of forms which must be ranked as
varieties being in some degree sterile when crossed i may remark that
other causes sometimes interfere with varieties freely intercrossing
thus they may differ too greatly in size as with some kinds of dogs
and fowls for instance the editor of the journal of horticulture
etc2 says that he can keep bantams with the larger breeds without
much danger of their crossing but not with the smaller breeds such as
games hamburghs etc with plants a difference in the period of
flowering serves to keep varieties distinct as with the various kinds
of maize and wheat thus colonel le couteur3 remarks the talavera
wheat from flowering much earlier than any other kind is sure to
continue pure in different parts of the falkland islands the cattle
are breaking up into herds of different colours and those on the
higher ground which are generally white usually breed as i am
informed by sir j sulivan three months earlier than those on the
lowland and this would manifestly tend to keep the herds from
blending
certain domestic races seem to prefer breeding with their own kind and
this is a fact of some importance for it is a step towards that
instinctive feeling which helps to keep closely allied species in a
state of nature distinct we have now abundant evidence that if it
were not for this feeling many more hybrids would be naturally
produced than in this case we have seen in the first chapter that the
alco dog of mexico dislikes dogs of other breeds and the hairless dog
of paraguay mixes less readily with the european races than the latter
do with each other in germany the female spitzdog is said to receive
the fox more readily than will other dogs a female australian dingo in
england attracted the wild male foxes but these differences in the
sexual instinct and attractive power of the various breeds may be
wholly due to their descent from distinct species in paraguay the
horses have much freedom and an excellent observer4 believes that
the native horses of the same colour and size prefer associating with
each other and that the horses which have been imported from entre
rios and banda oriental into paraguay likewise prefer associating
together in circassia six subraces of the horse have received
distinct names and a native proprietor of rank5 asserts that horses
of three of these races whilst living a free life almost always
refuse to mingle and cross and will even attack one another
it has been observed in a district stocked with heavy lincolnshire and
light norfolk sheep that both kinds though bred together when turned
out in a short time separate to a sheep the lincolnshires drawing
off to the rich soil and the norfolks to their own dry light soil and
as long as there is plenty of grass the two breeds keep themselves as
distinct as rooks and pigeons in this case different habits of life
tend to keep the races distinct on one of the faroe islands not more
than half a mile in diameter the halfwild native black sheep are said
not to have readily mixed with the imported white sheep it is a more
curious fact that the semimonstrous ancon sheep of modern origin have
been observed to keep together separating themselves from the rest of
the flock when put into enclosures with other sheep6 with respect
to fallowdeer which live in a semidomesticated condition mr
bennett7 states that the dark and pale coloured herds which have
long been kept together in the forest of dean in high meadow woods
and in the new forest have never been known to mingle the
darkcoloured deer it may be added are believed to have been first
brought by james i from norway on account of their greater hardiness
i imported from the island of porto santo two of the feral rabbits
which differ as described in the fourth chapter from common rabbits
both proved to be males and though they lived during some years in
the zoological gardens the superintendent mr bartlett in vain
endeavoured to make them breed with various tame kinds but whether
this refusal to breed was due to any change in the instinct or simply
to their extreme wildness or whether confinement had rendered them
sterile as often occurs cannot be determined
whilst matching for the sake of experiment many of the most distinct
breeds of pigeons it frequently appeared to me that the birds though
faithful to their marriage vow retained some desire after their own
kind accordingly i asked mr wicking who has kept a larger stock of
various breeds together than any man in england whether he thought
that they would prefer pairing with their own kind supposing that
there were males and females enough of each and he without hesitation
answered that he was convinced that this was the case it has often
been noticed that the dovecote pigeon seems to have an actual aversion
towards the several fancy breeds8 yet all have certainly sprung from
a common progenitor the rev w d fox informs me that his flocks of
white and common chinese geese kept distinct
these facts and statements though some of them are incapable of proof
resting only on the opinion of experienced observers show that some
domestic races are led by different habits of life to keep to a certain
extent separate and that others prefer coupling with their own kind
in the same manner as species in a state of nature though in a much
less degree
with respect to sterility from the crossing of domestic races i know
of no wellascertained case with animals this fact seeing the great
difference in structure between some breeds of pigeons fowls pigs
dogs etc is extraordinary in contrast with the sterility of many
closely allied natural species when crossed but we shall hereafter
attempt to show that it is not so extraordinary as it at first appears
and it may be well here to recall to mind that the amount of external
difference between two species is not a safe guide for predicting
whether or not they will breed togethersome closely allied species
when crossed being utterly sterile and others which are extremely
unlike being moderately fertile i have said that no case of sterility
in crossed races rests on satisfactory evidence but here is one which
at first seems trustworthy mr youatt9 and a better authority cannot
be quoted states that formerly in lancashire crosses were frequently
made between longhorn and shorthorn cattle the first cross was
excellent but the produce was uncertain in the third or fourth
generation the cows were bad milkers in addition to which there was
much uncertainty whether the cows would conceive and full onethird of
the cows among some of these halfbreds failed to be in calf this at
first seems a good case but mr wilkinson states10 that a breed
derived from this same cross was actually established in another part
of england and if it had failed in fertility the fact would surely
have been noticed moreover supposing that mr youatt had proved his
case it might be argued that the sterility was wholly due to the two
parentbreeds being descended from primordially distinct species
in the case of plants grtner states that he fertilised thirteen heads
and subsequently nine others on a dwarf maize bearing yellow seed11
with pollen of a tall maize having red seed and one head alone
produced good seed but only five in number though these plants are
moncious and therefore do not require castration yet i should have
suspected some accident in the manipulation had not grtner expressly
stated that he had during many years grown these two varieties
together and they did not spontaneously cross and this considering
that the plants are monoecious and abound with pollen and are well
known generally to cross freely seems explicable only on the belief
that these two varieties are in some degree mutually infertile the
hybrid plants raised from the above five seeds were intermediate in
structure extremely variable and perfectly fertile12 in like
manner prof hildebrand13 could not succeed in fertilising the female
flowers of a plant bearing brown grains with pollen from a certain kind
bearing yellow grains although other flowers on the same plant which
were fertilised with their own pollen yielded good seed no one i
believe even suspects that these varieties of maize are distinct
species but had the hybrids been in the least sterile no doubt
grtner would at once have so classed them i may here remark that
with undoubted species there is not necessarily any close relation
between the sterility of a first cross and that of the hybrid
offspring some species can be crossed with facility but produce
utterly sterile hybrids others can be crossed with extreme difficulty
but the hybrids when produced are moderately fertile i am not aware
however of any instance quite like this of the maize namely of a
first cross made with difficulty but yielding perfectly fertile
hybrids14
the following case is much more remarkable and evidently perplexed
grtner whose strong wish it was to draw a broad line of distinction
between species and varieties in the genus verbascum he made during
eighteen years a vast number of experiments and crossed no less than
1085 flowers and counted their seeds many of these experiments
consisted in crossing white and yellow varieties of both v lychnitis
and v blattaria with nine other species and their hybrids that the
white and yellow flowered plants of these two species are really
varieties no one has doubted and grtner actually raised in the case
of both species one variety from the seed of the other now in two of
his works15 he distinctly asserts that crosses between
similarlycoloured flowers yield more seed than between
dissimilarlycoloured so that the yellowflowered variety of either
species and conversely with the whiteflowered variety when crossed
with pollen of its own kind yields more seed than when crossed with
that of the white variety and so it is when differently coloured
species are crossed the general results may be seen in the table at
the end of his volume in one instance he gives16 the following
details but i must premise that grtner to avoid exaggerating the
degree of sterility in his crosses always compares the maximum
number obtained from a cross with the average number naturally given
by the pure motherplant the white variety of v lychnitis
naturally fertilised by its own pollen gave from an average of
twelve capsules ninetysix good seeds in each whilst twenty flowers
fertilised with pollen from the yellow variety of this same species
gave as the maximum only eightynine good seeds so that we have the
proportion of 1000 to 908 according to grtners usual scale i should
have thought it possible that so small a difference in fertility might
have been accounted for by the evil effects of the necessary
castration but grtner shows that the white variety of v lychnitis
when fertilised first by the white variety of v blattaria and then
by the yellow variety of this species yielded seed in the proportion
of 622 to 438 and in both these cases castration was performed now
the sterility which results from the crossing of the differently
coloured varieties of the same species is fully as great as that which
occurs in many cases when distinct species are crossed unfortunately
grtner compared the results of the first unions alone and not the
sterility of the two sets of hybrids produced from the white variety of
v lychnitis when fertilised by the white and yellow varieties of v
blattaria for it is probable that they would have differed in this
respect
mr j scott has given me the results of a series of experiments on
verbascum made by him in the botanic gardens of edinburgh17 he
repeated some of grtners experiments on distinct species but
obtained only fluctuating results some confirmatory the greater
number contradictory nevertheless these seem hardly sufficient to
overthrow the conclusion arrived at by grtner from experiments tried
on a larger scale mr scott also experimented on the relative
fertility of unions between similarly and dissimilarlycoloured
varieties of the same species thus he fertilised six flowers of the
yellow variety of v lychnitis by its own pollen and obtained six
capsules and calling for the sake of comparison the average number
of good seed in each of their capsules one hundred he found that this
same yellow variety when fertilised by the white variety yielded from
seven capsules an average of ninetyfour seed on the same principle
the white variety of v lychnitis by its own pollen from six
capsules and by the pollen of the yellow variety eight capsules
yielded seed in the proportion of 100 to 82 the yellow variety of v
thapsus by its own pollen eight capsules and by that of the white
variety only two capsules yielded seed in the proportion of 100 to
94 lastly the white variety of v blattaria by its own pollen
eight capsules and by that of the yellow variety five capsules
yielded seed in the proportion of 100 to 79 so that in every case the
unions of similarlycoloured varieties of the same species were more
fertile than the unions of dissimilarlycoloured varieties when all
the cases are grouped together the difference of fertility is as 100
to 86 some additional trials were made and altogether thirtysix
similarlycoloured unions yielded thirtyfive good capsules whilst
thirtyfive dissimilarlycoloured unions yielded only twentysix good
capsules besides the foregoing experiments the purple v phniceum
was crossed by a rosecoloured and a white variety of the same species
these two varieties were also crossed together and these several
unions yielded less seed than v phniceum by its own pollen hence
it follows from mr scotts experiments that in the genus verbascum
the similarly and dissimilarlycoloured varieties of the same species
behave when crossed like closely allied but distinct species18
this remarkable fact of the sexual affinity of similarlycoloured
varieties as observed by grtner and mr scott may not be of very
rare occurrence for the subject has not been attended to by others
the following case is worth giving partly to show how difficult it is
to avoid error dr herbert19 has remarked that variouslycoloured
double varieties of the hollyhock althea rosea may be raised with
certainty by seed from plants growing close together i have been
informed that nurserymen who raise seed for sale do not separate their
plants accordingly i procured seed of eighteen named varieties of
these eleven varieties produced sixtytwo plants all perfectly true to
their kind and seven produced fortynine plants half of which were
true and half false mr masters of canterbury has given me a more
striking case he saved seed from a great bed of twentyfour named
varieties planted in closely adjoining rows and each variety
reproduced itself truly with only sometimes a shade of difference in
tint now in the hollyhock the pollen which is abundant is matured
and nearly all shed before the stigma of the same flower is ready to
receive it20 and as bees covered with pollen incessantly fly from
plant to plant it would appear that adjoining varieties could not
escape being crossed as however this does not occur it appeared to
me probable that the pollen of each variety was prepotent on its own
stigma over that of all other varieties but i have no evidence on this
point mr c turner of slough well known for his success in the
cultivation of this plant informs me that it is the doubleness of the
flowers which prevents the bees gaining access to the pollen and
stigma and he finds that it is difficult even to cross them
artificially whether this explanation will fully account for varieties
in close proximity propagating themselves so truly by seed i do not
know
the following cases are worth giving as they relate to monoecious
forms which do not require and consequently cannot have been injured
by castration girou de buzareingues crossed what he designates three
varieties of gourd21 and asserts that their mutual fertilisation is
less easy in proportion to the difference which they present i am
aware how imperfectly the forms in this group were until recently
known but sageret22 who ranked them according to their mutual
fertility considers the three forms above alluded to as varieties as
does a far higher authority namely m naudin23 sageret24 has
observed that certain melons have a greater tendency whatever the
cause may be to keep true than others and m naudin who has had such
immense experience in this group informs me that he believes that
certain varieties intercross more readily than others of the same
species but he has not proved the truth of this conclusion the
frequent abortion of the pollen near paris being one great difficulty
nevertheless he has grown close together during seven years certain
forms of citrullus which as they could be artificially crossed with
perfect facility and produced fertile offspring are ranked as
varieties but these forms when not artificially crossed kept true
many other varieties on the other hand in the same group cross with
such facility as m naudin repeatedly insists that without being
grown far apart they cannot be kept in the least true
another case though somewhat different may be here given as it is
highly remarkable and is established on excellent evidence kolreuter
minutely describes five varieties of the common tobacco25 which were
reciprocally crossed and the offspring were intermediate in character
and as fertile as their parents from this fact kolreuter inferred that
they are really varieties and no one as far as i can discover seems
to have doubted that such is the case he also crossed reciprocally
these five varieties with n glutinosa and they yielded very sterile
hybrids but those raised from the var perennis whether used as the
father or mother plant were not so sterile as the hybrids from the
four other varieties26 so that the sexual capacity of this one
variety has certainly been in some degree modified so as to approach
in nature that of n glutinosa27
these facts with respect to plants show that in some few cases certain
varieties have had their sexual powers so far modified that they cross
together less readily and yield less seed than other varieties of the
same species we shall presently see that the sexual functions of most
animals and plants are eminently liable to be affected by the
conditions of life to which they are exposed and hereafter we shall
briefly discuss the conjoint bearing of this fact and others on the
difference in fertility between crossed varieties and crossed species
      domestication eliminates the tendency to sterility which is
      general with species when crossed
this hypothesis was first propounded by pallas28 and has been
adopted by several authors i can find hardly any direct facts in its
support but unfortunately no one has compared in the case of either
animals or plants the fertility of anciently domesticated varieties
when crossed with a distinct species with that of the wild
parentspecies when similarly crossed no one has compared for
instance the fertility of gallus bankiva and of the domesticated
fowl when crossed with a distinct species of gallus or phasianus and
the experiment would in all cases be surrounded by many difficulties
dureau de la malle who has so closely studied classical literature
states29 that in the time of the romans the common mule was produced
with more difficulty than at the present day but whether this
statement may be trusted i know not a much more important though
somewhat different case is given by m groenland30 namely that
plants known from their intermediate character and sterility to be
hybrids between gilops and wheat have perpetuated themselves under
culture since 1857 with a rapid but varying increase of fertility in
each generation in the fourth generation the plants still retaining
their intermediate character had become as fertile as common
cultivated wheat
the indirect evidence in favour of the pallasian doctrine appears to me
to be extremely strong in the earlier chapters i have shown that our
various breeds of the dog are descended from several wild species and
this probably is the case with sheep there can be no doubt that the
zebu or humped indian ox belongs to a distinct species from european
cattle the latter moreover are descended from two forms which may
be called either species or races we have good evidence that our
domesticated pigs belong to at least two specific types s scrofa
and  indicus now a widely extended analogy leads to the belief that
if these several allied species when first reclaimed had been
crossed they would have exhibited both in their first unions and in
their hybrid offspring some degree of sterility nevertheless the
several domesticated races descended from them are now all as far as
can be ascertained perfectly fertile together if this reasoning be
trustworthy and it is apparently sound we must admit the pallasian
doctrine that longcontinued domestication tends to eliminate that
sterility which is natural to species when crossed in their aboriginal
state
      on increased fertility from domestication and cultivation
increased fertility from domestication without any reference to
crossing may be here briefly considered this subject bears indirectly
on two or three points connected with the modification of organic
beings as buffon long ago remarked31 domestic animals breed oftener
in the year and produce more young at a birth than wild animals of the
same species they also sometimes breed at an earlier age the case
would hardly have deserved further notice had not some authors lately
attempted to show that fertility increases and decreases in an inverse
ratio with the amount of food this strange doctrine has apparently
arisen from individual animals when supplied with an inordinate
quantity of food and from plants of many kinds when grown on
excessively rich soil as on a dunghill becoming sterile but to this
latter point i shall have occasion presently to return with hardly an
exception our domesticated animals which have been long habituated to
a regular and copious supply of food without the labour of searching
for it are more fertile than the corresponding wild animals it is
notorious how frequently cats and dogs breed and how many young they
produce at a birth the wild rabbit is said generally to breed four
times yearly and to produce each time at most six young the tame
rabbit breeds six or seven times yearly producing each time from four
to eleven young and mr harrison weir tells me of a case of eighteen
young having been produced at a birth all of which survived the
ferret though generally so closely confined is more prolific than its
supposed wild prototype the wild sow is remarkably prolific she often
breeds twice in the year and bears from four to eight and sometimes
even twelve young but the domestic sow regularly breeds twice a year
and would breed oftener if permitted and a sow that produces less than
eight at a birth is worth little and the sooner she is fattened for
the butcher the better the amount of food affects the fertility of
the same individual thus sheep which on mountains never produce more
than one lamb at a birth when brought down to lowland pastures
frequently bear twins this difference apparently is not due to the
cold of the higher land for sheep and other domestic animals are said
to be extremely prolific in lapland hard living also retards the
period at which animals conceive for it has been found disadvantageous
in the northern islands of scotland to allow cows to bear calves before
they are four years old32
birds offer still better evidence of increased fertility from
domestication the hen of the wild  gallus bankiva lays from six to
ten eggs a number which would be thought nothing of with the domestic
hen the wild duck lays from five to ten eggs the tame one in the
course of the year from eighty to one hundred the wild greylag goose
lays from five to eight eggs the tame from thirteen to eighteen and
she lays a second time as mr dixon has remarked highfeeding care
and moderate warmth induce a habit of prolificacy which becomes in some
measure hereditary whether the semidomesticated dovecote pigeon is
more fertile than the wild rockpigeon c livia i know not but the
more thoroughly domesticated breeds are nearly twice as fertile as
dovecotes the latter however when caged and highly fed become
equally fertile with house pigeons i hear from judge caton that the
wild turkey in the united states does not breed when a year old as the
domesticated turkeys there invariably do the peahen alone of
domesticated birds is rather more fertile according to some accounts
when wild in its native indian home than in europe when exposed to our
much colder climate33
with respect to plants no one would expect wheat to tiller more and
each ear to produce more grain in poor than in rich soil or to get in
poor soil a heavy crop of peas or beans seeds vary so much in number
that it is difficult to estimate them but on comparing beds of carrots
in a nursery garden with wild plants the former seemed to produce
about twice as much seed cultivated cabbages yielded thrice as many
pods by measure as wild cabbages from the rocks of south wales the
excess of berries produced by the cultivated asparagus in comparison
with the wild plant is enormous no doubt many highly cultivated
plants such as pears pineapples bananas sugarcane etc are
nearly or quite sterile and i am inclined to attribute this sterility
to excess of food and to other unnatural conditions but to this
subject i shall recur
in some cases as with the pig rabbit etc and with those plants
which are valued for their seed the direct selection of the more
fertile individuals has probably much increased their fertility and in
all cases this may have occurred indirectly from the better chance of
some of the numerous offspring from the more fertile individuals having
been preserved but with cats ferrets and dogs and with plants like
carrots cabbages and asparagus which are not valued for their
prolificacy selection can have played only a subordinate part and
their increased fertility must be attributed to the more favourable
conditions of life under which they have long existed

 mr scotts and grtners statements and to a certain limited extent
 they do so klreuter asserts from innumerable observations that
 insects incessantly carry pollen from one species and variety of
 verbascum to another and i can confirm this assertion yet he found
 that the white and yellow varieties of verbascum lychnitis often
 grew wild mingled together moreover he cultivated these two
 varieties in considerable numbers during four years in his garden and
 they kept true by seed but when he crossed them they produced
 flowers of an intermediate tint hence it might have been thought that
 both varieties must have a stronger elective affinity for the pollen
 of their own variety than for that of the other this elective
 affinity i may add of each species for its own pollen klreuter
 dritte forts s 39 and grtner bastarderz passim being a
 perfectly wellascertained power but the force of the foregoing facts
 is much lessened by grtners numerous experiments for differently
 from klreuter he never once got bastarderz s 307 an
 intermediate tint when he crossed the yellow and white flowered
 varieties of verbascum so that the fact of the white and yellow
 varieties keeping true to their colour by seed does not prove that
 they were not mutually fertilised by the pollen carried by insects
 from one to the other

 26 klreuter was so much struck with this fact that he suspected
 that a little pollen of n glutinosa in one of his experiments might
 have accidentally got mingled with that of var perennis and thus
 aided its fertilising power but we now know conclusively from grtner
 bastarderz s 34 43 that the pollen of two species never acts
 conjointly on a third species still less will the pollen of a
 distinct species mingled with a plants own pollen if the latter be
 present in sufficient quantity have any effect the sole effect of
 mingling two kinds of pollen is to produce in the same capsule seeds
 which yield plants some taking after the one and some after the other
 parent

 a purple and white primrose primula vulgaris when fertilised by
 pollen from the common primrose journal of proc of linn soc

 i raised a number of purpleflowered longstyled seedlings from seed

 sterile they were much more fertile with pollen taken from the common
 primrose than with their own pollen mr scott has likewise described
 a red equalstyled cowslip p veris ibid p 106 which was found
 by him to be highly sterile when crossed with the common cowslip but
 this was not the case with several equalstyled red seedlings raised
 by me from his plant this variety of the cowslip presents the
 remarkable peculiarity of combining male organs in every respect like
 those of the shortstyled form with female organs resembling in
 function and partly in structure those of the longstyled form so
 that we have the singular anomaly of the two forms combined in the
 same flower hence it is not surprising that these flowers should be
 spontaneously selffertile in a high degree

the gain in constitutional vigour derived from an occasional cross
between individuals of the same variety but belonging to distinct
families or between distinct varieties has not been so largely or so
frequently discussed as have the evil effects of too close
interbreeding but the former point is the more important of the two
inasmuch as the evidence is more decisive the evil results from close
interbreeding are difficult to detect for they accumulate slowly and
differ much in degree with different species whilst the good effects
which almost invariably follow a cross are from the first manifest it
should however be clearly understood that the advantage of close
interbreeding as far as the retention of character is concerned is
indisputable and often outweighs the evil of a slight loss of
constitutional vigour in relation to the subject of domestication the
whole question is of some importance as too close interbreeding
interferes with the improvement of old races it is important as
indirectly bearing on hybridism and possibly on the extinction of
species when any form has become so rare that only a few individuals
remain within a confined area it bears in an important manner on the
influence of free intercrossing in obliterating individual
differences and thus giving uniformity of character to the individuals
of the same race or species for if additional vigour and fertility be
thus gained the crossed offspring will multiply and prevail and the
ultimate result will be far greater than otherwise would have occurred
lastly the question is of high interest as bearing on mankind i
shall therefore discuss this subject at full length as the facts which
prove the evil effects of close interbreeding are more copious though
less decisive than those on the good effects of crossing i shall
under each group of beings begin with the former
there is no difficulty in defining what is meant by a cross but this
is by no means easy in regard to breeding in and in or too close
interbreeding because as we shall see different species of animals
are differently affected by the same degree of interbreeding the
pairing of a father and daughter or mother and son or brothers and
sisters if carried on during several generations is the closest
possible form of interbreeding but some good judges for instance sir
j sebright believe that the pairing of a brother and sister is much
closer than that of parents and children for when the father is
matched with his daughter he crosses as is said with only half his
own blood the consequences of close interbreeding carried on for too
long a time are as is generally believed loss of size
constitutional vigour and fertility sometimes accompanied by a
tendency to malformation manifest evil does not usually follow from
pairing the nearest relations for two three or even four generations
but several causes interfere with our detecting the evilsuch as the
deterioration being very gradual and the difficulty of distinguishing
between such direct evil and the inevitable augmentation of any morbid
tendencies which may be latent or apparent in the related parents on
the other hand the benefit from a cross even when there has not been
any very close interbreeding is almost invariably at once conspicuous
there is good reason to believe and this was the opinion of that most
experienced observer sir j sebright1 that the evil effects of close
interbreeding may be checked or quite prevented by the related
individuals being separated for a few generations and exposed to
different conditions of life this conclusion is now held by many
breeders for instance mr carr2 remarks it is a wellknown fact
that a change of soil and climate effects perhaps almost as great a
change in the constitution as would result from an infusion of fresh
blood i hope to show in a future work that consanguinity by itself
counts for nothing but acts solely from related organisms generally
having a similar constitution and having been exposed in most cases to
similar conditions
that any evil directly follows from the closest interbreeding has been
denied by many persons but rarely by any practical breeder and never
as far as i know by one who has largely bred animals which propagate
their kind quickly many physiologists attribute the evil exclusively
to the combination and consequent increase of morbid tendencies common
to both parents and that this is an active source of mischief there
can be no doubt it is unfortunately too notorious that men and various
domestic animals endowed with a wretched constitution and with a
strong hereditary disposition to disease if not actually ill are
fully capable of procreating their kind close interbreeding on the
other hand often induces sterility and this indicates something quite
distinct from the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both
parents the evidence immediately to be given convinces me that it is a
great law of nature that all organic beings profit from an occasional
cross with individuals not closely related to them in blood and that
on the other hand longcontinued close interbreeding is injurious
various general considerations have had much influence in leading me to
this conclusion but the reader will probably rely more on special
facts and opinions the authority of experienced observers even when
they do not advance the grounds of their belief is of some little
value now almost all men who have bred many kinds of animals and have
written on the subject such as sir j sebright andrew knight
etc3 have expressed the strongest conviction on the impossibility
of longcontinued close interbreeding those who have compiled works on
agriculture and have associated much with breeders such as the
sagacious youatt low etc have strongly declared their opinion to
the same effect prosper lucas trusting largely to french authorities
has come to a similar conclusion the distinguished german
agriculturist hermann von nathusius who has written the most able
treatise on this subject which i have met with concurs and as i shall
have to quote from this treatise i may state that nathusius is not
only intimately acquainted with works on agriculture in all languages
and knows the pedigrees of our british breeds better than most
englishmen but has imported many of our improved animals and is
himself an experienced breeder
evidence of the evil effects of close interbreeding can most readily be
acquired in the case of animals such as fowls pigeons etc which
propagate quickly and from being kept in the same place are exposed
to the same conditions now i have inquired of very many breeders of
these birds and i have hitherto not met with a single man who was not
thoroughly convinced that an occasional cross with another strain of
the same subvariety was absolutely necessary most breeders of highly
improved or fancy birds value their own strain and are most unwilling
at the risk in their opinion of deterioration to make a cross the
purchase of a firstrate bird of another strain is expensive and
exchanges are troublesome yet all breeders as far as i can hear
excepting those who keep large stocks at different places for the sake
of crossing are driven after a time to take this step
another general consideration which has had great influence on my mind
is that with all hermaphrodite animals and plants which it might have
been thought would have perpetually fertilised themselves and been thus
subjected for long ages to the closest interbreeding there is not a
single species as far as i can discover in which the structure
ensures selffertilisation on the contrary there are in a multitude
of cases as briefly stated in the fifteenth chapter manifest
adaptations which favour or inevitably lead to an occasional cross
between one hermaphrodite and another of the same species and these
adaptive structures are utterly purposeless as far as we can see for
any other end
with cattle there can be no doubt that extremely close interbreeding
may be long carried on advantageously with respect to external
characters and with no manifest evil as far as constitution is
concerned the case of bakewells longhorns which were closely
interbred for a long period has often been quoted yet youatt says4
the breed had acquired a delicacy of constitution inconsistent with
common management and the propagation of the species was not always
certain but the shorthorns offer the most striking case of close
interbreeding for instance the famous bull favourite who was himself
the offspring of a halfbrother and sister from foljambe was matched
with his own daughter granddaughter and greatgranddaughter so that
the produce of this last union or the greatgreatgranddaughter had
1516ths or 9375 per cent of the blood of favourite in her veins
this cow was matched with the bull wellington having 625 per cent of
favourite blood in his veins and produced clarissa clarissa was
matched with the bull lancaster having 6875 of the same blood and
she yielded valuable offspring5 nevertheless collings who reared
these animals and was a strong advocate for close breeding once
crossed his stock with a galloway and the cows from this cross
realised the highest prices batess herd was esteemed the most
celebrated in the world for thirteen years he bred most closely in and
in but during the next seventeen years though he had the most exalted
notion of the value of his own stock he thrice infused fresh blood
into his herd it is said that he did this not to improve the form of
his animals but on account of their lessened fertility mr batess
own view as given by a celebrated breeder6 was that to breed
inandin from a bad stock was ruin and devastation yet that the
practice may be safely followed within certain limits when the parents
so related are descended from firstrate animals we thus see that
there has been much close interbreeding with shorthorns but nathusius
after the most careful study of their pedigrees says that he can find
no instance of a breeder who has strictly followed this practice during
his whole life from this study and his own experience he concludes
that close interbreeding is necessary to ennoble the stock but that in
effecting this the greatest care is necessary on account of the
tendency to infertility and weakness it may be added that another
high authority7 asserts that many more calves are born cripples from
shorthorns than from other and less closely interbred races of cattle
although by carefully selecting the best animals as nature effectually
does by the law of battle close interbreeding may be long carried on
with cattle yet the good effects of a cross between almost any two
breeds is at once shown by the greater size and vigour of the
offspring as mr spooner writes to me crossing distinct breeds
certainly improves cattle for the butcher such crossed animals are of
course of no value to the breeder but they have been raised during
many years in several parts of england to be slaughtered8 and their
merit is now so fully recognised that at fatcattle shows a separate
class has been formed for their reception the best fat ox at the great
show at islington in 1862 was a crossed animal
the halfwild cattle which have been kept in british parks probably
for 400 or 500 years or even for a longer period have been advanced
by culley and others as a case of longcontinued interbreeding within
the limits of the same herd without any consequent injury with respect
to the cattle at chillingham the late lord tankerville owned that they
were bad breeders9 the agent mr hardy estimates in a letter to
me dated may 1861 that in the herd of about fifty the average number
annually slaughtered killed by fighting and dying is about ten or
one in five as the herd is kept up to nearly the same average number
the annual rate of increase must be likewise about one in five the
bulls i may add engage in furious battles of which battles the
present lord tankerville has given me a graphic description so that
there will always be rigorous selection of the most vigorous males i
procured in 1855 from mr d gardner agent to the duke of hamilton
the following account of the wild cattle kept in the dukes park in
lanarkshire which is about 200 acres in extent the number of cattle
varies from sixtyfive to eighty and the number annually killed i
presume by all causes is from eight to ten so that the annual rate of
increase can hardly be more than one in six now in south america
where the herds are halfwild and therefore offer a nearly fair
standard of comparison according to azara the natural increase of the
cattle on an estancia is from onethird to onefourth of the total
number or one in between three and four and this no doubt applies
exclusively to adult animals fit for consumption hence the halfwild
british cattle which have long interbred within the limits of the same
herd are relatively far less fertile although in an unenclosed country
like paraguay there must be some crossing between the different herds
yet even there the inhabitants believe that the occasional introduction
of animals from distant localities is necessary to prevent
degeneration in size and diminution of fertility10 the decrease in
size from ancient times in the chillingham and hamilton cattle must
have been prodigious for professor rtimeyer has shown that they are
almost certainly the descendants of the gigantic bos primigenius no
doubt this decrease in size may be largely attributed to less
favourable conditions of life yet animals roaming over large parks
and fed during severe winters can hardly be considered as placed under
very unfavourable conditions
with sheep there has often been longcontinued interbreeding within
the limits of the same flock but whether the nearest relations have
been matched so frequently as in the case of shorthorn cattle i do not
know the messrs brown during fifty years have never infused fresh
blood into their excellent flock of leicesters since 1810 mr barford
has acted on the same principle with the foscote flock he asserts that
half a century of experience has convinced him that when two nearly
related animals are quite sound in constitution inandin breeding
does not induce degeneracy but he adds that he does not pride himself
on breeding from the nearest affinities in france the naz flock has
been bred for sixty years without the introduction of a single strange
ram11 nevertheless most great breeders of sheep have protested
against close interbreeding prolonged for too great a length of
time12 the most celebrated of recent breeders jonas webb kept five
separate families to work on thus retaining the requisite distance of
relationship between the sexes13 and what is probably of greater
importance the separate flocks will have been exposed to somewhat
different conditions
although by the aid of careful selection the near interbreeding of
sheep may be long continued without any manifest evil yet it has often
been the practice with farmers to cross distinct breeds to obtain
animals for the butcher which plainly shows that good of some kind is
derived from this practice we have excellent evidence on this head
from mr s druce14 who gives in detail the comparative numbers of
four pure breeds and of a crossbreed which can be supported on the
same ground and he gives their produce in fleece and carcase a high
authority mr pusey sums up the result in money value during an equal
length of time namely neglecting shillings for cotswolds 248l
for leicesters 223l for southdowns 204l for hampshire downs
264l and for the crossbred 293l a former celebrated breeder
lord somerville states that his halfbreeds from ryelands and spanish
sheep were larger animals than either the pure ryelands or pure spanish
sheep mr spooner concludes his excellent essay on crossing by
asserting that there is a pecuniary advantage in judicious
crossbreeding especially when the male is larger than the female15
as some of our british parks are ancient it occurred to me that there
must have been longcontinued close interbreeding with the fallowdeer
cervus dama kept in them but on inquiry i find that it is a common
practice to infuse new blood by procuring bucks from other parks mr
shirley16 who has carefully studied the management of deer admits
that in some parks there has been no admixture of foreign blood from a
time beyond the memory of man but he concludes that in the end the
constant breeding inandin is sure to tell to the disadvantage of the
whole herd though it may take a very long time to prove it moreover
when we find as is very constantly the case that the introduction of
fresh blood has been of the very greatest use to deer both by
improving their size and appearance and particularly by being of
service in removing the taint of rickback if not of other diseases
to which deer are sometimes subject when the blood has not been
changed there can i think be no doubt but that a judicious cross
with a good stock is of the greatest consequence and is indeed
essential sooner or later to the prosperity of every wellordered
park
mr meynells famous foxhounds have been adduced as showing that no
ill effects follow from close interbreeding and sir j sebright
ascertained from him that he frequently bred from father and daughter
mother and son and sometimes even from brothers and sisters with
greyhounds also there has been much close interbreeding but the best
breeders agree that it may be carried too far17 but sir j sebright
declares18 that by breeding inandin by which he means matching
brothers and sisters he has actually seen the offspring of strong
spaniels degenerate into weak and diminutive lapdogs the rev w d
fox has communicated to me the case of a small lot of bloodhounds long
kept in the same family which had become very bad breeders and nearly
all had a bony enlargement in the tail a single cross with a distinct
strain of bloodhounds restored their fertility and drove away the
tendency to malformation in the tail i have heard the particulars of
another case with bloodhounds in which the female had to be held to
the male considering how rapid is the natural increase of the dog it
is difficult to understand the large price of all highly improved
breeds which almost implies longcontinued close interbreeding except
on the belief that this process lessens fertility and increases
liability to distemper and other diseases a high authority mr
scrope attributes the rarity and deterioration in size of the scotch
deerhound the few individuals formerly existing throughout the country
being all related in large part to close interbreeding
with all highlybred animals there is more or less difficulty in
getting them to procreate quickly and all suffer much from delicacy of
constitution a great judge of rabbits19 says the longeared does
are often too highly bred or forced in their youth to be of much value
as breeders often turning out barren or bad mothers they often
desert their young so that it is necessary to have nurserabbits but
i do not pretend to attribute all these evil results to close
interbreeding20
with respect to pigs there is more unanimity amongst breeders on the
evil effects of close interbreeding than perhaps with any other large
animal mr druce a great and successful breeder of the improved
oxfordshires a crossed race writes without a change of boars of a
different tribe but of the same breed constitution cannot be
preserved mr fisher hobbs the raiser of the celebrated improved
essex breed divided his stock into three separate families by which
means he maintained the breed for more than twenty years by judicious
selection from the three distinct families21 lord western was the
first importer of a neapolitan boar and sow from this pair he bred
inandin until the breed was in danger of becoming extinct a sure
result as mr sidney remarks of inandin breeding lord western
then crossed his neapolitan pigs with the old essex and made the first
great step towards the improved essex breed here is a more interesting
case mr j wright well known as a breeder crossed22 the same boar
with the daughter granddaughter and greatgranddaughter and so on
for seven generations the result was that in many instances the
offspring failed to breed in others they produced few that lived and
of the latter many were idiotic without sense even to suck and when
attempting to move could not walk straight now it deserves especial
notice that the two last sows produced by this long course of
interbreeding were sent to other boars and they bore several litters
of healthy pigs the best sow in external appearance produced during
the whole seven generations was one in the last stage of descent but
the litter consisted of this one sow she would not breed to her sire
yet bred at the first trial to a stranger in blood so that in mr
wrights case longcontinued and extremely close interbreeding did not
affect the external form or merit of the young but with many of them
the general constitution and mental powers and especially the
reproductive functions were seriously affected
nathusius gives23 an analogous and even more striking case he
imported from england a pregnant sow of the large yorkshire breed and
bred the product closely inandin for three generations the result
was unfavourable as the young were weak in constitution with impaired
fertility one of the latest sows which he esteemed a good animal
produced when paired with her own uncle who was known to be
productive with sows of other breeds a litter of six and a second
time a litter of only five weak young pigs he then paired this sow
with a boar of a small black breed which he had likewise imported from
england this boar when matched with sows of his own breed produced
from seven to nine young now the sow of the large breed which was so
unproductive when paired with her own uncle yielded to the small black
boar in the first litter twentyone and in the second litter eighteen
young pigs so that in one year she produced thirtynine fine young
animals
as in the case of several other animals already mentioned even when no
injury is perceptible from moderately close interbreeding yet to
quote the words of mr coate who five times won the annual gold medal
of the smithfield club show for the best pen of pigs crosses answer
well for profit to the farmer as you get more constitution and quicker
growth but for me who sell a great number of pigs for breeding
purposes i find it will not do as it requires many years to get
anything like purity of blood again24
almost all the animals as yet mentioned are gregarious and the males
must frequently pair with their own daughters for they expel the young
males as well as all intruders until forced by old age and loss of
strength to yield to some stronger male it is therefore not improbable
that gregarious animals may have been rendered less susceptible than
nonsocial species to the evil consequences of close interbreeding so
that they may be enabled to live in herds without injury to their
offspring unfortunately we do not know whether an animal like the cat
which is not gregarious would suffer from close interbreeding in a
greater degree than our other domesticated animals but the pig is not
as far as i can discover strictly gregarious and we have seen that it
appears eminently liable to the evil effects of close interbreeding
mr huth in the case of the pig attributes chapter xxiv these
effects to their having been cultivated most for their fat or to the
selected individuals having had a weak constitution but we must
remember that it is great breeders who have brought forward the above
cases and who are far more familiar than ordinary men can be with the
causes which are likely to interfere with the fertility of their
animals
the effects of close interbreeding in the case of man is a difficult
subject on which i will say but little it has been discussed by
various authors under many points of view25 mr tylor26 has shown
that with widely different races in the most distant quarters of the
world marriages between relationseven between distant relationshave
been strictly prohibited there are however many exceptions to the
rule which are fully given by mr huth27 it is a curious problem
how these prohibitions arose during early and barbarous times mr
tylor is inclined to attribute them to the evil effects of
consanguineous marriages having been observed and he ingeniously
attempts to explain some apparent anomalies in the prohibition not
extending equally to the relations on the male and female side he
admits however that other causes such as the extension of friendly
alliances may have come into play mr w adam on the other hand
concludes that related marriages are prohibited and viewed with
repugnance from the confusion which would thus arise in the descent of
property and from other still more recondite reasons but i cannot
accept these views seeing that incest is held in abhorrence by savages
such as those of australia and south america28 who have no property
to bequeath or fine moral feelings to confuse and who are not likely
to reflect on distant evils to their progeny according to mr huth the
feeling is the indirect result of exogamy inasmuch as when this
practice ceased in any tribe and it became endogamous so that
marriages were strictly confined to the same tribe it is not unlikely
that a vestige of the former practice would still be retained so that
closelyrelated marriages would be prohibited with respect to exogamy
itself mr maclennan believes that it arose from a scarcity of women
owing to female infanticide aided perhaps by other causes
it has been clearly shown by mr huth that there is no instinctive
feeling in man against incest any more than in gregarious animals we
know also how readily any prejudice or feeling may rise to abhorrence
as shown by hindus in regard to objects causing defilement although
there seems to be no strong inherited feeling in mankind against
incest it seems possible that men during primeval times may have been
more excited by strange females than by those with whom they habitually
lived in the same manner as according to mr cupples29 male
deerhounds are inclined towards strange females while the females
prefer dogs with whom they have associated if any such feeling
formerly existed in man this would have led to a preference for
marriages beyond the nearest kin and might have been strengthened by
the offspring of such marriages surviving in greater numbers as
analogy would lead us to believe would have occurred
whether consanguineous marriages such as are permitted in civilised
nations and which would not be considered as close interbreeding in
the case of our domesticated animals cause any injury will never be
known with certainty until a census is taken with this object in view
my son george darwin has done what is possible at present by a
statistical investigation30 and he has come to the conclusion from
his own researches and those of dr mitchell that the evidence as to
any evil thus caused is conflicting but on the whole points to the
evil being very small
birdsin the case of the fowl a whole array of authorities could
be given against too close interbreeding sir j sebright positively
asserts that he made many trials and that his fowls when thus
treated became long in the legs small in the body and bad
breeders31 he produced the famous sebright bantams by complicated
crosses and by breeding inandin and since his time there has been
much close interbreeding with these animals and they are now
notoriously bad breeders i have seen silver bantams directly
descended from his stock which had become almost as barren as hybrids
for not a single chicken had been that year hatched from two full nests
of eggs mr hewitt says that with these bantams the sterility of the
male stands with rare exceptions in the closest relation with their
loss of certain secondary male characters he adds i have noticed as
a general rule that even the slightest deviation from feminine
character in the tail of the male sebrightsay the elongation by only
half an inch of the two principal tail feathersbrings with it improved
probability of increased fertility32
mr wright states33 that mr clark whose fightingcocks were so
notorious continued to breed from his own kind till they lost their
disposition to fight but stood to be cut up without making any
resistance and were so reduced in size as to be under those weights
required for the best prizes but on obtaining a cross from mr
leighton they again resumed their former courage and weight it
should be borne in mind that gamecocks before they fought were always
weighed so that nothing was left to the imagination about any
reduction or increase of weight mr clark does not seem to have bred
from brothers and sisters which is the most injurious kind of union
and he found after repeated trials that there was a greater reduction
in weight in the young from a father paired with his daughter than
from a mother with her son i may add that mr eyton of eyton the
wellknown ornithologist who is a large breeder of grey dorkings
informs me that they certainly diminish in size and become less
prolific unless a cross with another strain is occasionally obtained
so it is with malays according to mr hewitt as far as size is
concerned34
an experienced writer35 remarks that the same amateur as is well
known seldom long maintains the superiority of his birds and this he
adds undoubtedly is due to all his stock being of the same blood
hence it is indispensable that he should occasionally procure a bird of
another strain but this is not necessary with those who keep a stock
of fowls at different stations thus mr ballance who has bred malays
for thirty years and has won more prizes with these birds than any
other fancier in england says that breeding inandin does not
necessarily cause deterioration but all depends upon how this is
managed my plan has been to keep about five or six distinct runs and
to rear about two hundred or three hundred chickens each year and
select the best birds from each run for crossing i thus secure
sufficient crossing to prevent deterioration36
we thus see that there is almost complete unanimity with
poultrybreeders that when fowls are kept at the same place evil
quickly follows from interbreeding carried on to an extent which would
be disregarded in the case of most quadrupeds moreover it is a
generally received opinion that crossbred chickens are the hardiest
and most easily reared37 mr tegetmeier who has carefully attended
to poultry of all breeds says38 that dorking hens allowed to run
with houdan or crevecur cocks produce in the early spring chickens
that for size hardihood early maturity and fitness for the market
surpass those of any pure breed that we have ever raised mr hewitt
gives it as a general rule with fowls that crossing the breed
increases their size he makes this remark after stating that hybrids
from the pheasant and fowl are considerably larger than either
progenitor so again hybrids from the male golden pheasant and female
common pheasant are of far larger size than either parentbird39
to this subject of the increased size of hybrids i shall presently
return
with pigeons breeders are unanimous as previously stated that it
is absolutely indispensable notwithstanding the trouble and expense
thus caused occasionally to cross their muchprized birds with
individuals of another strain but belonging of course to the same
variety it deserves notice that when size is one of the desired
characters as with pouters40 the evil effects of close interbreeding
are much sooner perceived than when small birds such as shortfaced
tumblers are valued the extreme delicacy of the high fancy breeds
such as these tumblers and improved english carriers is remarkable
they are liable to many diseases and often die in the egg or during
the first moult and their eggs have generally to be hatched under
fostermothers although these highlyprized birds have invariably been
subjected to much close interbreeding yet their extreme delicacy of
constitution cannot perhaps be thus fully explained mr yarrell
informed me that sir j sebright continued closely interbreeding some
owlpigeons until from their extreme sterility he as nearly as
possible lost the whole family mr brent41 tried to raise a breed of
trumpeters by crossing a common pigeon and recrossing the daughter
granddaughter greatgranddaughter and greatgreatgranddaughter with
the same male trumpeter until he obtained a bird with 1516 of
trumpeters blood but then the experiment failed for breeding so
close stopped reproduction the experienced neumeister42 also
asserts that the offspring from dovecotes and various other breeds are
generally very fertile and hardy birds so again mm boitard and
corbi43 after fortyfive years experience recommend persons to
cross their breeds for amusement for if they fail to make interesting
birds they will succeed under an economical point of view as it is
found that mongrels are more fertile than pigeons of pure race
i will refer only to one other animal namely the hivebee because a
distinguished entomologist has advanced this as a case of inevitable
close interbreeding as the hive is tenanted by a single female it
might have been thought that her male and female offspring would always
have bred together more especially as bees of different hives are
hostile to each other a strange worker being almost always attacked
when trying to enter another hive but mr tegetmeier has shown44
that this instinct does not apply to drones which are permitted to
enter any hive so that there is no  priori improbability of a queen
receiving a foreign drone the fact of the union invariably and
necessarily taking place on the wing during the queens nuptial
flight seems to be a special provision against continued
interbreeding however this may be experience has shown since the
introduction of the yellowbanded ligurian race into germany and
england that bees freely cross mr woodbury who introduced ligurian
bees into devonshire found during a single season that three stocks
at distances of from one to two miles from his hives were crossed by
his drones in one case the ligurian drones must have flown over the
city of exeter and over several intermediate hives on another
occasion several common black queens were crossed by ligurian drones at
a distance of from one to three and a half miles45
      plants
when a single plant of a new species is introduced into any country if
propagated by seed many individuals will soon be raised so that if
the proper insects be present there will be crossing with
newlyintroduced trees or other plants not propagated by seed we are
not here concerned with oldestablished plants it is an almost
universal practice occasionally to make exchanges of seed by which
means individuals which have been exposed to different conditions of
lifeand this as we have seen with animals diminishes the evil from
close interbreedingwill occasionally be introduced into each
district
with respect to individuals belonging to the same subvariety grtner
whose accuracy and experience exceeded that of all other observers
states46 that he has many times observed good effects from this step
especially with exotic genera of which the fertility is somewhat
impaired such as passiflora lobelia fuchsia herbert also says47
i am inclined to think that i have derived advantage from impregnating
the flower from which i wished to obtain seed with pollen from another
individual of the same variety or at least from another flower rather
than with its own again professor lecoq ascertained that crossed
offspring are more vigorous and robust than their parents48
general statements of this kind however can seldom be fully trusted
i therefore began a long series of experiments continued for about ten
years which will i think conclusively show the good effects of
crossing two distinct plants of the same variety and the evil effects
of longcontinued selffertilisation a clear light will thus be thrown
on such questions as why flowers are almost invariably constructed so
as to permit or favour or necessitate the union of two individuals
we shall clearly understand why moncious and dioeciouswhy
dichogamous dimorphic and trimorphic plants exist and many other such
cases i intend soon to publish an account of these experiments and i
can here give only a few cases in illustration the plan which i
followed was to grow plants in the same pot or in pots of the same
size or close together in the open ground carefully to exclude
insects and then to fertilise some of the flowers with pollen from the
same flower and others on the same plant with pollen from a distinct
but adjoining plant in many of these experiments the crossed plants
yielded much more seed than the selffertilised plants and i have
never seen the reversed case the selffertilised and crossed seeds
thus obtained were allowed to germinate in the same glass vessel on
damp sand and as the seeds germinated they were planted in pairs on
opposite sides of the same pot with a superficial partition between
them and were placed so as to be equally exposed to the light in
other cases the selffertilised and crossed seeds were simply sown on
opposite sides of the same small pot i have in short followed
different plans but in every case have taken all the precautions which
i could think of so that the two lots should be equally favoured the
growth of the plants raised from the crossed and selffertilised seed
were carefully observed from their germination to maturity in species
belonging to fiftytwo genera and the difference in their growth and
in withstanding unfavourable conditions was in most cases manifest and
strongly marked it is of importance that the two lots of seed should
be sown or planted on opposite sides of the same pot so that the
seedlings may struggle against each other for if sown separately in
ample and good soil there is often but little difference in their
growth
i will briefly describe two of the first cases observed by me six
crossed and six selffertilised seeds of ipomoea purpurea from
plants treated in the manner above described were planted as soon as
they had germinated in pairs on opposite sides of two pots and rods
of equal thickness were given them to twine up five of the crossed
plants grew from the first more quickly than the opposed
selffertilised plants the sixth however was weakly and was for a
time beaten but at last its sounder constitution prevailed and it shot
ahead of its antagonist as soon as each crossed plant reached the top
of its sevenfoot rod its fellow was measured and the result was that
when the crossed plants were seven feet high the selffertilised had
attained the average height of only five feet four and a half inches
the crossed plants flowered a little before and more profusely than
the selffertilised plants on opposite sides of another  small pot a
large number of crossed and selffertilised seeds were sown so that
they had to struggle for bare existence a single rod was given to each
lot here again the crossed plants showed from the first their
advantage they never quite reached the summit of the sevenfoot rod
but relatively to the selffertilised plants their average height was
as seven feet to five feet two inches the experiment was repeated
during several succeeding generations treated in exactly the same
manner and with nearly the same result in the second generation the
crossed plants which were again crossed produced 121 seedcapsules
whilst the selffertilised again selffertilised produced only 84
capsules
some flowers of the mimulus luteus were fertilised with their own
pollen and others were crossed with pollen from distinct plants
growing in the same pot the seeds were thickly sown on opposite sides
of a pot the seedlings were at first equal in height but when the
young crossed plants were half an inch the selffertilised plants were
only a quarter of an inch high but this degree of inequality did not
last for when the crossed plants were four and a half inches high
the selffertilised were three inches and they retained the same
relative difference till their growth was complete the crossed plants
looked far more vigorous than the uncrossed and flowered before them
they produced also a far greater number of capsules as in the former
case the experiment was repeated during several succeeding
generations had i not watched these plants of mimulus and ipomoea
during their whole growth i could not have believed it possible that
a difference apparently so slight as that of the pollen being taken
from the same flower or from a distinct plant growing in the same pot
could have made so wonderful a difference in the growth and vigour of
the plants thus produced this under a physiological point of view is
a most remarkable phenomenon
with respect to the benefit derived from crossing distinct varieties
plenty of evidence has been published sageret49 repeatedly speaks in
strong terms of the vigour of melons raised by crossing different
varieties and adds that they are more easily fertilised than common
melons and produce numerous good seed here follows the evidence of an
english gardener50 i have this summer met with better success in my
cultivation of melons in an unprotected state from the seeds of
hybrids ie mongrels obtained by cross impregnation than with old
varieties the offspring of three different hybridisations one more
especially of which the parents were the two most dissimilar varieties
i could select each yielded more ample and finer produce than any one
of between twenty and thirty established varieties
andrew knight51 believed that his seedlings from crossed varieties of
the apple exhibited increased vigour and luxuriance and m
chevreul52 alludes to the extreme vigour of some of the crossed
fruittrees raised by sageret
by crossing reciprocally the tallest and shortest peas knight53
says i had in this experiment a striking instance of the stimulative
effects of crossing the breeds for the smallest variety whose height
rarely exceeded two feet was increased to six feet whilst the height
of the large and luxuriant kind was very little diminished mr laxton
gave me seedpeas produced from crosses between four distinct kinds
and the plants thus raised were extraordinarily vigorous being in each
case from one to two or three feet taller than the parentforms growing
close alongside them
wiegmann54 made many crosses between several varieties of cabbage
and he speaks with astonishment of the vigour and height of the
mongrels which excited the amazement of all the gardeners who beheld
them mr chaundy raised a great number of mongrels by planting
together six distinct varieties of cabbage these mongrels displayed an
infinite diversity of character but the most remarkable circumstance
was that while all the other cabbages and borecoles in the nursery
were destroyed by a severe winter these hybrids were little injured
and supplied the kitchen when there was no other cabbage to be had
mr maund exhibited before the royal agricultural society55 specimens
of crossed wheat together with their parent varieties and the editor
states that they were intermediate in character united with that
greater vigour of growth which it appears in the vegetable as in the
animal world is the result of a first cross knight also crossed
several varieties of wheat56 and he says that in the years 1795 and
1796 when almost the whole crop of corn in the island was blighted
the varieties thus obtained and these only escaped in this
neighbourhood though sown in several different soils and situations
here is a remarkable case m clotzsch57 crossed pinus sylvestris
and nigricans quercus robur and pedunculata alnus glutinosa and
incana ulmus campestris and  effusa and the crossfertilised
seeds as well as seeds of the pure parenttrees were all sown at the
same time and in the same place the result was that after an interval
of eight years the hybrids were onethird taller than the pure trees
the facts above given refer to undoubted varieties excepting the trees
crossed by clotzsch which are ranked by various botanists as
stronglymarked races subspecies or species that true hybrids
raised from entirely distinct species though they lose in fertility
often gain in size and constitutional vigour is certain it would be
superfluous to quote any facts for all experimenters kolreuter
grtner herbert sageret lecoq and naudin have been struck with the
wonderful vigour height size tenacity of life precocity and
hardiness of their hybrid productions grtner58 sums up his
conviction on this head in the strongest terms klreuter59 gives
numerous precise measurements of the weight and height of his hybrids
in his comparison with measurements of both parentforms and speaks
with astonishment of their statura portentosa their ambitus
vastissimus ac altitudo valde conspicua some exceptions to the rule
in the case of very sterile hybrids have however been noticed by
grtner and herbert but the most striking exceptions are given by max
wichura60 who found that hybrid willows were generally tender in
constitution dwarf and shortlived
kolreuter explains the vast increase in the size of the roots stems
etc of his hybrids as the result of a sort of compensation due to
their sterility in the same way as many emasculated animals are larger
than the perfect males this view seems at first sight extremely
probable and has been accepted by various authors61 but grtner62
has well remarked that there is much difficulty in fully admitting it
for with many hybrids there is no parallelism between the degree of
their sterility and their increased size and vigour the most striking
instances of luxuriant growth have been observed with hybrids which
were not sterile in any extreme degree in the genus mirabilis certain
hybrids are unusually fertile and their extraordinary luxuriance of
growth together with their enormous roots63 have been transmitted to
their progeny the result in all cases is probably in part due to the
saving of nutriment and vital force through the sexual organs acting
imperfectly or not at all but more especially to the general law of
good being derived from a cross for it deserves especial attention
that mongrel animals and plants which are so far from being sterile
that their fertility is often actually augmented have as previously
shown their size hardiness and constitutional vigour generally
increased it is not a little remarkable that an accession of vigour
and size should thus arise under the opposite contingencies of
increased and diminished fertility
it is a perfectly well ascertained fact64 that hybrids invariably
breed with either pure parent and not rarely with a distinct species
more readily than with one another herbert is inclined to explain even
this fact by the advantage derived from a cross but grtner more
justly accounts for it by the pollen of the hybrid and probably its
ovules being in some degree vitiated whereas the pollen and ovules of
both pure parents and of any third species are sound nevertheless
there are some wellascertained and remarkable facts which as we
shall presently see show that a cross by itself undoubtedly tends to
increase or reestablish the fertility of hybrids
the same law namely that the crossed offspring both of varieties and
species are larger than the parentforms holds good in the most
striking manner with hybrid animals as well as with mongrels mr
bartlett who has had such large experience says among all hybrids of
vertebrated animals there is a marked increase of size he then
enumerates many cases with mammals including monkeys and with various
families of birds65
      on certain hermaphrodite plants which either normally or
      abnormally require to be fertilised by pollen from a distinct
      individual or species
the facts now to be given differ from the foregoing as selfsterility
is not here the result of longcontinued close interbreeding these
facts are however connected with our present subject because a cross
with a distinct individual is shown to be either necessary or
advantageous dimorphic and trimorphic plants though they are
hermaphrodites must be reciprocally crossed one set of forms by the
other in order to be fully fertile and in some cases to be fertile in
any degree but i should not have noticed these plants had it not been
for the following cases given by dr hildebrand66
primula sinensis is a reciprocally dimorphic species dr hildebrand
fertilised twentyeight flowers of both forms each by pollen of the
other form and obtained the full number of capsules containing on an
average 427 seed per capsule here we have complete and normal
fertility he then fertilised fortytwo flowers of both forms with
pollen of the same form but taken from a distinct plant and all
produced capsules containing on an average only 196 seed lastly and
here we come to our more immediate point he fertilised fortyeight
flowers of both forms with pollen of the same form and taken from the
same flower and now he obtained only thirtytwo capsules and these
contained on an average 186 seed or one less per capsule than in the
former case so that with these illegitimate unions the act of
impregnation is less assured and the fertility slightly less when the
pollen and ovules belong to the same flower than when belonging to two
distinct individuals of the same form dr hildebrand has recently made
analogous experiments on the longstyled form of oxalis rosea with
the same result67
it has recently been discovered that certain plants whilst growing in
their native country under natural conditions cannot be fertilised
with pollen from the same plant they are sometimes so utterly
selfimpotent that though they can readily be fertilised by the
pollen of a distinct species or even distinct genus yet wonderful as
is the fact they never produce a single seed by their own pollen in
some cases moreover the plants own pollen and stigma mutually act on
each other in a deleterious manner most of the facts to be given
relate to orchids but i will commence with a plant belonging to a
widely different family
sixtythree flowers of corydalis cava borne on distinct plants were
fertilised by dr hildebrand68 with pollen from other plants of the
same species and fiftyeight capsules were obtained including on an
average 45 seed in each he then fertilised sixteen flowers produced
by the same raceme one with another but obtained only three capsules
one of which alone contained any good seeds namely two in number
lastly he fertilised twentyseven flowers each with its own pollen
he left also fiftyseven flowers to be spontaneously fertilised and
this would certainly have ensued if it had been possible for the
anthers not only touch the stigma but the pollentubes were seen by
dr hildebrand to penetrate it nevertheless these eightyfour flowers
did not produce a single seedcapsule this whole case is highly
instructive as it shows how widely different the action of the same
pollen is according as it is placed on the stigma of the same flower
or on that of another flower on the same raceme or on that of a
distinct plant
with exotic orchids several analogous cases have been observed chiefly
by mr john scott69 oncidium sphacelatum has effective pollen for
mr scott fertilised two distinct species with it the ovules are
likewise capable of impregnation for they were readily fertilised by
the pollen of o divaricatum nevertheless between one and two
hundred flowers fertilised by their own pollen did not produce a single
capsule though the stigmas were penetrated by the pollentubes mr
robertson munro of the royal botanic gardens of edinburgh also
informs me 1864 that a hundred and twenty flowers of this same
species were fertilised by him with their own pollen and did not
produce a capsule but eight flowers fertilised by the pollen of o
divaricatum produced four fine capsules again between two and three
hundred flowers of o divaricatum fertilised by their own pollen
did not set a capsule but twelve flowers fertilised by o flexuosum
produced eight fine capsules so that here we have three utterly
selfimpotent species with their male and female organs perfect as
shown by their mutual fertilisation in these cases fertilisation was
effected only by the aid of a distinct species but as we shall
presently see distinct plants raised from seed of oncidium
flexuosum and probably of the other species would have been
perfectly capable of fertilising each other for this is the natural
process again mr scott found that the pollen of a plant of o
microchilum was effective for with it he fertilised two distinct
species he found its ovules good for they could be fertilised by the
pollen of one of these species and by the pollen of a distinct plant
of o microchilum but they could not be fertilised by pollen of the
same plant though the pollentubes penetrated the stigma an analogous
case has been recorded by m rivire70 with two plants of o
cavendishianum which were both selfsterile but reciprocally
fertilised each other all these cases refer to the genus oncidium but
mr scott found that maxillaria atrorubens was totally
insusceptible of fertilisation with its own pollen but fertilised
and was fertilised by a widely distinct species viz m squalens
as these orchids had been grown under unnatural conditions in
hothouses i concluded that their selfsterility was due to this
cause but fritz mller informs me that at desterro in brazil he
fertilised above one hundred flowers of the abovementioned oncidium
flexuosum which is there endemic with its own pollen and with that
taken from distinct plants all the former were sterile whilst those
fertilised by pollen from any other plant of the same species were
fertile during the first three days there was no difference in the
action of the two kinds of pollen that placed on stigma of the same
plant separated in the usual manner into grains and emitted tubes
which penetrated the column and the stigmatic chamber shut itself but
only those flowers which had been fertilised by pollen taken from a
distinct plant produced seedcapsules on a subsequent occasion these
experiments were repeated on a large scale with the same result fritz
mller found that four other endemic species of oncidium were in like
manner utterly sterile with their own pollen but fertile with that
from any other plant some of them likewise produced seedcapsules when
impregnated with pollen of widely distinct genera such as cyrtopodium
and rodriguezia oncidium crispum however differs from the
foregoing species in varying much in its selfsterility some plants
producing fine pods with their own pollen others failing to do so in
two or three instances fritz mller observed that the pods produced by
pollen taken from a distinct flower on the same plant were larger than
those produced by the flowers own pollen in epidendrum
cinnabarinum an orchid belonging to another division of the family
fine pods were produced by the plants own pollen but they contained
by weight only about half as much seed as the capsules which had been
fertilised by pollen from a distinct plant and in one instance from a
distinct species moreover a very large proportion and in some cases
nearly all the seeds produced by the plants own pollen were destitute
of an embryo some selffertilised capsules of a maxillaria were in a
similar state
another observation made by fritz mller is highly remarkable namely
that with various orchids the plants own pollen not only fails to
impregnate the flower but acts on the stigma and is acted on in an
injurious or poisonous manner this is shown by the surface of the
stigma in contact with the pollen and by the pollen itself becoming in
from three to five days dark brown and then decaying the
discoloration and decay are not caused by parasitic cryptograms which
were observed by fritz mller in only a single instance these changes
are well shown by placing on the same stigma at the same time the
plants own pollen and that from a distinct plant of the same species
or of another species or even of another and widely remote genus
thus on the stigma of oncidium flexuosum the plants own pollen and
that from a distinct plant were placed side by side and in five days
time the latter was perfectly fresh whilst the plants own pollen was
brown on the other hand when the pollen of a distinct plant of the
oncidium flexuosum and of the  epidendrum zebra nov spec were
placed together on the same stigma they behaved in exactly the same
manner the grains separating emitting tubes and penetrating the
stigma so that the two pollenmasses after an interval of eleven
days could not be distinguished except by the difference of their
caudicles which of course undergo no change fritz mller has
moreover made a large number of crosses between orchids belonging to
distinct species and genera and he finds that in all cases when the
flowers are not fertilised their footstalks first begin to wither and
the withering slowly spreads upwards until the germens fall off after
an interval of one or two weeks and in one instance of between six and
seven weeks but even in this latter case and in most other cases the
pollen and stigma remained in appearance fresh occasionally however
the pollen becomes brownish generally on the external surface and not
in contact with the stigma as is invariably the case when the plants
own pollen is applied
fritz mller observed the poisonous action of the plants own pollen in
the abovementioned oncidium flexuosum o unicorne pubes  and
in two other unnamed species also in two species of rodriguezia in
two of notylia in one of burlingtonia and of a fourth genus in the
same group in all these cases except the last it was proved that the
flowers were as might have been expected fertile with pollen from a
distinct plant of the same species numerous flowers of one species of
notylia were fertilised with pollen from the same raceme in two days
time they all withered the germens began to shrink the pollenmasses
became dark brown and not one pollengrain emitted a tube so that in
this orchid the injurious action of the plants own pollen is more
rapid than with oncidium flexuosum eight other flowers on the same
raceme were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the same
species two of these were dissected and their stigmas were found to
be penetrated by numberless pollentubes and the germens of the other
six flowers became well developed on a subsequent occasion many other
flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and all fell off dead in
a few days whilst some flowers on the same raceme which had been left
simply unfertilised adhered and long remained fresh we have seen that
in crossunions between extremely distinct orchids the pollen long
remains undecayed but notylia behaved in this respect differently for
when its pollen was placed on the stigma of  oncidium flexuosum both
the stigma and pollen quickly became dark brown in the same manner as
if the plants own pollen had been applied
fritz mller suggests that as in all these cases the plants own
pollen is not only impotent thus effectually preventing
selffertilisation but likewise prevents as was ascertained in the
case of the notylia and oncidium flexuosum the action of
subsequently applied pollen from a distinct individual it would be an
advantage to the plant to have its own pollen rendered more and more
deleterious for the germens would thus quickly be killed and dropping
off there would be no further waste in nourishing a part which
ultimately could be of no avail
the same naturalist found in brazil three plants of a bignonia growing
near together he fertilised twentynine flowerets on one of them with
their own pollen and they did not set a single capsule thirty flowers
were then fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant one of the
three and they yielded only two capsules lastly five flowers were
fertilised with pollen from a fourth plant growing at a distance and
all five produced capsules fritz mller thinks that the three plants
which grew near one another were probably seedlings from the same
parent and that from being closely related they acted very feebly on
one another this view is extremely probable for he has since shown in
a remarkable paper71 that in the case of some brazilian species of
abutilon which are selfsterile and between which he raised some
complex hybrids that these if near relatives were much less fertile
inter se than when not closely related
we now come to cases closely analogous with those just given but
different in so far that only certain individuals of the species are
selfsterile this selfimpotence does not depend on the pollen or
ovules being in an unfit state for fertilisation for both have been
found effective in union with other plants of the same or of a distinct
species the fact of plants having acquired so peculiar a constitution
that they can be fertilised more readily by the pollen of a distinct
species than by their own is exactly the reverse of what occurs with
all ordinary species for in the latter the two sexual elements of the
same individual plant are of course capable of freely acting on each
other but are so constituted that they are more or less impotent when
brought into union with the sexual elements of a distinct species and
produce more or less sterile hybrids
grtner experimented on two plants of lobelia fulgens brought from
separate places and found72 that their pollen was good for he
fertilised with it l cardinalis and  syphilitica their ovules
were likewise good for they were fertilised by the pollen of these
same two species but these two plants of l fulgens could not be
fertilised by their own pollen as can generally be effected with
perfect ease with this species again the pollen of a plant of
verbascum nigrum grown in a pot was found by grtner73 capable of
fertilising v lychnitis and v austriacum the ovules could be
fertilised by the pollen of v thapsus but the flowers could not be
fertilised by their own pollen klreuter also74 gives the case of
three garden plants of verbascum phniceum which bore during two
years many flowers these he fertilised successfully with the pollen of
no less than four distinct species but they produced not a seed with
their own apparently good pollen subsequently these same plants and
others raised from seed assumed a strangely fluctuating condition
being temporarily sterile on the male or female side or on both sides
and sometimes fertile on both sides but two of the plants were
perfectly fertile throughout the summer
with reseda odorata i have found certain individuals quite sterile
with their own pollen and so it is with the indigenous reseda lutea
the selfsterile plants of both species were perfectly fertile when
crossed with pollen from any other individual of the same species
these observations will hereafter be published in another work in
which i shall also show that seeds sent to me by fritz mller produced
by plants of eschscholtzia californica which were quite selfsterile
in brazil yielded in this country plants which were only slightly
selfsterile
it appears75 that certain flowers on certain plants of lilium
candidum can be fertilised more freely by pollen from a distinct
individual than by their own so again with the varieties of the
potato tinzmann76 who made many trials with this plant says that
pollen from another variety sometimes exerts a powerful influence and
i have found sorts of potatoes which would not bear seed from
impregnation with the pollen of their own flowers would bear it when
impregnated with other pollen it does not however appear to have
been proved that the pollen which failed to act on the flowers own
stigma was in itself good
in the genus passiflora it has long been known that several species do
not produce fruit unless fertilised by pollen taken from distinct
species thus mr mowbray77 found that he could not get fruit from
p alata and racemosa except by reciprocally fertilising them with
each others pollen and similar facts have been observed in germany
and france78 i have received two accounts of p quadrangularis
never producing fruit from its own pollen but doing so freely when
fertilised in one case with the pollen of  p crulea and in another
case with that of p edulis but in three other cases this species
fruited freely when fertilised with its own pollen and the writer in
one case attributed the favourable result to the temperature of the
house having been raised from 5 to 10 fahr above the former
temperature after the flowers were fertilised79 with respect to p
laurifolia a cultivator of much experience has recently remarked80
that the flowers must be fertilised with the pollen of p crulea
or of some other common kind as their own pollen will not fertilise
them but the fullest details on this subject have been given by
messrs scott and robertson munro81 plants of  passiflora racemosa
crulea and alata flowered profusely during many years in the
botanic gardens of edinburgh and though repeatedly fertilised with
their own pollen never produced any seed yet this occurred at once
with all three species when they were crossed together in various ways
in the case of  p crulea three plants two of which grew in the
botanic gardens were all rendered fertile merely by impregnating each
with pollen of one of the others the same result was attained in the
same manner with p alata but with only one plant out of three as
so many selfsterile species of passiflora have been mentioned it
should be stated that the flowers of the annual p gracilis are
nearly as fertile with their own pollen as with that from a distinct
plant thus sixteen flowers spontaneously selffertilised produced
fruit each containing on an average 213 seed whilst fruit from
fourteen crossed flowers contained 241 seed
returning to p alata i have received 1866 some interesting
details from mr robertson munro three plants including one in
england have already been mentioned which were inveterately
selfsterile and mr munro informs me of several others which after
repeated trials during many years have been found in the same
predicament at some other places however this species fruits readily
when fertilised with its own pollen at taymouth castle there is a
plant which was formerly grafted by mr donaldson on a distinct
species name unknown and ever since the operation it has produced
fruit in abundance by its own pollen so that this small and unnatural
change in the state of this plant has restored its selffertility some
of the seedlings from the taymouth castle plant were found to be not
only sterile with their own pollen but with each others pollen and
with the pollen of distinct species pollen from the taymouth plant
failed to fertilise certain plants of the same species but was
successful on one plant in the edinburgh botanic gardens seedlings
were raised from this latter union and some of their flowers were
fertilised by mr munro with their own pollen but they were found to
be as selfimpotent as the motherplant had always proved except when
fertilised by the grafted taymouth plant and except as we shall see
when fertilised by her own seedlings for mr munro fertilised eighteen
flowers on the selfimpotent motherplant with pollen from these her
own selfimpotent seedlings and obtained remarkable as the fact is
eighteen fine capsules full of excellent seed i have met with no case
in regard to plants which shows so well as this of p alata on what
small and mysterious causes complete fertility or complete sterility
depends
the facts hitherto given relate to the muchlessened or completely
destroyed fertility of pure species when impregnated with their own
pollen in comparison with their fertility when impregnated by distinct
individuals or distinct species but closely analogous facts have been
observed with hybrids
herbert states82 that having in flower at the same time nine hybrid
hippeastrums of complicated origin descended from several species he
found that almost every flower touched with pollen from another cross
produced seed abundantly and those which were touched with their own
pollen either failed entirely or formed slowly a pod of inferior size
with fewer seeds in the horticultural journal he adds that the
admission of the pollen of another crossbred hippeastrum however
complicated the cross to any one flower of the number is almost sure
to check the fructification of the others in a letter written to me
in 1839 dr herbert says that he had already tried these experiments
during five consecutive years and he subsequently repeated them with
the same invariable result he was thus led to make an analogous trial
on a pure species namely on the hippeastrum aulicum which he had
lately imported from brazil this bulb produced four flowers three of
which were fertilised by their own pollen and the fourth by the pollen
of a triple cross between h bulbulosum regin and vittatum the
result was that the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to
grow and after a few days perished entirely whereas the pod
impregnated by the hybrid made vigorous and rapid progress to maturity
and bore good seed which vegetated freely this is indeed as
herbert remarks a strange truth but not so strange as it then
appeared
as a confirmation of these statements i may add that mr m mayes83
after much experience in crossing the species of amaryllis
hippeastrum says neither the species nor the hybrids will we are
well aware produce seed so abundantly from their own pollen as from
that of others so again mr bidwell in new south wales84 asserts
that amaryllis belladonna bears many more seeds when fertilised by
the pollen of  brunswigia amaryllis of some authors  josephin
or of b multiflora than when fertilised by its own pollen mr
beaton dusted four flowers of a cyrtanthus with their own pollen and
four with the pollen of vallota amaryllis purpurea on the seventh
day those which received their own pollen slackened their growth and
ultimately perished those which were crossed with the vallota held
on85 these latter cases however relate to uncrossed species like
those before given with respect to passiflora orchids etc and are
here referred to only because the plants belong to the same group of
amaryllidace
in the experiments on the hybrid hippeastrums if herbert had found
that the pollen of two or three kinds alone had been more efficient on
certain kinds than their own pollen it might have been argued that
these from their mixed parentage had a closer mutual affinity than
the others but this explanation is inadmissible for the trials were
made reciprocally backwards and forwards on nine different hybrids and
a cross whichever way taken always proved highly beneficial i can
add a striking and analogous case from experiments made by the rev a
rawson of bromley common with some complex hybrids of gladiolus this
skilful horticulturist possessed a number of french varieties
differing from each other only in the colour and size of the flowers
all descended from gandavensis a wellknown old hybrid said to be
descended from g natalensis by the pollen of  g
oppositiflorus86 mr rawson after repeated trials found that none
of the varieties would set seed with their own pollen although taken
from distinct plants of the same variety which had of course been
propagated by bulbs but that they all seeded freely with pollen from
any other variety to give two examples ophir did not produce a
capsule with its own pollen but when fertilised with that of janire
brenchleyensis vulcain and linn it produced ten fine capsules but
the pollen of ophir was good for when linn was fertilised by it seven
capsules were produced this latter variety on the other hand was
utterly barren with its own pollen which we have seen was perfectly
efficient on ophir altogether mr rawson in the year 1861 fertilised
twentysix flowers borne by four varieties with pollen taken from other
varieties and every single flower produced a fine seedcapsule
whereas fiftytwo flowers on the same plants fertilised at the same
time with their own pollen did not yield a single seedcapsule mr
rawson fertilised in some cases the alternate flowers and in other
cases all those down one side of the spike with pollen of other
varieties and the remaining flowers with their own pollen i saw these
plants when the capsules were nearly mature and their curious
arrangement at once brought full conviction to the mind that an immense
advantage had been derived from crossing these hybrids
lastly i have heard from dr e bornet of antibes who has made
numerous experiments in crossing the species of cistus but has not yet
published the results that when any of these hybrids are fertile
they may be said to be in regard to function dioecious for the
flowers are always sterile when the pistil is fertilised by pollen
taken from the same flower or from flowers on the same plant but they
are often fertile if pollen be employed from a distinct individual of
the same hybrid nature or from a hybrid made by a reciprocal cross
conclusionthat plants should be selfsterile although both sexual
elements are in a fit state for reproduction appears at first sight
opposed to all analogy with respect to the species all the
individuals of which are in this state although living under their
natural conditions we may conclude that their selfsterility has been
acquired for the sake of effectually preventing selffertilisation the
case is closely analogous with that of dimorphic and trimorphic or
heterostyled plants which can be fully fertilised only by plants
belonging to a different form and not as in the foregoing cases
indifferently by any other individual of the species some of these
heterostyled plants are completely sterile with pollen taken from the
same plant or from the same form with respect to species living under
their natural conditions of which only certain individuals are
selfsterile as with reseda lutea it is probable that these have
been rendered selfsterile to ensure occasional crossfertilisation
whilst other individuals have remained selffertile to ensure the
propagation of the species the case seems to be parallel with that of
plants which produce as hermann mller has discovered two formsone
bearing more conspicuous flowers with their structure adapted for
crossfertilisation by insects and the other form with less
conspicuous flowers adapted for selffertilisation the selfsterility
however of some of the foregoing plants is incidental on the
conditions to which they have been subjected as with the
eschscholtzia the verbascum phniceum the sterility of which varied
according to the season and with the passiflora alata which
recovered its selffertility when grafted on a different stock
it is interesting to observe in the above several cases the graduated
series from plants which when fertilised by their own pollen yield
the full number of seeds but with the seedlings a little dwarfed in
statureto plants which when selffertilised yield few seedsto those
which yield none but have their ovaria somewhat developedand lastly
to those in which the plants own pollen and stigma mutually act on one
another like poison it is also interesting to observe on how slight a
difference in the nature of the pollen or of the ovules complete
selfsterility or complete selffertility must depend in some of the
above cases every individual of the selfsterile species appears to be
capable of producing the full complement of seed when fertilised by the
pollen of any other individual though judging from the facts given
with respect to abutilon the nearest kin must be excepted but not one
individual can be fertilised by its own pollen as every organism
differs in some slight degree from every other individual of the same
species so no doubt it is with their pollen and ovules and in the
above cases we must believe that complete selfsterility and complete
selffertility depend on such slight differences in the ovules and
pollen and not their having been differentiated in some special manner
in relation to one another for it is impossible that the sexual
elements of many thousand individuals should have been specialised in
relation to every other individual in some however of the above
cases as with certain passifloras an amount of differentiation
between the pollen and ovules sufficient for fertilisation is gained
only by employing pollen from a distinct species but this is probably
the result of such plants having been rendered somewhat sterile from
the unnatural conditions to which they have been exposed
exotic animals confined in menageries are sometimes in nearly the same
state as the abovedescribed selfimpotent plants for as we shall see
in the following chapter certain monkeys the larger carnivora
several finches geese and pheasants cross together quite as freely
as or even more freely than the individuals of the same species breed
together cases will also be given of sexual incompatibility between
certain male and female domesticated animals which nevertheless are
fertile when matched with any other individual of the same kind
in the early part of this chapter it was shown that the crossing of
individuals belonging to distinct families of the same race or to
different races or species gives increased size and constitutional
vigour to the offspring and except in the case of crossed species
increased fertility the evidence rests on the universal testimony of
breeders for it should be observed that i am not here speaking of the
evil results of close interbreeding and is practically exemplified in
the higher value of crossbred animals for immediate consumption the
good results of crossing have also been demonstrated with some animals
and with numerous plants by actual weight and measurement although
animals of pure blood will obviously be deteriorated by crossing as
far as their characteristic qualities are concerned there seems to be
no exception to the rule that advantages of the kind just mentioned are
thus gained even when there has not been any previous close
interbreeding and the rule applies to such animals as cattle and
sheep which can long resist breeding inandin between the nearest
bloodrelations
in the case of crossed species although size vigour precocity and
hardiness are with rare exceptions gained fertility in a greater or
less degree is lost but the gain in the above respects can hardly be
attributed to the principle of compensation for there is no close
parallelism between the increased size and vigour of hybrid offspring
and their sterility moreover it has been clearly proved that mongrels
which are perfectly fertile gain these same advantages as well as
sterile hybrids
with the higher animals no special adaptations for ensuring occasional
crosses between distinct families seem to exist the eagerness of the
males leading to severe competition between them is sufficient for
even with gregarious animals the old and dominant males will be
dispossessed after a time and it would be a mere chance if a closely
related member of the same family were to be the victorious successor
the structure of many of the lower animals when they are
hermaphrodites is such as to prevent the ovules being fertilised by
the male element of the same individual so that the concourse of two
individuals is necessary in other cases the access of the male element
of a distinct individual is at least possible with plants which are
affixed to the ground and cannot wander from place to place like
animals the numerous adaptations for crossfertilisation are
wonderfully perfect as has been admitted by every one who has studied
the subject
the evil consequences of longcontinued close interbreeding are not so
easily recognised as the good effects from crossing for the
deterioration is gradual nevertheless it is the general opinion of
those who have had most experience especially with animals which
propagate quickly that evil does inevitably follow sooner or later
but at different rates with different animals no doubt a false belief
may like a superstition prevail widely yet it is difficult to
suppose that so many acute observers have all been deceived at the
expense of much cost and trouble a male animal may sometimes be paired
with his daughter granddaughter and so on even for seven
generations without any manifest bad result but the experiment has
never been tried of matching brothers and sisters which is considered
the closest form of interbreeding for an equal number of generations
there is good reason to believe that by keeping the members of the same
family in distinct bodies especially if exposed to somewhat different
conditions of life and by occasionally crossing these families the
evil results of interbreeding may be much diminished or quite
eliminated these results are loss of constitutional vigour size and
fertility but there is no necessary deterioration in the general form
of the body or in other good qualities we have seen that with pigs
firstrate animals have been produced after longcontinued close
interbreeding though they had become extremely infertile when paired
with their near relations the loss of fertility when it occurs seems
never to be absolute but only relative to animals of the same blood
so that this sterility is to a certain extent analogous with that of
selfimpotent plants which cannot be fertilised by their own pollen
but are perfectly fertile with pollen of any other individual of the
same species the fact of infertility of this peculiar nature being one
of the results of longcontinued interbreeding shows that
interbreeding does not act merely by combining and augmenting various
morbid tendencies common to both parents for animals with such
tendencies if not at the time actually ill can generally propagate
their kind although offspring descended from the nearest
bloodrelations are not necessarily deteriorated in structure yet some
authors believe that they are eminently liable to malformations and
this is not improbable as everything which lessens the vital powers
acts in this manner instances of this kind have been recorded in the
case of pigs bloodhounds and some other animals
finally when we consider the various facts now given which plainly
show that good follows from crossing and less plainly that evil
follows from close interbreeding and when we bear in mind that with
very many organisms elaborate provisions have been made for the
occasional union of distinct individuals the existence of a great law
of nature is almost proved namely that the crossing of animals and
plants which are not closely related to each other is highly beneficial
or even necessary and that interbreeding prolonged during many
generations is injurious

seedless fruit
on the good derived from slight changes in the conditions of lifein
considering whether any facts were known which might throw light on the
conclusion arrived at in the last chapter namely that benefits ensue
from crossing and that it is a law of nature that all organic beings
should occasionally cross it appeared to me probable that the good
derived from slight changes in the conditions of life from being an
analogous phenomenon might serve this purpose no two individuals and
still less no two varieties are absolutely alike in constitution and
structure and when the germ of one is fertilised by the male element
of another we may believe that it is acted on in a somewhat similar
manner as an individual when exposed to slightly changed conditions
now every one must have observed the remarkable influence on
convalescents of a change of residence and no medical man doubts the
truth of this fact small farmers who hold but little land are
convinced that their cattle derive great benefit from a change of
pasture in the case of plants the evidence is strong that a great
advantage is derived from exchanging seeds tubers bulbs and cuttings
from one soil or place to another as different as possible
the belief that plants are thus benefited whether or not well founded
has been firmly maintained from the time of columella who wrote
shortly after the christian era to the present day and it now
prevails in england france and germany1 a sagacious observer
bradley writing in 17242 says when we once become masters of a
good sort of seed we should at least put it into two or three hands
where the soils and situations are as different as possible and every
year the parties should change with one another by which means i find
the goodness of the seed will be maintained for several years for want
of this use many farmers have failed in their crops and been great
losers he then gives his own practical experience on this head a
modern writer3 asserts nothing can be more clearly established in
agriculture than that the continual growth of any one variety in the
same district makes it liable to deterioration either in quality or
quantity another writer states that he sowed close together in the
same field two lots of wheatseed the product of the same original
stock one of which had been grown on the same land and the other at a
distance and the difference in favour of the crop from the latter seed
was remarkable a gentleman in surrey who has long made it his business
to raise wheat to sell for seed and who has constantly realised in the
market higher prices than others assures me that he finds it
indispensable continually to change his seed and that for this purpose
he keeps two farms differing much in soil and elevation
with respect to the tubers of the potato i find that at the present
day the practice of exchanging sets is almost everywhere followed the
great growers of potatoes in lancashire formerly used to get tubers
from scotland but they found that a change from the mosslands and
vice versa was generally sufficient in former times in france the
crop of potatoes in the vosges had become reduced in the course of
fifty or sixty years in the proportion from 120150 to 3040 bushels
and the famous oberlin attributed the surprising good which he effected
in large part to changing the sets4
a wellknown practical gardener mr robson5 positively states that
he has himself witnessed decided advantage from obtaining bulbs of the
onion tubers of the potato and various seeds all of the same kind
from different soils and distant parts of england he further states
that with plants propagated by cuttings as with the pelargonium and
especially the dahlia manifest advantage is derived from getting
plants of the same variety which have been cultivated in another
place or where the extent of the place allows to take cuttings from
one description of soil to plant on another so as to afford the change
that seems so necessary to the wellbeing of the plants he maintains
that after a time an exchange of this nature is forced on the grower
whether he be prepared for it or not similar remarks have been made
by another excellent gardener mr fish namely that cuttings of the
same variety of calceolaria which he obtained from a neighbour
showed much greater vigour than some of his own that were treated in
exactly the same manner and he attributed this solely to his own
plants having become to a certain extent worn out or tired of their
quarters something of this kind apparently occurs in grafting and
budding fruittrees for according to mr abbey grafts or buds
generally take with greater facility on a distinct variety or even
species or on a stock previously grafted than on stocks raised from
seeds of the variety which is to be grafted and he believes this
cannot be altogether explained by the stocks in question being better
adapted to the soil and climate of the place it should however be
added that varieties grafted or budded on very distinct kinds though
they may take more readily and grow at first more vigorously than when
grafted on closely allied stocks afterwards often become unhealthy
i have studied m tessiers careful and elaborate experiments6 made
to disprove the common belief that good is derived from a change of
seed and he certainly shows that the same seed may with care be
cultivated on the same farm it is not stated whether on exactly the
same soil for ten consecutive years without loss another excellent
observer colonel le couteur7 has come to the same conclusion but
then he expressly adds if the same seed be used that which is grown
on land manured from the mixen one year becomes seed for land prepared
with lime and that again becomes seed for land dressed with ashes
then for land dressed with mixed manure and so on but this in effect
is a systematic exchange of seed within the limits of the same farm
on the whole the belief which has long been held by many cultivators
that good follows from exchanging seed tubers etc seems to be
fairly well founded it seems hardly credible that the advantage thus
derived can be due to the seeds especially if very small ones
obtaining in one soil some chemical element deficient in the other and
in sufficient quantity to influence the whole aftergrowth of the
plant as plants after once germinating are fixed to the same spot it
might have been anticipated that they would show the good effects of a
change more plainly than do animals which continually wander about and
this apparently is the case life depending on or consisting in an
incessant play of the most complex forces it would appear that their
action is in some way stimulated by slight changes in the circumstances
to which each organism is exposed all forces throughout nature as mr
herbert spencer8 remarks tend towards an equilibrium and for the
life of each organism it is necessary that this tendency should be
checked these views and the foregoing facts probably throw light on
the one hand on the good effects of crossing the breed for the germ
will be thus slightly modified or acted on by new forces and on the
other hand on the evil effects of close interbreeding prolonged during
many generations during which the germ will be acted on by a male
having almost identically the same constitution
      sterility from changed conditions of life
i will now attempt to show that animals and plants when removed from
their natural conditions are often rendered in some degree infertile
or completely barren and this occurs even when the conditions have not
been greatly changed this conclusion is not necessarily opposed to
that at which we have just arrived namely that lesser changes of
other kinds are advantageous to organic beings our present subject is
of some importance from having an intimate connection with the causes
of variability indirectly it perhaps bears on the sterility of species
when crossed for as on the one hand slight changes in the conditions
of life are favourable to plants and animals and the crossing of
varieties adds to the size vigour and fertility of their offspring
so on the other hand certain other changes in the conditions of life
cause sterility and as this likewise ensues from crossing
muchmodified forms or species we have a parallel and double series of
facts which apparently stand in close relation to each other
it is notorious that many animals though perfectly tamed refuse to
breed in captivity isidore geoffroy sthilaire9 consequently has
drawn a broad distinction between tamed animals which will not breed
under captivity and truly domesticated animals which breed
freelygenerally more freely as shown in the sixteenth chapter than
in a state of nature it is possible and generally easy to tame most
animals but experience has shown that it is difficult to get them to
breed regularly or even at all i shall discuss this subject in
detail but will give only those cases which seem most illustrative my
materials are derived from notices scattered through various works and
especially from a report kindly drawn up for me by the officers of the
zoological society of london which has especial value as it records
all the cases during nine years from 183846 in which the animals
were seen to couple but produced no offspring as well as the cases in
which they never as far as known coupled this ms report i have
corrected by the annual reports subsequently published up to the year
186510 many facts are given on the breeding of the animals in that
magnificent work gleanings from the menageries of knowsley hall by
dr gray i made also particular inquiries from the experienced
keeper of the birds in the old surrey zoological gardens i should
premise that a slight change in the treatment of animals sometimes
makes a great difference in their fertility and it is probable that
the results observed in different menageries would differ indeed some
animals in our zoological gardens have become more productive since the
year 1846 it is also manifest from f cuviers account of the jardin
des plantes11 that the animals formerly bred much less freely there
than with us for instance in the duck tribe which is highly
prolific only one species had at that period produced young
the most remarkable cases however are afforded by animals kept in
their native country which though perfectly tamed quite healthy and
allowed some freedom are absolutely incapable of breeding
rengger12 who in paraguay particularly attended to this subject
specifies six quadrupeds in this condition and he mentions two or
three others which most rarely breed mr bates in his admirable work
on the amazons strongly insists on similar cases13 and he remarks
that the fact of thoroughly tamed native mammals and birds not breeding
when kept by the indians cannot be wholly accounted for by their
negligence or indifference for the turkey and fowl are kept and bred
by various remote tribes in almost every part of the worldfor
instance in the interior of africa and in several of the polynesian
islandsthe natives are extremely fond of taming the indigenous
quadrupeds and birds but they rarely or never succeed in getting them
to breed
the most notorious case of an animal not breeding in captivity is that
of the elephant elephants are kept in large numbers in their native
indian home live to old age and are vigorous enough for the severest
labour yet with a very few exceptions they have never been known
even to couple though both males and females have their proper
periodical seasons if however we proceed a little eastward to ava
we hear from mr crawfurd14 that their breeding in the domestic
state or at least in the halfdomestic state in which the female
elephants are generally kept is of everyday occurrence and mr
crawfurd informs me that he believes that the difference must be
attributed solely to the females being allowed to roam the forest with
some degree of freedom the captive rhinoceros on the other hand
seems from bishop hebers account15 to breed in india far more
readily than the elephant four wild species of the horse genus have
bred in europe though here exposed to a great change in their natural
habits of life but the species have generally been crossed one with
another most of the members of the pig family breed readily in our
menageries even the red river hog potamochrus penicillatus from
the sweltering plains of west africa has bred twice in the zoological
gardens here also the peccary dicotyles torquatus has bred several
times but another species the d labiatus though rendered so tame
as to be halfdomesticated is said to breed so rarely in its native
country of paraguay that according to rengger16 the fact requires
confirmation mr bates remarks that the tapir though often kept tame
in amazonia by the indians never breeds
ruminants generally breed quite freely in england though brought from
widely different climates as may be seen in the annual reports of the
zoological gardens and in the gleanings from lord derbys menagerie
the carnivora with the exception of the plantigrade division breed
though with capricious exceptions about half as freely as ruminants
many species of felidae have bred in various menageries although
imported from diverse climates and closely confined mr bartlett the
present superintendent of the zoological gardens17 remarks that the
lion appears to breed more frequently and to bring forth more young at
a birth than any other species of the family he adds that the tiger
has rarely bred but there are several wellauthenticated instances of
the female tiger breeding with the lion strange as the fact may
appear many animals under confinement unite with distinct species and
produce hybrids quite as freely as or even more freely than with
their own species on inquiring from dr falconer and others it
appears that the tiger when confined in india does not breed though it
has been known to couple the chetah felis jubata has never been
known by mr bartlett to breed in england but it has bred at
frankfort nor does it breed in india where it is kept in large
numbers for hunting but no pains would be taken to make them breed as
only those animals which have hunted for themselves in a state of
nature are serviceable and worth training18 according to rengger
two species of wild cats in paraguay though thoroughly tamed have
never bred although so many of the felidae breed readily in the
zoological gardens yet conception by no means always follows union in
the nineyear report various species are specified which were observed
to couple seventythree times and no doubt this must have passed many
times unnoticed yet from the seventy three unions only fifteen births
ensued the carnivora in the zoological gardens were formerly less
freely exposed to the air and cold than at present and this change of
treatment as i was assured by the former superintendent mr miller
greatly increased their fertility mr bartlett and there cannot be a
more capable judge says it is remarkable that lions breed more
freely in travelling collections than in the zoological gardens
probably the constant excitement and irritation produced by moving from
place to place or change of air may have considerable influence in
the matter
many members of the dog family breed readily when confined the dhole
is one of the most untamable animals in india yet a pair kept there by
dr falconer produced young foxes on the other hand rarely breed
and i have never heard of such an occurrence with the european fox the
silver fox of north america canis argentatus however has bred
several times in the zoological gardens even the otter has bred there
every one knows how readily the semidomesticated ferret breeds though
shut up in miserably small cages but other species of viverra and
paradoxurus absolutely refuse to breed in the zoological gardens the
genetta has bred both here and in the jardin des plantes and produced
hybrids the herpestes fasciatus has likewise bred but i was
formerly assured that the h griseus though many were kept in the
gardens never bred
the plantigrade carnivora breed under confinement much less freely than
other carnivora although no reason can be assigned for this fact in
the nineyear report it is stated that the bears had been seen in the
zoological gardens to couple freely but previously to 1848 had most
rarely conceived in the reports published since this date three
species have produced young hybrids in one case and wonderful to
relate the white polar bear has produced young the badger meles
taxus has bred several times in the gardens but i have not heard of
this occurring elsewhere in england and the event must be very rare
for an instance in germany has been thought worth recording19 in
paraguay the native nasua though kept in pairs during many years and
perfectly tamed has never been known according to rengger to breed
or show any sexual passion nor as i hear from mr bates does this
animal or the cercoleptes breed in amazonia two other plantigrade
genera procyon and gulo though often kept tame in paraguay never
breed there in the zoological gardens species of nasua and procyon
have been seen to couple but they did not produce young
as domesticated rabbits guineapigs and white mice breed so
abundantly when closely confined under various climates it might have
been thought that most other members of the rodent order would have
bred in captivity but this is not the case it deserves notice as
showing how the capacity to breed sometimes goes by affinity that the
one native rodent of paraguay which there breeds freely and has
yielded successive generations is the cavia aperea and this animal
is so closely allied to the guineapig that it has been erroneously
thought to be the parent form20 in the zoological gardens some
rodents have coupled but have never produced young some have neither
coupled nor bred but a few have bred as the porcupine more than once
the barbary mouse lemming chinchilla and agouti dasyprocta aguti
several times this latter animal has also produced young in paraguay
though they were born dead and illformed but in amazonia according
to mr bates it never breeds though often kept tame about the houses
nor does the paca clogenys paca breed there the common hare when
confined has i believe never bred in europe though according to a
recent statement it has crossed with the rabbit21 i have never
heard of the dormouse breeding in confinement but squirrels offer a
more curious case with one exception no species has bred in the
zoological gardens yet as many as fourteen individuals of s
palmarum were kept together during several years the s cinera has
been seen to couple but it did not produce young nor has this
species when rendered extremely tame in its native country north
america been ever known to breed22 at lord derbys menagerie
squirrels of many kinds were kept in numbers but mr thompson the
superintendent told me that none had ever bred there or elsewhere as
far as he knew i have never heard of the english squirrel breeding in
confinement but the species which has bred more than once in the
zoological gardens is the one which perhaps might have been least
expected namely the flying squirrel sciuropterus volucella it
has also bred several times near birmingham but the female never
produced more than two young at a birth whereas in its native american
home she bears from three to six young23
monkeys in the nineyear report from the zoological gardens are
stated to unite most freely but during this period though many
individuals were kept there were only seven births i have heard of
only one american monkey the ouistiti breeding in europe24 a
macacus according to flourens bred in paris and more than one
species of this genus has produced young in london especially the
macacus rhesus which everywhere shows a special capacity to breed
under confinement hybrids have been produced both in paris and london
from this same genus the arabian baboon or  cynocephalus
hamadryas25 and a cercopithecus have bred in the zoological
gardens and the latter species at the duke of northumberlands
several members of the family of lemurs have produced hybrids in the
zoological gardens it is much more remarkable that monkeys very rarely
breed when confined in their native country thus the cay cebus
azar is frequently and completely tamed in paraguay but rengger26
says that it breeds so rarely that he never saw more than two females
which had produced young a similar observation has been made with
respect to the monkeys which are frequently tamed by the aborigines in
brazil27 in amazonia these animals are so often kept in a tame
state that mr bates in walking through the streets of para counted
thirteen species but as he asserts they have never been known to
breed in captivity28
      birds
birds offer in some respects better evidence than quadrupeds from
their breeding more rapidly and being kept in greater numbers29 we
have seen that carnivorous animals are more fertile under confinement
than most other mammals the reverse holds good with carnivorous birds
it is said30 that as many as eighteen species have been used in
europe for hawking and several others in persia and india31 they
have been kept in their native country in the finest condition and
have been flown during six eight or nine years32 yet there is no
record of their having ever produced young as these birds were
formerly caught whilst young at great expense being imported from
iceland norway and sweden there can be little doubt that if
possible they would have been propagated in the jardin des plantes
no bird of prey has been known to couple33 no hawk vulture or owl
has ever produced fertile eggs in the zoological gardens or in the old
surrey gardens with the exception in the former place on one
occasion of a condor and a kite milvus niger yet several species
namely the aquila fusca haliaetus leucocephalus falco tinnunculus
f subbuteo and buteo vulgaris have been seen to couple in the
zoological gardens mr morris34 mentions as a unique fact that a
kestrel falco tinnunculus bred in an aviary the one kind of owl
which has been known to couple in the zoological gardens was the eagle
owl bubo maximus and this species shows a special inclination to
breed in captivity for a pair at arundel castle kept more nearly in a
state of nature than ever fell to the lot of an animal deprived of its
liberty35 actually reared their young mr gurney has given another
instance of this same owl breeding in confinement and he records the
case of a second species of owl the strix passerina breeding in
captivity36
of the smaller graminivorous birds many kinds have been kept tame in
their native countries and have lived long yet as the highest
authority on cagebirds37 remarks their propagation is uncommonly
difficult the canarybird shows that there is no inherent difficulty
in these birds breeding freely in confinement and audubon says38
that the  fringilla spiza ciris of north america breeds as
perfectly as the canary the difficulty with the many finches which
have been kept in confinement is all the more remarkable as more than a
dozen species could be named which have yielded hybrids with the
canary but hardly any of these with the exception of the siskin
fringilla spinus have reproduced their own kind even the
bullfinch loxia pyrrhula has bred as frequently with the canary
though belonging to a distinct genus as with its own species39 with
respect to the skylark alauda arvensis i have heard of birds
living for seven years in an aviary which never produced young and a
great london birdfancier assured me that he had never known an
instance of their breeding nevertheless one case has been
recorded40 in the nineyear report from the zoological society
twentyfour insessorial species are enumerated which had not bred and
of these only four were known to have coupled
parrots are singularly longlived birds and humboldt mentions the
curious fact of a parrot in south america which spoke the language of
an extinct indian tribe so that this bird preserved the sole relic of
a lost language even in this country there is reason to believe41
that parrots have lived to the age of nearly one hundred years yet
they breed so rarely though many have been kept in europe that the
event has been thought worth recording in the gravest publications42
nevertheless when mr buxton turned out a large number of parrots in
norfolk three pairs bred and reared ten young birds in the course of
two seasons and this success may be attributed to their free life43
according to bechstein44 the african psittacus erithacus breeds
oftener than any other species in germany the p macoa occasionally
lays fertile eggs but rarely succeeds in hatching them this bird
however has the instinct of incubation sometimes so strongly
developed that it will hatch the eggs of fowls or pigeons in the
zoological gardens and in the old surrey gardens some few species have
coupled but with the exception of three species of parakeets none
have bred it is a much more remarkable fact that in guiana parrots of
two kinds as i am informed by sir r schomburgk are often taken from
the nests by the indians and reared in large numbers they are so tame
that they fly freely about the houses and come when called to be fed
like pigeons yet he has never heard of a single instance of their
breeding45 in jamaica a resident naturalist mr r hill46 says
no birds more readily submit to human dependence than the
parrottribe but no instance of a parrot breeding in this tame life
has been known yet mr hill specifies a number of other native birds
kept tame in the west indies which never breed in this state
the great pigeon family offers a striking contrast with the parrots in
the nineyear report thirteen species are recorded as having bred and
what is more noticeable only two were seen to couple without any
result since the above date every annual report gives many cases of
various pigeons breeding the two magnificent crowned pigeons goura
coronata and  victori produced hybrids nevertheless of the
former species more than a dozen birds were kept as i am informed by
mr crawfurd in a park at penang under a perfectly welladapted
climate but never once bred the columba migratoria in its native
country north america invariably lays two eggs but in lord derbys
menagerie never more than one the same fact has been observed with the
c leucocephala47
gallinaceous birds of many genera likewise show an eminent capacity for
breeding under captivity this is particularly the case with pheasants
yet our english species seldom lays more than ten eggs in confinement
whilst from eighteen to twenty is the usual number in the wild
state48 with the gallinace as with all other orders there are
marked and inexplicable exceptions in regard to the fertility of
certain species and genera under confinement although many trials have
been made with the common partridge it has rarely bred even when
reared in large aviaries and the hen will never hatch her own
eggs49 the american tribe of guans or cracid are tamed with
remarkable ease but are very shy breeders in this country50 but
with care various species were formerly made to breed rather freely in
holland51 birds of this tribe are often kept in a perfectly tamed
condition in their native country by the indians but they never
breed52 it might have been expected that grouse from their habits of
life would not have bred in captivity more especially as they are said
soon to languish and die53 but many cases are recorded of their
breeding the capercailzie tetrao urogallus has bred in the
zoological gardens it breeds without much difficulty when confined in
norway and in russia five successive generations have been reared
tetrao tetrix has likewise bred in norway  t scoticus in ireland
t umbellus at lord derbys and t cupido in north america
it is scarcely possible to imagine a greater change in habits than that
which the members of the ostrich family must suffer when cooped up in
small enclosures under a temperate climate after freely roaming over
desert and tropical plains or entangled forests yet almost all the
kinds have frequently produced young in the various european
menageries even the mooruk casuarius bennetii from new ireland
the african ostrich though perfectly healthy and living long in the
south of france never lays more than from twelve to fifteen eggs
though in its native country it lays from twentyfive to thirty54
here we have another instance of fertility impaired but not lost
under confinement as with the flying squirrel the henpheasant and
two species of american pigeons
most waders can be tamed as the rev e s dixon informs me with
remarkable facility but several of them are shortlived under
confinement so that their sterility in this state is not surprising
the cranes breed more readily than other genera grus montigresia has
bred several times in paris and in the zoological gardens as has g
cinerea at the latter place and g antigone at calcutta of other
members of this great order tetrapteryx paradisea has bred at
knowsley a porphyrio in sicily and the gallinula chloropus in the
zoological gardens on the other hand several birds belonging to this
order will not breed in their native country jamaica and the psophia
though often kept by the indians of guiana about their houses is
seldom or never known to breed55
the members of the great duck family breed as readily in confinement as
do the columb and gallin and this considering their aquatic and
wandering habits and the nature of their food could not have been
anticipated even some time ago above two dozen species had bred in the
zoological gardens and m selyslongchamps has recorded the production
of hybrids from fortyfour different members of the family and to
these professor newton has added a few more cases56 there is not
says mr dixon57 in the wide world a goose which is not in the
strict sense of the word domesticable that is capable of breeding
under confinement but this statement is probably too bold the
capacity to breed sometimes varies in individuals of the same species
thus audubon58 kept for more than eight years some wild geese anser
canadensis but they would not mate whilst other individuals of the
same species produced young during the second year i know of but one
instance in the whole family of a species which absolutely refuses to
breed in captivity namely the dendrocygna viduata although
according to sir r schomburgk59 it is easily tamed and is
frequently kept by the indians of guiana lastly with respect to
gulls though many have been kept in the zoological gardens and in the
old surrey gardens no instance was known before the year 1848 of their
coupling or breeding but since that period the herring gull larus
argentatus has bred many times in the zoological gardens and at
knowsley
there is reason to believe that insects are affected by confinement
like the higher animals it is well known that the sphingidae rarely
breed when thus treated an entomologist60 in paris kept twentyfive
specimens of saturnia pyri but did not succeed in getting a single
fertile egg a number of females of orthosia munda and of mamestra
suasa reared in confinement were unattractive to the males61 mr
newport kept nearly a hundred individuals of two species of vanessa
but not one paired this however might have been due to their habit
of coupling on the wing62 mr atkinson could never succeed in india
in making the tarroo silkmoth breed in confinement63 it appears
that a number of moths especially the sphingidae when hatched in the
autumn out of their proper season are completely barren but this
latter case is still involved in some obscurity64
independently of the fact of many animals under confinement not
coupling or if they couple not producing young there is evidence of
another kind that their sexual functions are disturbed for many cases
have been recorded of the loss by male birds when confined of their
characteristic plumage thus the common linnet linota cannabina
when caged does not acquire the fine crimson colour on its breast and
one of the buntings emberiza passerina loses the black on its head
a pyrrhula and an oriolus have been observed to assume the quiet
plumage of the henbird and the falco albidus returned to the dress
of an earlier age65 mr thompson the superintendent of the knowsley
menagerie informed me that he had often observed analogous facts the
horns of a male deer cervus canadensis during the voyage from
america were badly developed but subsequently in paris perfect horns
were produced
when conception takes place under confinement the young are often born
dead or die soon or are illformed this frequently occurs in the
zoological gardens and according to rengger with native animals
confined in paraguay the mothers milk often fails we may also
attribute to the disturbance of the sexual functions the frequent
occurrence of that monstrous instinct which leads the mother to devour
her own offspringa mysterious case of perversion as it at first
appears
sufficient evidence has now been advanced to prove that animals when
first confined are eminently liable to suffer in their reproductive
systems we feel at first naturally inclined to attribute the result to
loss of health or at least to loss of vigour but this view can hardly
be admitted when we reflect how healthy longlived and vigorous many
animals are under captivity such as parrots and hawks when used for
hawking cheetahs when used for hunting and elephants the
reproductive organs themselves are not diseased and the diseases from
which animals in menageries usually perish are not those which in any
way affect their fertility no domestic animal is more subject to
disease than the sheep yet it is remarkably prolific the failure of
animals to breed under confinement has been sometimes attributed
exclusively to a failure in their sexual instincts this may
occasionally come into play but there is no obvious reason why this
instinct should be especially liable to be affected with perfectly
tamed animals except indeed indirectly through the reproductive
system itself being disturbed moreover numerous cases have been given
of various animals which couple freely under confinement but never
conceive or if they conceive and produce young these are fewer in
number than is natural to the species in the vegetable kingdom
instinct of course can play no part and we shall presently see that
plants when removed from their natural conditions are affected in
nearly the same manner as animals change of climate cannot be the
cause of the loss of fertility for whilst many animals imported into
europe from extremely different climates breed freely many others when
confined in their native land are completely sterile change of food
cannot be the chief cause for ostriches ducks and many other
animals which must have undergone a great change in this respect
breed freely carnivorous birds when confined are extremely sterile
whilst most carnivorous mammals except plantigrades are moderately
fertile nor can the amount of food be the cause for a sufficient
supply will certainly be given to valuable animals and there is no
reason to suppose that much more food would be given to them than to
our choice domestic productions which retain their full fertility
lastly we may infer from the case of the elephant cheetah various
hawks and of many animals which are allowed to lead an almost free
life in their native land that want of exercise is not the sole cause
it would appear that any change in the habits of life whatever these
habits may be if great enough tends to affect in an inexplicable
manner the powers of reproduction the result depends more on the
constitution of the species than on the nature of the change for
certain whole groups are affected more than others but exceptions
always occur for some species in the most fertile groups refuse to
breed and some in the most sterile groups breed freely those animals
which usually breed freely under confinement rarely breed as i was
assured in the zoological gardens within a year or two after their
first importation when an animal which is generally sterile under
confinement happens to breed the young apparently do not inherit this
power for had this been the case various quadrupeds and birds which
are valuable for exhibition would have become common dr broca even
affirms66 that many animals in the jardin des plantes after having
produced young for three or four successive generations become
sterile but this may be the result of too close interbreeding it is a
remarkable circumstance that many mammals and birds have produced
hybrids under confinement quite as readily as or even more readily
than they have procreated their own kind of this fact many instances
have been given67 and we are thus reminded of those plants which
when cultivated refuse to be fertilised by their own pollen but can
easily be fertilised by that of a distinct species finally we must
conclude limited as the conclusion is that changed conditions of life
have an especial power of acting injuriously on the reproductive
system the whole case is quite peculiar for these organs though not
diseased are thus rendered incapable of performing their proper
functions or perform them imperfectly
sterility of domesticated animals from changed conditionswith
respect to domesticated animals as their domestication mainly depends
on the accident of their breeding freely under captivity we ought not
to expect that their reproductive system would be affected by any
moderate degree of change those orders of quadrupeds and birds of
which the wild species breed most readily in our menageries have
afforded us the greatest number of domesticated productions savages in
most parts of the world are fond of taming animals68 and if any of
these regularly produced young and were at the same time useful they
would be at once domesticated if when their masters migrated into
other countries they were in addition found capable of withstanding
various climates they would be still more valuable and it appears
that the animals which breed readily in captivity can generally
withstand different climates some few domesticated animals such as
the reindeer and camel offer an exception to this rule many of our
domesticated animals can bear with undiminished fertility the most
unnatural conditions for instance rabbits guineapigs and ferrets
breed in miserably confined hutches few european dogs of any kind
withstand the climate of india without degenerating but as long as
they survive they retain as i hear from dr falconer their
fertility so it is according to dr daniell with english dogs taken
to sierra leone the fowl a native of the hot jungles of india
becomes more fertile than its parentstock in every quarter of the
world until we advance as far north as greenland and northern siberia
where this bird will not breed both fowls and pigeons which i
received during the autumn direct from sierra leone were at once ready
to couple69 i have also seen pigeons breeding as freely as the
common kinds within a year after their importation from the upper nile
the guinea fowl an aboriginal of the hot and dry deserts of africa
whilst living under our damp and cool climate produces a large supply
of eggs
nevertheless our domesticated animals under new conditions
occasionally show signs of lessened fertility roulin asserts that in
the hot valleys of the equatorial cordillera sheep are not fully
fecund70 and according to lord somerville71 the merinosheep which
he imported from spain were not at first perfectly fertile it is
said72 that mares brought up on dry food in the stable and turned
out to grass do not at first breed the peahen as we have seen is
said not to lay so many eggs in england as in india it was long before
the canarybird was fully fertile and even now firstrate breeding
birds are not common73 in the hot and dry province of delhi as i
hear from dr falconer the eggs of the turkey though placed under a
hen are extremely liable to fail according to roulin geese taken to
the lofty plateau of bogota at first laid seldom and then only a few
eggs of these scarcely a fourth were hatched and half the young birds
died in the second generation they were more fertile and when roulin
wrote they were becoming as fertile as our geese in europe with
respect to the valley of quito mr orton says74 the only geese in
the valley are a few imported from europe and these refuse to
propagate in the philippine archipelago the goose it is asserted
will not breed or even lay eggs75 a more curious case is that of the
fowl which according to roulin when first introduced would not breed
at cusco in bolivia but subsequently became quite fertile and the
english game fowl lately introduced had not as yet arrived at its
full fertility for to raise two or three chickens from a nest of eggs
was thought fortunate in europe close confinement has a marked effect
on the fertility of the fowl it has been found in france that with
fowls allowed considerable freedom only twenty per cent of the eggs
failed when allowed less freedom forty per cent failed and in close
confinement sixty out of the hundred were not hatched76 so we see
that unnatural and changed conditions of life produce some effect on
the fertility of our most thoroughly domesticated animals in the same
manner though in a far less degree as with captive wild animals
it is by no means rare to find certain males and females which will not
breed together though both are known to be perfectly fertile with
other males and females we have no reason to suppose that this is
caused by these animals having been subjected to any change in their
habits of life therefore such cases are hardly related to our present
subject the cause apparently lies in an innate sexual incompatibility
of the pair which are matched several instances have been communicated
to me by mr w c spooner well known for his essay on
crossbreeding by mr eyton of eyton by mr wicksted and other
breeders and especially by mr waring of chelsfield in relation to
horses cattle pigs foxhounds other dogs and pigeons77 in these
cases females which either previously or subsequently were proved to
be fertile failed to breed with certain males with whom it was
particularly desired to match them a change in the constitution of the
female may sometimes have occurred before she was put to the second
male but in other cases this explanation is hardly tenable for a
female known not to be barren has been unsuccessfully paired seven or
eight times with the same male likewise known to be perfectly fertile
with cartmares which sometimes will not breed with stallions of pure
blood but subsequently have bred with cartstallions mr spooner is
inclined to attribute the failure to the lesser sexual power of the
racehorse but i have heard from the greatest breeder of racehorses at
the present day through mr waring that it frequently occurs with a
mare to be put several times during one or two seasons to a particular
stallion of acknowledged power and yet prove barren the mare
afterwards breeding at once with some other horse these facts are
worth recording as they show like so many previous facts on what
slight constitutional differences the fertility of an animal often
depends
      sterility of plants from changed conditions of life and from
      other causes
in the vegetable kingdom cases of sterility frequently occur analogous
with those previously given in the animal kingdom but the subject is
obscured by several circumstances presently to be discussed namely
the contabescence of the anthers as grtner has named a certain
affectionmonstrositiesdoubleness of the flowermuchenlarged
fruitand longcontinued or excessive propagation by buds
it is notorious that many plants in our gardens and hothouses though
preserved in the most perfect health rarely or never produce seed i
do not allude to plants which run to leaves from being kept too damp
or too warm or too much manured for these do not flower and the case
may be wholly different nor do i allude to fruit not ripening from
want of heat or rotting from too much moisture but many exotic plants
with their ovules and pollen appearing perfectly sound will not set
any seed the sterility in many cases as i know from my own
observation is simply due to the absence of the proper insects for
carrying the pollen to the stigma but after excluding the several
cases just specified there are many plants in which the reproductive
system has been seriously affected by the altered conditions of life to
which they have been subjected
it would be tedious to enter on many details linnus long ago
observed78 that alpine plants although naturally loaded with seed
produce either few or none when cultivated in gardens but exceptions
often occur the draba sylvestris one of our most thoroughly alpine
plants multiplies itself by seed in mr h c watsons garden near
london and kerner who has particularly attended to the cultivation of
alpine plants found that various kinds when cultivated spontaneously
sowed themselves79 many plants which naturally grow in peatearth
are entirely sterile in our gardens i have noticed the same fact with
several liliaceous plants which nevertheless grew vigorously
too much manure renders some kinds utterly sterile as i have myself
observed the tendency to sterility from this cause runs in families
thus according to grtner80 it is hardly possible to give too much
manure to most gramine crucifer and leguminos whilst succulent
and bulbousrooted plants are easily affected extreme poverty of soil
is less apt to induce sterility but dwarfed plants of trifolium
minus and repens growing on a lawn often mown and never manured
were found by me not to produce any seed the temperature of the soil
and the season at which plants are watered often have a marked effect
on their fertility as was observed by klreuter in the case of
mirabilis81 mr scott in the botanic gardens of edinburgh observed
that oncidium divaricatum would not set seed when grown in a basket
in which it throve but was capable of fertilisation in a pot where it
was a little damper pelargonium fulgidum for many years after its
introduction seeded freely it then became sterile now it is
fertile82 if kept in a dry stove during the winter other varieties
of pelargonium are sterile and others fertile without our being able to
assign any cause very slight changes in the position of a plant
whether planted on a bank or at its base sometimes make all the
difference in its producing seed temperature apparently has a much
more powerful influence on the fertility of plants than on that of
animals nevertheless it is wonderful what changes some few plants will
withstand with undiminished fertility thus the zephyranthes candida
a native of the moderately warm banks of the plata sows itself in the
hot dry country near lima and in yorkshire resists the severest
frosts and i have seen seeds gathered from pods which had been covered
with snow during three weeks83 berberis wallichii from the hot
khasia range in india is uninjured by our sharpest frosts and ripens
its fruit under our cool summers nevertheless i presume we must
attribute to change of climate the sterility of many foreign plants
thus the persian and chinese lilacs syringa persica and
chinensis though perfectly hardy here never produce a seed the
common lilac s vulgaris seeds with us moderately well but in
parts of germany the capsules never contain seed84 some few of the
cases given in the last chapter of selfimpotent plants might have
been here introduced as their state seems due to the conditions to
which they have been subjected
the liability of plants to be affected in their fertility by slightly
changed conditions is the more remarkable as the pollen when once in
process of formation is not easily injured a plant may be
transplanted or a branch with flowerbuds be cut off and placed in
water and the pollen will be matured pollen also when once mature
may be kept for weeks or even months85 the female organs are more
sensitive for grtner86 found that dicotyledonous plants when
carefully removed so that they did not in the least flag could seldom
be fertilised this occurred even with potted plants if the roots had
grown out of the hole at the bottom in some few cases however as
with digitalis transplantation did not prevent fertilisation and
according to the testimony of mawz brassica rapa when pulled up by
its roots and placed in water ripened its seed flowerstems of
several monocotyledonous plants when cut off and placed in water
likewise produce seed but in these cases i presume that the flowers
had been already fertilised for herbert87 found with the crocus that
the plants might be removed or mutilated after the act of
fertilisation and would still perfect their seeds but that if
transplanted before being fertilised the application of pollen was
powerless
plants which have been long cultivated can generally endure with
undiminished fertility various and great changes but not in most cases
so great a change of climate as domesticated animals it is remarkable
that many plants under these circumstances are so much affected that
the proportion and the nature of their chemical ingredients are
modified yet their fertility is unimpaired thus as dr falconer
informs me there is a great difference in the character of the fibre
in hemp in the quantity of oil in the seed of the linum in the
proportion of narcotin to morphine in the poppy in gluten to starch in
wheat when these plants are cultivated on the plains and on the
mountains of india nevertheless they all remain fully fertile
contabescencegrtner has designated by this term a peculiar
condition of the anthers in certain plants in which they are
shrivelled or become brown and tough and contain no good pollen when
in this state they exactly resemble the anthers of the most sterile
hybrids grtner88 in his discussion on this subject has shown that
plants of many orders are occasionally thus affected but the
caryophyllace and liliace suffer most and to these orders i think
the ericace may be added contabescence varies in degree but on the
same plant all the flowers are generally affected to nearly the same
extent the anthers are affected at a very early period in the
flowerbud and remain in the same state with one recorded exception
during the life of the plant the affection cannot be cured by any
change of treatment and is propagated by layers cuttings etc and
perhaps even by seed in contabescent plants the female organs are
seldom affected or merely become precocious in their development the
cause of this affection is doubtful and is different in different
cases until i read grtners discussion i attributed it as apparently
did herbert to the unnatural treatment of the plants but its
permanence under changed conditions and the female organs not being
affected seem incompatible with this view the fact of several endemic
plants becoming contabescent in our gardens seems at first sight
equally incompatible with this view but klreuter believes that this
is the result of their transplantation the contabescent plants of
dianthus and verbascum found wild by wiegmann grew on a dry and
sterile bank the fact that exotic plants are eminently liable to this
affection also seems to show that it is in some manner caused by their
unnatural treatment in some instances as with silene grtners view
seems the most probable namely that it is caused by an inherent
tendency in the species to become dioecious i can add another cause
namely the illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants for i have
observed seedlings of three species of primula and of  lythrum
salicaria which had been raised from plants illegitimately fertilised
by their ownform pollen with some or all their anthers in a
contabescent state there is perhaps an additional cause namely
selffertilisation for many plants of dianthus and lobelia which had
been raised from selffertilised seeds had their anthers in this
state but these instances are not conclusive as both genera are
liable from other causes to this affection
cases of an opposite nature likewise occur namely plants with the
female organs struck with sterility whilst the male organs remain
perfect dianthus japonicus a passiflora and nicotiana have been
described by grtner89 as being in this unusual condition
monstrosities as a cause of sterilitygreat deviations of structure
even when the reproductive organs themselves are not seriously
affected sometimes cause plants to become sterile but in other cases
plants may become monstrous to an extreme degree and yet retain their
full fertility gallesio who certainly had great experience90 often
attributes sterility to this cause but it may be suspected that in
some of his cases sterility was the cause and not the result of the
monstrous growths the curious st valery apple although it bears
fruit rarely produces seed the wonderfully anomalous flowers of
begonia frigida formerly described though they appear fit for
fructification are sterile91 species of primula in which the calyx
is brightly coloured are said92 to be often sterile though i have
known them to be fertile on the other hand verlot gives several cases
of proliferous flowers which can be propagated by seed this was the
case with a poppy which had become monopetalous by the union of its
petals93 another extraordinary poppy with the stamens replaced by
numerous small supplementary capsules likewise reproduces itself by
seed this has also occurred with a plant of saxifraga geum in which
a series of adventitious carpels bearing ovules on their margins had
been developed between the stamens and the normal carpels94 lastly
with respect to peloric flowers which depart wonderfully from the
natural structurethose of linaria vulgaris seem generally to be
more or less sterile whilst those before described of  antirrhinum
majus when artificially fertilised with their own pollen are
perfectly fertile though sterile when left to themselves for bees are
unable to crawl into the narrow tubular flower the peloric flowers of
corydalis solida according to godron95 are sometimes barren and
sometimes fertile whilst those of gloxinia are well known to yield
plenty of seed in our greenhouse pelargoniums the central flower of
the truss is often peloric and mr masters informs me that he tried in
vain during several years to get seed from these flowers i likewise
made many vain attempts but sometimes succeeded in fertilising them
with pollen from a normal flower of another variety and conversely i
several times fertilised ordinary flowers with peloric pollen only
once i succeeded in raising a plant from a peloric flower fertilised by
pollen from a peloric flower borne by another variety but the plant
it may be added presented nothing particular in its structure hence
we may conclude that no general rule can be laid down but any great
deviation from the normal structure even when the reproductive organs
themselves are not seriously affected certainly often leads to sexual
impotence
double flowerswhen the stamens are converted into petals the plant
becomes on the male side sterile when both stamens and pistils are
thus changed the plant becomes completely barren symmetrical flowers
having numerous stamens and petals are the most liable to become
double as perhaps follows from all multiple organs being the most
subject to variability but flowers furnished with only a few stamens
and others which are asymmetrical in structure sometimes become
double as we see with the double gorse or ulex and antirrhinum the
composit bear what are called double flowers by the abnormal
development of the corolla of their central florets doubleness is
sometimes connected with prolification96 or the continued growth of
the axis of the flower doubleness is strongly inherited no one has
produced as lindley remarks97 double flowers by promoting the
perfect health of the plant on the contrary unnatural conditions of
life favour their production there is some reason to believe that
seeds kept during many years and seeds believed to be imperfectly
fertilised yield double flowers more freely than fresh and perfectly
fertilised seed98 longcontinued cultivation in rich soil seems to
be the commonest exciting cause a double narcissus and a double
anthemis nobilis transplanted into very poor soil has been observed
to become single99 and i have seen a completely double white
primrose rendered permanently single by being divided and transplanted
whilst in full flower it has been observed by professor e morren that
doubleness of the flowers and variegation of the leaves are
antagonistic states but so many exceptions to the rule have lately
been recorded100 that though general it cannot be looked at as
invariable variegation seems generally to result from a feeble or
atrophied condition of the plant and a large proportion of the
seedlings raised from parents if both are variegated usually perish
at an early age hence we may perhaps infer that doubleness which is
the antagonistic state commonly arises from a plethoric condition on
the other hand extremely poor soil sometimes though rarely appears
to cause doubleness i formerly described101 some completely double
budlike flowers produced in large numbers by stunted wild plants of
gentiana amarella growing on a poor chalky bank i have also noticed
a distinct tendency to doubleness in the flowers of a ranunculus
horsechestnut and bladdernut ranunculus repens aesculus pavia
and staphylea growing under very unfavourable conditions professor
lehmann102 found several wild plants growing near a hot spring with
double flowers with respect to the cause of doubleness which arises
as we see under widely different circumstances i shall presently
attempt to show that the most probable view is that unnatural
conditions first give a tendency to sterility and that then on the
principle of compensation as the reproductive organs do not perform
their proper functions they either become developed into petals or
additional petals are formed this view has lately been supported by
mr laxton103 who advances the case of some common peas which after
longcontinued heavy rain flowered a second time and produced double
flowers
seedless fruitmany of our most valuable fruits although consisting
in a homological sense of widely different organs are either quite
sterile or produce extremely few seeds this is notoriously the case
with our best pears grapes and figs with the pineapple banana
breadfruit pomegranate azarole datepalms and some members of the
orangetribe poorer varieties of these same fruits either habitually
or occasionally yield seed104 most horticulturists look at the great
size and anomalous development of the fruit as the cause and sterility
as the result but the opposite view as we shall presently see is
more probable
sterility from the excessive development of the organs of growth or
vegetationplants which from any cause grow too luxuriantly and
produce leaves stems runners suckers tubers bulbs etc in
excess sometimes do not flower or if they flower do not yield seed
to make european vegetables under the hot climate of india yield seed
it is necessary to check their growth and when onethird grown they
are taken up and their stems and taproots are cut or mutilated105
so it is with hybrids for instance prof lecoq106 had three plants
of mirabilis which though they grew luxuriantly and flowered were
quite sterile but after beating one with a stick until a few branches
alone were left these at once yielded good seed the sugarcane which
grows vigorously and produces a large supply of succulent stems never
according to various observers bears seed in the west indies malaga
india cochin china mauritius or the malay archipelago107 plants
which produce a large number of tubers are apt to be sterile as
occurs to a certain extent with the common potato and mr fortune
informs me that the sweet potato convolvulus batatas in china
never as far as he has seen yields seed dr royle remarks108 that
in india the agave vivipara when grown in rich soil invariably
produces bulbs but no seeds whilst a poor soil and dry climate lead
to an opposite result in china according to mr fortune an
extraordinary number of little bulbs are developed in the axils of the
leaves of the yam and this plant does not bear seed whether in these
cases as in those of double flowers and seedless fruit sexual
sterility from changed conditions of life is the primary cause which
leads to the excessive development of the organs of vegetation is
doubtful though some evidence might be advanced in favour of this
view it is perhaps a more probable view that plants which propagate
themselves largely by one method namely by buds have not sufficient
vital power or organised matter for the other method of sexual
generation
several distinguished botanists and good practical judges believe that
long continued propagation by cuttings runners tubers bulbs etc
independently of any excessive development of these parts is the cause
of many plants failing to produce flowers or producing only barren
flowersit is as if they had lost the habit of sexual generation109
that many plants when thus propagated are sterile there can be no
doubt but as to whether the long continuance of this form of
propagation is the actual cause of their sterility i will not venture
from the want of sufficient evidence to express an opinion
that plants may be propagated for long periods by buds without the aid
of sexual generation we may safely infer from this being the case with
many plants which must have long survived in a state of nature as i
have had occasion before to allude to this subject i will here give
such cases as i have collected many alpine plants ascend mountains
beyond the height at which they can produce seed110 certain species
of poa and festuca when growing on mountainpastures propagate
themselves as i hear from mr bentham almost exclusively by bulblets
kalm gives a more curious instance111 of several american trees
which grow so plentifully in marshes or in thick woods that they are
certainly well adapted for these stations yet scarcely ever produce
seeds but when accidentally growing on the outside of the marsh or
wood are loaded with seed the common ivy is found in northern sweden
and russia but flowers and fruits only in the southern provinces the
acorus calamus extends over a large portion of the globe but so
rarely perfects fruit that this has been seen only by a few botanists
according to caspary all its pollengrains are in a worthless
condition112 the hypericum calycinum which propagates itself so
freely in our shrubberies by rhizomes and is naturalised in ireland
blossoms profusely but rarely sets any seed and this only during
certain years nor did it set any when fertilised in my garden by
pollen from plants growing at a distance the lysimachia nummularia
which is furnished with long runners so seldom produces seedcapsules
that prof decaisne113 who has especially attended to this plant
has never seen it in fruit the carex rigida often fails to perfect
its seed in scotland lapland greenland germany and new hampshire in
the united states114 the periwinkle vinca minor which spreads
largely by runners is said scarcely ever to produce fruit in
england115 but this plant requires insectaid for its fertilisation
and the proper insects may be absent or rare the jussiaea grandiflora
has become naturalised in southern france and has spread by its
rhizomes so extensively as to impede the navigation of the waters but
never produces fertile seed116 the horseradish cochleria
armoracia spreads pertinaciously and is naturalised in various parts
of europe though it bears flowers these rarely produce capsules
professor caspary informs me that he has watched this plant since 1851
but has never seen its fruit 65 per cent of its pollengrains are bad
the common  ranunculus ficaria rarely bears seed in england france
or switzerland but in 1863 i observed seeds on several plants growing
near my house117 other cases analogous with the foregoing could be
given for instance some kinds of mosses and lichens have never been
seen to fructify in france
some of these endemic and naturalised plants are probably rendered
sterile from excessive multiplication by buds and their consequent
incapacity to produce and nourish seed but the sterility of others
more probably depends on the peculiar conditions under which they live
as in the case of the ivy in the northern part of europe and of the
trees in the swamps of the united states yet these plants must be in
some respects eminently well adapted for the stations which they
occupy for they hold their places against a host of competitors
finally the high degree of sterility which often accompanies the
doubling of flowers or an excessive development of fruit seldom
supervenes at once an incipient tendency is observed and continued
selection completes the result the view which seems the most probable
and which connects together all the foregoing facts and brings them
within our present subject is that changed and unnatural conditions
of life first give a tendency to sterility and in consequence of this
the organs of reproduction being no longer able fully to perform their
proper functions a supply of organised matter not required for the
development of the seed flows either into these organs and renders
them foliaceous or into the fruit stems tubers etc increasing
their size and succulency but it is probable that there exists
independently of any incipient sterility an antagonism between the two
forms of reproduction namely by seed and buds when either is carried
to an extreme degree that incipient sterility plays an important part
in the doubling of flowers and in the other cases just specified i
infer chiefly from the following facts when fertility is lost from a
wholly different cause namely from hybridism there is a strong
tendency as grtner118 affirms for flowers to become double and
this tendency is inherited moreover it is notorious that with hybrids
the male organs become sterile before the female organs and with
double flowers the stamens first become foliaceous this latter fact is
well shown by the male flowers of dioecious plants which according to
gallesio119 first become double again grtner120 often insists
that the flowers of even utterly sterile hybrids which do not produce
any seed generally yield perfect capsules or fruita fact which has
likewise been repeatedly observed by naudin with the cucurbitace so
that the production of fruit by plants rendered sterile through any
cause is intelligible klreuter has also expressed his unbounded
astonishment at the size and development of the tubers in certain
hybrids and all experimentalists121 have remarked on the strong
tendency in hybrids to increase by roots runners and suckers seeing
that hybrid plants which from their nature are more or less sterile
thus tend to produce double flowers that they have the parts including
the seed that is the fruit perfectly developed even when containing
no seed that they sometimes yield gigantic roots that they almost
invariably tend to increase largely by suckers and other such
meansseeing this and knowing from the many facts given in the
earlier parts of this chapter that almost all organic beings when
exposed to unnatural conditions tend to become more or less sterile it
seems much the most probable view that with cultivated plants sterility
is the exciting cause and double flowers rich seedless fruit and in
some cases largelydeveloped organs of vegetation etc are the
indirect resultsthese results having been in most cases largely
increased through continued selection by man

hybridism

domestication on fertilityclose interbreedinggood and evil results
from changed conditions of lifevarieties when crossed not invariably
fertileon the difference in fertility between crossed species and
varietiesconclusions with respect to hybridismlight thrown on
hybridism by the illegitimate progeny of heterostyled plantssterility
of crossed species due to differences confined to the reproductive
systemnot accumulated through natural selectionreasons why domestic
varieties are not mutually steriletoo much stress has been laid on the
difference in fertility between crossed species and crossed
varietiesconclusion
it was shown in the fifteenth chapter that when individuals of the same
variety or even of a distinct variety are allowed freely to
intercross uniformity of character is ultimately acquired some few
characters however are incapable of fusion but these are
unimportant as they are often of a semimonstrous nature and have
suddenly appeared hence to preserve our domesticated breeds true or
to improve them by methodical selection it is obviously necessary that
they should be kept separate nevertheless a whole body of individuals
may be slowly modified through unconscious selection as we shall see
in a future chapter without separating them into distinct lots
domestic races have often been intentionally modified by one or two
crosses made with some allied race and occasionally even by repeated
crosses with very distinct races but in almost all such cases
longcontinued and careful selection has been absolutely necessary
owing to the excessive variability of the crossed offspring due to the
principle of reversion in a few instances however mongrels have
retained a uniform character from their first production
when two varieties are allowed to cross freely and one is much more
numerous than the other the former will ultimately absorb the latter
should both varieties exist in nearly equal numbers it is probable
that a considerable period would elapse before the acquirement of a
uniform character and the character ultimately acquired would largely
depend on prepotency of transmission and on the conditions of life for
the nature of these conditions would generally favour one variety more
than another so that a kind of natural selection would come into play
unless the crossed offspring were slaughtered by man without the least
discrimination some degree of unmethodical selection would likewise
come into action from these several considerations we may infer that
when two or more closely allied species first came into the possession
of the same tribe their crossing will not have influenced in so great
a degree as has often been supposed the character of the offspring in
future times although in some cases it probably has had a considerable
effect
domestication as a general rule increases the prolificness of animals
and plants it eliminates the tendency to sterility which is common to
species when first taken from a state of nature and crossed on this
latter head we have no direct evidence but as our races of dogs
cattle pigs etc are almost certainly descended from aboriginally
distinct stocks and as these races are now fully fertile together or
at least incomparably more fertile than most species when crossed we
may with entire confidence accept this conclusion
abundant evidence has been given that crossing adds to the size
vigour and fertility of the offspring this holds good when there has
been no previous close interbreeding it applies to the individuals of
the same variety but belonging to different families to distinct
varieties subspecies and even to species in the latter case though
size is gained fertility is lost but the increased size vigour and
hardiness of many hybrids cannot be accounted for solely on the
principle of compensation from the inaction of the reproductive system
certain plants whilst growing under their natural conditions others
when cultivated and others of hybrid origin are completely
selfimpotent though perfectly healthy and such plants can be
stimulated to fertility only by being crossed with other individuals of
the same or of a distinct species
on the other hand longcontinued close interbreeding between the
nearest relations diminishes the constitutional vigour size and
fertility of the offspring and occasionally leads to malformations
but not necessarily to general deterioration of form or structure this
failure of fertility shows that the evil results of interbreeding are
independent of the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both
parents though this augmentation no doubt is often highly injurious
our belief that evil follows from close interbreeding rests to a
certain extent on the experience of practical breeders especially of
those who have reared many animals of quickly propagating kinds but it
likewise rests on several carefully recorded experiments with some
animals close interbreeding may be carried on for a long period with
impunity by the selection of the most vigorous and healthy individuals
but sooner or later evil follows the evil however comes on so slowly
and gradually that it easily escapes observation but can be recognised
by the almost instantaneous manner in which size constitutional
vigour and fertility are regained when animals that have long been
interbred are crossed with a distinct family
these two great classes of facts namely the good derived from
crossing and the evil from close interbreeding with the consideration
of the innumerable adaptations throughout nature for compelling or
favouring or at least permitting the occasional union of distinct
individuals taken together lead to the conclusion that it is a law of
nature that organic beings shall not fertilise themselves for
perpetuity this law was first plainly hinted at in 1799 with respect
to plants by andrew knight1 and not long afterwards that sagacious
observer klreuter after showing how well the malvace are adapted for
crossing asks an id aliquid in recessu habeat quod hujuscemodi
flores nunquam proprio suo pulvere sed semper eo aliarum su speciei
impregnentur merito quritur certe natura nil facit frustra
although we may demur to klreuters saying that nature does nothing in
vain seeing how many rudimentary and useless organs there are yet
undoubtedly the argument from the innumerable contrivances which
favour crossing is of the greatest weight the most important result
of this law is that it leads to uniformity of character in the
individuals of the same species in the case of certain hermaphrodites
which probably intercross only at long intervals of time and with
unisexual animals inhabiting somewhat separated localities which can
only occasionally come into contact and pair the greater vigour and
fertility of the crossed offspring will ultimately tend to give
uniformity of character but when we go beyond the limits of the same
species free intercrossing is barred by the law of sterility
in searching for facts which might throw light on the cause of the good
effects from crossing and of the evil effects from close
interbreeding we have seen that on the one hand it is a widely
prevalent and ancient belief that animals and plants profit from
slight changes in their condition of life and it would appear that the
germ in a somewhat analogous manner is more effectually stimulated by
the male element when taken from a distinct individual and therefore
slightly modified in nature than when taken from a male having the
same identical constitution on the other hand numerous facts have
been given showing that when animals are first subjected to captivity
even in their native land and although allowed much liberty their
reproductive functions are often greatly impaired or quite annulled
some groups of animals are more affected than others but with
apparently capricious exceptions in every group some animals never or
rarely couple under confinement some couple freely but never or
rarely conceive the secondary male characters the maternal functions
and instincts are occasionally affected with plants when first
subjected to cultivation analogous facts have been observed we
probably owe our double flowers rich seedless fruits and in some
cases greatly developed tubers etc to incipient sterility of the
above nature combined with a copious supply of nutriment animals which
have long been domesticated and plants which have long been
cultivated can generally withstand with unimpaired fertility great
changes in their conditions of life though both are sometimes slightly
affected with animals the somewhat rare capacity of breeding freely
under confinement together with their utility mainly determine the
kinds which have been domesticated
we can in no case precisely say what is the cause of the diminished
fertility of an animal when first captured or of a plant when first
cultivated we can only infer that it is caused by a change of some
kind in the natural conditions of life the remarkable susceptibility
of the reproductive system to such changesa susceptibility not common
to any other organapparently has an important bearing on variability
as we shall see in a future chapter
it is impossible not to be struck with the double parallelism between
the two classes of facts just alluded to on the one hand slight
changes in the conditions of life and crosses between slightly
modified forms or varieties are beneficial as far as prolificness and
constitutional vigour are concerned on the other hand changes in the
conditions greater in degree or of a different nature and crosses
between forms which have been slowly and greatly modified by natural
meansin other words between speciesare highly injurious as far as
the reproductive system is concerned and in some few instances as far
as constitutional vigour is concerned can this parallelism be
accidental does it not rather indicate some real bond of connection
as a fire goes out unless it be stirred up so the vital forces are
always tending according to mr herbert spencer to a state of
equilibrium unless disturbed and renovated through the action of other
forces
in some few cases varieties tend to keep distinct by breeding at
different seasons by great difference in size or by sexual
preference but the crossing of varieties far from diminishing
generally adds to the fertility of the first union and of the mongrel
offspring whether all the more widely distinct domestic varieties are
invariably quite fertile when crossed we do not positively know much
time and trouble would be requisite for the necessary experiments and
many difficulties occur such as the descent of the various races from
aboriginally distinct species and the doubts whether certain forms
ought to be ranked as species or varieties nevertheless the wide
experience of practical breeders proves that the great majority of
varieties even if some should hereafter prove not to be indefinitely
fertile inter se are far more fertile when crossed than the vast
majority of closely allied natural species a few remarkable cases
have however been given on the authority of excellent observers
showing that with plants certain forms which undoubtedly must be
ranked as varieties yield fewer seeds when crossed than is natural to
the parentspecies other varieties have had their reproductive powers
so far modified that they are either more or less fertile than their
parents when crossed with a distinct species
nevertheless the fact remains indisputable that domesticated
varieties of animals and of plants which differ greatly from one
another in structure but which are certainly descended from the same
aboriginal species such as the races of the fowl pigeon many
vegetables and a host of other productions are extremely fertile when
crossed and this seems to make a broad and impassable barrier between
domestic varieties and natural species but as i will now attempt to
show the distinction is not so great and overwhelmingly important as
it at first appears
      on the difference in fertility between varieties and species
      when crossed
this work is not the proper place for fully treating the subject of
hybridism and i have already given in my origin of species a
moderately full abstract i will here merely enumerate the general
conclusions which may be relied on and which bear on our present
point
firstly the laws governing the production of hybrids are identical
or nearly identical in the animal and vegetable kingdoms
secondly the sterility of distinct species when first united and
that of their hybrid offspring graduate by an almost infinite number
of steps from zero when the ovule is never impregnated and a
seedcapsule is never formed up to complete fertility we can only
escape the conclusion that some species are fully fertile when crossed
by determining to designate as varieties all the forms which are quite
fertile this high degree of fertility is however rare nevertheless
plants which have been exposed to unnatural conditions sometimes
become modified in so peculiar a manner that they are much more
fertile when crossed with a distinct species than when fertilised by
their own pollen success in effecting a first union between two
species and the fertility of their hybrids depend in an eminent
degree on the conditions of life being favourable the innate sterility
of hybrids of the same parentage and raised from the same seedcapsule
often differs much in degree
thirdly the degree of sterility of a first cross between two species
does not always run strictly parallel with that of their hybrid
offspring many cases are known of species which can be crossed with
ease but yield hybrids excessively sterile and conversely some which
can be crossed with great difficulty but produce fairly fertile
hybrids this is an inexplicable fact on the view that species have
been specially endowed with mutual sterility in order to keep them
distinct
fourthly the degree of sterility often differs greatly in two
species when reciprocally crossed for the first will readily fertilise
the second but the latter is incapable after hundreds of trials of
fertilising the former hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses
between the same two species likewise sometimes differ in their degree
of sterility these cases also are utterly inexplicable on the view of
sterility being a special endowment
fifthly the degree of sterility of first crosses and of hybrids
runs to a certain extent parallel with the general or systematic
affinity of the forms which are united for species belonging to
distinct genera can rarely and those belonging to distinct families
can never be crossed the parallelism however is far from complete
for a multitude of closely allied species will not unite or unite with
extreme difficulty whilst other species widely different from one
another can be crossed with perfect facility nor does the difficulty
depend on ordinary constitutional differences for annual and perennial
plants deciduous and evergreen trees plants flowering at different
seasons inhabiting different stations and naturally living under the
most opposite climates can often be crossed with ease the difficulty
or facility apparently depends exclusively on the sexual constitution
of the species which are crossed or on their sexual elective affinity
ie wahlverwandtschaft of grtner as species rarely or never become
modified in one character without being at the same time modified in
many characters and as systematic affinity includes all visible
similarities and dissimilarities any difference in sexual constitution
between two species would naturally stand in more or less close
relation with their systematic position
sixthly the sterility of species when first crossed and that of
hybrids may possibly depend to a certain extent on distinct causes
with pure species the reproductive organs are in a perfect condition
whilst with hybrids they are often plainly deteriorated a hybrid
embryo which partakes of the constitution of its father and mother is
exposed to unnatural conditions as long as it is nourished within the
womb or egg or seed of the motherform and as we know that unnatural
conditions often induce sterility the reproductive organs of the
hybrid might at this early age be permanently affected but this cause
has no bearing on the infertility of first unions the diminished
number of the offspring from first unions may often result as is
certainly sometimes the case from the premature death of most of the
hybrid embryos but we shall immediately see that a law of an unknown
nature apparently exists which leads to the offspring from unions
which are infertile being themselves more or less infertile and this
at present is all that can be said
seventhly hybrids and mongrels present with the one great exception
of fertility the most striking accordance in all other respects
namely in the laws of their resemblance to their two parents in their
tendency to reversion in their variability and in being absorbed
through repeated crosses by either parentform
after arriving at these conclusions i was led to investigate a subject
which throws considerable light on hybridism namely the fertility of
heterostyled or dimorphic and trimorphic plants when illegitimately
united i have had occasion several times to allude to these plants
and i may here give a brief abstract of my observations several plants
belonging to distinct orders present two forms which exist in about
equal numbers and which differ in no respect except in their
reproductive organs one form having a long pistil with short stamens
the other a short pistil with long stamens both with differently sized
pollengrains with trimorphic plants there are three forms likewise
differing in the lengths of their pistils and stamens in the size and
colour of the pollengrains and in some other respects and as in each
of the three forms there are two sets of stamens there are altogether
six sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils these organs are so
proportioned in length to one another that in any two of the forms
half the stamens in each stand on a level with the stigma of the third
form now i have shown and the result has been confirmed by other
observers that in order to obtain full fertility with these plants
it is necessary that the stigma of the one form should be fertilised by
pollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in the other
form so that with dimorphic species two unions which may be called
legitimate are fully fertile and two which may be called
illegitimate are more or less infertile with trimorphic species six
unions are legitimate or fully fertile and twelve are illegitimate
or more or less infertile2
the infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and
trimorphic plants when illegitimately fertilised that is by pollen
taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil differs
much in degree up to absolute and utter sterility just in the same
manner as occurs in crossing distinct species as the degree of
sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the
conditions of life being more or less favourable so i have found it
with illegitimate unions it is well known that if pollen of a distinct
species be placed on the stigma of a flower and its own pollen be
afterwards even after a considerable interval of time placed on the
same stigma its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally
annihilates the effect of the foreign pollen so it is with the pollen
of the several forms of the same species for legitimate pollen is
strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen when both are placed on
the same stigma i ascertained this by fertilising several flowers
first illegitimately and twentyfour hours afterwards legitimately
with pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety and all the
seedlings were similarly coloured this shows that the legitimate
pollen though applied twentyfour hours subsequently had wholly
destroyed or prevented the action of the previously applied
illegitimate pollen again as in making reciprocal crosses between
the same two species there is occasionally a great difference in the
result so the same thing occurs with trimorphic plants for instance
the midstyled form of lythrum salicaria could be illegitimately
fertilised with the greatest ease by pollen from the longer stamens of
the shortstyled form and yielded many seeds but the shortstyled
form did not yield a single seed when fertilised by the longer stamens
of the midstyled form
in all these respects the forms of the same undoubted species when
illegitimately united behave in exactly the same manner as do two
distinct species when crossed this led me carefully to observe during
four years many seedlings raised from several illegitimate unions the
chief result is that these illegitimate plants as they may be called
are not fully fertile it is possible to raise from dimorphic species
both longstyled and shortstyled illegitimate plants and from
trimorphic plants all three illegitimate forms these can then be
properly united in a legitimate manner when this is done there is no
apparent reason why they should not yield as many seeds as did their
parents when legitimately fertilised but such is not the case they
are all infertile but in various degrees some being so utterly and
incurably sterile that they did not yield during four seasons a single
seed or even seedcapsule these illegitimate plants which are so
sterile although united with each other in a legitimate manner may be
strictly compared with hybrids when crossed inter se and it is well
known how sterile these latter generally are when on the other hand
a hybrid is crossed with either pure parentspecies the sterility is
usually much lessened and so it is when an illegitimate plant is
fertilised by a legitimate plant in the same manner as the sterility
of hybrids does not always run parallel with the difficulty of making
the first cross between the two parentspecies so the sterility of
certain illegitimate plants was unusually great whilst the sterility
of the union from which they were derived was by no means great with
hybrids raised from the same seedcapsule the degree of sterility is
innately variable so it is in a marked manner with illegitimate
plants lastly many hybrids are profuse and persistent flowerers
whilst other and more sterile hybrids produce few flowers and are
weak miserable dwarfs exactly similar cases occur with the
illegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic plants
although there is the closest identity in character and behaviour
between illegitimate plants and hybrids it is hardly an exaggeration
to maintain that the former are hybrids but produced within the limits
of the same species by the improper union of certain forms whilst
ordinary hybrids are produced from an improper union between socalled
distinct species we have already seen that there is the closest
similarity in all respects between first illegitimate unions and first
crosses between distinct species this will perhaps be made more fully
apparent by an illustrationwe may suppose that a botanist found two
wellmarked varieties and such occur of the longstyled form of the
trimorphic lithrum salicaria and that he determined to try by
crossing whether they were specifically distinct he would find that
they yielded only about onefifth of the proper number of seed and
that they behaved in all the other abovespecified respects as if they
had been two distinct species but to make the case sure he would
raise plants from his supposed hybridised seed and he would find that
the seedlings were miserably dwarfed and utterly sterile and that they
behaved in all other respects like ordinary hybrids he might then
maintain that he had actually proved in accordance with the common
view that his two varieties were as good and as distinct species as
any in the world but he would be completely mistaken
the facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important
because they show us first that the physiological test of lessened
fertility both in first crosses and in hybrids is no criterion of
specific distinction secondly because we may conclude that there is
some unknown bond which connects the infertility of illegitimate unions
with that of their illegitimate offspring and we are led to extend the
same view to first crosses and hybrids thirdly because we find and
this seems to me of especial importance that two or three forms of the
same species may exist and may differ in no respect whatever either in
structure or in constitution relatively to external conditions and
yet be sterile when united in certain ways for we must remember that
it is the union of the sexual elements of individuals of the same form
for instance of two longstyled forms which results in sterility
whilst it is the union of the sexual element proper to two distinct
forms which is fertile hence the case appears at first sight exactly
the reverse of what occurs in the ordinary unions of the individuals of
the same species and with crosses between distinct species it is
however doubtful whether this is really so but i will not enlarge on
this obscure subject
we may however infer as probable from the consideration of dimorphic
and trimorphic plants that the sterility of distinct species when
crossed and of their hybrid progeny depends exclusively on the nature
of their sexual elements and not on any difference in their structure
or general constitution we are also led to this same conclusion by
considering reciprocal crosses in which the male of one species cannot
be united or only with great difficulty with the female of a second
species whilst the converse cross can be effected with perfect
facility that excellent observer grtner likewise concluded that
species when crossed are sterile owing to differences confined to their
reproductive systems
on the principle which makes it necessary for man whilst he is
selecting and improving his domestic varieties to keep them separate
it would clearly be advantageous to varieties in a state of nature
that is to incipient species if they could be kept from blending
either through sexual aversion or by becoming mutually sterile hence
it at one time appeared to me probable as it has to others that this
sterility might have been acquired through natural selection on this
view we must suppose that a shade of lessened fertility first
spontaneously appeared like any other modification in certain
individuals of a species when crossed with other individuals of the
same species and that successive slight degrees of infertility from
being advantageous were slowly accumulated this appears all the more
probable if we admit that the structural differences between the forms
of dimorphic and trimorphic plants as the length and curvature of the
pistil etc have been coadapted through natural selection for if
this be admitted we can hardly avoid extending the same conclusion to
their mutual infertility sterility moreover has been acquired
through natural selection for other and widely different purposes as
with neuter insects in reference to their social economy in the case
of plants the flowers on the circumference of the truss in the guelder
rose viburnum opulus and those on the summit of the spike in the
featherhyacinth muscari comosum have been rendered conspicuous
and apparently in consequence sterile in order that insects might
easily discover and visit the perfect flowers but when we endeavour to
apply the principle of natural selection to the acquirement by distinct
species of mutual sterility we meet with great difficulties in the
first place it may be remarked that separate regions are often
inhabited by groups of species or by single species which when brought
together and crossed are found to be more or less sterile now it could
clearly have been no advantage to such separated species to have been
rendered mutually sterile and consequently this could not have been
effected through natural selection but it may perhaps be argued that
if a species were rendered sterile with some one compatriot sterility
with other species would follow as a necessary consequence in the
second place it is as much opposed to the theory of natural selection
as to the theory of special creation that in reciprocal crosses the
male element of one form should have been rendered utterly impotent on
a second form whilst at the same time the male element of this second
form is enabled freely to fertilise the first form for this peculiar
state of the reproductive system could not possibly have been
advantageous to either species
in considering the probability of natural selection having come into
action in rendering species mutually sterile one of the greatest
difficulties will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated
steps from slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility it may be
admitted on the principle above explained that it would profit an
incipient species if it were rendered in some slight degree sterile
when crossed with its parentform or with some other variety for thus
fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring would be produced to
commingle their blood with the new species in process of formation but
he who will take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which this
first degree of sterility could be increased through natural selection
to that higher degree which is common to so many species and which is
universal with species which have been differentiated to a generic or
family rank will find the subject extraordinarily complex after
mature reflection it seems to me that this could not have been effected
through natural selection take the case of any two species which when
crossed produce few and sterile offspring now what is there which
could favour the survival of those individuals which happened to be
endowed in a slightly higher degree with mutual infertility and which
thus approached by one small step towards absolute sterility yet an
advance of this kind if the theory of natural selection be brought to
bear must have incessantly occurred with many species for a multitude
are mutually quite barren with sterile neuter insects we have reason
to believe that modifications in their structure and fertility have
been slowly accumulated by natural selection from an advantage having
been thus indirectly given to the community to which they belonged over
other communities of the same species but an individual animal not
belonging to a social community if rendered slightly sterile when
crossed with some other variety would not thus itself gain any
advantage or indirectly give any advantage to the other individuals of
the same variety thus leading to their preservation
but it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail for
with plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed
species must be due to some principle quite independent of natural
selection both grtner and kolreuter have proved that in general
including numerous species a series can be formed from species which
when crossed yield fewer and fewer seeds to species which never
produce a single seed but yet are affected by the pollen of certain
other species for the germen swells it is here manifestly impossible
to select the more sterile individuals which have already ceased to
yield seeds so that this acme of sterility when the germen alone is
affected cannot have been gained through selection and from the laws
governing the various grades of sterility being so uniform throughout
the animal and vegetable kingdoms we may infer that the cause
whatever it may be is the same or nearly the same in all cases
as species have not been rendered mutually infertile through the
accumulative action of natural selection and as we may safely
conclude from the previous as well as from other and more general
considerations that they have not been endowed through an act of
creation with this quality we must infer that it has arisen
incidentally during their slow formation in connection with other and
unknown changes in their organisation by a quality arising
incidentally i refer to such cases as different species of animals and
plants being differently affected by poisons to which they are not
naturally exposed and this difference in susceptibility is clearly
incidental on other and unknown differences in their organisation so
again the capacity in different kinds of trees to be grafted on each
other or on a third species differs much and is of no advantage to
these trees but is incidental on structural or functional differences
in their woody tissues we need not feel surprise at sterility
incidentally resulting from crosses between distinct speciesthe
modified descendants of a common progenitorwhen we bear in mind how
easily the reproductive system is affected by various causesoften by
extremely slight changes in the conditions of life by too close
interbreeding and by other agencies it is well to bear in mind such
cases as that of the passiflora alata which recovered its
selffertility from being grafted on a distinct speciesthe cases of
plants which normally or abnormally are selfimpotent but can readily
be fertilised by the pollen of a distinct speciesand lastly the cases
of individual domesticated animals which evince towards each other
sexual incompatibility
we now at last come to the immediate point under discussion how is it
that with some few exceptions in the case of plants domesticated
varieties such as those of the dog fowl pigeon several fruittrees
and culinary vegetables which differ from each other in external
characters more than many species are perfectly fertile when crossed
or even fertile in excess whilst closely allied species are almost
invariably in some degree sterile we can to a certain extent give a
satisfactory answer to this question passing over the fact that the
amount of external difference between two species is no sure guide to
their degree of mutual sterility so that similar differences in the
case of varieties would be no sure guide we know that with species the
cause lies exclusively in differences in their sexual constitution now
the conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants have
been subjected have had so little tendency towards modifying the
reproductive system in a manner leading to mutual sterility that we
have very good grounds for admitting the directly opposite doctrine of
pallas namely that such conditions generally eliminate this tendency
so that the domesticated descendants of species which in their natural
state would have been in some degree sterile when crossed become
perfectly fertile together with plants so far is cultivation from
giving a tendency towards mutual sterility that in several
wellauthenticated cases already often alluded to certain species
have been affected in a very different manner for they have become
selfimpotent whilst still retaining the capacity of fertilising and
being fertilised by distinct species if the pallasian doctrine of the
elimination of sterility through longcontinued domestication be
admitted and it can hardly be rejected it becomes in the highest
degree improbable that similar circumstances should commonly both
induce and eliminate the same tendency though in certain cases with
species having a peculiar constitution sterility might occasionally be
thus induced thus as i believe we can understand why with
domesticated animals varieties have not been produced which are
mutually sterile and why with plants only a few such cases have been
observed namely by grtner with certain varieties of maize and
verbascum by other experimentalists with varieties of the gourd and
melon and by klreuter with one kind of tobacco
with respect to varieties which have originated in a state of nature
it is almost hopeless to expect to prove by direct evidence that they
have been rendered mutually sterile for if even a trace of sterility
could be detected such varieties would at once be raised by almost
every naturalist to the rank of distinct species if for instance
grtners statement were fully confirmed that the blue and red
flowered forms of the pimpernel anagallis arvensis are sterile when
crossed i presume that all the botanists who now maintain on various
grounds that these two forms are merely fleeting varieties would at
once admit that they were specifically distinct
the real difficulty in our present subject is not as it appears to me
why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed
but why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties as soon
as they have been modified in a sufficient and permanent degree to take
rank as species we are far from precisely knowing the cause but we
can see that the species owing to their struggle for existence with
numerous competitors must have been exposed to more uniform conditions
of life during long periods of time than domestic varieties have been
and this may well make a wide difference in the result for we know how
commonly wild animals and plants when taken from their natural
conditions and subjected to captivity are rendered sterile and the
reproductive functions of organic beings which have always lived and
been slowly modified under natural conditions would probably in like
manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an unnatural cross
domesticated productions on the other hand which as shown by the
mere fact of their domestication were not originally highly sensitive
to changes in their conditions of life and which can now generally
resist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of conditions
might be expected to produce varieties which would be little liable to
have their reproductive powers injuriously affected by the act of
crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like manner
certain naturalists have recently laid too great stress as it appears
to me on the difference in fertility between varieties and species
when crossed some allied species of trees cannot be grafted on one
another whilst all varieties can be so grafted some allied animals
are affected in a very different manner by the same poison but with
varieties no such case until recently was known whilst now it has been
proved that immunity from certain poisons sometimes stands in
correlation with the colour of the individuals of the same species the
period of gestation generally differs much in distinct species but
with varieties until lately no such difference had been observed here
we have various physiological differences and no doubt others could be
added between one species and another of the same genus which do not
occur or occur with extreme rarity in the case of varieties and
these differences are apparently wholly or in chief part incidental on
other constitutional differences just in the same manner as the
sterility of crossed species is incidental on differences confined to
the sexual system why then should these latter differences however
serviceable they may indirectly be in keeping the inhabitants of the
same country distinct be thought of such paramount importance in
comparison with other incidental and functional differences no
sufficient answer to this question can be given hence the fact that
widely distinct domestic varieties are with rare exceptions perfectly
fertile when crossed and produce fertile offspring whilst closely
allied species are with rare exceptions more or less sterile is not
nearly so formidable an objection as it appears at first to the theory
of the common descent of allied species

and by semicivilised peopleunimportant characters often attended

domesticated animals changed through the action of unconscious
selectioninfluence of different breeders on the same
subvarietyplants as affected by unconscious selectioneffects of
selection as shown by the great amount of difference in the parts most
valued by man
the power of selection whether exercised by man or brought into play
under nature through the struggle for existence and the consequent
survival of the fittest absolutely depends on the variability of
organic beings without variability nothing can be effected slight
individual differences however suffice for the work and are probably
the chief or sole means in the production of new species hence our
discussion on the causes and laws of variability ought in strict order
to have preceded the present subject as well as inheritance crossing
etc but practically the present arrangement has been found the most
convenient man does not attempt to cause variability though he
unintentionally effects this by exposing organisms to new conditions of
life and by crossing breeds already formed but variability being
granted he works wonders unless some degree of selection be
exercised the free commingling of the individuals of the same variety
soon obliterates as we have previously seen the slight differences
which arise and gives uniformity of character to the whole body of
individuals in separated districts longcontinued exposure to
different conditions of life may produce new races without the aid of
selection but to this subject of the direct action of the conditions
of life i shall recur in a future chapter
when animals or plants are born with some conspicuous and firmly
inherited new character selection is reduced to the preservation of
such individuals and to the subsequent prevention of crosses so that
nothing more need be said on the subject but in the great majority of
cases a new character or some superiority in an old character is at
first faintly pronounced and is not strongly inherited and then the
full difficulty of selection is experienced indomitable patience the
finest powers of discrimination and sound judgment must be exercised
during many years a clearly predetermined object must be kept steadily
in view few men are endowed with all these qualities especially with
that of discriminating very slight differences judgment can be
acquired only by long experience but if any of these qualities be
wanting the labour of a life may be thrown away i have been
astonished when celebrated breeders whose skill and judgment have been
proved by their success at exhibitions have shown me their animals
which appeared all alike and have assigned their reasons for matching
this and that individual the importance of the great principle of
selection mainly lies in this power of selecting scarcely appreciable
differences which nevertheless are found to be transmissible and
which can be accumulated until the result is made manifest to the eyes
of every beholder
the principle of selection may be conveniently divided into three
kinds methodical selection is that which guides a man who
systematically endeavours to modify a breed according to some
predetermined standard unconscious selection is that which follows
from men naturally preserving the most valued and destroying the less
valued individuals without any thought of altering the breed and
undoubtedly this process slowly works great changes unconscious
selection graduates into methodical and only extreme cases can be
distinctly separated for he who preserves a useful or perfect animal
will generally breed from it with the hope of getting offspring of the
same character but as long as he has not a predetermined purpose to
improve the breed he may be said to be selecting unconsciously1
lastly we have natural selection which implies that the individuals
which are best fitted for the complex and in the course of ages
changing conditions to which they are exposed generally survive and
procreate their kind with domestic productions natural selection
comes to a certain extent into action independently of and even in
opposition to the will of man
methodical selectionwhat man has effected within recent times in
england by methodical selection is clearly shown by our exhibitions of
improved quadrupeds and fancy birds with respect to cattle sheep and
pigs we owe their great improvement to a long series of wellknown
namesbakewell coiling ellman bates jonas webb lords leicester and
western fisher hobbs and others agricultural writers are unanimous
on the power of selection any number of statements to this effect
could be quoted a few will suffice youatt a sagacious and
experienced observer writes2 the principle of selection is that
which enables the agriculturist not only to modify the character of
his flock but to change it altogether a great breeder of
shorthorns3 says in the anatomy of the shoulder modern breeders
have made great improvement on the ketton shorthorns by correcting the
defect in the knuckle or shoulderjoint and by laying the top of the
shoulder more snugly in the crop and thereby filling up the hollow
behind it    the eye has its fashion at different periods at one
time the eye high and outstanding from the head and at another time
the sleepy eye sunk into the head but these extremes have merged into
the medium of a full clear and prominent eye with a placid look
again hear what an excellent judge of pigs4 says the legs should
be no longer than just to prevent the animals belly from trailing on
the ground the leg is the least profitable portion of the hog and we
therefore require no more of it than is absolutely necessary for the
support of the rest let any one compare the wildboar with any
improved breed and he will see how effectually the legs have been
shortened
few persons except breeders are aware of the systematic care taken in
selecting animals and of the necessity of having a clear and almost
prophetic vision into futurity lord spencers skill and judgment were
well known and he writes5 it is therefore very desirable before
any man commences to breed either cattle or sheep that he should make
up his mind to the shape and qualities he wishes to obtain and
steadily pursue this object lord somerville in speaking of the
marvellous improvement of the new leicester sheep effected by bakewell
and his successors says it would seem as if they had first drawn a
perfect form and then given it life youatt6 urges the necessity of
annually drafting each flock as many animals will certainly degenerate
from the standard of excellence which the breeder has established in
his own mind even with a bird of such little importance as the
canary long ago 17801790 rules were established and a standard of
perfection was fixed according to which the london fanciers tried to
breed the several subvarieties7 a great winner of prizes at the
pigeonshows8 in describing the shortfaced almond tumbler says
there are many firstrate fanciers who are particularly partial to
what is called the goldfinchbeak which is very beautiful others say
take a fullsize round cherry then take a barleycorn and judiciously
placing and thrusting it into the cherry form as it were your beak
and that is not all for it will form a good head and beak provided
as i said before it is judiciously done others take an oat but as i
think the goldfinchbeak the handsomest i would advise the
inexperienced fancier to get the head of a goldfinch and keep it by
him for his observation wonderfully different as are the beaks of the
rock pigeon and goldfinch the end has undoubtedly been nearly gained
as far as external shape and proportions are concerned
not only should our animals be examined with the greatest care whilst
alive but as anderson remarks9 their carcases should be
scrutinised so as to breed from the descendants of such only as in
the language of the butcher cut up well the grain of the meat in
cattle and its being well marbled with fat10 and the greater or
less accumulation of fat in the abdomen of our sheep have been
attended to with success so with poultry a writer11 speaking of
cochinchina fowls which are said to differ much in the quality of
their flesh says the best mode is to purchase two young
brothercocks kill dress and serve up one if he be indifferent
similarly dispose of the other and try again if however he be fine
and wellflavoured his brother will not be amiss for breeding purposes
for the table
the great principle of the division of labour has been brought to bear
on selection in certain districts12 the breeding of bulls is
confined to a very limited number of persons who by devoting their
whole attention to this department are able from year to year to
furnish a class of bulls which are steadily improving the general breed
of the district the rearing and letting of choice rams has long been
as is well known a chief source of profit to several eminent breeders
in parts of germany this principle is carried with merino sheep to an
extreme point13 so important is the proper selection of breeding
animals considered that the best flockmasters do not trust to their
own judgment or to that of their shepherds but employ persons called
sheepclassifiers who make it their special business to attend to
this part of the management of several flocks and thus to preserve or
if possible to improve the best qualities of both parents in the
lambs in saxony when the lambs are weaned each in his turn is
placed upon a table that his wool and form may be minutely observed
the finest are selected for breeding and receive a first mark when
they are one year old and prior to shearing them another close
examination of those previously marked takes place those in which no
defect can be found receive a second mark and the rest are condemned
a few months afterwards a third and last scrutiny is made the prime
rams and ewes receive a third and final mark but the slightest blemish
is sufficient to cause the rejection of the animal these sheep are
bred and valued almost exclusively for the fineness of their wool and
the result corresponds with the labour bestowed on their selection
instruments have been invented to measure accurately the thickness of
the fibres and an austrian fleece has been produced of which twelve
hairs equalled in thickness one from a leicester sheep
throughout the world wherever silk is produced the greatest care is
bestowed on selecting the cocoons from which the moths for breeding are
to be reared a careful cultivator14 likewise examines the moths
themselves and destroys those that are not perfect but what more
immediately concerns us is that certain families in france devote
themselves to raising eggs for sale15 in china near shanghai the
inhabitants of two small districts have the privilege of raising eggs
for the whole surrounding country and that they may give up their
whole time to this business they are interdicted by law from producing
silk16
the care which successful breeders take in matching their birds is
surprising sir john sebright whose fame is perpetuated by the
sebright bantam used to spend two and three days in examining
consulting and disputing with a friend which were the best of five or
six birds17 mr bult whose pouterpigeons won so many prizes and
were exported to north america under the charge of a man sent on
purpose told me that he always deliberated for several days before he
matched each pair hence we can understand the advice of an eminent
fancier who writes18 i would here particularly guard you against
having too great a variety of pigeons otherwise you will know a little
of all but nothing about one as it ought to be known apparently it
transcends the power of the human intellect to breed all kinds it is
possible that there may be a few fanciers that have a good general
knowledge of fancy pigeons but there are many more who labour under
the delusion of supposing they know what they do not the excellence
of one subvariety the almond tumbler lies in the plumage carriage
head beak and eye but it is too presumptuous in the beginner to try
for all these points the great judge above quoted says there are
some young fanciers who are overcovetous who go for all the above
five properties at once they have their reward by getting nothing we
thus see that breeding even fancy pigeons is no simple art we may
smile at the solemnity of these precepts but he who laughs will win no
prizes
what methodical selection has effected for our animals is sufficiently
proved as already remarked by our exhibitions so greatly were the
sheep belonging to some of the earlier breeders such as bakewell and
lord western changed that many persons could not be persuaded that
they had not been crossed our pigs as mr corringham remarks19
during the last twenty years have undergone through rigorous selection
together with crossing a complete metamorphosis the first exhibition
for poultry was held in the zoological gardens in 1845 and the
improvement effected since that time has been great as mr bailey the
great judge remarked to me it was formerly ordered that the comb of
the spanish cock should be upright and in four or five years all good
birds had upright combs it was ordered that the polish cock should
have no comb or wattles and now a bird thus furnished would be at once
disqualified beards were ordered and out of fiftyseven pens lately
1860 exhibited at the crystal palace all had beards so it has been
in many other cases but in all cases the judges order only what is
occasionally produced and what can be improved and rendered constant by
selection the steady increase in weight during the last few years in
our fowls turkeys ducks and geese is notorious sixpound ducks are
now common whereas four pounds was formerly the average as the time
required to make a change has not often been recorded it may be worth
mentioning that it took mr wicking thirteen years to put a clean white
head on an almond tumblers body a triumph says another fancier
of which he may be justly proud20
mr tollet of betley hall selected cows and especially bulls
descended from good milkers for the sole purpose of improving his
cattle for the production of cheese he steadily tested the milk with
the lactometer and in eight years he increased as i was informed by
him the product in proportion of four to three here is a curious
case21 of steady but slow progress with the end not as yet fully
attained in 1784 a race of silkworms was introduced into france in
which one hundred in the thousand failed to produce white cocoons but
now after careful selection during sixtyfive generations the
proportion of yellow cocoons has been reduced to thirtyfive in the
thousand
with plants selection has been followed with the same good result as
with animals but the process is simpler for plants in the great
majority of cases bear both sexes nevertheless with most kinds it is
necessary to take as much care to prevent crosses as with animals or
unisexual plants but with some plants such as peas this care is not
necessary with all improved plants excepting of course those which
are propagated by buds cuttings etc it is almost indispensable to
examine the seedlings and destroy those which depart from the proper
type this is called roguing and is in fact a form of selection
like the rejection of inferior animals experienced horticulturists and
agriculturists incessantly urge every one to preserve the finest plants
for the production of seed
although plants often present much more conspicuous variations than
animals yet the closest attention is generally requisite to detect
each slight and favourable change mr masters relates22 how many a
patient hour was devoted whilst he was young to the detection of
differences in peas intended for seed mr barnet23 remarks that the
old scarlet american strawberry was cultivated for more than a century
without producing a single variety and another writer observes how
singular it was that when gardeners first began to attend to this fruit
it began to vary the truth no doubt being that it had always varied
but that until slight variations were selected and propagated by seed
no conspicuous result was obtained the finest shades of difference in
wheat have been discriminated and selected with almost as much care as
in the case of the higher animals for instance by col le couteur and
more especially by major hallett
it may be worth while to give a few examples of methodical selection
with plants but in fact the great improvement of all our anciently
cultivated plants may be attributed to selection long carried on in
part methodically and in part unconsciously i have shown in a former
chapter how the weight of the gooseberry has been increased by
systematic selection and culture the flowers of the heartsease have
been similarly increased in size and regularity of outline with the
cineraria mr glenny24 was bold enough when the flowers were ragged
and starry and ill defined in colour to fix a standard which was then
considered outrageously high and impossible and which even if
reached it was said we should be no gainers by as it would spoil the
beauty of the flowers he maintained that he was right and the event
has proved it to be so the doubling of flowers has several times been
effected by careful selection the rev w williamson25 after sowing
during several years seed of anemone coronaria found a plant with
one additional petal he sowed the seed of this and by perseverance in
the same course obtained several varieties with six or seven rows of
petals the single scotch rose was doubled and yielded eight good
varieties in nine or ten years26 the canterbury bell campanula
medium was doubled by careful selection in four generations27 in
four years mr buckman28 by culture and careful selection converted
parsnips raised from wild seed into a new and good variety by
selection during a long course of years the early maturity of peas has
been hastened by between ten and twentyone days29 a more curious
case is offered by the beet plant which since its cultivation in
france has almost exactly doubled its yield of sugar this has been
effected by the most careful selection the specific gravity of the
roots being regularly tested and the best roots saved for the
production of seed30
      selection by ancient and semicivilised people
in attributing so much importance to the selection of animals and
plants it may be objected that methodical selection would not have
been carried on during ancient times a distinguished naturalist
considers it as absurd to suppose that semicivilised people should
have practised selection of any kind undoubtedly the principle has
been systematically acknowledged and followed to a far greater extent
within the last hundred years than at any former period and a
corresponding result has been gained but it would be a greater error
to suppose as we shall immediately see that its importance was not
recognised and acted on during the most ancient times and by
semicivilised people i should premise that many facts now to be given
only show that care was taken in breeding but when this is the case
selection is almost sure to be practised to a certain extent we shall
hereafter be enabled better to judge how far selection when only
occasionally carried on by a few of the inhabitants of a country will
slowly produce a great effect
in a wellknown passage in the thirtieth chapter of genesis rules are
given for influencing as was then thought possible the colour of
sheep and speckled and dark breeds are spoken of as being kept
separate by the time of david the fleece was likened to snow
youatt31 who has discussed all the passages in relation to breeding
in the old testament concludes that at this early period some of the
best principles of breeding must have been steadily and long pursued
it was ordered according to moses that thou shalt not let thy cattle
gender with a diverse kind but mules were purchased32 so that at
this early period other nations must have crossed the horse and ass it
is said33 that erichthonius some generations before the trojan war
had many broodmares which by his care and judgment in the choice of
stallions produced a breed of horses superior to any in the surrounding
countries homer book 5 speaks of aeneas horses as bred from mares
which were put to the steeds of laomedon plato in his republic says
to glaucus i see that you raise at your house a great many dogs for
the chase do you take care about breeding and pairing them among
animals of good blood are there not always some which are superior to
the rest to which glaucus answers in the affirmative34 alexander
the great selected the finest indian cattle to send to macedonia to
improve the breed35 according to pliny36 king pyrrhus had an
especially valuable breed of oxen and he did not suffer the bulls and
cows to come together till four years old that the breed might not
degenerate virgil in his georgics lib 3 gives as strong advice as
any modern agriculturist could do carefully to select the breeding
stock to note the tribe the lineage and the sire whom to reserve
for husband of the herdto brand the progenyto select sheep of the
purest white and to examine if their tongues are swarthy we have seen
that the romans kept pedigrees of their pigeons and this would have
been a senseless proceeding had not great care been taken in breeding
them columella gives detailed instructions about breeding fowls let
the breeding hens therefore be of a choice colour a robust body
squarebuilt fullbreasted with large heads with upright and
brightred combs those are believed to be the best bred which have
five toes37 according to tacitus the celts attended to the races
of their domestic animals and caesar states that they paid high prices
to merchants for fine imported horses38 in regard to plants virgil
speaks of yearly culling the largest seeds and celsus says where the
corn and crop is but small we must pick out the best ears of corn and
of them lay up our seed separately by itself39
coming down the stream of time we may be brief at about the beginning
of the ninth century charlemagne expressly ordered his officers to take
great care of his stallions and if any proved bad or old to forewarn
him in good time before they were put to the mares40 even in a
country so little civilised as ireland during the ninth century it
would appear from some ancient verses41 describing a ransom demanded
by cormac that animals from particular places or having a particular
character were valued thus it is said
      two pigs of the pigs of mac lir
      a ram and ewe both round and red
      i brought with me from aengus
      i brought with me a stallion and a mare
      from the beautiful stud of manannan
      a bull and a white cow from druim cain
athelstan in 930 received runninghorses as a present from germany
and he prohibited the exportation of english horses king john imported
one hundred chosen stallions from flanders42 on june 16th 1305
the prince of wales wrote to the archbishop of canterbury begging for
the loan of any choice stallion and promising its return at the end of
the season43 there are numerous records at ancient periods in
english history of the importation of choice animals of various kinds
and of foolish laws against their exportation in the reigns of henry
vii and viii it was ordered that the magistrates at michaelmas
should scour the heaths and commons and destroy all mares beneath a
certain size44 some of our earlier kings passed laws against the
slaughtering rams of any good breed before they were seven years old
so that they might have time to breed in spain cardinal ximenes
issued in 1509 regulations on the  selection of good rams for
breeding45
the emperor akbar khan before the year l600 is said to have
wonderfully improved his pigeons by crossing the breeds and this
necessarily implies careful selection about the same period the dutch
attended with the greatest care to the breeding of these birds belon
in 1555 says that good managers in france examined the colour of their
goslings in order to get geese of a white colour and better kinds
markham in 1631 tells the breeder to elect the largest and goodliest
conies and enters into minute details even with respect to seeds of
plants for the flowergarden sir j hanmer writing about the year
166046 says in choosing seed the best seed is the most weighty
and is had from the lustiest and most vigorous stems and he then
gives rules about leaving only a few flowers on plants for seed so
that even such details were attended to in our flowergardens two
hundred years ago in order to show that selection has been silently
carried on in places where it would not have been expected i may add
that in the middle of the last century in a remote part of north
america mr cooper improved by careful selection all his vegetables
so that they were greatly superior to those of any other person when
his radishes for instance are fit for use he takes ten or twelve
that he most approves and plants them at least 100 yards from others
that blossom at the same time in the same manner he treats all his
other plants varying the circumstances according to their nature47
in the great work on china published in the last century by the
jesuits and which is chiefly compiled from ancient chinese
encyclopaedias it is said that with sheep improving the breed
consists in choosing with particular care the lambs which are destined
for propagation in nourishing them well and in keeping the flocks
separate the same principles were applied by the chinese to various
plants and fruittrees48 an imperial edict recommends the choice of
seed of remarkable size and selection was practised even by imperial
hands for it is said that the yami or imperial rice was noticed at
an ancient period in a field by the emperor khanghi was saved and
cultivated in his garden and has since become valuable from being the
only kind which will grow north of the great wall49 even with
flowers the tree paeony p moutan has been cultivated according
to chinese traditions for 1400 years between 200 and 300 varieties
have been raised which are cherished like tulips formerly were by the
dutch50
turning now to semicivilised people and to savages it occurred to me
from what i had seen of several parts of south america where fences do
not exist and where the animals are of little value that there would
be absolutely no care in breeding or selecting them and this to a
large extent is true roulin51 however describes in columbia a
naked race of cattle which are not allowed to increase on account of
their delicate constitution according to azara52 horses are often
born in paraguay with curly hair but as the natives do not like them
they are destroyed on the other hand azara states that a hornless
bull born in 1770 was preserved and propagated its race i was
informed of the existence in banda oriental of a breed with reversed
hair and the extraordinary niata cattle first appeared and have since
been kept distinct in la plata hence certain conspicuous variations
have been preserved and others have been habitually destroyed in
these countries which are so little favourable for careful selection
we have also seen that the inhabitants sometimes introduce fresh cattle
on their estates to prevent the evil effects of close interbreeding on
the other hand i have heard on reliable authority that the gauchos of
the pampas never take any pains in selecting the best bulls or
stallions for breeding and this probably accounts for the cattle and
horses being remarkably uniform in character throughout the immense
range of the argentine republic
looking to the old world in the sahara desert the touareg is as
careful in the selection of his breeding mahari a fine race of the
dromedary as the arab is in that of his horse the pedigrees are
handed down and many a dromedary can boast a genealogy far longer than
the descendants of the darley arabian53 according to pallas the
mongolians endeavour to breed the yaks or horsetailed buffaloes with
white tails for these are sold to the chinese mandarins as
flyflappers and moorcroft about seventy years after pallas found
that whitetailed animals were still selected for breeding54
we have seen in the chapter on the dog that savages in different parts
of north america and in guiana cross their dogs with wild canid as
did the ancient gauls according to pliny this was done to give their
dogs strength and vigour in the same way as the keepers in large
warrens now sometimes cross their ferrets as i have been informed by
mr yarrell with the wild polecat to give them more devil
according to varro the wild ass was formerly caught and crossed with
the tame animal to improve the breed in the same manner as at the
present day the natives of java sometimes drive their cattle into the
forests to cross with the wild banteng bos sondaicus55 in
northern siberia among the ostyaks the dogs vary in markings in
different districts but in each place they are spotted black and white
in a remarkably uniform manner56 and from this fact alone we may
infer careful breeding more especially as the dogs of one locality are
famed throughout the country for their superiority i have heard of
certain tribes of esquimaux who take pride in their teams of dogs being
uniformly coloured in guiana as sir h schomburgk informs me57 the
dogs of the turuma indians are highly valued and extensively bartered
the price of a good one is the same as that given for a wife they are
kept in a sort of cage and the indians take great care when the
female is in season to prevent her uniting with a dog of an inferior
description the indians told sir robert that if a dog proved bad or
useless he was not killed but was left to die from sheer neglect
hardly any nation is more barbarous than the fuegians but i hear from
mr bridges the catechist to the mission that when these savages
have a large strong and active bitch they take care to put her to a
fine dog and even take care to feed her well that her young may be
strong and well favoured
in the interior of africa negroes who have not associated with white
men show great anxiety to improve their animals they always choose
the larger and stronger males for stock the malakolo were much
pleased at livingstones promise to send them a bull and some bakalolo
carried a live cock all the way from loanda into the interior58 at
falaba mr winwood reade noticed an unusually fine horse and the negro
king informed him that the owner was noted for his skill in breeding
horses further south on the same continent andersson states that he
has known a damara give two fine oxen for a dog which struck his fancy
the damaras take great delight in having whole droves of cattle of the
same colour and they prize their oxen in proportion to the size of
their horns the namaquas have a perfect mania for a uniform team and
almost all the people of southern africa value their cattle next to
their women and take a pride in possessing animals that look
highbred they rarely or never make use of a handsome animal as a
beast of burden59 the power of discrimination which these savages
possess is wonderful and they can recognise to which tribe any cattle
belong mr andersson further informs me that the natives frequently
match a particular bull with a particular cow
the most curious case of selection by semicivilised people or indeed
by any people which i have found recorded is that given by garcilazo
de la vega a descendant of the incas as having been practised in peru
before the country was subjugated by the spaniards60 the incas
annually held great hunts when all the wild animals were driven from
an immense circuit to a central point the beasts of prey were first
destroyed as injurious the wild guanacos and vicunas were sheared the
old males and females killed and the others set at liberty the
various kinds of deer were examined the old males and females were
likewise killed but the young females with a certain number of
males selected from the most beautiful and strong were given their
freedom here then we have selection by man aiding natural selection
so that the incas followed exactly the reverse system of that which our
scottish sportsman are accused of following namely of steadily
killing the finest stags thus causing the whole race to
degenerate61 in regard to the domesticated llamas and alpacas they
were separated in the time of the incas according to colour and if by
chance one in a flock was born of the wrong colour it was eventually
put into another flock
in the genus auchenia there are four formsthe guanaco and vicuna
found wild and undoubtedly distinct species the llama and alpaca
known only in a domesticated condition these four animals appear so
different that most naturalists especially those who have studied
these animals in their native country maintain that they are
specifically distinct notwithstanding that no one pretends to have
seen a wild llama or alpaca mr ledger however who has closely
studied these animals both in peru and during their exportation to
australia and who has made many experiments on their propagation
adduces arguments62 which seem to me conclusive that the llama is
the domesticated descendant of the guanaco and the alpaca of the
vicuna and now that we know that these animals were systematically
bred and selected many centuries ago there is nothing surprising in
the great amount of change which they have undergone
it appeared to me at one time probable that though ancient and
semicivilised people might have attended to the improvement of their
more useful animals in essential points yet that they would have
disregarded unimportant characters but human nature is the same
throughout the world fashion everywhere reigns supreme and man is apt
to value whatever he may chance to possess we have seen that in south
america the niata cattle which certainly are not made useful by their
shortened faces and upturned nostrils have been preserved the damaras
of south africa value their cattle for uniformity of colour and
enormously long horns and i will now show that there is hardly any
peculiarity in our most useful animals which from fashion
superstition or some other motive has not been valued and
consequently preserved with respect to cattle an early record
according to youatt63 speaks of a hundred white cows with red ears
being demanded as a compensation by the princes of north and south
wales if the cattle were of a dark or black colour 150 were to be
presented so that colour was attended to in wales before its
subjugation by england in central africa an ox that beats the ground
with its tail is killed and in south africa some of the damaras will
not eat the flesh of a spotted ox the kaffirs value an animal with a
musical voice and at a sale in british kaffraria the low of a heifer
excited so much admiration that a sharp competition sprung up for her
possession and she realised a considerable price64 with respect to
sheep the chinese prefer rams without horns the tartars prefer them
with spirally wound horns because the hornless are thought to lose
courage65 some of the damaras will not eat the flesh of hornless
sheep in regard to horses at the end of the fifteenth century animals
of the colour described as liart pomme were most valued in france the
arabs have a proverb never buy a horse with four white feet for he
carries his shroud with him66 the arabs also as we have seen
despise duncoloured horses so with dogs xenophon and others at an
ancient period were prejudiced in favour of certain colours and white
or slatecoloured hunting dogs were not esteemed67
turning to poultry the old roman gourmands thought that the liver of a
white goose was the most savoury in paraguay blackskinned fowls are
kept because they are thought to be more productive and their flesh
the most proper for invalids68 in guiana as i am informed by sir r
schomburgk the aborigines will not eat the flesh or eggs of the fowl
but two races are kept distinct merely for ornament in the
philippines no less than nine subvarieties of the gamecock are kept
and named so that they must be separately bred
at the present time in europe the smallest peculiarities are carefully
attended to in our most useful animals either from fashion or as a
mark of purity of blood many examples could be given two will
suffice in the western counties of england the prejudice against a
white pig is nearly as strong as against a black one in yorkshire in
one of the berkshire subbreeds it is said the white should be
confined to four white feet a white spot between the eyes and a few
white hairs behind each shoulder mr saddler possessed three hundred
pigs every one of which was marked in this manner69 marshall
towards the close of the last century in speaking of a change in one
of the yorkshire breeds of cattle says the horns have been
considerably modified as a clean small sharp horn has been
fashionable for the last twenty years70 in a part of germany the
cattle of the race de gfoehl are valued for many good qualities but
they must have horns of a particular curvature and tint so much so
that mechanical means are applied if they take a wrong direction but
the inhabitants consider it of the highest importance that the
nostrils of the bull should be fleshcoloured and the eyelashes light
this is an indispensable condition a calf with blue nostrils would not
be purchased or purchased at a very low price71 therefore let no
man say that any point or character is too trifling to be methodically
attended to and selected by breeders
unconscious selectionby this term i mean as already more than once
explained the preservation by man of the most valued and the
destruction of the least valued individuals without any conscious
intention on his part of altering the breed it is difficult to offer
direct proofs of the results which follow from this kind of selection
but the indirect evidence is abundant in fact except that in the one
case man acts intentionally and in the other unintentionally there is
little difference between methodical and unconscious selection in both
cases man preserves the animals which are most useful or pleasing to
him and destroys or neglects the others but no doubt a far more rapid
result follows from methodical than from unconscious selection the
roguing of plants by gardeners and the destruction by law in henry
viiis reign of all undersized mares are instances of a process the
reverse of selection in the ordinary sense of the word but leading to
the same general result the influence of the destruction of
individuals having a particular character is well shown by the
necessity of killing every lamb with a trace of black about it in
order to keep the flock white or again by the effects on the average
height of the men of france of the destructive wars of napoleon by
which many tall men were killed the short ones being left to be the
fathers of families this at least is the conclusion of some of those
who have closely studied the effects of the conscription and it is
certain that since napoleons time the standard for the army has been
lowered two or three times
unconscious selection blends with methodical so that it is scarcely
possible to separate them when a fancier long ago first happened to
notice a pigeon with an unusually short beak or one with the
tailfeathers unusually developed although he bred from these birds
with the distinct intention of propagating the variety yet he could
not have intended to make a shortfaced tumbler or a fantail and was
far from knowing that he had made the first step towards this end if
he could have seen the final result he would have been struck with
astonishment but from what we know of the habits of fanciers
probably not with admiration our english carriers barbs and
shortfaced tumblers have been greatly modified in the same manner as
we may infer both from the historical evidence given in the chapters on
the pigeon and from the comparison of birds brought from distant
countries
so it has been with dogs our present foxhounds differ from the old
english hound our greyhounds have become lighter the scotch
deerhound has been modified and is now rare our bulldogs differ from
those which were formerly used for baiting bulls our pointers and
newfoundlands do not closely resemble any native dog now found in the
countries whence they were brought these changes have been effected
partly by crosses but in every case the result has been governed by
the strictest selection nevertheless there is no reason to suppose
that man intentionally and methodically made the breeds exactly what
they now are as our horses became fleeter and the country more
cultivated and smoother fleeter foxhounds were desired and produced
but probably without any one distinctly foreseeing what they would
become our pointers and setters the latter almost certainly descended
from large spaniels have been greatly modified in accordance with
fashion and the desire for increased speed wolves have become extinct
and so has the wolfdog deer have become rarer bulls are no longer
baited and the corresponding breeds of the dog have answered to the
change but we may feel almost sure that when for instance bulls were
no longer baited no man said to himself i will now breed my dogs of
smaller size and thus create the present race as circumstances
changed men unconsciously and slowly modified their course of
selection
with racehorses selection for swiftness has been followed methodically
and our horses now easily surpass their progenitors the increased size
and different appearance of the english racehorse led a good observer
in india to ask could any one in this year of 1856 looking at our
racehorses conceive that they were the result of the union of the arab
horse and the african mare72 this change has it is probable been
largely effected through unconscious selection that is by the general
wish to breed as fine horses as possible in each generation combined
with training and high feeding but without any intention to give to
them their present appearance according to youatt73 the
introduction in oliver cromwells time of three celebrated eastern
stallions speedily affected the english breed so that lord harleigh
one of the old school complained that the great horse was fast
disappearing this is an excellent proof how carefully selection must
have been attended to for without such care all traces of so small an
infusion of eastern blood would soon have been absorbed and lost
notwithstanding that the climate of england has never been esteemed
particularly favourable to the horse yet longcontinued selection
both methodical and unconscious together with that practised by the
arabs during a still longer and earlier period has ended in giving us
the best breed of horses in the world macaulay74 remarks two men
whose authority on such subjects was held in great esteem the duke of
newcastle and sir john fenwick pronounced that the meanest hack ever
imported from tangier would produce a finer progeny than could be
expected from the best sire of our native breed they would not readily
have believed that a time would come when the princes and nobles of
neighbouring lands would be as eager to obtain horses from england as
ever the english had been to obtain horses from barbary
the london drayhorse which differs so much in appearance from any
natural species and which from its size has so astonished many eastern
princes was probably formed by the heaviest and most powerful animals
having been selected during many generations in flanders and england
but without the least intention or expectation of creating a horse such
as we now see if we go back to an early period of history we behold
in the antique greek statues as schaaffhausen has remarked75 a
horse equally unlike a race or dray horse and differing from any
existing breed
the results of unconscious selection in an early stage are well shown
in the difference between the flocks descended from the same stock but
separately reared by careful breeders youatt gives an excellent
instance of this fact in the sheep belonging to messrs buckley and
burgess which have been purely bred from the original stock of mr
bakewell for upwards of fifty years there is not a suspicion existing
in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the
owner of either flock has deviated in any one instance from the pure
blood of mr bakewells flock yet the difference between the sheep
possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the
appearance of being quite different varieties76 i have seen several
analogous and well marked cases with pigeons for instance i had a
family of barbs descended from those long bred by sir j sebright and
another family long bred by another fancier and the two families
plainly differed from each other nathusiusand a more competent
witness could not be citedobserves that though the shorthorns are
remarkably uniform in appearance except in colour yet the individual
character and wishes of each breeder become impressed on his cattle so
that different herds differ slightly from one another77 the hereford
cattle assumed their present wellmarked character soon after the year
1769 through careful selection by mr tomkins78 and the breed has
lately split into two strainsone strain having a white face and
differing slightly it is said79 in some other points but there is
no reason to believe that this split the origin of which is unknown
was intentionally made it may with much more probability be attributed
to different breeders having attended to different points so again
the berkshire breed of swine in the year 1810 had greatly changed from
what it was in 1780 and since 1810 at least two distinct subbreeds
have arisen bearing the same name80 keeping in mind how rapidly all
animals increase and that some must be annually slaughtered and some
saved for breeding then if the same breeder during a long course of
years deliberately settles which shall be saved and which shall be
killed it is almost inevitable that his individual turn of mind will
influence the character of his stock without his having had any
intention to modify the breed
unconscious selection in the strictest sense of the word that is the
saving of the more useful animals and the neglect or slaughter of the
less useful without any thought of the future must have gone on
occasionally from the remotest period and amongst the most barbarous
nations savages often suffer from famines and are sometimes expelled
by war from their own homes in such cases it can hardly be doubted
that they would save their most useful animals when the fuegians are
hard pressed by want they kill their old women for food rather than
their dogs for as we were assured old women no usedogs catch
otters the same sound sense would surely lead them to preserve their
more useful dogs when still harder pressed by famine mr oldfield who
has seen so much of the aborigines of australia informs me that they
are all very glad to get a european kangaroo dog and several instances
have been known of the father killing his own infant that the mother
might suckle the muchprized puppy different kinds of dogs would be
useful to the australian for hunting opossums and kangaroos and to the
fuegian for catching fish and otters and the occasional preservation
in the two countries of the most useful animals would ultimately lead
to the formation of two widely distinct breeds
with plants from the earliest dawn of civilisation the best variety
which was known would generally have been cultivated at each period and
its seeds occasionally sown so that there will have been some
selection from an extremely remote period but without any prefixed
standard of excellence or thought of the future we at the present day
profit by a course of selection occasionally and unconsciously carried
on during thousands of years this is proved in an interesting manner
by oswald heers researches on the lakeinhabitants of switzerland as
given in a former chapter for he shows that the grain and seed of our
present varieties of wheat barley oats peas beans lentils and
poppy exceed in size those which were cultivated in switzerland during
the neolithic and bronze periods these ancient people during the
neolithic period possessed also a crab considerably larger than that
now growing wild on the jura81 the pears described by pliny were
evidently extremely inferior in quality to our present pears we can
realise the effects of longcontinued selection and cultivation in
another way for would any one in his senses expect to raise a
firstrate apple from the seed of a truly wild crab or a luscious
melting pear from the wild pear alphonse de candolle informs me that
he has lately seen on an ancient mosaic at rome a representation of the
melon and as the rotnans who were such gourmands are silent on this
fruit he infers that the melon has been greatly ameliorated since the
classical period
coming to later times buffon82 on comparing the flowers fruit and
vegetables which were then cultivated with some excellent drawings made
a hundred and fifty years previously was struck with surprise at the
great improvement which had been effected and remarks that these
ancient flowers and vegetables would now be rejected not only by a
florist but by a village gardener since the time of buffon the work of
improvement has steadily and rapidly gone on every florist who
compares our present flowers with those figured in books published not
long since is astonished at the change a wellknown amateur83 in
speaking of the varieties of pelargonium raised by mr garth only
twentytwo years before remarks what a rage they excited surely we
had attained perfection it was said and now not one of the flowers of
those days will be looked at but none the less is the debt of
gratitude which we owe to those who saw what was to be done and did
it mr paul the wellknown horticulturist in writing of the same
flower84 says he remembers when young being delighted with the
portraits in sweets work but what are they in point of beauty
compared with the pelargoniums of this day here again nature did not
advance by leaps the improvement was gradual and if we had neglected
those very gradual advances we must have foregone the present grand
results how well this practical horticulturist appreciates and
illustrates the gradual and accumulative force of selection the dahlia
has advanced in beauty in a like manner the line of improvement being
guided by fashion and by the successive modifications which the flower
slowly underwent85 a steady and gradual change has been noticed in
many other flowers thus an old florist86 after describing the
leading varieties of the pink which were grown in 1813 adds the pinks
of those days would now be scarcely grown as borderflowers the
improvement of so many flowers and the number of the varieties which
have been raised is all the more striking when we hear that the
earliest known flowergarden in europe namely at padua dates only
from the year 154587
effects of selection as shown by the parts most valued by man
presenting the greatest amount of differencethe power of
longcontinued selection whether methodical or unconscious or both
combined is well shown in a general way namely by the comparison of
the differences between the varieties of distinct species which are
valued for different parts such as for the leaves or stems or
tubers the seed or fruit or flowers whatever part man values most
that part will be found to present the greatest amount of difference
with trees cultivated for their fruit sageret remarks that the fruit
is larger than in the parentspecies whilst with those cultivated for
the seed as with nuts walnuts almonds chestnuts etc it is the
seed itself which is larger and he accounts for this fact by the fruit
in the one case and by the seed in the other having been carefully
attended to and selected during many ages gallesio has made the same
observation godron insists on the diversity of the tuber in the
potato of the bulb in the onion and of the fruit in the melon and on
the close similarity of the other parts in these same plants88
in order to judge how far my own impression on this subject was
correct i cultivated numerous varieties of the same species close to
one another the comparison of the amount of difference between widely
different organs is necessarily vague i will therefore give the
results in only a few cases we have previously seen in the ninth
chapter how greatly the varieties of the cabbage differ in their
foliage and stems which are the selected parts and how closely they
resemble one another in their flowers capsules and seeds in seven
varieties of the radish the roots differed greatly in colour and
shape but no difference whatever could be detected in their foliage
flowers or seeds now what a contrast is presented if we compare the
flowers of the varieties of these two plants with those of any species
cultivated in our flowergardens for ornament or if we compare their
seeds with those of the varieties of maize peas beans etc which
are valued and cultivated for their seeds in the ninth chapter it was
shown that the varieties of the pea differ but little except in the
tallness of the plant moderately in the shape of the pod and greatly
in the pea itself and these are all selected points the varieties
however of the pois sans parchemin differ much more in their pods
and these are eaten and valued i cultivated twelve varieties of the
common bean one alone the dwarf fan differed considerably in general
appearance two differed in the colour of their flowers one being an
albino and the other being wholly instead of partially purple several
differed considerably in the shape and size of the pod but far more in
the bean itself and this is the valued and selected part tokers
bean for instance is twiceandahalf as long and broad as the
horsebean and is much thinner and of a different shape
the varieties of the gooseberry as formerly described differ much in
their fruit but hardly perceptibly in their flowers or organs of
vegetation with the plum the differences likewise appear to be
greater in the fruit than in the flowers or leaves on the other hand
the seed of the strawberry which corresponds with the fruit of the
plum differs hardly at all whilst every one knows how greatly the
fruitthat is the enlarged receptaclediffers in several varieties in
apples pears and peaches the flowers and leaves differ considerably
but not as far as i can judge in proportion with the fruit the
chinese doubleflowering peaches on the other hand show that
varieties of this tree have been formed which differ more in flower
than in fruit if as is highly probable the peach is the modified
descent of the almond a surprising amount of change has been effected
in the same species in the fleshy covering of the former and in the
kernels of the latter
when parts stand in close relationship to each other such as the seed
and the fleshy covering of the fruit whatever its homological nature
may be changes in the one are usually accompanied by modifications in
the other though not necessarily to the same degree with the
plumtree for instance some varieties produce plums which are nearly
alike but include stones extremely dissimilar in shape whilst
conversely other varieties produce dissimilar fruit with barely
distinguishable stones and generally the stones though they have
never been subjected to selection differ greatly in the several
varieties of the plum in other cases organs which are not manifestly
related through some unknown bond vary together and are consequently
liable without any intention on mans part to be simultaneously acted
on by selection thus the varieties of the stock matthiola have been
selected solely for the beauty of their flowers but the seeds differ
greatly in colour and somewhat in size varieties of the lettuce have
been selected solely on account of their leaves yet produce seeds
which likewise differ in colour generally through the law of
correlation when a variety differs greatly from its fellowvarieties
in any one character it differs to a certain extent in several other
characters i observed this fact when i cultivated together many
varieties of the same species for i used first to make a list of the
varieties which differed most from each other in their foliage and
manner of growth afterwards of those that differed most in their
flowers then in their seedcapsules and lastly in their mature seed
and i found that the same names generally occurred in two three or
four of the successive lists nevertheless the greatest amount of
difference between the varieties was always exhibited as far as i
could judge by that part or organ for which the plant was cultivated
when we bear in mind that each plant was at first cultivated because
useful to man and that its variation was a subsequent often a long
subsequent event we cannot explain the greater amount of diversity in
the valuable parts by supposing that species endowed with an especial
tendency to vary in any particular manner were originally chosen we
must attribute the result to the variations in these parts having been
successively preserved and thus continually augmented whilst other
variations excepting such as inevitably appeared through correlation
were neglected and lost we may therefore infer that most plants might
be made through longcontinued selection to yield races as different
from one another in any character as they now are in those parts for
which they are valued and cultivated
with animals we see nothing of the same kind but a sufficient number
of species have not been domesticated for a fair comparison sheep are
valued for their wool and the wool differs much more in the several
races than the hair in cattle neither sheep goats european cattle
nor pigs are valued for their fleetness or strength and we do not
possess breeds differing in these respects like the racehorse and
drayhorse but fleetness and strength are valued in camels and dogs
and we have with the former the swift dromedary and heavy camel with
the latter the greyhound and mastiff but dogs are valued even in a
higher degree for their mental qualities and senses and every one
knows how greatly the races differ in these respects on the other
hand where the dog is kept solely to serve for food as in the
polynesian islands and china it is described as an extremely stupid
animal89 blumenbach remarks that many dogs such as the badgerdog
have a build so marked and so appropriate for particular purposes that
i should find it very difficult to persuade myself that this
astonishing figure was an accidental consequence of degeneration90
had blumenbach reflected on the great principle of selection he would
not have used the term degeneration and he would not have been
astonished that dogs and other animals should become excellently
adapted for the service of man
on the whole we may conclude that whatever part or character is most
valuedwhether the leaves stems tubers bulbs flowers fruit or
seed of plants or the size strength fleetness hairy covering or
intellect of animalsthat character will almost invariably be found to
present the greatest amount of difference both in kind and degree and
this result may be safely attributed to man having preserved during a
long course of generations the variations which were useful to him and
neglected the others
i will conclude this chapter by some remarks on an important subject
with animals such as the giraffe of which the whole structure is
admirably coordinated for certain purposes it has been supposed that
all the parts must have been simultaneously modified and it has been
argued that on the principle of natural selection this is scarcely
possible but in thus arguing it has been tacitly assumed that the
variations must have been abrupt and great no doubt if the neck of a
ruminant were suddenly to become greatly elongated the fore limbs and
back would have to be simultaneously strengthened and modified but it
cannot be denied that an animal might have its neck or head or
tongue or forelimbs elongated a very little without any corresponding
modification in other parts of the body and animals thus slightly
modified would during a dearth have a slight advantage and be
enabled to browse on higher twigs and thus survive a few mouthfuls
more or less every day would make all the difference between life and
death by the repetition of the same process and by the occasional
intercrossing of the survivors there would be some progress slow and
fluctuating though it would be towards the admirably coordinated
structure of the giraffe if the shortfaced tumblerpigeon with its
small conical beak globular head rounded body short wings and small
feetcharacters which appear all in harmonyhad been a natural species
its whole structure would have been viewed as well fitted for its life
but in this case we know that inexperienced breeders are urged to
attend to point after point and not to attempt improving the whole
structure at the same time look at the greyhound that perfect image
of grace symmetry and vigour no natural species can boast of a more
admirably coordinated structure with its tapering head slim body
deep chest tuckedup abdomen ratlike tail and long muscular limbs
all adapted for extreme fleetness and for running down weak prey now
from what we see of the variability of animals and from what we know
of the method which different men follow in improving their stocksome
chiefly attending to one point others to another point others again
correcting defects by crosses and so forthwe may feel assured that if
we could see the long line of ancestors of a firstrate greyhound up to
its wild wolflike progenitor we should behold an infinite number of
the finest gradations sometimes in one character and sometimes in
another but all leading towards our present perfect type by small and
doubtful steps such as these nature as we may confidently believe
has progressed on her grand march of improvement and development
a similar line of reasoning is as applicable to separate organs as to
the whole organisation a writer91 has recently maintained that it
is probably no exaggeration to suppose that in order to improve such an
organ as the eye at all it must be improved in ten different ways at
once and the improbability of any complex organ being produced and
brought to perfection in any such way is an improbability of the same
kind and degree as that of producing a poem or a mathematical
demonstration by throwing letters at random on a table if the eye
were abruptly and greatly modified no doubt many parts would have to
be simultaneously altered in order that the organ should remain
serviceable
but is this the case with smaller changes there are persons who can
see distinctly only in a dull light and this condition depends i
believe on the abnormal sensitiveness of the retina and is known to
be inherited now if a bird for instance receive some great advantage
from seeing well in the twilight all the individuals with the most
sensitive retina would succeed best and be the most likely to survive
and why should not all those which happened to have the eye itself a
little larger or the pupil capable of greater dilatation be likewise
preserved whether or not these modifications were strictly
simultaneous these individuals would subsequently intercross and blend
their respective advantages by such slight successive changes the eye
of a diurnal bird would be brought into the condition of that of an
owl which has often been advanced as an excellent instance of
adaptation shortsight which is often inherited permits a person to
see distinctly a minute object at so near a distance that it would be
indistinct to ordinary eyes and here we have a capacity which might be
serviceable under certain conditions abruptly gained the fuegians on
board the beagle could certainly see distant objects more distinctly
than our sailors with all their long practice i do not know whether
this depends upon sensitiveness or on the power of adjustment in the
focus but this capacity for distant vision might it is probable be
slightly augmented by successive modifications of either kind
amphibious animals which are enabled to see both in the water and in
the air require and possess as m plateau has shown92 eyes
constructed on the following plan the cornea is always flat or at
least much flattened in the front of the crystalline and over a space
equal to the diameter of that lens whilst the lateral portions may be
much curved the crystalline is very nearly a sphere and the humours
have nearly the same density as water now as a terrestrial animal
became more and more aquatic in its habits very slight changes first
in the curvature of the cornea or crystalline and then in the density
of the humours or conversely might successively occur and would be
advantageous to the animal whilst under water without serious
detriment to its power of vision in the air it is of course impossible
to conjecture by what steps the fundamental structure of the eye in the
vertebrata was originally acquired for we know nothing about this
organ in the first progenitors of the class with respect to the lowest
animals in the scale the transitional states through which the eye at
first probably passed can by the aid of analogy be indicated as i
have attempted to show in my origin of species93

power of selectionlapse of time importantmanner in which domestic
races have originatedsummary
natural selection or the survival of the fittest as affecting
domestic productionswe know little on this head but as animals kept
by savages have to provide throughout the year their own food either
entirely or to a large extent it can hardly be doubted that in
different countries varieties differing in constitution and in various
characters would succeed best and so be naturally selected hence
perhaps it is that the few domesticated animals kept by savages
partake as has been remarked by more than one writer of the wild
appearance of their masters and likewise resemble natural species
even in longcivilised countries at least in the wilder parts natural
selection must act on our domestic races it is obvious that varieties
having very different habits constitution and structure would
succeed best on mountains and on rich lowland pastures for example
the improved leicester sheep were formerly taken to the lammermuir
hills but an intelligent sheepmaster reported that our coarse lean
pastures were unequal to the task of supporting such heavybodied
sheep and they gradually dwindled away into less and less bulk each
generation was inferior to the preceding one and when the spring was
severe seldom more than twothirds of the lambs survived the ravages
of the storms1 so with the mountain cattle of north wales and the
hebrides it has been found that they could not withstand being crossed
with the larger and more delicate lowland breeds two french
naturalists in describing the horses of circassia remark that
subjected as they are to extreme vicissitudes of climate having to
search for scanty pasture and exposed to constant danger from wolves
the strongest and most vigorous alone survive2
every one must have been struck with the surpassing grace strength
and vigour of the gamecock with its bold and confident air its long
yet firm neck compact body powerful and closely pressed wings
muscular thighs strong beak massive at the base dense and sharp spurs
set low on the legs for delivering the fatal blow and its compact
glossy and maillike plumage serving as a defence now the english
gamecock has not only been improved during many years by mans careful
selection but in addition as mr tegetmeier has remarked3 by a
kind of natural selection for the strongest most active and
courageous birds have stricken down their antagonists in the cockpit
generation after generation and have subsequently served as the
progenitors of their race the same kind of double selection has come
into play with the carrier pigeon for during their training the
inferior birds fail to return home and are lost so that even without
selection by man only the superior birds propagate their race
in great britain in former times almost every district had its own
breed of cattle and sheep they were indigenous to the soil climate
and pasturage of the locality on which they grazed they seemed to have
been formed for it and by it4 but in this case we are quite unable
to disentangle the effects of the direct action of the conditions of
lifeof use or habitof natural selectionand of that kind of
selection which we have seen is occasionally and unconsciously followed
by man even during the rudest periods of history
let us now look to the action of natural selection on special
characters although nature is difficult to resist yet man often
strives against her power and sometimes with success from the facts
to be given it will also be seen that natural selection would
powerfully affect many of our domestic productions if left unprotected
this is a point of much interest for we thus learn that differences
apparently of very slight importance would certainly determine the
survival of a form when forced to struggle for its own existence it
may have occurred to some naturalists as it formerly did to me that
though selection acting under natural conditions would determine the
structure of all important organs yet that it could not affect
characters which are esteemed by us of little importance but this is
an error to which we are eminently liable from our ignorance of what
characters are of real value to each living creature
when man attempts to make a breed with some serious defect in
structure or in the mutual relation of the several parts he will
partly or completely fail or encounter much difficulty he is in fact
resisted by a form of natural selection we have seen that an attempt
was once made in yorkshire to breed cattle with enormous buttocks but
the cows perished so often in bringing forth their calves that the
attempt had to be given up in rearing shortfaced tumblers mr eaton
says5 i am convinced that better head and beak birds have perished
in the shell than ever were hatched the reason being that the
amazingly shortfaced bird cannot reach and break the shell with its
beak and so perishes here is a more curious case in which natural
selection comes into play only at long intervals of time during
ordinary seasons the niata cattle can graze as well as others but
occasionally as from 1827 to 1830 the plains of la plata suffer from
longcontinued droughts and the pasture is burnt up at such times
common cattle and horses perish by the thousand but many survive by
browsing on twigs reeds etc this the niata cattle cannot so well
effect from their upturned jaws and the shape of their lips
consequently if not attended to they perish before the other cattle
in columbia according to roulin there is a breed of nearly hairless
cattle called pelones these succeed in their native hot district but
are found too tender for the cordillera in this case however natural
selection determines only the range of the variety it is obvious that
a host of artificial races could never survive in a state of
naturesuch as italian greyhoundshairless and almost toothless
turkish dogsfantail pigeons which cannot fly well against a strong
windbarbs and polish fowls with their vision impeded by their eye
wattles and great topknotshornless bulls and rams which consequently
cannot cope with other males and thus have a poor chance of leaving
offspringseedless plants and many other such cases
colour is generally esteemed by the systematic naturalist as
unimportant let us therefore see how far it indirectly affects our
domestic productions and how far it would affect them if they were
left exposed to the full force of natural selection in a future
chapter i shall have to show that constitutional peculiarities of the
strangest kind entailing liability to the action of certain poisons
are correlated with the colour of the skin i will here give a single
case on the high authority of professor wyman he informs me that
being surprised at all the pigs in a part of virginia being black he
made inquiries and ascertained that these animals feed on the roots of
the lachnanthes tinctoria which colours their bones pink and
excepting in the case of the black varieties causes the hoofs to drop
off hence as one of the squatters remarked we select the black
members of the litter for raising as they alone have a good chance of
living so that here we have artificial and natural selection working
hand in hand i may add that in the tarentino the inhabitants keep
black sheep alone because the hypericum crispum abounds there and
this plant does not injure black sheep but kills the white ones in
about a fortnights time6
complexion and liability to certain diseases are believed to run
together in man and the lower animals thus white terriers suffer more
than those of any other colour from the fatal distemper7 in north
america plumtrees are liable to a disease which downing8 believes is
not caused by insects the kinds bearing purple fruit are most
affected and we have never known the green or yellow fruited
varieties infected until the other sorts had first become filled with
the knots on the other hand peaches in north america suffer much
from a disease called the yellows which seems to be peculiar to that
continent and more than ninetenths of the victims when the disease
first appeared were the yellowfleshed peaches the whitefleshed
kinds are much more rarely attacked in some parts of the country
never in mauritius the white sugarcanes have of late years been so
severely attacked by a disease that many planters have been compelled
to give up growing this variety although fresh plants were imported
from china for trial and cultivate only red canes9 now if these
plants had been forced to struggle with other competing plants and
enemies there cannot be a doubt that the colour of the flesh or skin
of the fruit unimportant as these characters are considered would
have rigorously determined their existence
liability to the attacks of parasites is also connected with colour
white chickens are certainly more subject than darkcoloured chickens
to the gapes which is caused by a parasitic worm in the trachea10
on the other hand experience has shown that in france the caterpillars
which produce white cocoons resist the deadly fungus better than those
producing yellow cocoons11 analogous facts have been observed with
plants a new and beautiful white onion imported from france though
planted close to other kinds was alone attacked by a parasitic
fungus12 white verbenas are especially liable to mildew13 near
malaga during an early period of the vinedisease the green sorts
suffered most and red and black grapes even when interwoven with the
sick plants suffered not at all in france whole groups of varieties
were comparatively free and others such as the chasselas did not
afford a single fortunate exception but i do not know whether any
correlation between colour and liability to disease was here
observed14 in a former chapter it was shown how curiously liable one
variety of the strawberry is to mildew
it is certain that insects regulate in many cases the range and even
the existence of the higher animals whilst living under their natural
conditions under domestication lightcoloured animals suffer most in
thuringia15 the inhabitants do not like grey white or pale cattle
because they are much more troubled by various kinds of flies than the
brown red or black cattle an albino negro it has been remarked16
was peculiarly sensitive to the bites of insects in the west
indies17 it is said that the only horned cattle fit for work are
those which have a good deal of black in them the white are terribly
tormented by the insects and they are weak and sluggish in proportion
to the white
in devonshire there is a prejudice against white pigs because it is
believed that the sun blisters them when turned out18 and i knew a
man who would not keep white pigs in kent for the same reason the
scorching of flowers by the sun seems likewise to depend much on
colour thus dark pelargoniums suffer most and from various accounts
it is clear that the clothofgold variety will not withstand a degree
of exposure to sunshine which other varieties enjoy another amateur
asserts that not only all darkcoloured verbenas but likewise
scarlets suffer from the sun the paler kinds stand better and pale
blue is perhaps the best of all so again with the heartsease viola
tricolor hot weather suits the blotched sorts whilst it destroys
the beautiful markings of some other kinds19 during one extremely
cold season in holland all redflowered hyacinths were observed to be
very inferior in quality it is believed by many agriculturists that
red wheat is hardier in northern climates than white wheat20
with animals white varieties from being conspicuous are the most
liable to be attacked by beasts and birds of prey in parts of france
and germany where hawks abound persons are advised not to keep white
pigeons for as parmentier says it is certain that in a flock the
white always first fall victims to the kite in belgium where so many
societies have been established for the flight of carrierpigeons
white is the one colour which for the same reason is disliked21
prof g jaeger22 whilst fishing found four pigeons which had been
killed by hawks and all were white on another occasion he examined
the eyrie of a hawk and the feathers of the pigeons which had been
caught were all of a white or yellow colour on the other hand it is
said that the seaeagle falco ossifragus linn on the west coast
of ireland picks out the black fowls so that the villagers avoid as
much as possible rearing birds of that colour m daudin23 speaking
of white rabbits kept in warrens in russia remarks that their colour
is a great disadvantage as they are thus more exposed to attack and
can be seen during bright nights from a distance a gentleman in kent
who failed to stock his woods with a nearly white and hardy kind of
rabbit accounted in the same manner for their early disappearance any
one who will watch a white cat prowling after her prey will soon
perceive under what a disadvantage she lies
the white tartarian cherry owing either to its colour being so much
like that of the leaves or to the fruit always appearing from a
distance unripe is not so readily attacked by birds as other sorts
the yellowfruited raspberry which generally comes nearly true by
seed is very little molested by birds who evidently are not fond of
it so that nets may be dispensed with in places where nothing else
will protect the red fruit24 this immunity though a benefit to the
gardener would be a disadvantage in a state of nature both to the
cherry and raspberry as dissemination depends on birds i noticed
during several winters that some trees of the yellowberried holly
which were raised from seed from a tree found wild by my father
remained covered with fruit whilst not a scarlet berry could be seen
on the adjoining trees of the common kind a friend informs me that a
mountainash pyrus aucuparia growing in his garden bears berries
which though not differently coloured are always devoured by birds
before those on the other trees this variety of the mountainash would
thus be more freely disseminated and the yellowberried variety of the
holly less freely than the common varieties of these two trees
independently of colour trifling differences are sometimes found to be
of importance to plants under cultivation and would be of paramount
importance if they had to fight their own battle and to struggle with
many competitors the thinshelled peas called pois sans parchemin
are attacked by birds25 much more commonly than ordinary peas on the
other hand the purplepodded pea which has a hard shell escaped the
attacks of tomtits parus major in my garden far better than any
other kind the thinshelled walnut likewise suffers greatly from the
tomtit26 these same birds have been observed to pass over and thus
favour the filbert destroying only the other kinds of nuts which grew
in the same orchard27
certain varieties of the pear have soft bark and these suffer severely
from woodboring beetles whilst other varieties are known to resist
their attacks much better28 in north america the smoothness or
absence of down on the fruit makes a great difference in the attacks
of the weevil which is the uncompromising foe of all smooth
stonefruits and the cultivator has the frequent mortification of
seeing nearly all or indeed often the whole crop fall from the trees
when half or twothirds grown hence the nectarine suffers more than
the peach a particular variety of the morello cherry raised in north
america is without any assignable cause more liable to be injured by
this same insect than other cherrytrees29 from some unknown cause
certain varieties of the apple enjoy as we have seen the great
advantage in various parts of the world of not being infested by the
coccus on the other hand a particular case has been recorded in which
aphides confined themselves to the winter nelis pear and touched no
other kind in an extensive orchard30 the existence of minute glands
on the leaves of peaches nectarines and apricots would not be
esteemed by botanists as a character of the least importance for they
are present or absent in closelyrelated subvarieties descended from
the same parenttree yet there is good evidence31 that the absence
of glands leads to mildew which is highly injurious to these trees
a difference either in flavour or in the amount of nutriment in certain
varieties causes them to be more eagerly attacked by various enemies
than other varieties of the same species bullfinches pyrrhula
vulgaris injure our fruittrees by devouring the flowerbuds and a
pair of these birds have been seen to denude a large plumtree in a
couple of days of almost every bud but certain varieties32 of the
apple and thorn cratgus oxyacantha are more especially liable to
be attacked a striking instance of this was observed in mr riverss
garden in which two rows of a particular variety of plum33 had to be
carefully protected as they were usually stripped of all their buds
during the winter whilst other sorts growing near them escaped the
root or enlarged stem of laings swedish turnip is preferred by
hares and therefore suffers more than other varieties hares and
rabbits eat down common rye before st johnsdayrye when both grow
together34 in the south of france when an orchard of almondtrees
is formed the nuts of the bitter variety are sown in order that they
may not be devoured by fieldmice35 so we see the use of the bitter
principle in almonds
other slight differences which would be thought quite unimportant are
no doubt sometimes of great service both to plants and animals the
whitesmiths gooseberry as formerly stated produces its leaves later
than other varieties and as the flowers are thus left unprotected
the fruit often fails in one variety of the cherry according to mr
rivers36 the petals are much curled backwards and in consequence of
this the stigmas were observed to be killed by a severe frost whilst
at the same time in another variety with incurved petals the stigmas
were not in the least injured the straw of the fenton wheat is
remarkably unequal in height and a competent observer believes that
this variety is highly productive partly because the ears from being
distributed at various heights above the ground are less crowded
together the same observer maintains that in the upright varieties the
divergent awns are serviceable by breaking the shocks when the ears are
dashed together by the wind37 if several varieties of a plant are
grown together and the seed is indiscriminately harvested it is clear
that the hardier and more productive kinds will by a sort of natural
selection gradually prevail over the others this takes place as
colonel le couteur believes38 in our wheatfields for as formerly
shown no variety is quite uniform in character the same thing as i
am assured by nurserymen would take place in our flowergardens if
the seed of the different varieties were not separately saved when the
eggs of the wild and tame duck are hatched together the young wild
ducks almost invariably perish from being of smaller size and not
getting their fair share of food39
facts in sufficient number have now been given showing that natural
selection often checks but occasionally favours mans power of
selection these facts teach us in addition a valuable lesson
namely that we ought to be extremely cautious in judging what
characters are of importance in a state of nature to animals and
plants which have to struggle for existence from the hour of their
birth to that of their deaththeir existence depending on conditions
about which we are profoundly ignorant
      circumstances favourable to selection by man
the possibility of selection rests on variability and this as we
shall see in the following chapters mainly depends on changed
conditions of life but is governed by infinitely complex and unknown
laws domestication even when long continued occasionally causes but
a small amount of variability as in the case of the goose and turkey
the slight differences however which characterise each individual
animal and plant would in most probably in all cases suffice for the
production of distinct races through careful and prolonged selection
we see what selection though acting on mere individual differences
can effect when families of cattle sheep pigeons etc of the same
race have been separately bred during a number of years by different
men without any wish on their part to modify the breed we see the same
fact in the difference between hounds bred for hunting in different
districts40 and in many other such cases
in order that selection should produce any result it is manifest that
the crossing of distinct races must be prevented hence facility in
pairing as with the pigeon is highly favourable for the work and
difficulty in pairing as with cats prevents the formation of distinct
breeds on nearly the same principle the cattle of the small island of
jersey have been improved in their milking qualities with a rapidity
that could not have been obtained in a widely extended country like
france41 although free crossing is a danger on the one side which
every one can see too close interbreeding is a hidden danger on the
other side unfavourable conditions of life overrule the power of
selection our improved heavy breeds of cattle and sheep could not have
been formed on mountainous pastures nor could drayhorses have been
raised on a barren and inhospitable land such as the falkland islands
where even the light horses of la plata rapidly decrease in size it
seems impossible to preserve several english breeds of sheep in france
for as soon as the lambs are weaned their vigour decays as the heat of
the summer increases42 it would be impossible to give great length
of wool to sheep within the tropics yet selection has kept the merino
breed nearly true under diversified and unfavourable conditions the
power of selection is so great that breeds of the dog sheep and
poultry of the largest and smallest size long and short beaked
pigeons and other breeds with opposite characters have had their
characteristic qualities augmented though treated in every way alike
being exposed to the same climate and fed on the same food selection
however is either checked or favoured by the effects of use or habit
our wonderfullyimproved pigs could never have been formed if they had
been forced to search for their own food the english racehorse and
greyhound could not have been improved up to their present high
standard of excellence without constant training
as conspicuous deviations of structure occur rarely the improvement of
each breed is generally the result of the selection of slight
individual differences hence the closest attention the sharpest
powers of observation and indomitable perseverance are indispensable
it is also highly important that many individuals of the breed which
is to be improved should be raised for thus there will be a better
chance of the appearance of variations in the right direction and
individuals varying in an unfavourable manner may be freely rejected or
destroyed but that a large number of individuals should be raised it
is necessary that the conditions of life should favour the propagation
of the species had the peacock been reared as easily as the fowl we
should probably ere this have had many distinct races we see the
importance of a large number of plants from the fact of nursery
gardeners almost always beating amateurs in the exhibition of new
varieties in 1845 it was estimated43 that between 4000 and 5000
pelargoniums were annually raised from seed in england yet a decidedly
improved variety is rarely obtained at messrs carters grounds in
essex where such flowers as the lobelia nemophila mignonette etc
are grown by the acre for seed scarcely a season passes without some
new kinds being raised or some improvement effected on old kinds44
at kew as mr beaton remarks where many seedlings of common plants
are raised you see new forms of laburnums spiraeas and other
shrubs45 so with animals marshall46 in speaking of the sheep in
one part of yorkshire remarks as they belong to poor people and are
mostly in small lots they never can be improved lord rivers when
asked how he succeeded in always having firstrate greyhounds
answered i breed many and hang many this as another man remarks
was the secret of his success and the same will be found in
exhibiting fowls successful competitors breed largely and keep the
best47
it follows from this that the capacity of breeding at an early age and
at short intervals as with pigeons rabbits etc facilitates
selection for the result is thus soon made visible and perseverance
in the work encouraged it can hardly be an accident that the great
majority of the culinary and agricultural plants which have yielded
numerous races are annuals or biennials which therefore are capable of
rapid propagation and thus of improvement seakale asparagus common
and jerusalem artichokes potatoes and onions must be excepted as
they are perennials but onions are propagated like annuals and of the
other plants just specified none with the exception of the potato
have yielded in this country more than one or two varieties in the
mediterranean region where artichokes are often raised from seed
there are several kinds as i hear from mr bentham no doubt
fruittrees which cannot be propagated quickly by seed have yielded a
host of varieties though not permanent races but these judging from
prehistoric remains have been produced at a comparatively late period
a species may be highly variable but distinct races will not be
formed if from any cause selection be not applied it would be
difficult to select slight variations in fishes from their place of
habitation and though the carp is extremely variable and is much
attended to in germany only one wellmarked race has been formed as i
hear from lord a russell namely the spiegelcarpe and this is
carefully secluded from the common scaly kind on the other hand a
closely allied species the goldfish from being reared in small
vessels and from having been carefully attended to by the chinese has
yielded many races neither the bee which has been semidomesticated
from an extremely remote period nor the cochineal insect which was
cultivated by the aboriginal mexicans48 has yielded races and it
would be impossible to match the queenbee with any particular drone
and most difficult to match cochineal insects silkmoths on the other
hand have been subjected to rigorous selection and have produced a
host of races cats which from their nocturnal habits cannot be
selected for breeding do not as formerly remarked yield distinct
races within the same country dogs are held in abomination in the
east and their breeding is neglected consequently as prof moritz
wagner49 remarks one kind alone exists there the ass in england
varies much in colour and size but as it is an animal of little value
and bred by poor people there has been no selection and distinct
races have not been formed we must not attribute the inferiority of
our asses to climate for in india they are of even smaller size than
in europe but when selection is brought to bear on the ass all is
changed near cordova as i am informed feb 1860 by mr w e webb
ce they are carefully bred as much as 200l having been paid for
a stallion ass and they have been immensely improved in kentucky
asses have been imported for breeding mules from spain malta and
france these seldom averaged more than fourteen hands high but the
kentuckians by great care have raised them up to fifteen hands and
sometimes even to sixteen the prices paid for these splendid animals
for such they really are will prove how much they are in request one
male of great celebrity was sold for upwards of one thousand pounds
sterling these choice asses are sent to cattleshows a day being
given for their exhibition50
analogous facts have been observed with plants the nutmegtree in the
malay archipelago is highly variable but there has been no selection
and there are no distinct races51 the common mignonette reseda
odorata from bearing inconspicuous flowers valued solely for their
fragrance remains in the same unimproved condition as when first
introduced52 our common foresttrees are very variable as may be
seen in every extensive nurseryground but as they are not valued like
fruittrees and as they seed late in life no selection has been
applied to them consequently as mr patrick matthews remarks53
they have not yielded distinct races leafing at different periods
growing to different sizes and producing timber fit for different
purposes we have gained only some fanciful and semimonstrous
varieties which no doubt appeared suddenly as we now see them
some botanists have argued that plants cannot have so strong a tendency
to vary as is generally supposed because many species long grown in
botanic gardens or unintentionally cultivated year after year mingled
with our corn crops have not produced distinct races but this is
accounted for by slight variations not having been selected and
propagated let a plant which is now grown in a botanic garden or any
common weed be cultivated on a large scale and let a sharpsighted
gardener look out for each slight variety and sow the seed and then
if distinct races are not produced the argument will be valid
the importance of selection is likewise shown by considering special
characters for instance with most breeds of fowls the form of the
comb and the colour of the plumage have been attended to and are
eminently characteristic of each race but in dorkings fashion has
never demanded uniformity of comb or colour and the utmost diversity
in these respects prevails rosecombs doublecombs cupcombs etc
and colours of all kinds may be seen in purely bred and closely
related dorking fowls whilst other points such as the general form of
body and the presence of an additional toe have been attended to and
are invariably present it has also been ascertained that colour can be
fixed in this breed as well as in any other54
during the formation or improvement of a breed its members will always
be found to vary much in those characters to which especial attention
is directed and of which each slight improvement is eagerly sought and
selected thus with shortfaced tumblerpigeons the shortness of the
beak shape of head and plumagewith carriers the length of the beak
and wattlewith fantails the tail and carriagewith spanish fowls
the white face and combwith longeared rabbits the length of ear
are all points which are eminently variable so it is in every case
and the large price paid for firstrate animals proves the difficulty
of breeding them up to the highest standard of excellence this subject
has been discussed by fanciers55 and the greater prizes given for
highly improved breeds in comparison with those given for old breeds
which are not now undergoing rapid improvement have been fully
justified nathusius makes56 a similar remark when discussing the
less uniform character of improved shorthorn cattle and of the english
horse in comparison for example with the unennobled cattle of
hungary or with the horses of the asiatic steppes this want of
uniformity in the parts which at the time are undergoing selection
chiefly depends on the strength of the principle of reversion but it
likewise depends to a certain extent on the continued variability of
the parts which have recently varied that the same parts do continue
varying in the same manner we must admit for if it were not so there
could be no improvement beyond an early standard of excellence and we
know that such improvement is not only possible but is of general
occurrence
as a consequence of continued variability and more especially of
reversion all highly improved races if neglected or not subjected to
incessant selection soon degenerate youatt gives a curious instance
of this in some cattle formerly kept in glamorganshire but in this
case the cattle were not fed with sufficient care mr baker in his
memoir on the horse sums up it must have been observed in the
preceding pages that whenever there has been neglect the breed has
proportionally deteriorated57 if a considerable number of improved
cattle sheep or other animals of the same race were allowed to breed
freely together with no selection but with no change in their
condition of life there can be no doubt that after a score or hundred
generations they would be very far from excellent of their kind but
from what we see of the many common races of dogs cattle fowls
pigeons etc which without any particular care have long retained
nearly the same character we have no grounds for believing that they
would altogether depart from their type
it is a general belief amongst breeders that characters of all kinds
become fixed by longcontinued inheritance but i have attempted to
show in the fourteenth chapter that this belief apparently resolves
itself into the following proposition namely that all characters
whatever whether recently acquired or ancient tend to be transmitted
but that those which have already long withstood all counteracting
influences will as a general rule continue to withstand them and
consequently be faithfully transmitted
      tendency in man to carry the practice of selection to an extreme
      point
it is an important principle that in the process of selection man
almost invariably wishes to go to an extreme point thus there is no
limit to his desire to breed certain kinds of horses and dogs as fleet
as possible and others as strong as possible certain kinds of sheep
for extreme fineness and others for extreme length of wool and he
wishes to produce fruit grain tubers and other useful parts of
plants as large and excellent as possible with animals bred for
amusement the same principle is even more powerful for fashion as we
see in our dress always runs to extremes this view has been expressly
admitted by fanciers instances were given in the chapters on the
pigeon but here is another mr eaton after describing a
comparatively new variety namely the archangel remarks what
fanciers intend doing with this bird i am at a loss to know whether
they intend to breed it down to the tumblers head and beak or carry
it out to the carriers head and beak leaving it as they found it is
not progressing ferguson speaking of fowls says their
peculiarities whatever they may be must necessarily be fully
developed a little peculiarity forms nought but ugliness seeing it
violates the existing laws of symmetry so mr brent in discussing
the merits of the subvarieties of the belgian canarybird remarks
fanciers always go to extremes they do not admire indefinite
properties58
this principle which necessarily leads to divergence of character
explains the present state of various domestic races we can thus see
how it is that racehorses and drayhorses greyhounds and mastiffs
which are opposed to each other in every characterhow varieties so
distinct as cochinchina fowls and bantams or carrierpigeons with
very long beaks and tumblers with excessively short beaks have been
derived from the same stock as each breed is slowly improved the
inferior varieties are first neglected and finally lost in a few
cases by the aid of old records or from intermediate varieties still
existing in countries where other fashions have prevailed we are
enabled partially to trace the graduated changes through which certain
breeds have passed selection whether methodical or unconscious
always tending towards an extreme point together with the neglect and
slow extinction of the intermediate and lessvalued forms is the key
which unlocks the mystery of how man has produced such wonderful
results
in a few instances selection guided by utility for a single purpose
has led to convergence of character all the improved and different
races of the pig as nathusius has well shown59 closely approach
each other in character in their shortened legs and muzzles their
almost hairless large rounded bodies and small tusks we see some
degree of convergence in the similar outline of the body in wellbred
cattle belonging to distinct races60 i know of no other such cases
continued divergence of character depends on and is indeed a clear
proof as previously remarked of the same parts continuing to vary in
the same direction the tendency to mere general variability or
plasticity of organisation can certainly be inherited even from one
parent as has been shown by grtner and klreuter in the production
of varying hybrids from two species of which one alone was variable
it is in itself probable that when an organ has varied in any manner
it will again vary in the same manner if the conditions which first
caused the being to vary remain as far as can be judged the same
this is either tacitly or expressly admitted by all horticulturists if
a gardener observes one or two additional petals in a flower he feels
confident that in a few generations he will be able to raise a double
flower crowded with petals some of the seedlings from the weeping
moccas oak were so prostrate that they only crawled along the ground a
seedling from the fastigiate or upright irish yew is described as
differing greatly from the parentform by the exaggeration of the
fastigiate habit of its branches61 mr shirreff who has been
highly successful in raising new kinds of wheat remarks a good
variety may safely be regarded as the forerunner of a better one62
a great rosegrower mr rivers has made the same remark with respect
to roses sageret63 who had large experience in speaking of the
future progress of fruittrees observes that the most important
principle is that the more plants have departed from their original
type the more they tend to depart from it there is apparently much
truth in this remark for we can in no other way understand the
surprising amount of difference between varieties in the parts or
qualities which are valued whilst other parts retain nearly their
original character
the foregoing discussion naturally leads to the question what is the
limit to the possible amount of variation in any part or quality and
consequently is there any limit to what selection can effect will a
racehorse ever be reared fleeter than eclipse can our prizecattle and
sheep be still further improved will a gooseberry ever weigh more than
that produced by london in 1852 will the beetroot in france yield a
greater percentage of sugar will future varieties of wheat and other
grain produce heavier crops than our present varieties these questions
cannot be positively answered but it is certain that we ought to be
cautious in answering them by a negative in some lines of variation
the limit has probably been reached youatt believes that the reduction
of bone in some of our sheep has already been carried so far that it
entails great delicacy of constitution64 but seeing the great
improvement within recent times in our cattle and sheep and especially
in our pigs seeing the wonderful increase in weight in our poultry of
all kinds during the last few years he would be a bold man who would
assert that perfection has been reached it has often been said that
eclipse never was and never will be beaten in speed by any other
horse but on making inquiries i find that the best judges believe that
our present racehorses are fleeter65 the attempt to raise a new
variety of wheat more productive than the many old kinds might have
been thought until lately quite hopeless but this has been effected by
major hallett by careful selection with respect to almost all our
animals and plants those who are best qualified to judge do not
believe that the extreme point of perfection has yet been reached even
in the characters which have already been carried to a high standard
for instance the shortfaced tumblerpigeon has been greatly modified
nevertheless according to mr eaton66 the field is still as open
for fresh competitors as it was one hundred years ago over and over
again it has been said that perfection had been attained with our
flowers but a higher standard has soon been reached hardly any fruit
has been more improved than the strawberry yet a great authority
remarks67 it must not be concealed that we are far from the extreme
limits at which we may arrive
no doubt there is a limit beyond which the organisation cannot be
modified compatibly with health or life the extreme degree of
fleetness for instance of which a terrestrial animal is capable may
have been acquired by our present racehorses but as mr wallace has
well remarked68 the question that interests us is not whether
indefinite and unlimited change in any or all directions is possible
but whether such differences as do occur in nature could have been
produced by the accumulation of varieties by selection and in the
case of our domestic productions there can be no doubt that many parts
of the organisation to which man has attended have been thus modified
to a greater degree than the corresponding parts in the natural species
of the same genera or even families we see this in the form and size
of our light and heavy dogs or horsesin the beak and many other
characters of our pigeonsin the size and quality of many fruitsin
comparison with the species belonging to the same natural groups
time is an important element in the formation of our domestic races as
it permits innumerable individuals to be born and these when exposed
to diversified conditions are rendered variable methodical selection
has been occasionally practised from an ancient period to the present
day even by semicivilised people and during former times will have
produced some effect unconscious selection will have been still more
effective for during a lengthened period the more valuable individual
animals will occasionally have been saved and the less valuable
neglected in the course of time different varieties especially in
the less civilised countries will also have been more or less modified
through natural selection it is generally believed though on this
head we have little or no evidence that new characters in time become
fixed and after having long remained fixed it seems possible that
under new conditions they might again be rendered variable
how great the lapse of time has been since man first domesticated
animals and cultivated plants we begin dimly to see when the
lakedwellings of switzerland were inhabited during the neolithic
period several animals were already domesticated and various plants
cultivated the science of language tells us that the art of ploughing
and sowing the land was followed and the chief animals had been
already domesticated at an epoch so immensely remote that the
sanskrit greek latin gothic celtic and sclavonic languages had not
as yet diverged from their common parenttongue69
it is scarcely possible to overrate the effects of selection
occasionally carried on in various ways and places during thousands of
generations all that we know and in a still stronger degree all
that we do not know70 of the history of the great majority of our
breeds even of our more modern breeds agrees with the view that their
production through the action of unconscious and methodical selection
has been almost insensibly slow when a man attends rather more closely
than is usual to the breeding of his animals he is almost sure to
improve them to a slight extent they are in consequence valued in his
immediate neighbourhood and are bred by others and their
characteristic features whatever these may be will then slowly but
steadily be increased sometimes by methodical and almost always by
unconscious selection at last a strain deserving to be called a
subvariety becomes a little more widely known receives a local name
and spreads the spreading will have been extremely slow during ancient
and less civilised times but now is rapid by the time that the new
breed had assumed a somewhat distinct character its history hardly
noticed at the time will have been completely forgotten for as low
remarks71 we know how quickly the memory of such events is
effaced
as soon as a new breed is thus formed it is liable through the same
process to break up into new strains and subvarieties for different
varieties are suited for and are valued under different
circumstances fashion changes but should a fashion last for even a
moderate length of time so strong is the principle of inheritance
that some effect will probably be impressed on the breed thus
varieties go on increasing in number and history shows us how
wonderfully they have increased since the earliest records72 as each
new variety is produced the earlier intermediate and less valuable
forms will be neglected and perish when a breed from not being
valued is kept in small numbers its extinction almost inevitably
follows sooner or later either from accidental causes of destruction
or from close interbreeding and this is an event which in the case of
wellmarked breeds excites attention the birth or production of a new
domestic race is so slow a process that it escapes notice its death or
destruction is comparatively sudden is often recorded and when too
late sometimes regretted
several authors have drawn a wide distinction between artificial and
natural races the latter are more uniform in character possessing in
a high degree the appearance of natural species and are of ancient
origin they are generally found in less civilised countries and have
probably been largely modified by natural selection and only to a
small extent by mans unconscious and methodical selection they have
also during a long period been directly acted on by the physical
conditions of the countries which they inhabit the socalled
artificial races on the other hand are not so uniform in character
some have a semimonstrous character such as the wrylegged terriers
so useful in rabbitshooting73 turnspit dogs ancon sheep niata
oxen polish fowls fantailpigeons etc their characteristic
features have generally been acquired suddenly though subsequently
increased by careful selections in many cases other races which
certainly must be called artificial for they have been largely
modified by methodical selection and by crossing as the english
racehorse terrierdogs the english gamecock antwerp
carrierpigeons etc nevertheless cannot be said to have an unnatural
appearance and no distinct line as it seems to me can be drawn
between natural and artificial races
it is not surprising that domestic races should generally present a
different aspect from natural species man selects and propagates
modifications solely for his own use or fancy and not for the
creatures own good his attention is struck by strongly marked
modifications which have appeared suddenly due to some great
disturbing cause in the organisation he attends almost exclusively to
external characters and when he succeeds in modifying internal
organswhen for instance he reduces the bones and offal or loads the
viscera with fat or gives early maturity etcthe chances are strong
that he will at the same time weaken the constitution on the other
hand when an animal has to struggle throughout its life with many
competitors and enemies under circumstances inconceivably complex and
liable to change modifications of the most varied nature in the
internal organs as well as in external characters in the functions and
mutual relations of parts will be rigorously tested preserved or
rejected natural selection often checks mans comparatively feeble and
capricious attempts at improvement and if it were not so the result
of his work and of natures work would be even still more different
nevertheless we must not overrate the amount of difference between
natural species and domestic races the most experienced naturalists
have often disputed whether the latter are descended from one or from
several aboriginal stocks and this clearly shows that there is no
palpable difference between species and races
domestic races propagate their kind far more truly and endure for
munch longer periods than most naturalists are willing to admit
breeders feel no doubt on this head ask a man who has long reared
shorthorn or hereford cattle leicester or southdown sheep spanish or
game poultry tumbler or carrierpigeons whether these races may not
have been derived from common progenitors and he will probably laugh
you to scorn the breeder admits that he may hope to produce sheep with
finer or longer wool and with better carcases or handsomer fowls or
carrierpigeons with beaks just perceptibly longer to the practised
eye and thus be successful at an exhibition thus far he will go but
no farther he does not reflect on what follows from adding up during a
long course of time many slight successive modifications nor does he
reflect on the former existence of numerous varieties connecting the
links in each divergent line of descent he concludes as was shown in
the earlier chapters that all the chief breeds to which he has long
attended are aboriginal productions the systematic naturalist on the
other hand who generally knows nothing of the art of breeding who
does not pretend to know how and when the several domestic races were
formed who cannot have seen the intermediate gradations for they do
not now exist nevertheless feels no doubt that these races are sprung
from a single source but ask him whether the closely allied natural
species which he has studied may not have descended from a common
progenitor and he in his turn will perhaps reject the notion with
scorn thus the naturalist and breeder may mutually learn a useful
lesson from each other
summary on selection by manthere can be no doubt that methodical
selection has effected and will effect wonderful results it was
occasionally practised in ancient times and is still practised by
semicivilised people characters of the highest importance and others
of trifling value have been attended to and modified i need not here
repeat what has been so often said on the part which unconscious
selection has played we see its power in the difference between flocks
which have been separately bred and in the slow changes as
circumstances have slowly changed which many animals have undergone in
the same country or when transported into a foreign land we see the
combined effects of methodical and unconscious selection in the great
amount of difference in those parts or qualities which are valued by
man in comparison with the parts which are not valued and consequently
have not been attended to natural selection often determines mans
power of selection we sometimes err in imagining that characters
which are considered as unimportant by the systematic naturalist could
not be affected by the struggle for existence and could not be acted
on by natural selection but striking cases have been given showing
how great an error this is
the possibility of selection coming into action rests on variability
and this is mainly caused as we shall hereafter see by changes in the
conditions of life selection is sometimes rendered difficult or even
impossible by the conditions being opposed to the desired character or
quality it is sometimes checked by the lessened fertility and weakened
constitution which follow from longcontinued close interbreeding that
methodical selection may be successful the closest attention and
discernment combined with unwearied patience are absolutely
necessary and these same qualities though not indispensable are
highly serviceable in the case of unconscious selection it is almost
necessary that a large number of individuals should be reared for thus
there will be a fair chance of variations of the desired nature
arising and of every individual with the slightest blemish or in any
degree inferior being freely rejected hence length of time is an
important element of success thus also reproduction at an early age
and at short intervals favours the work facility in pairing animals
or their inhabiting a confined area is advantageous as a check to free
crossing whenever and wherever selection is not practised distinct
races are not formed within the same country when any one part of the
body or one quality is not attended to it remains either unchanged or
varies in a fluctuating manner whilst at the same time other parts and
other qualities may become permanently and greatly modified but from
the tendency to reversion and to continued variability those parts or
organs which are now undergoing rapid improvement through selection
are likewise found to vary much consequently highlybred animals when
neglected soon degenerate but we have no reason to believe that the
effects of longcontinued selection would if the conditions of life
remained the same be soon and completely lost
man always tends to go to an extreme point in the selection whether
methodical or unconscious of all useful and pleasing qualities this
is an important principle as it leads to continued divergence and in
some rare cases to convergence of character the possibility of
continued divergence rests on the tendency in each part or organ to go
on varying in the same manner in which it has already varied and that
this occurs is proved by the steady and gradual improvement of many
animals and plants during lengthened periods the principle of
divergence of character combined with the neglect and final extinction
of all previous lessvalued and intermediate varieties explains the
amount of difference and the distinctness of our several races
although we may have reached the utmost limit to which certain
characters can be modified yet we are far from having reached as we
have good reason to believe the limit in the majority of cases
finally from the difference between selection as carried on by man and
by nature we can understand how it is that domestic races often
though by no means always differ in general aspect from closely allied
natural species
throughout this chapter and elsewhere i have spoken of selection as the
paramount power yet its action absolutely depends on what we in our
ignorance call spontaneous or accidental variability let an architect
be compelled to build an edifice with uncut stones fallen from a
precipice the shape of each fragment may be called accidental yet the
shape of each has been determined by the force of gravity the nature
of the rock and the slope of the precipiceevents and circumstances
all of which depend on natural laws but there is no relation between
these laws and the purpose for which each fragment is used by the
builder in the same manner the variations of each creature are
determined by fixed and immutable laws but these bear no relation to
the living structure which is slowly built up through the power of
selection whether this be natural or artificial selection
if our architect succeeded in rearing a noble edifice using the rough
wedgeshaped fragments for the arches the longer stones for the
lintels and so forth we should admire his skill even in a higher
degree than if he had used stones shaped for the purpose so it is with
selection whether applied by man or by nature for although
variability is indispensably necessary yet when we look at some
highly complex and excellently adapted organism variability sinks to a
quite subordinate position in importance in comparison with selection
in the same manner as the shape of each fragment used by our supposed
architect is unimportant in comparison with his skill

chapter xxii causes of variability
variability does not necessarily accompany reproductioncauses assigned
by various authorsindividual differencesvariability of every kind due
to changed conditions of lifeon the nature of such changesclimate
food excess of nutrimentslight changes sufficienteffects of grafting
on the variability of seedlingtreesdomestic productions become
habituated to changed conditionson the accumulative action of changed
conditionsclose interbreeding and the imagination of the mother
supposed to cause variabilitycrossing as a cause of the appearance of
new charactersvariability from the commingling of characters and from
reversionon the manner and period of action of the causes which either
directly or indirectly through the reproductive system induce
variability
we will now consider as far as we can the causes of the almost
universal variability of our domesticated productions the subject is
an obscure one but it may be useful to probe our ignorance some
authors for instance dr prosper lucas look at variability as a
necessary contingent on reproduction and as much an aboriginal law as
growth or inheritance others have of late encouraged perhaps
unintentionally this view by speaking of inheritance and variability
as equal and antagonistic principles pallas maintained and he has had
some followers that variability depends exclusively on the crossing of
primordially distinct forms other authors attribute variability to an
excess of food and with animals to an excess relatively to the amount
of exercise taken or again to the effects of a more genial climate
that these causes are all effective is highly probable but we must i
think take a broader view and conclude that organic beings when
subjected during several generations to any change whatever in their
conditions tend to vary the kind of variation which ensues depending
in most cases in a far higher degree on the nature or constitution of
the being than on the nature of the changed conditions
those authors who believe that it is a law of nature that each
individual should differ in some slight degree from every other may
maintain apparently with truth that this is the fact not only with
all domesticated animals and cultivated plants but likewise with all
organic beings in a state of nature the laplander by long practice
knows and gives a name to each reindeer though as linnus remarks
to distinguish one from another among such multitudes was beyond my
comprehension for they were like ants on an anthill in germany
shepherds have won wagers by recognising each sheep in a flock of a
hundred which they had never seen until the previous fortnight this
power of discrimination however is as nothing compared to that which
some florists have acquired verlot mentions a gardener who could
distinguish 150 kinds of camellia when not in flower and it has been
positively asserted that the famous old dutch florist voorhelm who
kept above 1200 varieties of the hyacinth was hardly ever deceived in
knowing each variety by the bulb alone hence we must conclude that the
bulbs of the hyacinth and the branches and leaves of the camellia
though appearing to an unpractised eye absolutely undistinguishable
yet really differ1
as linnus has compared the reindeer in number to ants i may add that
each ant knows its fellow of the same community several times i
carried ants of the same species formica rufa from one anthill to
another inhabited apparently by tens of thousands of ants but the
strangers were instantly detected and killed i then put some ants
taken from a very large nest into a bottle strongly perfumed with
assaftida and after an interval of twentyfour hours returned them to
their home they were at first threatened by their fellows but were
soon recognised and allowed to pass hence each ant certainly
recognised independently of odour its fellow and if all the ants of
the same community have not some countersign or watchword they must
present to each others senses some distinguishable character
the dissimilarity of brothers or sisters of the same family and of
seedlings from the same capsule may be in part accounted for by the
unequal blending of the characters of the two parents and by the more
or less complete recovery through reversion of ancestral characters on
either side but we thus only push the difficulty further back in time
for what made the parents or their progenitors different hence the
belief2 that an innate tendency to vary exists independently of
external differences seems at first sight probable but even the seeds
nurtured in the same capsule are not subjected to absolutely uniform
conditions as they draw their nourishment from different points and
we shall see in a future chapter that this difference sometimes
suffices to affect the character of the future plant the greater
dissimilarity of the successive children of the same family in
comparison with twins which often resemble each other in external
appearance mental disposition and constitution in so extraordinary a
manner apparently proves that the state of the parents at the exact
period of conception or the nature of the subsequent embryonic
development has a direct and powerful influence on the character of
the offspring nevertheless when we reflect on the individual
differences between organic beings in a state of nature as shown by
every wild animal knowing its mate and when we reflect on the infinite
diversity of the many varieties of our domesticated productions we may
well be inclined to exclaim though falsely as i believe that
variability must be looked at as an ultimate fact necessarily
contingent on reproduction
those authors who adopt this latter view would probably deny that each
separate variation has its own proper exciting cause although we can
seldom trace the precise relation between cause and effect yet the
considerations presently to be given lead to the conclusion that each
modification must have its own distinct cause and is not the result of
what we blindly call accident the following striking case has been
communicated to me by dr william ogle two girls born as twins and
in all respects extremely alike had their little fingers on both hands
crooked and in both children the second bicuspid tooth of the second
dentition on the right side in the upper jaw was misplaced for
instead of standing in a line with the others it grew from the roof of
the mouth behind the first bicuspid neither the parents nor any other
members of the family were known to have exhibited any similar
peculiarity but a son of one of these girls had the same tooth
similarly misplaced now as both the girls were affected in exactly
the same manner the idea of accident is at once excluded and we are
compelled to admit that there must have existed some precise and
sufficient cause which if it had occurred a hundred times would have
given crooked fingers and misplaced bicuspid teeth to a hundred
children it is of course possible that this case may have been due to
reversion to some longforgotten progenitor and this would much weaken
the value of the argument i have been led to think of the probability
of reversion from having been told by mr galton of another case of
twin girls born with their little fingers slightly crooked which they
inherited from their maternal grandmother
we will now consider the general arguments which appear to me to have
great weight in favour of the view that variations of all kinds and
degrees are directly or indirectly caused by the conditions of life to
which each being and more especially its ancestors have been exposed
no one doubts that domesticated productions are more variable than
organic beings which have never been removed from their natural
conditions monstrosities graduate so insensibly into mere variations
that it is impossible to separate them and all those who have studied
monstrosities believe that they are far commoner with domesticated than
with wild animals and plants3 and in the case of plants
monstrosities would be equally noticeable in the natural as in the
cultivated state under nature the individuals of the same species are
exposed to nearly uniform conditions for they are rigorously kept to
their proper places by a host of competing animals and plants they
have also long been habituated to their conditions of life but it
cannot be said that they are subject to quite uniform conditions and
they are liable to a certain amount of variation the circumstances
under which our domestic productions are reared are widely different
they are protected from competition they have not only been removed
from their natural conditions and often from their native land but
they are frequently carried from district to district where they are
treated differently so that they rarely remain during any considerable
length of time exposed to closely similar conditions in conformity
with this all our domesticated productions with the rarest
exceptions vary far more than natural species the hivebee which
feeds itself and follows in most respects its natural habits of life
is the least variable of all domesticated animals and probably the
goose is the next least variable but even the goose varies more than
almost any wild bird so that it cannot be affiliated with perfect
certainty to any natural species hardly a single plant can be named
which has long been cultivated and propagated by seed that is not
highly variable common rye secale cereale has afforded fewer and
less marked varieties than almost any other cultivated plant4 but it
may be doubted whether the variations of this the least valuable of
all our cereals have been closely observed
budvariation which was fully discussed in a former chapter shows us
that variability may be quite independent of seminal reproduction and
likewise of reversion to longlost ancestral characters no one will
maintain that the sudden appearance of a mossrose on a provencerose
is a return to a former state for mossiness of the calyx has been
observed in no natural species the same argument is applicable to
variegated and laciniated leaves nor can the appearance of nectarines
on peachtrees be accounted for on the principle of reversion but
budvariations more immediately concern us as they occur far more
frequently on plants which have been highly cultivated during a length
of time than on other and less highly cultivated plants and very few
wellmarked instances have been observed with plants growing under
strictly natural conditions i have given one instance of an ashtree
growing in a gentlemans pleasuregrounds and occasionally there may
be seen on beech and other trees twigs leafing at a different period
from the other branches but our forest trees in england can hardly be
considered as living under strictly natural conditions the seedlings
are raised and protected in nurserygrounds and must often be
transplanted into places where wild trees of the kind would not
naturally grow it would be esteemed a prodigy if a dogrose growing in
a hedge produced by budvariation a mossrose or a wild bullace or
wild cherrytree yielded a branch bearing fruit of a different shape
and colour from the ordinary fruit the prodigy would be enhanced if
these varying branches were found capable of propagation not only by
grafts but sometimes by seed yet analogous cases have occurred with
many of our highly cultivated trees and herbs
these several considerations alone render it probable that variability
of every kind is directly or indirectly caused by changed conditions of
life or to put the case under another point of view if it were
possible to expose all the individuals of a species during many
generations to absolutely uniform conditions of life there would be no
variability
      on the nature of the changes in the conditions of life which
      induce variability
from a remote period to the present day under climates and
circumstances as different as it is possible to conceive organic
beings of all kinds when domesticated or cultivated have varied we
see this with the many domestic races of quadrupeds and birds belonging
to different orders with goldfish and silkworms with plants of many
kinds raised in various quarters of the world in the deserts of
northern africa the datepalm has yielded thirtyeight varieties in
the fertile plains of india it is notorious how many varieties of rice
and of a host of other plants exist in a single polynesian island
twentyfour varieties of the breadfruit the same number of the
banana and twentytwo varieties of the arum are cultivated by the
natives the mulberrytree in india and europe has yielded many
varieties serving as food for the silkworm and in china sixtythree
varieties of the bamboo are used for various domestic purposes5
these facts and innumerable others which could be added indicate that
a change of almost any kind in the conditions of life suffices to cause
variabilitydifferent changes acting on different organisms
andrew knight6 attributed the variation of both animals and plants to
a more abundant supply of nourishment or to a more favourable climate
than that natural to the species a more genial climate however is
far from necessary the kidneybean which is often injured by our
spring frosts and peaches which require the protection of a wall
have varied much in england as has the orangetree in northern italy
where it is barely able to exist7 nor can we overlook the fact
though not immediately connected with our present subject that the
plants and shells of the arctic regions are eminently variable8
moreover it does not appear that a change of climate whether more or
less genial is one of the most potent causes of variability for in
regard to plants alph de candolle in his gographie botanique
repeatedly shows that the native country of a plant where in most
cases it has been longest cultivated is that where it has yielded the
greatest number of varieties
it is doubtful whether a change in the nature of the food is a potent
cause of variability scarcely any domesticated animal has varied more
than the pigeon or the fowl but their food especially that of
highlybred pigeons is generally the same nor can our cattle and
sheep have been subjected to any great change in this respect but in
all these cases the food probably is much less varied in kind than that
which was consumed by the species in its natural state9
of all the causes which induce variability excess of food whether or
not changed in nature is probably the most powerful this view was
held with regard to plants by andrew knight and is now held by
schleiden more especially in reference to the inorganic elements of
the food10 in order to give a plant more food it suffices in most
cases to grow it separately and thus prevent other plants robbing its
roots it is surprising as i have often seen how vigorously our
common wild species flourish when planted by themselves though not in
highly manured land separate growth is in fact the first step in
cultivation we see the converse of the belief that excess of food
induces variability in the following statement by a great raiser of
seeds of all kinds11 it is a rule invariably with us when we
desire to keep a true stock of any one kind of seed to grow it on poor
land without dung but when we grow for quantity we act contrary and
sometimes have dearly to repent of it according also to carrire who
has had great experience with flowergarden seeds on remarque en
gnral les plantes de vigeur moyenne sont celles qui conservent le
mieux leurs caractres
in the case of animals the want of a proper amount of exercise as
bechstein remarked has perhaps played independently of the direct
effects of the disuse of any particular organ an important part in
causing variability we can see in a vague manner that when the
organised and nutrient fluids of the body are not used during growth
or by the wear and tear of the tissues they will be in excess and as
growth nutrition and reproduction are intimately allied processes
this superfluity might disturb the due and proper action of the
reproductive organs and consequently affect the character of the
future offspring but it may be argued that neither an excess of food
nor a superfluity in the organised fluids of the body necessarily
induces variability the goose and the turkey have been well fed for
many generations yet have varied very little our fruittrees and
culinary plants which are so variable have been cultivated from an
ancient period and though they probably still receive more nutriment
than in their natural state yet they must have received during many
generations nearly the same amount and it might be thought that they
would have become habituated to the excess nevertheless on the whole
knights view that excess of food is one of the most potent causes of
variability appears as far as i can judge probable
whether or not our various cultivated plants have received nutriment in
excess all have been exposed to changes of various kinds fruittrees
are grafted on different stocks and grown in various soils the seeds
of culinary and agricultural plants are carried from place to place
and during the last century the rotation of our crops and the manures
used have been greatly changed
slight changes of treatment often suffice to induce variability the
simple fact of almost all our cultivated plants and domesticated
animals having varied in all places and at all times leads to this
conclusion seeds taken from common english foresttrees grown under
their native climate not highly manured or otherwise artificially
treated yield seedlings which vary much as may be seen in every
extensive seedbed i have shown in a former chapter what a number of
wellmarked and singular varieties the thorn cratgus oxycantha has
produced yet this tree has been subjected to hardly any cultivation
in staffordshire i carefully examined a large number of two british
plants namely geranium phum and pyrenaicum which have never been
highly cultivated these plants had spread spontaneously by seed from a
common garden into an open plantation and the seedlings varied in
almost every single character both in their flower and foliage to a
degree which i have never seen exceeded yet they could not have been
exposed to any great change in their conditions
with respect to animals azara has remarked with much surprise12
that whilst the feral horses on the pampas are always of one of three
colours and the cattle always of a uniform colour yet these animals
when bred on the unenclosed estancias though kept in a state which can
hardly be called domesticated and apparently exposed to almost
identically the same conditions as when they are feral nevertheless
display a great diversity of colour so again in india several species
of freshwater fish are only so far treated artificially that they are
reared in great tanks but this small change is sufficient to induce
much variability13
some facts on the effects of grafting in regard to the variability of
trees deserve attention cabanis asserts that when certain pears are
grafted on the quince their seeds yield a greater number of varieties
than do the seeds of the same variety of pear when grafted on the wild
pear14 but as the pear and quince are distinct species though so
closely related that the one can be readily grafted and succeeds
admirably on the other the fact of variability being thus caused is
not surprising as we are here enabled to see the cause namely the
very different nature of the stock and graft several north american
varieties of the plum and peach are well known to reproduce themselves
truly by seed but downing asserts15 that when a graft is taken
from one of these trees and placed upon another stock this grafted
tree is found to lose its singular property of producing the same
variety by seed and becomes like all other worked treesthat is its
seedlings become highly variable another case is worth giving the
lalande variety of the walnuttree leafs between april 20th and may
15th and its seedlings invariably inherit the same habit whilst
several other varieties of the walnut leaf in june now if seedlings
are raised from the mayleafing lalande variety grafted on another
mayleafing variety though both stock and graft have the same early
habit of leafing yet the seedlings leaf at various times even as late
as the 5th of june16 such facts as these are well fitted to show on
what obscure and slight causes variability depends
i may here just allude to the appearance of new and valuable varieties
of fruittrees and of wheat in woods and waste places which at first
sight seems a most anomalous circumstance in france a considerable
number of the best pears have been discovered in woods and this has
occurred so frequently that poiteau asserts that improved varieties
of our cultivated fruits rarely originate with nurserymen17 in
england on the other hand no instance of a good pear having been
found wild has been recorded and mr rivers informs me that he knows
of only one instance with apples namely the bess poole which was
discovered in a wood in nottinghamshire this difference between the
two countries may be in part accounted for by the more favourable
climate of france but chiefly from the great number of seedlings which
spring up there in the woods i infer that this is the case from a
remark made by a french gardener18 who regards it as a national
calamity that such a number of peartrees are periodically cut down for
firewood before they have borne fruit the new varieties which thus
spring up in the woods though they cannot have received any excess of
nutriment will have been exposed to abruptly changed conditions but
whether this is the cause of their production is very doubtful these
varieties however are probably all descended19 from old cultivated
kinds growing in adjoining orchards a circumstance which will account
for their variability and out of a vast number of varying trees there
will always be a good chance of the appearance of a valuable kind in
north america where fruittrees frequently spring up in waste places
the washington pear was found in a hedge and the emperor peach in a
wood20
with respect to wheat some writers have spoken21 as if it were an
ordinary event for new varieties to be found in waste places the
fenton wheat was certainly discovered growing on a pile of basaltic
detritus in a quarry but in such a situation the plant would probably
receive a sufficient amount of nutriment the chidham wheat was raised
from an ear found on a hedge and hunters wheat was discovered by
the roadside in scotland but it is not said that this latter variety
grew where it was found22
whether our domestic productions would ever become so completely
habituated to the conditions under which they now live as to cease
varying we have no sufficient means for judging but in fact our
domestic productions are never exposed for a great length of time to
uniform conditions and it is certain that our most anciently
cultivated plants as well as animals still go on varying for all
have recently undergone marked improvement in some few cases however
plants have become habituated to new conditions thus metzger who
cultivated in germany during many years numerous varieties of wheat
brought from different countries23 states that some kinds were at
first extremely variable but gradually in one instance after an
interval of twentyfive years became constant and it does not appear
that this resulted from the selection of the more constant forms
on the accumulative action of changed conditions of lifewe have
good grounds for believing that the influence of changed conditions
accumulates so that no effect is produced on a species until it has
been exposed during several generations to continued cultivation or
domestication universal experience shows us that when new flowers are
first introduced into our gardens they do not vary but ultimately all
with the rarest exceptions vary to a greater or less extent in a few
cases the requisite number of generations as well as the successive
steps in the progress of variation have been recorded as in the often
quoted instance of the dahlia24 after several years culture the
zinnia has only lately 1860 begun to vary in any great degree in
the first seven or eight years of high cultivation the swan river
daisy brachycome iberidifolia kept to its original colour it then
varied into lilac and purple and other minor shades25 analogous
facts have been recorded with the scotch rose in discussing the
variability of plants several experienced horticulturists have spoken
to the same general effect mr salter26 remarks every one knows
that the chief difficulty is in breaking through the original form and
colour of the species and every one will be on the lookout for any
natural sport either from seed or branch that being once obtained
however trifling the change may be the result depends upon himself
m de jonghe who has had so much success in raising new varieties of
pears and strawberries27 remarks with respect to the former there
is another principle namely that the more a type has entered into a
state of variation the greater is its tendency to continue doing so
and the more it has varied from the original type the more it is
disposed to vary still farther we have indeed already discussed
this latter point when treating of the power which man possesses
through selection of continually augmenting in the same direction each
modification for this power depends on continued variability of the
same general kind the most celebrated horticulturist in france
namely vilmorin28 even maintains that when any particular
variation is desired the first step is to get the plant to vary in any
manner whatever and to go on selecting the most variable individuals
even though they vary in the wrong direction for the fixed character
of the species being once broken the desired variation will sooner or
later appear
as nearly all our animals were domesticated at an extremely remote
epoch we cannot of course say whether they varied quickly or slowly
when first subjected to new conditions but dr bachman29 states that
he has seen turkeys raised from the eggs of the wild species lose their
metallic tints and become spotted with white in the third generation
mr yarrell many years ago informed me that the wild ducks bred on the
ponds in st jamess park which had never been crossed as it is
believed with domestic ducks lost their true plumage after a few
generations an excellent observer30 who has often reared ducks from
the eggs of the wild bird and who took precautions that there should
be no crossing with domestic breeds has given as previously stated
full details on the changes which they gradually undergo he found that
he could not breed these wild ducks true for more than five or six
generations as they then proved so much less beautiful the white
collar round the neck of the mallard became much broader and more
irregular and white feathers appeared in the ducklings wings they
increased also in size of body their legs became less fine and they
lost their elegant carriage fresh eggs were then procured from wild
birds but again the same result followed in these cases of the duck
and turkey we see that animals like plants do not depart from their
primitive type until they have been subjected during several
generations to domestication on the other hand mr yarrell informed
me that the australian dingos bred in the zoological gardens almost
invariably produced in the first generation puppies marked with white
and other colours but these introduced dingos had probably been
procured from the natives who keep them in a semidomesticated state
it is certainly a remarkable fact that changed conditions should at
first produce as far as we can see absolutely no effect but that
they should subsequently cause the character of the species to change
in the chapter on pangenesis i shall attempt to throw a little light on
this fact
returning now to the causes which are supposed to induce variability
some authors31 believe that close interbreeding gives this tendency
and leads to the production of monstrosities in the seventeenth
chapter some few facts were advanced showing that monstrosities are
as it appears occasionally thus induced and there can be no doubt
that close interbreeding causes lessened fertility and a weakened
constitution hence it may lead to variability but i have not
sufficient evidence on this head on the other hand close
interbreeding if not carried to an injurious extreme far from causing
variability tends to fix the character of each breed
it was formerly a common belief still held by some persons that the
imagination of the mother affects the child in the womb32 this view
is evidently not applicable to the lower animals which lay
unimpregnated eggs or to plants dr william hunter in the last
century told my father that during many years every woman in a large
london lyingin hospital was asked before her confinement whether
anything had specially affected her mind and the answer was written
down and it so happened that in no one instance could a coincidence be
detected between the womans answer and any abnormal structure but
when she knew the nature of the structure she frequently suggested
some fresh cause the belief in the power of the mothers imagination
may perhaps have arisen from the children of a second marriage
resembling the previous father as certainly sometimes occurs in
accordance with the facts given in the eleventh chapter
crossing as a cause of variabilityin an early part of this chapter
it was stated that pallas33 and a few other naturalists maintain that
variability is wholly due to crossing if this means that new
characters never spontaneously appear in our domestic races but that
they are all directly derived from certain aboriginal species the
doctrine is little less than absurd for it implies that animals like
italian greyhounds pugdogs bulldogs pouter and fantail pigeons
etc were able to exist in a state of nature but the doctrine may
mean something widely different namely that the crossing of distinct
species is the sole cause of the first appearance of new characters
and that without this aid man could not have formed his various breeds
as however new characters have appeared in certain cases by
budvariation we may conclude with certainty that crossing is not
necessary for variability it is moreover certain that the breeds of
various animals such as of the rabbit pigeon duck etc and the
varieties of several plants are the modified descendants of a single
wild species nevertheless it is probable that the crossing of two
forms when one or both have long been domesticated or cultivated adds
to the variability of the offspring independently of the commingling
of the characters derived from the two parentforms and this implies
that new characters actually arise but we must not forget the facts
advanced in the thirteenth chapter which clearly prove that the act of
crossing often leads to the reappearance or reversion of longlost
characters and in most cases it would be impossible to distinguish
between the reappearance of ancient characters and the first appearance
of absolutely new characters practically whether new or old they
would be new to the breed in which they reappeared
grtner declares34 and his experience is of the highest value on
such a point that when he crossed native plants which had not been
cultivated he never once saw in the offspring any new character but
that from the odd manner in which the characters derived from the
parents were combined they sometimes appeared as if new when on the
other hand he crossed cultivated plants he admits that new characters
occasionally appeared but he is strongly inclined to attribute their
appearance to ordinary variability not in any way to the cross an
opposite conclusion however appears to me the more probable
according to klreuter hybrids in the genus mirabilis vary almost
infinitely and he describes new and singular characters in the form of
the seeds in the colour of the anthers in the cotyledons being of
immense size in new and highly peculiar odours in the flowers
expanding early in the season and in their closing at night with
respect to one lot of these hybrids he remarks that they presented
characters exactly the reverse of what might have been expected from
their parentage35
prof lecoq36 speaks strongly to the same effect in regard to this
same genus and asserts that many of the hybrids from mirabilis
jalapa and multiflora might easily be mistaken for distinct species
and adds that they differed in a greater degree than the other species
of the genus from m jalapa herbert also has described37
certain hybrid rhododendrons as being as unlike all others in
foliage as if they had been a separate species the common experience
of floriculturists proves that the crossing and recrossing of distinct
but allied plants such as the species of petunia calceolaria
fuchsia verbena etc induces excessive variability hence the
appearance of quite new characters is probable m carrire38 has
lately discussed this subject he states that erythrina cristagalli
had been multiplied by seed for many years but had not yielded any
varieties it was then crossed with the allied e herbacea and the
resistance was now overcome and varieties were produced with flowers
of extremely different size form and colour
from the general and apparently wellfounded belief that the crossing
of distinct species besides commingling their characters adds greatly
to their variability it has probably arisen that some botanists have
gone so far as to maintain39 that when a genus includes only a
single species this when cultivated never varies the proposition made
so broadly cannot be admitted but it is probably true that the
variability of monotypic genera when cultivated is generally less than
that of genera including numerous species and this quite independently
of the effects of crossing i have shown in my origin of species that
the species belonging to small genera generally yield a less number of
varieties in a state of nature than those belonging to large genera
hence the species of small genera would it is probable produce fewer
varieties under cultivation than the already variable species of larger
genera
although we have not at present sufficient evidence that the crossing
of species which have never been cultivated leads to the appearance
of new characters this apparently does occur with species which have
been already rendered in some degree variable through cultivation
hence crossing like any other change in the conditions of life seems
to be an element probably a potent one in causing variability but we
seldom have the means of distinguishing as previously remarked
between the appearance of really new characters and the reappearance of
longlost characters evoked through the act of crossing i will give
an instance of the difficulty in distinguishing such cases the species
of datura may be divided into two sections those having white flowers
with green stems and those having purple flowers with brown stems now
naudin40 crossed datura lvis and  ferox both of which belong to
the white section and raised from them 205 hybrids of these hybrids
every one had brown stems and bore purple flowers so that they
resembled the species of the other section of the genus and not their
own two parents naudin was so much astonished at this fact that he
was led carefully to observe both parentspecies and he discovered
that the pure seedlings of d ferox immediately after germination
had dark purple stems extending from the young roots up to the
cotyledons and that this tint remained ever afterwards as a ring round
the base of the stem of the plant when old now i have shown in the
thirteenth chapter that the retention or exaggeration of an early
character is so intimately related to reversion that it evidently
comes under the same principle hence probably we ought to look at the
purple flowers and brown stems of these hybrids not as new characters
due to variability but as a return to the former state of some ancient
progenitor
independently of the appearance of new characters from crossing a few
words may be added to what has been said in former chapters on the
unequal combination and transmission of the characters proper to the
two parentforms when two species or races are crossed the offspring
of the first generation are generally uniform but those subsequently
produced display an almost infinite diversity of character he who
wishes says klreuter41 to obtain an endless number of varieties
from hybrids should cross and recross them there is also much
variability when hybrids or mongrels are reduced or absorbed by
repeated crosses with either pure parentform and a still higher
degree of variability when three distinct species and most of all when
four species are blended together by successive crosses beyond this
point grtner42 on whose authority the foregoing statements are
made never succeeded in effecting a union but max wichura43 united
six distinct species of willows into a single hybrid the sex of the
parent species affects in an inexplicable manner the degree of
variability of hybrids for grtner44 repeatedly found that when a
hybrid was used as a father and either one of the pure parentspecies
or a third species was used as the mother the offspring were more
variable than when the same hybrid was used as the mother and either
pure parent or the same third species as the father thus seedlings
from dianthus barbatus crossed by the hybrid d chinensibarbatus
were more variable than those raised from this latter hybrid fertilised
by the pure d barbatus max wichura45 insists strongly on an
analogous result with his hybrid willows again grtner46 asserts
that the degree of variability sometimes differs in hybrids raised from
reciprocal crosses between the same two species and here the sole
difference is that the one species is first used as the father and
then as the mother on the whole we see that independently of the
appearance of new characters the variability of successive crossed
generations is extremely complex partly from the offspring partaking
unequally of the characters of the two parentforms and more
especially from their unequal tendency to revert to such characters or
to those of more ancient progenitors
on the manner and on the period of action of the causes which induce
variabilitythis is an extremely obscure subject and we need here
only consider whether inherited variations are due to certain parts
being acted on after they have been formed or through the reproductive
system being affected before their formation and in the former case at
what period of growth or development the effect is produced we shall
see in the two following chapters that various agencies such as an
abundant supply of food exposure to a different climate increased use
or disuse of parts etc prolonged during several generations
certainly modify either the whole organisation or certain organs and
it is clear at least in the case of budvariation that the action
cannot have been through the reproductive system
with respect to the part which the reproductive system takes in causing
variability we have seen in the eighteenth chapter that even slight
changes in the conditions of life have a remarkable power in causing a
greater or less degree of sterility hence it seems not improbable that
beings generated through a system so easily affected should themselves
be affected or should fail to inherit or inherit in excess
characters proper to their parents we know that certain groups of
organic beings but with exceptions in each group have their
reproductive systems much more easily affected by changed conditions
than other groups for instance carnivorous birds more readily than
carnivorous mammals and parrots more readily than pigeons and this
fact harmonises with the apparently capricious manner and degree in
which various groups of animals and plants vary under domestication
klreuter47 was struck with the parallelism between the excessive
variability of hybrids when crossed and recrossed in various
waysthese hybrids having their reproductive powers more or less
affectedand the variability of anciently cultivated plants max
wichura48 has gone one step farther and shows that with many of our
highly cultivated plants such as the hyacinth tulip auricula
snapdragon potato cabbage etc which there is no reason to believe
have been hybridised the anthers contain many irregular pollengrains
in the same state as in hybrids he finds also in certain wild forms
the same coincidence between the state of the pollen and a high degree
of variability as in many species of rubus but in r caesius and
idaeus which are not highly variable species the pollen is sound it
is also notorious that many cultivated plants such as the banana
pineapple breadfruit and others previously mentioned have their
reproductive organs so seriously affected as to be generally quite
sterile and when they do yield seed the seedlings judging from the
large number of cultivated races which exist must be variable in an
extreme degree these facts indicate that there is some relation
between the state of the reproductive organs and a tendency to
variability but we must not conclude that the relation is strict
although many of our highly cultivated plants may have their pollen in
a deteriorated condition yet as we have previously seen they yield
more seeds and our anciently domesticated animals are more prolific
than the corresponding species in a state of nature the peacock is
almost the only bird which is believed to be less fertile under
domestication than in its native state and it has varied in a
remarkably small degree from these considerations it would seem that
changes in the conditions of life lead either to sterility or to
variability or to both and not that sterility induces variability on
the whole it is probable that any cause affecting the organs of
reproduction would likewise affect their productthat is the
offspring thus generated
the period of life at which the causes that induce variability act is
likewise an obscure subject which has been discussed by various
authors49 in some of the cases to be given in the following
chapter of modifications from the direct action of changed conditions
which are inherited there can be no doubt that the causes have acted
on the mature or nearly mature animal on the other hand
monstrosities which cannot be distinctly separated from lesser
variations are often caused by the embryo being injured whilst in the
mothers womb or in the egg thus i geoffroy sainthilaire50 asserts
that poor women who work hard during their pregnancy and the mothers
of illegitimate children troubled in their minds and forced to conceal
their state are far more liable to give birth to monsters than women
in easy circumstances the eggs of the fowl when placed upright or
otherwise treated unnaturally frequently produce monstrous chickens it
would however appear that complex monstrosities are induced more
frequently during a rather late than during a very early period of
embryonic life but this may partly result from some one part which
has been injured during an early period affecting by its abnormal
growth other parts subsequently developed and this would be less
likely to occur with parts injured at a later period51 when any part
or organ becomes monstrous through abortion a rudiment is generally
left and this likewise indicates that its development had already
commenced
insects sometimes have their antennae or legs in a monstrous condition
the larvae of which do not possess either antennae or legs and in
these cases as quatrefages52 believes we are enabled to see the
precise period at which the normal progress of development was
troubled but the nature of the food given to a caterpillar sometimes
affects the colours of the moth without the caterpillar itself being
affected therefore it seems possible that other characters in the
mature insect might be indirectly modified through the larvae there is
no reason to suppose that organs which have been rendered monstrous
have always been acted on during their development the cause may have
acted on the organisation at a much earlier stage it is even probable
that either the male or female sexual elements or both before their
union may be affected in such a manner as to lead to modifications in
organs developed at a late period of life in nearly the same manner as
a child may inherit from his father a disease which does not appear
until old age
in accordance with the facts above given which prove that in many
cases a close relation exists between variability and the sterility
following from changed conditions we may conclude that the exciting
cause often acts at the earliest possible period namely on the sexual
elements before impregnation has taken place that an affection of the
female sexual element may induce variability we may likewise infer as
probable from the occurrence of budvariations for a bud seems to be
the analogue of an ovule but the male element is apparently much
oftener affected by changed conditions at least in a visible manner
than the female element or ovule and we know from grtners and
wichuras statements that a hybrid used as the father and crossed with
a pure species gives a greater degree of variability to the offspring
than does the same hybrid when used as the mother lastly it is
certain that variability may be transmitted through either sexual
element whether or not originally excited in them for klreuter and
grtner53 found that when two species were crossed if either one was
variable the offspring were rendered variable
summaryfrom the facts given in this chapter we may conclude that
the variability of organic beings under domestication although so
general is not an inevitable contingent on life but results from the
conditions to which the parents have been exposed changes of any kind
in the conditions of life even extremely slight changes often suffice
to cause variability excess of nutriment is perhaps the most efficient
single exciting cause animals and plants continue to be variable for
an immense period after their first domestication but the conditions
to which they are exposed never long remain quite constant in the
course of time they can be habituated to certain changes so as to
become less variable and it is possible that when first domesticated
they may have been even more variable than at present there is good
evidence that the power of changed conditions accumulates so that two
three or more generations must be exposed to new conditions before any
effect is visible the crossing of distinct forms which have already
become variable increases in the offspring the tendency to further
variability by the unequal commingling of the characters of the two
parents by the reappearance of longlost characters and by the
appearance of absolutely new characters some variations are induced by
the direct action of the surrounding conditions on the whole
organisation or on certain parts alone other variations appear to be
induced indirectly through the reproductive system being affected as
we know is often the case with various beings which when removed from
their natural conditions become sterile the causes which induce
variability act on the mature organism on the embryo and probably
on the sexual elements before impregnation has been effected

if we ask ourselves why this or that character has been modified under
domestication we are in most cases lost in utter darkness many
naturalists especially of the french school attribute every
modification to the monde ambiant that is to changed climate with
all its diversities of heat and cold dampness and dryness light and
electricity to the nature of the soil and to varied kinds and amount
of food by the term definite action as used in this chapter i mean
an action of such a nature that when many individuals of the same
variety are exposed during several generations to any particular change
in their conditions of life all or nearly all the individuals are
modified in the same manner the effects of habit or of the increased
use and disuse of various organs might have been included under this
head but it will be convenient to discuss this subject in a separate
chapter by the term indefinite action i mean an action which causes
one individual to vary in one way and another individual in another
way as we often see with plants and animals after they have been
subjected for some generations to changed conditions of life but we
know far too little of the causes and laws of variation to make a sound
classification the action of changed conditions whether leading to
definite or indefinite results is a totally distinct consideration
from the effects of selection for selection depends on the
preservation by man of certain individuals or on their survival under
various and complex natural circumstances and has no relation whatever
to the primary cause of each particular variation
i will first give in detail all the facts which i have been able to
collect rendering it probable that climate food etc have acted so
definitely and powerfully on the organisation of our domesticated
productions that new subvarieties or races have been thus formed
without the aid of selection by man or nature i will then give the
facts and considerations opposed to this conclusion and finally we
will weigh as fairly as we can the evidence on both sides
when we reflect that distinct races of almost all our domesticated
animals exist in each kingdom of europe and formerly even in each
district of england we are at first strongly inclined to attribute
their origin to the definite action of the physical conditions of each
country and this has been the conclusion of many authors but we
should bear in mind that man annually has to choose which animals shall
be preserved for breeding and which shall be slaughtered we have also
seen that both methodical and unconscious selection were formerly
practised and are now occasionally practised by the most barbarous
races to a much greater extent than might have been anticipated hence
it is difficult to judge how far differences in the conditions between
for instance the several districts in england have sufficed to modify
the breeds which have been reared in each it may be argued that as
numerous wild animals and plants have ranged during many ages
throughout great britain and still retain the same character the
difference in conditions between the several districts could not have
modified in a marked manner the various native races of cattle sheep
pigs and horses the same difficulty of distinguishing between the
effects of natural selection and the definite action of external
conditions is encountered in a still higher degree when we compare
closely allied species inhabiting two countries such as north america
and europe which do not differ greatly in climate nature of soil
etc for in this case natural selection will inevitably and rigorously
have acted during a long succession of ages
prof weismann has suggested1 that when a variable species enters a
new and isolated country although the variations may be of the same
general nature as before yet it is improbable that they should occur
in the same proportional numbers after a longer or shorter period the
species will tend to become nearly uniform in character from the
incessant crossing of the varying individuals but owing to the
proportion of the individuals varying in different ways not being the
same in the two cases the final result will be the production of two
forms somewhat different from one another in cases of this kind it
would falsely appear as if the conditions had induced certain definite
modifications whereas they had only excited indefinite variability
but with the variations in slightly different proportional numbers
this view may throw some light on the fact that the domestic animals
which formerly inhabited the several districts in great britain and
the half wild cattle lately kept in several british parks differed
slightly from one another for these animals were prevented from
wandering over the whole country and intercrossing but would have
crossed freely within each district or park
from the difficulty of judging how far changed conditions have caused
definite modifications of structure it will be advisable to give as
large a body of facts as possible showing that extremely slight
differences within the same country or during different seasons
certainly produce an appreciable effect at least on varieties which
are already in an unstable condition ornamental flowers are good for
this purpose as they are highly variable and are carefully observed
all floriculturists are unanimous that certain varieties are affected
by very slight differences in the nature of the artificial compost in
which they are grown and by the natural soil of the district as well
as by the season thus a skilful judge in writing on carnations and
picotees2 asks where can admiral curzon be seen possessing the
colour size and strength which it has in derbyshire where can
floras garland be found equal to those at slough where do
highcoloured flowers revel better than at woolwich and birmingham yet
in no two of these districts do the same varieties attain an equal
degree of excellence although each may be receiving the attention of
the most skilful cultivators the same writer then recommends every
cultivator to keep five different kinds of soil and manure and to
endeavour to suit the respective appetites of the plants you are
dealing with for without such attention all hope of general success
will be vain so it is with the dahlia3 the lady cooper rarely
succeeds near london but does admirably in other districts the
reverse holds good with other varieties and again there are others
which succeed equally well in various situations a skilful gardener4
states that he procured cuttings of an old and wellknown variety
pulchella of verbena which from having been propagated in a
different situation presented a slightly different shade of colour the
two varieties were afterwards multiplied by cuttings being carefully
kept distinct but in the second year they could hardly be
distinguished and in the third year no one could distinguish them
the nature of the season has an especial influence on certain varieties
of the dahlia in 1841 two varieties were preeminently good and the
next year these same two were preeminently bad a famous amateur5
asserts that in 1861 many varieties of the rose came so untrue in
character that it was hardly possible to recognise them and the
thought was not seldom entertained that the grower had lost his tally
the same amateur6 states that in 1862 twothirds of his auriculas
produced central trusses of flowers and such trusses are liable not to
keep true and he adds that in some seasons certain varieties of this
plant all prove good and the next season all prove bad whilst exactly
the reverse happens with other varieties in 1845 the editor of the
gardeners chronicle7 remarked how singular it was that this year
many calceolarias tended to assume a tubular form with heartsease8
the blotched sorts do not acquire their proper character until hot
weather sets in whilst other varieties lose their beautiful marks as
soon as this occurs
analogous facts have been observed with leaves mr beaton asserts9
that he raised at shrubland during six years twenty thousand
seedlings from the punch pelargonium and not one had variegated
leaves but at surbiton in surrey onethird or even a greater
proportion of the seedlings from this same variety were more or less
variegated the soil of another district in surrey has a strong
tendency to cause variegation as appears from information given me by
sir f pollock verlot10 states that the variegated strawberry
retains its character as long as grown in a dryish soil but soon loses
it when planted in fresh and humid soil mr salter who is well known
for his success in cultivating variegated plants informs me that rows
of strawberries were planted in his garden in 1859 in the usual way
and at various distances in one row several plants simultaneously
became variegated and what made the case more extraordinary all were
variegated in precisely the same manner these plants were removed but
during the three succeeding years other plants in the same row became
variegated and in no instance were the plants in any adjoining row
affected
the chemical qualities odours and tissues of plants are often
modified by a change which seems to us slight the hemlock is said not
to yield conicine in scotland the root of the aconitum napellus
becomes innocuous in frigid climates the medicinal properties of the
digitalis are easily affected by culture as the pistacia lentiscus
grows abundantly in the south of france the climate must suit it but
it yields no mastic the laurus sassafras in europe loses the odour
proper to it in north america11 many similar facts could be given
and they are remarkable because it might have been thought that
definite chemical compounds would have been little liable to change
either in quality or quantity
the wood of the american locusttree robinia when grown in england
is nearly worthless as is that of the oaktree when grown at the cape
of good hope12 hemp and flax as i hear from dr falconer flourish
and yield plenty of seed on the plains of india but their fibres are
brittle and useless hemp on the other hand fails to produce in
england that resinous matter which is so largely used in india as an
intoxicating drug
the fruit of the melon is greatly influenced by slight differences in
culture and climate hence it is generally a better plan according to
naudin to improve an old kind than to introduce a new one into any
locality the seed of the persian melon produces near paris fruit
inferior to the poorest market kinds but at bordeaux yields delicious
fruit13 seed is annually brought from thibet to kashmir14 and
produces fruit weighing from four to ten pounds but plants raised next
year from seed saved in kashmir give fruit weighing only from two to
three pounds it is well known that american varieties of the apple
produce in their native land magnificent and brightlycoloured fruit
but these in england are of poor quality and a dull colour in hungary
there are many varieties of the kidneybean remarkable for the beauty
of their seeds but the rev mj berkeley15 found that their beauty
could hardly ever be preserved in england and in some cases the colour
was greatly changed we have seen in the ninth chapter with respect to
wheat what a remarkable effect transportal from the north to the south
of france and conversely produced on the weight of the grain
when man can perceive no change in plants or animals which have been
exposed to a new climate or to different treatment insects can
sometimes perceive a marked change a cactus has been imported into
india from canton manilla mauritius and from the hothouses of kew
and there is likewise a socalled native kind which was formerly
introduced from south america all these plants belong to the same
species and are alike in appearance but the cochineal insect
flourishes only on the native kind on which it thrives
prodigiously16 humboldt remarks17 that white men born in the
torrid zone walk barefoot with impunity in the same apartment where a
european recently landed is exposed to the attacks of the pulex
penetrans this insect the too wellknown chigoe must therefore be
able to perceive what the most delicate chemical analysis fails to
discover namely a difference between the blood or tissues of a
european and those of a white man born in the tropics but the
discernment of the chigoe is not so surprising as it at first appears
for according to liebig18 the blood of men with different
complexions though inhabiting the same country emits a different
odour
diseases peculiar to certain localities heights or climates may be
here briefly noticed as showing the influence of external
circumstances on the human body diseases confined to certain races of
man do not concern us for the constitution of the race may play the
more important part and this may have been determined by unknown
causes the plica polonica stands in this respect in a nearly
intermediate position for it rarely affects germans who inhabit the
neighbourhood of the vistula where so many poles are grievously
affected neither does it affect russians who are said to belong to
the same original stock as the poles19 the elevation of a district
often governs the appearance of diseases in mexico the yellow fever
does not extend above 924 metres and in peru people are affected with
the verugas only between 600 and 1600 metres above the sea many
other such cases could be given a peculiar cutaneous complaint called
the bouton dalep affects in aleppo and some neighbouring districts
almost every native infant and some few strangers and it seems fairly
well established that this singular complaint depends on drinking
certain waters in the healthy little island of st helena the
scarletfever is dreaded like the plague analogous facts have been
observed in chili and mexico20 even in the different departments of
france it is found that the various infirmities which render the
conscript unfit for serving in the army prevail with remarkable
inequality revealing as boudin observes that many of them are
endemic which otherwise would never have been suspected21 any one
who will study the distribution of disease will be struck with surprise
at what slight differences in the surrounding circumstances govern the
nature and severity of the complaints by which man is at least
temporarily affected
the modifications as yet referred to are extremely slight and in most
cases have been caused as far as we can judge by equally slight
differences in the conditions but such conditions acting during a
series of generations would perhaps produce a marked effect
with plants a considerable change of climate sometimes produces a
conspicuous result i have given in the ninth chapter the most
remarkable case known to me namely that of varieties of maize which
were greatly modified in the course of only two or three generations
when taken from a tropical country to a cooler one or conversely dr
falconer informs me that he has seen the english ribstonpippin apple
a himalayan oak prunus and pyrus all assume in the hotter parts of
india a fastigiate or pyramidal habit and this fact is the more
interesting as a chinese tropical species of pyrus naturally grows
thus although in these cases the changed manner of growth seems to
have been directly caused by the great heat we know that many
fastigiate trees have originated in their temperate homes in the
botanic gardens of ceylon the appletree22 sends out numerous
runners under ground which continually rise into small stems and form
a growth around the parenttree the varieties of the cabbage which
produce heads in europe fail to do so in certain tropical
countries23 the rhododendron ciliatum produced at kew flowers so
much larger and palercoloured than those which it bears on its native
himalayan mountain that dr hooker24 would hardly have recognised
the species by the flowers alone many similar facts with respect to
the colour and size of flowers could be given
the experiments of vilmorin and buckman on carrots and parsnips prove
that abundant nutriment produces a definite and inheritable effect on
the roots with scarcely any change in other parts of the plant alum
directly influences the colour of the flowers of the hydrangea25
dryness seems generally to favour the hairiness or villosity of plants
grtner found that hybrid verbascums became extremely woolly when grown
in pots mr masters on the other hand states that the opuntia
leucotricha is well clothed with beautiful white hairs when grown in
a damp heat but in a dry heat exhibits none of this peculiarity26
slight variations of many kinds not worth specifying in detail are
retained only as long as plants are grown in certain soils of which
sageret27 gives some instances from his own experience odart who
insists strongly on the permanence of the varieties of the grape
admits28 that some varieties when grown under a different climate or
treated differently vary in a slight degree as in the tint of the
fruit and in the period of ripening some authors have denied that
grafting causes even the slightest difference in the scion but there
is sufficient evidence that the fruit is sometimes slightly affected in
size and flavour the leaves in duration and the flowers in
appearance29
there can be no doubt from the facts given in the first chapter that
european dogs deteriorate in india not only in their instincts but in
structure but the changes which they undergo are of such a nature
that they may be partly due to reversion to a primitive form as in the
case of feral animals in parts of india the turkey becomes reduced in
size with the pendulous appendage over the beak enormously
developed30 we have seen how soon the wild duck when domesticated
loses its true character from the effects of abundant or changed food
or from taking little exercise from the direct action of a humid
climate and poor pasture the horse rapidly decreases in size in the
falkland islands from information which i have received this seems
likewise to be the case to a certain extent with sheep in australia
climate definitely influences the hairy covering of animals in the
west indies a great change is produced in the fleece of sheep in about
three generations dr falconer states31 that the thibet mastiff and
goat when brought down from the himalaya to kashmir lose their fine
wool at angora not only goats but shepherddogs and cats have fine
fleecy hair and mr ainsworth32 attributes the thickness of the
fleece to the severe winters and its silky lustre to the hot summers
burnes states positively33 that the karakool sheep lose their
peculiar black curled fleeces when removed into any other country even
within the limits of england i have been assured that the wool of two
breeds of sheep was slightly changed by the flocks being pastured in
different localities34 it has been asserted on good authority35
that horses kept during several years in the deep coalmines of belgium
become covered with velvety hair almost like that on the mole these
cases probably stand in close relation to the natural change of coat in
winter and summer naked varieties of several domestic animals have
occasionally appeared but there is no reason to believe that this is
in any way related to the nature of the climate to which they have been
exposed36
it appears at first sight probable that the increased size the
tendency to fatten the early maturity and altered forms of our
improved cattle sheep and pigs have directly resulted from their
abundant supply of food this is the opinion of many competent judges
and probably is to a great extent true but as far as form is
concerned we must not overlook the more potent influence of lessened
use on the limbs and lungs we see moreover as far as size is
concerned that selection is apparently a more powerful agent than a
large supply of food for we can thus only account for the existence
as remarked to me by mr blyth of the largest and smallest breeds of
sheep in the same country of cochinchina fowls and bantams of small
tumbler and large runt pigeons all kept together and supplied with
abundant nourishment nevertheless there can be little doubt that our
domesticated animals have been modified independently of the increased
or lessened use of parts by the conditions to which they have been
subjected without the aid of selection for instance prof
rtimeyer37 shows that the bones of domesticated quadrupeds can be
distinguished from those of wild animals by the state of their surface
and general appearance it is scarcely possible to read nathusiuss
excellent vorstudien38 and doubt that with the highly improved
races of the pig abundant food has produced a conspicuous effect on
the general form of the body on the breadth of the head and face and
even on the teeth nathusius rests much on the case of a purely bred
berkshire pig which when two months old became diseased in its
digestive organs and was preserved for observation until nineteen
months old at this age it had lost several characteristic features of
the breed and had acquired a long narrow head of large size
relatively to its small body and elongated legs but in this case and
in some others we ought not to assume that because certain characters
are lost perhaps through reversion under one course of treatment
therefore that they were at first directly produced by an opposite
treatment
in the case of the rabbit which has become feral on the island of
porto santo we are at first strongly tempted to attribute the whole
changethe greatly reduced size the altered tints of the fur and the
loss of certain characteristic marksto the definite action of the new
conditions to which it has been exposed but in all such cases we have
to consider in addition the tendency to reversion to progenitors more
or less remote and the natural selection of the finest shades of
difference
the nature of the food sometimes either definitely induces certain
peculiarities or stands in some close relation with them pallas long
ago asserted that the fattailed sheep of siberia degenerate and lose
their enormous tails when removed from certain saline pastures and
recently erman39 states that this occurs with the kirgisian sheep
when brought to orenburgh
it is well known that hempseed causes bullfinches and certain other
birds to become black mr wallace has communicated to me some much
more remarkable facts of the same nature the natives of the amazonian
region feed the common green parrot chrysotis festiva linn with
the fat of large siluroid fishes and the birds thus treated become
beautifully variegated with red and yellow feathers in the malayan
archipelago the natives of gilolo alter in an analogous manner the
colours of another parrot namely the lorius garrulus linn and
thus produce the lori rajah or kinglory these parrots in the malay
islands and south america when fed by the natives on natural vegetable
food such as rice and plaintains retain their proper colours mr
wallace has also recorded40 a still more singular fact the
indians of s america have a curious art by which they change the
colours of the feathers of many birds they pluck out those from the
part they wish to paint and inoculate the fresh wound with the milky
secretion from the skin of a small toad the feathers grow of a
brilliant yellow colour and on being plucked out it is said grow
again of the same colour without any fresh operation
bechstein41 does not entertain any doubt that seclusion from light
affects at least temporarily the colours of cagebirds
it is well known that the shells of landmollusca are affected by the
abundance of lime in different districts isidore geoffroy
sainthilaire42 gives the case of helix lactea which has recently
been carried from spain to the south of france and to the rio plata
and in both countries now presents a distinct appearance but whether
this has resulted from food or climate is not known with respect to
the common oyster mr f buckland informs me that he can generally
distinguish the shells from different districts young oysters brought
from wales and laid down in beds where natives are indigenous in
the short space of two months begin to assume the native character
m costa43 has recorded a much more remarkable case of the same
nature namely that young shells taken from the shores of england and
placed in the mediterranean at once altered their manner of growth and
formed prominent diverging rays like those on the shells of the proper
mediterranean oyster the same individual shell showing both forms of
growth was exhibited before a society in paris lastly it is well
known that caterpillars fed on different food sometimes either
themselves acquire a different colour or produce moths differing in
colour44
it would be travelling beyond my proper limits here to discuss how far
organic beings in a state of nature are definitely modified by changed
conditions in my origin of species i have given a brief abstract of
the facts bearing on this point and have shown the influence of light
on the colours of birds and of residence near the sea on the lurid
tints of insects and on the succulency of plants mr herbert
spencer45 has recently discussed with much ability this whole subject
on general grounds he argues for instance that with all animals the
external and internal tissues are differently acted on by the
surrounding conditions and they invariably differ in intimate
structure so again the upper and lower surfaces of true leaves as
well as of stems and petioles when these assume the function and
occupy the position of leaves are differently circumstanced with
respect to light etc and apparently in consequence differ in
structure but as mr herbert spencer admits it is most difficult in
all such cases to distinguish between the effects of the definite
action of physical conditions and the accumulation through natural
selection of inherited variations which are serviceable to the
organism and which have arisen independently of the definite action of
these conditions
although we are not here concerned with the definite action of the
conditions of life on organisms in a state of nature i may state that
much evidence has been gained during the last few years on this
subject in the united states for instance it has been clearly
proved more especially by mr j a allen that with birds many
species differ in tint size of body and of beak and in length of
tail in proceeding from the north to the south and it appears that
these differences must be attributed to the direct action of
temperature46 with respect to plants i will give a somewhat
analogous case mr meehan47 has compared twentynine kinds of
american trees with their nearest european allies all grown in close
proximity and under as nearly as possible the same conditions in the
american species he finds with the rarest exceptions that the leaves
fall earlier in the season and assume before their fall a brighter
tint that they are less deeply toothed or serrated that the buds are
smaller that the trees are more diffuse in growth and have fewer
branchlets and lastly that the seeds are smallerall in comparison
with the corresponding european species now considering that these
corresponding trees belong to several distinct orders and that they
are adapted to widely different stations it can hardly be supposed
that their differences are of any special service to them in the new
and old worlds and if so such differences cannot have been gained
through natural selection and must be attributed to the long continued
action of a different climate
gallsanother class of facts not relating to cultivated plants
deserves attention i allude to the production of galls every one
knows the curious brightred hairy productions on the wild rosetree
and the various different galls produced by the oak some of the latter
resemble fruit with one face as rosy as the rosiest apple these
bright colours can be of no service either to the gallforming insect
or to the tree and probably are the direct result of the action of the
light in the same manner as the apples of nova scotia or canada are
brighter coloured than english apples according to osten sackens
latest revision no less than fiftyeight kinds of galls are produced
on the several species of oak by cynips with its subgenera and mr
b d walsh48 states that he can add many others to the list one
american species of willow the salix humilis bears ten distinct
kinds of galls the leaves which spring from the galls of various
english willows differ completely in shape from the natural leaves the
young shoots of junipers and firs when punctured by certain insects
yield monstrous growths resembling flowers and fircones and the
flowers of some plants become from the same cause wholly changed in
appearance galls are produced in every quarter of the world of
several sent to me by mr thwaites from ceylon some were as
symmetrical as a composite flower when in bud others smooth and
spherical like a berry some protected by long spines others clothed
with yellow wool formed of long cellular hairs others with regularly
tufted hairs in some galls the internal structure is simple but in
others it is highly complex thus m lacazeduthiers49 has figured in
the common inkgall no less than seven concentric layers composed of
distinct tissue namely the epidermic subepidermic spongy
intermediate and the hard protective layer formed of curiously
thickened woody cells and lastly the central mass abounding with
starchgranules on which the larv feed
galls are produced by insects of various orders but the greater number
by species of cynips it is impossible to read m lacazeduthiers
discussion and doubt that the poisonous secretion of the insect causes
the growth of the gall and every one knows how virulent is the poison
secreted by wasps and bees which belong to the same group with cynips
galls grow with extraordinary rapidity and it is said that they attain
their full size in a few days50 it is certain that they are almost
completely developed before the larvae are hatched considering that
many gallinsects are extremely small the drop of secreted poison must
be excessively minute it probably acts on one or two cells alone
which being abnormally stimulated rapidly increase by a process of
selfdivision galls as mr walsh51 remarks afford good constant
and definite characters each kind keeping as true to form as does any
independent organic being this fact becomes still more remarkable when
we hear that for instance seven out of the ten different kinds of
galls produced on salix humilis are formed by gallgnats
cecidomyid which though essentially distinct species yet
resemble one another so closely that in almost all cases it is
difficult and in most cases impossible to distinguish the fullgrown
insects one from the other52 for in accordance with a widespread
analogy we may safely infer that the poison secreted by insects so
closely allied would not differ much in nature yet this slight
difference is sufficient to induce widely different results in some
few cases the same species of gallgnat produces on distinct species of
willows galls which cannot be distinguished the cynips fecundatrix
also has been known to produce on the turkish oak to which it is not
properly attached exactly the same kind of gall as on the european
oak53 these latter facts apparently prove that the nature of the
poison is a more powerful agent in determining the form of the gall
than the specific character of the tree which is acted on
as the poisonous secretion of insects belonging to various orders has
the special power of affecting the growth of various plants as a
slight difference in the nature of the poison suffices to produce
widely different results and lastly as we know that the chemical
compounds secreted by plants are eminently liable to be modified by
changed conditions of life we may believe it possible that various
parts of a plant might be modified through the agency of its own
altered secretions compare for instance the mossy and viscid calyx
of a mossrose which suddenly appears through budvariation on a
provencerose with the gall of red moss growing from the inoculated
leaf of a wild rose with each filament symmetrically branched like a
microscopical sprucefir bearing a glandular tip and secreting
odoriferous gummy matter54 or compare on the one hand the fruit of
the peach with its hairy skin fleshy covering hard shell and kernel
and on the other hand one of the more complex galls with its epidermic
spongy and woody layers surrounding tissue loaded with starch
granules these normal and abnormal structures manifestly present a
certain degree of resemblance or again reflect on the cases above
given of parrots which have had their plumage brightly decorated
through some change in their blood caused by having been fed on
certain fishes or locally inoculated with the poison of a toad i am
far from wishing to maintain that the mossrose or the hard shell of
the peachstone or the bright colours of birds are actually due to any
chemical change in the sap or blood but these cases of galls and of
parrots are excellently adapted to show us how powerfully and
singularly external agencies may affect structure with such facts
before us we need feel no surprise at the appearance of any
modification in any organic being
i may also here allude to the remarkable effects which parasitic
fungi sometimes produce on plants reissek55 has described a thesium
affected by an cidium which was greatly modified and assumed some of
the characteristic features of certain allied species or even genera
suppose says reissek the condition originally caused by the fungus
to become constant in the course of time the plant would if found
growing wild be considered as a distinct species or even as belonging
to a new genus i quote this remark to show how profoundly yet in how
natural a manner this plant must have been modified by the parasitic
fungus mr meehan56 also states that three species of euphorbia and
portulaca olereacea which naturally grow prostrate become erect
when they are attacked by the cidium euphorbia maculata in this
case also becomes nodose with the branchlets comparatively smooth and
the leaves modified in shape approaching in these respects to a
distinct species namely the e hypericifolia
      facts and considerations opposed to the belief that the
      conditions of life act in a potent manner in causing definite
      modifications of structure
i have alluded to the slight differences in species naturally living in
distinct countries under different conditions and such differences we
feel at first inclined to attribute probably often with justice to
the definite action of the surrounding conditions but it must be borne
in mind that there exist many animals and plants which range widely and
have been exposed to great diversities of climate yet remain uniform
in character some authors as previously remarked account for the
varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants by the definite
action of the conditions to which they have been exposed in the
different parts of great britain but there are about 200 plants57
which are found in every single english county and these plants must
have been exposed for an immense period to considerable differences of
climate and soil yet do not differ so again some animals and plants
range over a large portion of the world yet retain the same character
notwithstanding the facts previously given on the occurrence of highly
peculiar local diseases and on the strange modifications of structure
in plants caused by the inoculated poison of insects and other
analogous cases still there are a multitude of variationssuch as the
modified skull of the niata ox and bulldog the long horns of caffre
cattle the conjoined toes of the solidhoofed swine the immense crest
and protuberant skull of polish fowls the crop of the pouterpigeon
and a host of other such caseswhich we can hardly attribute to the
definite action in the sense before specified of the external
conditions of life no doubt in every case there must have been some
exciting cause but as we see innumerable individuals exposed to nearly
the same conditions and one alone is affected we may conclude that
the constitution of the individual is of far higher importance than the
conditions to which it has been exposed it seems indeed to be a
general rule that conspicuous variations occur rarely and in one
individual alone out of millions though all may have been exposed as
far as we can judge to nearly the same conditions as the most
strongly marked variations graduate insensibly into the most trifling
we are led by the same train of thought to attribute each slight
variation much more to innate differences of constitution however
caused than to the definite action of the surrounding conditions
we are led to the same conclusion by considering the cases formerly
alluded to of fowls and pigeons which have varied and will no doubt
go on varying in directly opposite ways though kept during many
generations under nearly the same conditions some for instance are
born with their beaks wings tails legs etc a little longer and
others with these same parts a little shorter by the longcontinued
selection of such slight individual differences which occur in birds
kept in the same aviary widely different races could certainly be
formed and longcontinued selection important as is the result does
nothing but preserve the variations which arise as it appears to us
spontaneously
in these cases we see that domesticated animals vary in an indefinite
number of particulars though treated as uniformly as is possible on
the other hand there are instances of animals and plants which
though they have been exposed to very different conditions both under
nature and domestication have varied in nearly the same manner mr
layard informs me that he has observed amongst the caffres of south
africa a dog singularly like an arctic esquimaux dog pigeons in india
present nearly the same wide diversities of colour as in europe and i
have seen chequered and simply barred pigeons and pigeons with blue
and white loins from sierra leone madeira england and india new
varieties of flowers are continually raised in different parts of great
britain but many of these are found by the judges at our exhibitions
to be almost identical with old varieties a vast number of new
fruittrees and culinary vegetables have been produced in north
america these differ from european varieties in the same general
manner as the several varieties raised in europe differ from one
another and no one has ever pretended that the climate of america has
given to the many american varieties any general character by which
they can be recognised nevertheless from the facts previously
advanced on the authority of mr meehan with respect to american and
european foresttrees it would be rash to affirm that varieties raised
in the two countries would not in the course of ages assume a
distinctive character dr m masters has recorded a striking fact58
bearing on this subject he raised numerous plants of hybiscus
syriacus from seed collected in south carolina and the holy land
where the parentplants must have been exposed to considerably
different conditions yet the seedlings from both localities broke into
two similar strains one with obtuse leaves and purple or crimson
flowers and the other with elongated leaves and more or less pink
flowers
we may also infer the prepotent influence of the constitution of the
organism over the definite action of the conditions of life from the
several cases given in the earlier chapters of parallel series of
varietiesan important subject hereafter to be more fully discussed
subvarieties of the several kinds of wheat gourds peaches and other
plants and to a limited extent subvarieties of the fowl pigeon and
dog have been shown either to resemble or to differ from one another
in a closely corresponding or parallel manner in other cases a
variety of one species resembles a distinct species or the varieties
of two distinct species resemble one another although these parallel
resemblances no doubt often result from reversion to the former
characters of a common progenitor yet in other cases when new
characters first appear the resemblance must be attributed to the
inheritance of a similar constitution and consequently to a tendency
to vary in the same manner we see something of a similar kind in the
same monstrosity appearing and reappearing many times in the same
species of animal and as dr maxwell masters has remarked to me in
the same species of plant
we may at least conclude that the amount of modification which animals
and plants have undergone under domestication does not correspond with
the degree to which they have been subjected to changed circumstances
as we know the parentage of domesticated birds far better than of most
quadrupeds we will glance through the list the pigeon has varied in
europe more than almost any other bird yet it is a native species and
has not been exposed to any extraordinary change of conditions the
fowl has varied equally or almost equally with the pigeon and is a
native of the hot jungles of india neither the peacock a native of
the same country nor the guineafowl an inhabitant of the dry deserts
of africa has varied at all or only in colour the turkey from
mexico has varied but little the duck on the other hand a native of
europe has yielded some wellmarked races and as this is an aquatic
bird it must have been subjected to a far more serious change in its
habits than the pigeon or even the fowl which nevertheless have varied
in a much higher degree the goose a native of europe and aquatic like
the duck has varied less than any other domesticated bird except the
peacock
budvariation is also important under our present point of view in
some few cases as when all the eyes on the same tuber of the potato
or all the fruit on the same plumtree or all the flowers on the same
plant have suddenly varied in the same manner it might be argued that
the variation had been definitely caused by some change in the
conditions to which the plants had been exposed yet in other cases
such an admission is extremely difficult as new characters sometimes
appear by budvariation which do not occur in the parentspecies or in
any allied species we may reject at least in these cases the idea
that they are due to reversion now it is well worth while to reflect
maturely on some striking case of budvariation for instance that of
the peach this tree has been cultivated by the million in various
parts of the world has been treated differently grown on its own
roots and grafted on various stocks planted as a standard trained
against a wall or under glass yet each bud of each subvariety keeps
true to its kind but occasionally at long intervals of time a tree
in england or under the widely different climate of virginia produces
a single bud and this yields a branch which ever afterwards bears
nectarines nectarines differ as every one knows from peaches in
their smoothness size and flavour and the difference is so great
that some botanists have maintained that they are specifically
distinct so permanent are the characters thus suddenly acquired that
a nectarine produced by budvariation has propagated itself by seed to
guard against the supposition that there is some fundamental
distinction between bud and seminal variation it is well to bear in
mind that nectarines have likewise been produced from the stone of the
peach and reversely peaches from the stone of the nectarine now is
it possible to conceive external conditions more closely alike than
those to which the buds on the same tree are exposed yet one bud
alone out of the many thousands borne by the same tree has suddenly
without any apparent cause produced a nectarine but the case is even
stronger than this for the same flowerbud has yielded a fruit
onehalf or onequarter a nectarine and the other half or
threequarters a peach again seven or eight varieties of the peach
have yielded by budvariation nectarines the nectarines thus produced
no doubt differ a little from one another but still they are
nectarines of course there must be some cause internal or external
to excite the peachbud to change its nature but i cannot imagine a
class of facts better adapted to force on our minds the conviction that
what we call the external conditions of life are in many cases quite
insignificant in relation to any particular variation in comparison
with the organisation or constitution of the being which varies
it is known from the labours of geoffroy sainthilaire and recently
from those of dareste and others that eggs of the fowl if shaken
placed upright perforated covered in part with varnish etc produce
monstrous chickens now these monstrosities may be said to be directly
caused by such unnatural conditions but the modifications thus induced
are not of a definite nature an excellent observer m camille
dareste59 remarks that the various species of monstrosities are not
determined by specific causes the external agencies which modify the
development of the embryo act solely in causing a perturbationa
perversion in the normal course of development he compares the result
to what we see in illness a sudden chill for instance affects one
individual alone out of many causing either a cold or sorethroat
rheumatism or inflammation of the lungs or pleura contagious matter
acts in an analogous manner60 we may take a still more specific
instance seven pigeons were struck by rattlesnakes61 some suffered
from convulsions some had their blood coagulated in others it was
perfectly fluid some showed ecchymosed spots on the heart others on
the intestines etc others again showed no visible lesion in any
organ it is well known that excess in drinking causes different
diseases in different men but in the tropics the effects of
intemperance differ from those caused in a cold climate62 and in
this case we see the definite influence of opposite conditions the
foregoing facts apparently give us as good an idea as we are likely for
a long time to obtain how in many cases external conditions act
directly though not definitely in causing modifications of structure
summarythere can be no doubt from the facts given in this chapter
that extremely slight changes in the conditions of life sometimes
probably often act in a definite manner on our domesticated
productions and as the action of changed conditions in causing
indefinite variability is accumulative so it may be with their
definite action hence considerable and definite modifications of
structure probably follow from altered conditions acting during a long
series of generations in some few instances a marked effect has been
produced quickly on all or nearly all the individuals which have been
exposed to a marked change of climate food or other circumstance
this has occurred with european men in the united states with european
dogs in india with horses in the falkland islands apparently with
various animals at angora with foreign oysters in the mediterranean
and with maize transported from one climate to another we have seen
that the chemical compounds of some plants and the state of their
tissues are readily affected by changed conditions a relation
apparently exists between certain characters and certain conditions so
that if the latter be changed the character is lostas with the colours
of flowers the state of some culinary plants the fruit of the melon
the tail of fattailed sheep and the peculiar fleeces of other sheep
the production of galls and the change of plumage in parrots when fed
on peculiar food or when inoculated by the poison of a toad prove to
us what great and mysterious changes in structure and colour may be
the definite result of chemical changes in the nutrient fluids or
tissues
we now almost certainly know that organic beings in a state of nature
may be modified in various definite ways by the conditions to which
they have been long exposed as in the case of the birds and other
animals in the northern and southern united states and of american
trees in comparison with their representatives in europe but in many
cases it is most difficult to distinguish between the definite result
of changed conditions and the accumulation through natural selection
of indefinite variations which have proved serviceable if it profited
a plant to inhabit a humid instead of an arid station a fitting change
in its constitution might possibly result from the direct action of the
environment though we have no grounds for believing that variations of
the right kind would occur more frequently with plants inhabiting a
station a little more humid than usual than with other plants whether
the station was unusually dry or humid variations adapting the plant
in a slight degree for directly opposite habits of life would
occasionally arise as we have good reason to believe from what we
actually see in other cases
the organisation or constitution of the being which is acted on is
generally a much more important element than the nature of the changed
conditions in determining the nature of the variation we have
evidence of this in the appearance of nearly similar modifications
under different conditions and of different modifications under
apparently nearly the same conditions we have still better evidence of
this in closely parallel varieties being frequently produced from
distinct races or even distinct species and in the frequent
recurrence of the same monstrosity in the same species we have also
seen that the degree to which domesticated birds have varied does not
stand in any close relation with the amount of change to which they
have been subjected
to recur once again to budvariations when we reflect on the millions
of buds which many trees have produced before some one bud has varied
we are lost in wonder as to what the precise cause of each variation
can be let us recall the case given by andrew knight of the
fortyyearold tree of the yellow magnum bonum plum an old variety
which has been propagated by grafts on various stocks for a very long
period throughout europe and north america and on which a single bud
suddenly produced the red magnum bonum we should also bear in mind
that distinct varieties and even distinct speciesas in the case of
peaches nectarines and apricotsof certain roses and
camelliasalthough separated by a vast number of generations from any
progenitor in common and although cultivated under diversified
conditions have yielded by budvariation closely analogous varieties
when we reflect on these facts we become deeply impressed with the
conviction that in such cases the nature of the variation depends but
little on the conditions to which the plant has been exposed and not
in any especial manner on its individual character but much more on
the inherited nature or constitution of the whole group of allied
beings to which the plant in question belongs we are thus driven to
conclude that in most cases the conditions of life play a subordinate
part in causing any particular modification like that which a spark
plays when a mass of combustibles bursts into flamethe nature of the
flame depending on the combustible matter and not on the spark63
no doubt each slight variation must have its efficient cause but it is
as hopeless an attempt to discover the cause of each as to say why a
chill or a poison affects one man differently from another even with
modifications resulting from the definite action of the conditions of
life when all or nearly all the individuals which have been similarly
exposed are similarly affected we can rarely see the precise relation
between cause and effect in the next chapter it will be shown that the
increased use or disuse of various organs produces an inherited effect
it will further be seen that certain variations are bound together by
correlation as well as by other laws beyond this we cannot at present
explain either the causes or nature of the variability of organic
beings

in this and the two following chapters i shall discuss as well as the
difficulty of the subject permits the several laws which govern
variability these may be grouped under the effects of use and disuse
including changed habits and acclimatisationarrest of
developmentcorrelated variationthe cohesion of homologous partsthe
variability of multiple partscompensation of growththe position of
buds with respect to the axis of the plantand lastly analogous
variation these several subjects so graduate into one another that
their distinction is often arbitrary
it may be convenient first briefly to discuss that coordinating and
reparative power which is common in a higher or lower degree to all
organic beings and which was formerly designated by physiologists as
nisus formativus
blumenbach and others1 have insisted that the principle which permits
a hydra when cut into fragments to develop itself into two or more
perfect animals is the same with that which causes a wound in the
higher animals to heal by a cicatrice such cases as that of the hydra
are evidently analogous to the spontaneous division or fissiparous
generation of the lowest animals and likewise to the budding of
plants between these extreme cases and that of a mere cicatrice we
have every gradation spallanzani2 by cutting off the legs and tail
of a salamander got in the course of three months six crops of these
members so that 687 perfect bones were reproduced by one animal during
one season at whatever point the limb was cut off the deficient part
and no more was exactly reproduced when a diseased bone has been
removed a new one sometimes gradually assumes the regular form and
all the attachments of muscles ligaments etc become as complete as
before3
this power of regrowth does not however always act perfectly the
reproduced tail of a lizard differs in the form of the scales from the
normal tail with certain orthopterous insects the large hind legs are
reproduced of smaller size4 the white cicatrice which in the higher
animals unites the edges of a deep wound is not formed of perfect skin
for elastic tissue is not produced till long afterwards5 the
activity of the nisus formativus says blumenbach is in an inverse
ratio to the age of the organised body its power is also greater with
animals the lower they stand in the scale of organisation and animals
low in the scale correspond with the embryos of higher animals
belonging to the same class newports observations6 afford a good
illustration of this fact for he found that myriapods whose highest
development scarcely carries them beyond the larva of perfect insects
can regenerate limbs and antennae up to the time of their last moult
and so can the larvae of true insects but except in one order not in
the mature insect salamanders correspond in development with the
tadpoles or larvae of the tailless batrachians and both possess to a
large extent the power of regrowth but not so the mature tailless
batrachians
absorption often plays an important part in the repair of injuries
when a bone is broken and does not unite the ends are absorbed and
rounded so that a false joint is formed or if the ends unite but
overlap the projecting parts are removed7 a dislocated bone will
form for itself a new socket displaced tendons and varicose veins
excavate new channels in the bones against which they press but
absorption comes into action as virchow remarks during the normal
growth of bones parts which are solid during youth become hollowed out
for the medullary tissue as the bone increases in size in trying to
understand the many welladapted cases of regrowth when aided by
absorption we should remember that almost all parts of the
organisation even whilst retaining the same form undergo constant
renewal so that a part which is not renewed would be liable to
absorption
some cases usually classed under the socalled nisus formativus at
first appear to come under a distinct head for not only are old
structures reproduced but new structures are formed thus after
inflammation false membranes furnished with bloodvessels
lymphatics and nerves are developed or a ftus escapes from the
fallopian tubes and falls into the abdomen nature pours out a
quantity of plastic lymph which forms itself into organised membrane
richly supplied with bloodvessels and the ftus is nourished for a
time in certain cases of hydrocephalus the open and dangerous spaces
in the skull are filled up with new bones which interlock by perfect
serrated sutures8 but most physiologists especially on the
continent have now given up the belief in plastic lymph or blastema
and virchow9 maintains that every structure new or old is formed by
the proliferation of preexisting cells on this view false membranes
like cancerous or other tumours are merely abnormal developments of
normal growths and we can thus understand how it is that they resemble
adjoining structures for instance that a false membrane in the
serous cavities acquires a covering of epithelium exactly like that
which covers the original serous membrane adhesions of the iris may
become black apparently from the production of pigmentcells like those
of the uvea10
no doubt the power of reparation though not always perfect is an
admirable provision ready for various emergencies even for such as
occur only at long intervals of time11 yet this power is not more
wonderful than the growth and development of every single creature
more especially of those which are propagated by fissiparous
generation this subject has been here noticed because we may infer
that when any part or organ is either greatly increased in size or
wholly suppressed through variation and continued selection the
coordinating power of the organisation will continually tend to bring
again all the parts into harmony with one another
      on the effects of the increased use and disuse of organs
it is notorious and we shall immediately adduce proofs that increased
use or action strengthens muscles glands senseorgans etc and that
disuse on the other hand weakens them it has been experimentally
proved by ranke12 that the flow of blood is greatly increased towards
any part which is performing work and sinks again when the part is at
rest consequently if the work is frequent the vessels increase in
size and the part is better nourished paget13 also accounts for the
long thick darkcoloured hairs which occasionally grow even in young
children near oldstanding inflamed surfaces or fractured bones by an
increased flow of blood to the part when hunter inserted the spur of a
cock into the comb which is well supplied with bloodvessels it grew
in one case spirally to a length of six inches and in another case
forward like a horn so that the bird could not touch the ground with
its beak according to the interesting observations of m sedillot14
when a portion of one of the bones of the leg of an animal is removed
the associated bone enlarges till it attains a bulk equal to that of
the two bones of which it has to perform the functions this is best
exhibited in dogs in which the tibia has been removed the companion
bone which is naturally almost filiform and not onefifth the size of
the other soon acquires a size equal to or greater than that of the
tibia now it is at first difficult to believe that increased weight
acting on a straight bone could by alternately increasing and
diminishing the pressure cause the blood to flow more freely in the
vessels which permeate the periosteum and thus supply more nutriment to
the bone nevertheless the observations adduced by mr spencer15 on
the strengthening of the bowed bones of rickety children along their
concave sides leads to the belief that this is possible
the rocking of the stem of a tree increases in a marked manner the
growth of the woody tissue in the parts which are strained prof sachs
believes from reasons which he assigns that this is due to the
pressure of the bark being relaxed in such parts and not as knight and
h spencer maintain to an increased flow of sap caused by the movement
of the trunk16 but hard woody tissue may be developed without the
aid of any movement as we see with ivy closely attached to an old
wall in all such cases it is very difficult to distinguish between
the effects of longcontinued selection and those which follow from the
increased action of the part or directly from some other cause mr h
spencer17 acknowledges this difficulty and gives as an instance the
thorns on trees and the shells of nuts here we have extremely hard
woody tissue without the possibility of any movement and without as
far as we can see any other directly exciting cause and as the
hardness of these parts is of manifest service to the plant we may
look at the result as probably due to the selection of socalled
spontaneous variations every one knows that hard work thickens the
epidermis on the hands and when we hear that with infants long before
birth the epidermis is thicker on the palms and soles of the feet than
on any other part of the body as was observed with admiration by
albinus18 we are naturally inclined to attribute this to the
inherited effects of longcontinued use or pressure we are tempted to
extend the same view even to the hoofs of quadrupeds but who will
pretend to determine how far natural selection may have aided in the
formation of structures of such obvious importance to the animal
that use strengthens the muscles may be seen in the limbs of artisans
who follow different trades and when a muscle is strengthened the
tendons and the crests of bone to which they are attached become
enlarged and this must likewise be the case with the bloodvessels and
nerves on the other hand when a limb is not used as by eastern
fanatics or when the nerve supplying it with nervous power is
effectually destroyed the muscles wither so again when the eye is
destroyed the optic nerve becomes atrophied sometimes even in the
course of a few months19 the proteus is furnished with branchiae as
well as with lungs and schreibers20 found that when the animal was
compelled to live in deep water the branchiae were developed to thrice
their ordinary size and the lungs were partially atrophied when on
the other hand the animal was compelled to live in shallow water the
lungs became larger and more vascular whilst the branchiae disappeared
in a more or less complete degree such modifications as these are
however of comparatively little value for us as we do not actually
know that they tend to be inherited
in many cases there is reason to believe that the lessened use of
various organs has affected the corresponding parts in the offspring
but there is no good evidence that this ever follows in the course of a
single generation it appears as in the case of general or indefinite
variability that several generations must be subjected to changed
habits for any appreciable result our domestic fowls ducks and geese
have almost lost not only in the individual but in the race their
power of flight for we do not see a young fowl when frightened take
flight like a young pheasant hence i was led carefully to compare the
limbbones of fowls ducks pigeons and rabbits with the same bones
in the wild parentspecies as the measurements and weights were fully
given in the earlier chapters i need here only recapitulate the
results with domestic pigeons the length of the sternum the
prominence of its crest the length of the scapulae and furculum the
length of the wings as measured from tip to tip of the radii are all
reduced relatively to the same parts in the wild pigeon the wing and
tail feathers however are increased in length but this may have as
little connection with the use of the wings or tail as the lengthened
hair on a dog with the amount of exercise which it has habitually
taken the feet of pigeons except in the longbeaked races are
reduced in size with fowls the crest of the sternum is less prominent
and is often distorted or monstrous the wingbones have become lighter
relatively to the legbones and are apparently a little shorter in
comparison with those of the parentform the gallus bankiva with
ducks the crest of the sternum is affected in the same manner as in
the foregoing cases the furculum coracoids and scapulae are all
reduced in weight relatively to the whole skeleton the bones of the
wings are shorter and lighter and the bones of the legs longer and
heavier relatively to each other and relatively to the whole
skeleton in comparison with the same bones in the wildduck the
decreased weight and size of the bones in the foregoing cases is
probably the indirect result of the reaction of the weakened muscles on
the bones i failed to compare the feathers of the wings of the tame
and wild duck but gloger21 asserts that in the wild duck the tips of
the wingfeathers reach almost to the end of the tail whilst in the
domestic duck they often hardly reach to its base he remarks also on
the greater thickness of the legs and says that the swimming membrane
between the toes is reduced but i was not able to detect this latter
difference
with the domesticated rabbit the body together with the whole
skeleton is generally larger and heavier than in the wild animal and
the legbones are heavier in due proportion but whatever standard of
comparison be taken neither the legbones nor the scapulae have
increased in length proportionally with the increased dimensions of the
rest of the skeleton the skull has become in a marked manner narrower
and from the measurements of its capacity formerly given we may
conclude that this narrowness results from the decreased size of the
brain consequent on the mentally inactive life led by these
closelyconfined animals
we have seen in the eighth chapter that silkmoths which have been
kept during many centuries closely confined emerge from their cocoons
with their wings distorted incapable of flight often greatly reduced
in size or even according to quatrefages quite rudimentary this
condition of the wings may be largely owing to the same kind of
monstrosity which often affects wild lepidoptera when artificially
reared from the cocoon or it may be in part due to an inherent
tendency which is common to the females of many bombycidae to have
their wings in a more or less rudimentary state but part of the effect
may be attributed to longcontinued disuse
from the foregoing facts there can be no doubt that with our anciently
domesticated animals certain bones have increased or decreased in size
and weight owing to increased or decreased use but they have not been
modified as shown in the earlier chapters in shape or structure with
animals living a free life and occasionally exposed to severe
competition the reduction would tend to be greater as it would be an
advantage to them to have the development of every superfluous part
saved with highlyfed domesticated animals on the other hand there
seems to be no economy of growth nor any tendency to the elimination
of superfluous details but to this subject i shall recur
turning now to more general observations nathusius has shown that with
the improved races of the pig the shortened legs and snout the form
of the articular condyles of the occiput and the position of the jaws
with the upper canine teeth projecting in a most anomalous manner in
front of the lower canines may be attributed to these parts not having
been fully exercised for the highlycultivated races do not travel in
search of food nor root up the ground with their ringed muzzles22
these modifications of structure which are all strictly inherited
characterise several improved breeds so that they cannot have been
derived from any single domestic stock with respect to cattle
professor tanner has remarked that the lungs and liver in the improved
breeds are found to be considerably reduced in size when compared with
those possessed by animals having perfect liberty23 and the
reduction of these organs affects the general shape of the body the
cause of the reduced lungs in highlybred animals which take little
exercise is obvious and perhaps the liver may be affected by the
nutritious and artificial food on which they largely subsist again
dr wilckens asserts24 that various parts of the body certainly
differ in alpine and lowland breeds of several domesticated animals
owing to their different habits of life for instance the neck and
forelegs in length and the hoofs in shape
it is well known that when an artery is tied the anastomosing
branches from being forced to transmit more blood increase in
diameter and this increase cannot be accounted for by mere extension
as their coats gain in strength with respect to glands sir j paget
observes that when one kidney is destroyed the other often becomes
much larger and does double work25 if we compare the size of the
udders and their power of secretion in cows which have been long
domesticated and in certain breeds of the goat in which the udders
nearly touch the ground with these organs in wild or halfdomesticated
animals the difference is great a good cow with us daily yields more
than five gallons or forty pints of milk whilst a firstrate animal
kept for instance by the damaras of south africa26 rarely gives
more than two or three pints of milk daily and should her calf be
taken from her she absolutely refuses to give any we may attribute
the excellence of our cows and of certain goats partly to the
continued selection of the best milking animals and partly to the
inherited effects of the increased action through mans art of the
secreting glands
it is notorious that shortsight is inherited and we have seen in the
twelfth chapter from the statistical researches of m giraudteulon
that the habit of viewing near objects gives a tendency to shortsight
veterinarians are unanimous that horses are affected with spavins
splints ringbones etc from being shod and from travelling on hard
roads and they are almost equally unanimous that a tendency to these
malformations is transmitted formerly horses were not shod in north
carolina and it has been asserted that they did not then suffer from
these diseases of the legs and feet27
our domesticated quadrupeds are all descended as far as is known from
species having erect ears yet few kinds can be named of which at
least one race has not drooping ears cats in china horses in parts of
russia sheep in italy and elsewhere the guineapig formerly in
germany goats and cattle in india rabbits pigs and dogs in all
longcivilised countries have dependent ears with wild animals which
constantly use their ears like funnels to catch every passing sound
and especially to ascertain the direction whence it comes there is
not as mr blyth has remarked any species with drooping ears except
the elephant hence the incapacity to erect the ears is certainly in
some manner the result of domestication and this incapacity has been
attributed by various authors28 to disuse for animals protected by
man are not compelled habitually to use their ears col hamilton
smith29 states that in ancient effigies of the dog with the
exception of one egyptian instance no sculpture of the earlier grecian
era produces representations of hounds with completely drooping ears
those with them half pendulous are missing in the most ancient and
this character increases by degrees in the works of the roman
period godron also has remarked that the pigs of the ancient
egyptians had not their ears enlarged and pendent30 but it is
remarkable that the drooping of the ear is not accompanied by any
decrease in size on the contrary animals so different as fancy
rabbits certain indian breeds of the goat our petted spaniels
bloodhounds and other dogs have enormously elongated ears so that
it would appear as if their weight had caused them to droop aided
perhaps by disuse with rabbits the drooping of the much elongated
ears has affected even the structure of the skull
the tail of no wild animal as remarked to me by mr blyth is curled
whereas pigs and some races of dogs have their tails much curled this
deformity therefore appears to be the result of domestication but
whether in any way connected with the lessened use of the tail is
doubtful
the epidermis on our hands is easily thickened as every one knows by
hard work in a district of ceylon the sheep have horny callosities
that defend their knees and which arise from their habit of kneeling
down to crop the short herbage and this distinguishes the jaffna
flocks from those of other portions of the island but it is not
stated whether this peculiarity is inherited31
the mucous membrane which lines the stomach is continuous with the
external skin of the body therefore it is not surprising that its
texture should be affected by the nature of the food consumed but
other and more interesting changes likewise follow hunter long ago
observed that the muscular coat of the stomach of a gull larus
tridactylus which had been fed for a year chiefly on grain was
thickened and according to dr edmondston a similar change
periodically occurs in the shetland islands in the stomach of the
larus argentatus which in the spring frequents the cornfields and
feeds on the seed the same careful observer has noticed a great change
in the stomach of a raven which had been long fed on vegetable food in
the case of an owl strix grallaria similarly treated menetries
states that the form of the stomach was changed the inner coat became
leathery and the liver increased in size whether these modifications
in the digestive organs would in the course of generations become
inherited is not known32
the increased or diminished length of the intestines which apparently
results from changed diet is a more remarkable case because it is
characteristic of certain animals in their domesticated condition and
therefore must be inherited the complex absorbent system the
bloodvessels nerves and muscles are necessarily all modified
together with the intestines according to daubenton the intestines of
the domestic cat are onethird longer than those of the wild cat of
europe and although this species is not the parentstock of the
domestic animal yet as isidore geoffroy has remarked the several
species of cats are so closely allied that the comparison is probably a
fair one the increased length appears to be due to the domestic cat
being less strictly carnivorous in its diet than any wild feline
species for instance i have seen a french kitten eating vegetables as
readily as meat according to cuvier the intestines of the
domesticated pig exceed greatly in proportionate length those of the
wild boar in the tame and wild rabbit the change is of an opposite
nature and probably results from the nutritious food given to the tame
rabbit33
changed and inherited habits of lifethis subject as far as the
mental powers of animals are concerned so blends into instinct that i
will here only remind the reader of such cases as the tameness of our
domesticated animalsthe pointing or retrieving of dogs their not
attacking the smaller animals kept by manand so forth how much of
these changes ought to be attributed to mere habit and how much to the
selection of individuals which have varied in the desired manner
irrespectively of the special circumstances under which they have been
kept can seldom be told
we have already seen that animals may be habituated to a changed diet
but some additional instances may be given in the polynesian islands
and in china the dog is fed exclusively on vegetable matter and the
taste for this kind of food is to a certain extent inherited34 our
sporting dogs will not touch the bones of game birds whilst most other
dogs devour them with greediness in some parts of the world sheep have
been largely fed on fish the domestic hog is fond of barley the wild
boar is said to disdain it and the disdain is partially inherited for
some young wild pigs bred in captivity showed an aversion for this
grain whilst others of the same brood relished it35 one of my
relations bred some young pigs from a chinese sow by a wild alpine
boar they lived free in the park and were so tame that they came to
the house to be fed but they would not touch swill which was devoured
by the other pigs an animal when once accustomed to an unnatural diet
which can generally be effected only during youth dislikes its proper
food as spallanzani found to be the case with a pigeon which had been
long fed on meat individuals of the same species take to new food with
different degrees of readiness one horse it is stated soon learned
to eat meat whilst another would have perished from hunger rather than
have partaken of it36 the caterpillars of the bombyx hesperus feed
in a state of nature on the leaves of the caf diable but after
having been reared on the ailanthus they would not touch the  caf
diable and actually died of hunger37
it has been found possible to accustom marine fish to live in fresh
water but as such changes in fish and other marine animals have been
chiefly observed in a state of nature they do not properly belong to
our present subject the period of gestation and of maturity as shown
in the earlier chaptersthe season and the frequency of the act of
breedinghave all been greatly modified under domestication with the
egyptian goose the rate of change with respect to the season has been
recorded38 the wild drake pairs with one female the domestic drake
is polygamous certain breeds of fowls have lost the habit of
incubation the paces of the horse and the manner of flight of certain
breeds of the pigeon have been modified and are inherited cattle
horses and pigs have learnt to browse under water in the st johns
river east florida where the vallisneria has been largely
naturalised the cows were observed by prof wyman to keep their heads
immersed for a period varying from fifteen to thirtyfive
seconds39 the voice differs much in certain kinds of fowls and
pigeons some varieties are clamorous and others silent as the call
and common duck or the spitz and pointer dog every one knows how the
breeds of the dog differ from one another in their manner of hunting
and in their ardour after different kinds of game or vermin
with plants the period of vegetation is easily changed and is
inherited as in the case of summer and winter wheat barley and
vetches but to this subject we shall immediately return under
acclimatisation annual plants sometimes become perennial under a new
climate as i hear from dr hooker is the case with the stock and
mignonette in tasmania on the other hand perennials sometimes become
annuals as with the ricinus in england and as according to captain
mangles with many varieties of the heartsease von berg40 raised
from seed of verbascum phniceum which is usually a biennial both
annual and perennial varieties some deciduous bushes become evergreen
in hot countries41 rice requires much water but there is one
variety in india which can be grown without irrigation42 certain
varieties of the oat and of our other cereals are best fitted for
certain soils43 endless similar facts could be given in the animal
and vegetable kingdoms they are noticed here because they illustrate
analogous differences in closely allied natural species and because
such changed habits of life whether due to habit or to the direct
action of external conditions or to socalled spontaneous variability
would be apt to lead to modifications of structure
acclimatisationfrom the previous remarks we are naturally led to
the much disputed subject of acclimatisation there are two distinct
questions do varieties descended from the same species differ in their
power of living under different climates and secondly if they so
differ how have they become thus adapted we have seen that european
dogs do not succeed well in india and it is asserted44 that no one
has there succeeded in keeping the newfoundland long alive but then it
may be argued and probably with truth that these northern breeds are
specifically distinct from the native dogs which flourish in india the
same remark may be made with respect to different breeds of sheep of
which according to youatt45 not one brought from a torrid climate
lasts out the second year in the zoological gardens but sheep are
capable of some degree of acclimatisation for merino sheep bred at the
cape of good hope have been found far better adapted for india than
those imported from england46 it is almost certain that all the
breeds of the fowl are descended from one species but the spanish
breed which there is good reason to believe originated near the
mediterranean47 though so fine and vigorous in england suffers more
from frost than any other breed the arrindy silk moth introduced from
bengal and the ailanthus moth from the temperate province of shan
tung in china belong to the same species as we may infer from their
identity in the caterpillar cocoon and mature states48 yet they
differ much in constitution the indian form will flourish only in
warm latitudes the other is quite hardy and withstands cold and rain
plants are more strictly adapted to climate than are animals the
latter when domesticated withstand such great diversities of climate
that we find nearly the same species in tropical and temperate
countries whilst the cultivated plants are widely dissimilar hence a
larger field is open for inquiry in regard to the acclimatisation of
plants than of animals it is no exaggeration to say that with almost
every plant which has long been cultivated varieties exist which are
endowed with constitutions fitted for very different climates i will
select only a few of the more striking cases as it would be tedious to
give all in north america numerous fruittrees have been raised and
in horticultural publicationsfor instance in that by downinglists
are given of the varieties which are best able to withstand the severe
climate of the northern states and canada many american varieties of
the pear plum and peach are excellent in their own country but until
recently hardly one was known that succeeded in england and with
apples49 not one succeeds though the american varieties can
withstand a severer winter than ours the summer here is not hot
enough fruittrees have also originated in europe with different
constitutions but they are not much noticed because nurserymen here
do not supply wide areas the forelle pear flowers early and when the
flowers have just set and this is the critical period they have been
observed both in france and england to withstand with complete
impunity a frost of 18 deg and even 14 fahr which killed the
flowers whether fully expanded or in bud of all other kinds of
pears50 this power in the flower of resisting cold and afterwards
producing fruit does not invariably depend as we know on good
authority51 on general constitutional vigour in proceeding
northward the number of varieties which are found capable of resisting
the climate rapidly decreases as may be seen in the list of the
varieties of the cherry apple and pear which can be cultivated in
the neighbourhood of stockholm52 near moscow prince troubetzkoy
planted for experiment in the open ground several varieties of the
pear but one alone the poire sans pepins withstood the cold of
winter53 we thus see that our fruittrees like distinct species of
the same genus certainly differ from each other in their
constitutional adaptation to different climates
with the varieties of many plants the adaptation to climate is often
very close thus it has been proved by repeated trials that few if any
of the english varieties of wheat are adapted for cultivation in
scotland54 but the failure in this case is at first only in the
quantity though ultimately in the quality of the grain produced the
rev m j berkeley sowed wheatseed from india and got the most
meagre ears on land which would certainly have yielded a good crop
from english wheat55 in these cases varieties have been carried from
a warmer to a cooler climate in the reverse case as when wheat was
imported directly from france into the west indian islands it produced
either wholly barren spikes or furnished with only two or three
miserable seeds while west indian seed by its side yielded an enormous
harvest56 here is another case of close adaptation to a slightly
cooler climate a kind of wheat which in england may be used
indifferently either as a winter or summer variety when sown under the
warmer climate of grignan in france behaved exactly as if it had been
a true winter wheat57
botanists believe that all the varieties of maize belong to the same
species and we have seen that in north america in proceeding
northward the varieties cultivated in each zone produce their flowers
and ripen their seed within shorter and shorter periods so that the
tall slowly maturing southern varieties do not succeed in new england
and the new english varieties do not succeed in canada i have not met
with any statement that the southern varieties are actually injured or
killed by a degree of cold which the northern varieties can withstand
with impunity though this is probable but the production of early
flowering and early seeding varieties deserves to be considered as one
form of acclimatisation hence it has been found possible according to
kalm to cultivate maize further and further northwards in america in
europe also as we learn from the evidence given by alph de candolle
the culture of maize has extended since the end of the last century
thirty leagues north of its former boundary58 on the authority of
linnus59 i may quote an analogous case namely that in sweden
tobacco raised from homegrown seed ripens its seed a month sooner and
is less liable to miscarry than plants raised from foreign seed
with the vine differently from the maize the line of practical
culture has retreated a little southward since the middle ages60 but
this seems due to commerce being now easier so that it is better to
import wine from the south than to make it in northern districts
nevertheless the fact of the vine not having spread northward shows
that acclimatisation has made no progress during several centuries
there is however a marked difference in the constitution of the
several varieties some being hardy whilst others like the muscat of
alexandria require a very high temperature to come to perfection
according to labat61 vines taken from france to the west indies
succeed with extreme difficulty whilst those imported from madeira or
the canary islands thrive admirably
gallesio gives a curious account of the naturalisation of the orange in
italy during many centuries the sweet orange was propagated
exclusively by grafts and so often suffered from frosts that it
required protection after the severe frost of 1709 and more
especially after that of 1763 so many trees were destroyed that
seedlings from the sweet orange were raised and to the surprise of
the inhabitants their fruit was found to be sweet the trees thus
raised were larger more productive and hardier than the old kinds
and seedlings are now continually raised hence gallesio concludes that
much more was effected for the naturalisation of the orange in italy by
the accidental production of new kinds during a period of about sixty
years than had been effected by grafting old varieties during many
ages62 i may add that risso63 describes some portuguese varieties
of the orange as extremely sensitive to cold and as much tenderer than
certain other varieties
the peach was known to theophrastus 322 bc64 according to the
authorities quoted by dr f rolle65 it was tender when first
introduced into greece and even in the island of rhodes only
occasionally bore fruit if this be correct the peach in spreading
during the last two thousand years over the middle parts of europe
must have become much hardier at the present day different varieties
differ much in hardiness some french varieties will not succeed in
england and near paris the pavie de bonneuil does not ripen its
fruit till very late in the season even when grown on a wall it is
therefore only fit for a very hot southern climate66
i will briefly give a few other cases a variety of magnolia
grandiflora raised by m roy withstands a temperature several
degrees lower than that which any other variety can resist with
camellias there is much difference in hardiness one particular variety
of the noisette rose withstood the severe frost of 1860 untouched and
hale amidst a universal destruction of other noisettes in new york
the irish yew is quite hardy but the common yew is liable to be cut
down i may add that there are varieties of the sweet potato
convolvulus batatas which are suited for warmer as well as for
colder climates67
the plants as yet mentioned have been found capable of resisting an
unusual degree of cold or heat when fully grown the following cases
refer to plants whilst young in a large bed of young araucarias of the
same age growing close together and equally exposed it was
observed68 after the unusually severe winter of 186061 that in
the midst of the dying numerous individuals remained on which the
frost had absolutely made no kind of impression dr lindley after
alluding to this and other similar cases remarks among the lessons
which the late formidable winter has taught us is that even in their
power of resisting cold individuals of the same species of plants are
remarkably different near salisbury there was a sharp frost on the
night of may 24 1836 and all the french beans phaseolus vulgaris
in a bed were killed except about one in thirty which completely
escaped69 on the same day of the month but in the year 1864 there
was a severe frost in kent and two rows of scarletrunners p
multiflorus in my garden containing 390 plants of the same age and
equally exposed were all blackened and killed except about a dozen
plants in an adjoining row of fulmers dwarf bean p vulgaris
one single plant escaped a still more severe frost occurred four days
afterwards and of the dozen plants which had previously escaped only
three survived these were not taller or more vigorous than the other
young plants but they escaped completely with not even the tips of
their leaves browned it was impossible to behold these three plants
with their blackened withered and dead brethren all around and not
see at a glance that they differed widely in constitutional power of
resisting frost
this work is not the proper place to show that wild plants of the same
species naturally growing at different altitudes or under different
latitudes become to a certain extent acclimatised as is proved by the
different behaviour of their seedlings when raised in another country
in my origin of species i have alluded to some cases and i could add
many others one instance must suffice mr grigor of forres70
states that seedlings of the scotch fir pinus sylvestris raised
from seed from the continent and from the forests of scotland differ
much the difference is perceptible in oneyearold and more so in
twoyearold seedlings but the effects of the winter on the second
years growth almost uniformly make those from the continent quite
brown and so damaged that by the month of march they are quite
unsaleable while the plants from the native scotch pine under the
same treatment and standing alongside although considerably shorter
are rather stouter and quite green so that the beds of the one can be
known from the other when seen from the distance of a mile closely
similar facts have been observed with seedling larches
hardy varieties would alone be valued or noticed in europe whilst
tender varieties requiring more warmth would generally be neglected
but such occasionally arise thus loudon71 describes a cornish
variety of the elm which is almost an evergreen and of which the
shoots are often killed by the autumnal frosts so that its timber is
of little value horticulturists know that some varieties are much more
tender than others thus all the varieties of the broccoli are more
tender than cabbages but there is much difference in this respect in
the subvarieties of the broccoli the pink and purple kinds are a
little hardier than the white cape broccoli but they are not to be
depended on after the thermometer falls below 24 fahr the walcheren
broccoli is less tender than the cape and there are several varieties
which will stand much severer cold than the walcheren72 cauliflowers
seed more freely in india than cabbages73 to give one instance with
flowers eleven plants raised from a hollyhock called the queen of
the whites74 were found to be much more tender than various other
seedlings it may be presumed that all tender varieties would succeed
better under a climate warmer than ours with fruittrees it is well
known that certain varieties for instance of the peach stand forcing
in a hothouse better than others and this shows either pliability of
organisation or some constitutional difference the same individual
cherrytree when forced has been observed during successive years
gradually to change its period of vegetation75 few pelargoniums can
resist the heat of a stove but alba multiflora will as a most
skilful gardener asserts stand pineapple top and bottom heat the
whole winter without looking any more drawn than if it had stood in a
common greenhouse and  blanche fleur seems as if it had been made on
purpose for growing in winter like many bulbs and to rest all
summer76 there can hardly be a doubt that the alba multiflora
pelargonium must have a widely different constitution from that of most
other varieties of this plant it would probably withstand even an
equatorial climate
we have seen that according to labat the vine and wheat require
acclimatisation in order to succeed in the west indies similar facts
have been observed at madras two parcels of mignonetteseed one
direct from europe the other saved at bangalore of which the mean
temperature is much below that of madras were sown at the same time
they both vegetated equally favourably but the former all died off a
few days after they appeared above ground the latter still survive
and are vigorous healthy plants so again turnip and carrot seed
saved at hyderabad are found to answer better at madras than seed from
europe or from the cape of good hope77 mr j scott of the calcutta
botanic gardens informs me that seeds of the sweetpea lathyrus
odoratus imported from england produce plants with thick rigid
stems and small leaves which rarely blossom and never yield seed
plants raised from french seed blossom sparingly but all the flowers
are sterile on the other hand plants raised from sweetpeas grown
near darjeeling in upper india but originally derived from england
can be successfully cultivated on the plains of india for they flower
and seed profusely and their stems are lax and scandent in some of
the foregoing cases as dr hooker has remarked to me the greater
success may perhaps be attributed to the seeds having been more fully
ripened under a more favourable climate but this view can hardly be
extended to so many cases including plants which from being
cultivated under a climate hotter than their native one become fitted
for a still hotter climate we may therefore safely conclude that
plants can to a certain extent become accustomed to a climate either
hotter or colder than their own although the latter cases have been
more frequently observed
we will now consider the means by which acclimatisation may be
effected namely through the appearance of varieties having a
different constitution and through the effects of habit in regard to
new varieties there is no evidence that a change in the constitution
of the offspring necessarily stands in any direct relation with the
nature of the climate inhabited by the parents on the contrary it is
certain that hardy and tender varieties of the same species appear in
the same country new varieties thus spontaneously arising become
fitted to slightly different climates in two different ways firstly
they may have the power either as seedlings or when fullgrown of
resisting intense cold as with the moscow pear or of resisting
intense heat as with some kinds of pelargonium or the flowers may
withstand severe frost as with the forelle pear secondly plants may
become adapted to climates widely different from their own from
flowering and fruiting either earlier or later in the season in both
these cases the power of acclimatisation by man consists simply in the
selection and preservation of new varieties but without any direct
intention on his part of securing a hardier variety acclimatisation
may be unconsciously effected by merely raising tender plants from
seed and by occasionally attempting their cultivation further and
further northwards as in the case of maize the orange and the peach
how much influence ought to be attributed to inherited habit or custom
in the acclimatisation of animals and plants is a much more difficult
question in many cases natural selection can hardly have failed to
have come into play and complicated the result it is notorious that
mountain sheep resist severe weather and storms of snow which would
destroy lowland breeds but then mountain sheep have been thus exposed
from time immemorial and all delicate individuals will have been
destroyed and the hardiest preserved so with the arrindy silkmoths
of china and india who can tell how far natural selection may have
taken a share in the formation of the two races which are now fitted
for such widely different climates it seems at first probable that the
many fruittrees which are so well fitted for the hot summers and cold
winters of north america in contrast with their poor success under our
climate have become adapted through habit but when we reflect on the
multitude of seedlings annually raised in that country and that none
would succeed unless born with a fitting constitution it is possible
that mere habit may have done nothing towards their acclimatisation on
the other hand when we hear that merino sheep bred during no great
number of generations at the cape of good hopethat some european
plants raised during only a few generations in the cooler parts of
india withstand the hotter parts of that country much better than the
sheep or seeds imported directly from england we must attribute some
influence to habit we are led to the same conclusion when we hear from
naudin78 that the races of melons squashes and gourds which have
long been cultivated in northern europe are comparatively more
precocious and need much less heat for maturing their fruit than the
varieties of the same species recently brought from tropical regions
in the reciprocal conversion of summer and winter wheat barley and
vetches into each other habit produces a marked effect in the course
of a very few generations the same thing apparently occurs with the
varieties of maize which when carried from the southern states of
america or into germany soon became accustomed to their new homes
with vineplants taken to the west indies from madeira which are said
to succeed better than plants brought directly from france we have
some degree of acclimatisation in the individual independently of the
production of new varieties by seed
the common experience of agriculturists is of some value and they
often advise persons to be cautious in trying the productions of one
country in another the ancient agricultural writers of china recommend
the preservation and cultivation of the varieties peculiar to each
country during the classical period columella wrote vernaculum
pecus peregrino longe prstantius est79
i am aware that the attempt to acclimatise either animals or plants has
been called a vain chimera no doubt the attempt in most cases deserves
to be thus called if made independently of the production of new
varieties endowed with a different constitution with plants propagated
by buds habit rarely produces any effect it apparently acts only
through successive seminal generations the laurel bay laurestinus
etc and the jerusalem artichoke which are propagated by cuttings or
tubers are probably now as tender in england as when first introduced
and this appears to be the case with the potato which until recently
was seldom multiplied by seed with plants propagated by seed and with
animals there will be little or no acclimatisation unless the hardier
individuals are either intentionally or unconsciously preserved the
kidneybean has often been advanced as an instance of a plant which has
not become hardier since its first introduction into britain we hear
however on excellent authority80 that some very fine seed imported
from abroad produced plants which blossomed most profusely but were
nearly all but abortive whilst plants grown alongside from english
seed podded abundantly and this apparently shows some degree of
acclimatisation in our english plants we have also seen that seedlings
of the kidneybean occasionally appear with a marked power of resisting
frost but no one as far as i can hear has ever separated such hardy
seedlings so as to prevent accidental crossing and then gathered
their seed and repeated the process year after year it may however
be objected with truth that natural selection ought to have had a
decided effect on the hardiness of our kidneybeans for the tenderest
individuals must have been killed during every severe spring and the
hardier preserved but it should be borne in mind that the result of
increased hardiness would simply be that gardeners who are always
anxious for as early a crop as possible would sow their seed a few
days earlier than formerly now as the period of sowing depends much
on the soil and elevation of each district and varies with the season
and as new varieties have often been imported from abroad can we feel
sure that our kidneybeans are not somewhat hardier i have not been
able by searching old horticultural works to answer this question
satisfactorily
on the whole the facts now given show that though habit does something
towards acclimatisation yet that the appearance of constitutionally
different individuals is a far more effective agent as no single
instance has been recorded either with animals or plants of hardier
individuals having been long and steadily selected though such
selection is admitted to be indispensable for the improvement of any
other character it is not surprising that man has done little in the
acclimatisation of domesticated animals and cultivated plants we need
not however doubt that under nature new races and new species would
become adapted to widely different climates by variation aided by
habit and regulated by natural selection
      arrests of development rudimentary and aborted organs
modifications of structure from arrested development so great or so
serious as to deserve to be called monstrosities are not infrequent
with domesticated animals but as they differ much from any normal
structure they require only a passing notice thus the whole head may
be represented by a soft nipplelike projection and the limbs by mere
papillae these rudiments of limbs are sometimes inherited as has been
observed in a dog81
many lesser anomalies appear to be due to arrested development what
the cause of the arrest may be we seldom know except in the case of
direct injury to the embryo that the cause does not generally act at
an extremely early embryonic period we may infer from the affected
organ seldom being wholly aborteda rudiment being generally
preserved the external ears are represented by mere vestiges in a
chinese breed of sheep and in another breed the tail is reduced to a
little button suffocated in a manner by fat82 in tailless dogs
and cats a stump is left in certain breeds of fowls the comb and
wattles are reduced to rudiments in the cochinchina breed scarcely
more than rudiments of spurs exist with polled suffolk cattle
rudiments of horns can often be felt at an early age83 and with
species in a state of nature the relatively great development of
rudimentary organs at an early period of life is highly characteristic
of such organs with hornless breeds of cattle and sheep another and
singular kind of rudiment has been observed namely minute dangling
horns attached to the skin alone and which are often shed and grow
again with hornless goats according to desmarest84 the bony
protuberance which properly supports the horn exists as a mere
rudiment
with cultivated plants it is far from rare to find the petals stamens
and pistils represented by rudiments like those observed in natural
species so it is with the whole seed in many fruits thus near
astrakhan there is a grape with mere traces of seeds so small and
lying so near the stalk that they are not perceived in eating the
grape85 in certain varieties of the gourd the tendrils according
to naudin are represented by rudiments or by various monstrous
growths in the broccoli and cauliflower the greater number of the
flowers are incapable of expansion and include rudimentary organs in
the feather hyacinth muscari comosum in its natural state the upper
and central flowers are brightly coloured but rudimentary under
cultivation the tendency to abortion travels downwards and outwards
and all the flowers become rudimentary but the abortive stamens and
pistils are not so small in the lower as in the upper flowers in the
viburnum opulus on the other hand the outer flowers naturally have
their organs of fructification in a rudimentary state and the corolla
is of large size under cultivation the change spreads to the centre
and all the flowers become affected in the compositae the socalled
doubling of the flowers consists in the greater development of the
corolla of the central florets generally accompanied with some degree
of sterility and it has been observed86 that the progressive
doubling invariably spreads from the circumference to the centrethat
is from the ray florets which so often include rudimentary organs to
those of the disc i may add as bearing on this subject that with
asters seeds taken from the florets of the circumference have been
found to yield the greatest number of double flowers87 in the above
cases we have a natural tendency in certain parts to be rudimentary
and this under culture spreads either to or from the axis of the
plant it deserves notice as showing how the same laws govern the
changes which natural species and artificial varieties undergo that in
the species of carthamus one of the compositae a tendency to the
abortion of the pappus may be traced extending from the circumference
to the centre of the disc as in the socalled doubling of the flowers
in the members of the same family thus according to a de
jussieu88 the abortion is only partial in carthamus creticus but
more extended in c lanatus for in this species only two or three of
the central seeds are furnished with a pappus the surrounding seeds
being either quite naked or furnished with a few hairs and lastly in
c tinctorius even the central seeds are destitute of pappus and
the abortion is complete
with animals and plants under domestication when an organ disappears
leaving only a rudiment the loss has generally been sudden as with
hornless and tailless breeds and such cases may be ranked as inherited
monstrosities but in some few cases the loss has been gradual and has
been effected partly by selection as with the rudimentary combs and
wattles of certain fowls we have also seen that the wings of some
domesticated birds have been slightly reduced by disuse and the great
reduction of the wings in certain silkmoths with mere rudiments left
has probably been aided by disuse
with species in a state of nature rudimentary organs are extremely
common such organs are generally variable as several naturalists have
observed for being useless they are not regulated by natural
selection and they are more or less liable to reversion the same rule
certainly holds good with parts which have become rudimentary under
domestication we do not know through what steps under nature
rudimentary organs have passed in being reduced to their present
condition but we so incessantly see in species of the same group the
finest gradations between an organ in a rudimentary and perfect state
that we are led to believe that the passage must have been extremely
gradual it may be doubted whether a change of structure so abrupt as
the sudden loss of an organ would ever be of service to a species in a
state of nature for the conditions to which all organisms are closely
adapted usually change very slowly even if an organ did suddenly
disappear in some one individual by an arrest of development
intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species would tend
to cause its partial reappearance so that its final reduction could
only be effected by some other means the most probable view is that a
part which is now rudimentary was formerly owing to changed habits of
life used less and less being at the same time reduced in size by
disuse until at last it became quite useless and superfluous but as
most parts or organs are not brought into action during an early period
of life disuse or decreased action will not lead to their reduction
until the organism arrives at a somewhat advanced age and from the
principle of inheritance at corresponding ages the reduction will be
transmitted to the offspring at the same advanced stage of growth the
part or organ will thus retain its full size in the embryo as we know
to be the case with most rudiments as soon as a part becomes useless
another principle that of economy of growth will come into play as
it would be an advantage to an organism exposed to severe competition
to save the development of any useless part and individuals having the
part less developed will have a slight advantage over others but as
mr mivart has justly remarked as soon as a part is much reduced the
saving from its further reduction will be utterly insignificant so
that this cannot be effected by natural selection this manifestly
holds good if the part be formed of mere cellular tissue entailing
little expenditure of nutriment how then can the further reduction of
an already somewhat reduced part be effected that this has occurred
repeatedly under nature is shown by the many gradations which exist
between organs in a perfect state and the merest vestiges of them mr
romanes89 has i think thrown much light on this difficult problem
his view as far as it can be given in a few words is as follows all
parts are somewhat variable and fluctuate in size round an average
point now when a part has already begun from any cause to decrease
it is very improbable that the variations should be as great in the
direction of increase as of diminution for the previous reduction
shows that circumstances have not been favourable for its development
whilst there is nothing to check variations in the opposite direction
if this be so the long continued crossing of many individuals
furnished with an organ which fluctuates in a greater degree towards
decrease than towards increase will slowly but steadily lead to its
diminution with respect to the complete and absolute abortion of a
part a distinct principle which will be discussed in the chapter on
pangenesis probably comes into action
with animals and plants reared by man there is no severe or recurrent
struggle for existence and the principle of economy will not come into
action so that the reduction of an organ will not thus be aided so
far indeed is this from being the case that in some few instances
organs which are naturally rudimentary in the parentspecies become
partially redeveloped in the domesticated descendants thus cows like
most other ruminants properly have four active and two rudimentary
mamma but in our domesticated animals the latter occasionally become
considerably developed and yield milk the atrophied mammae which in
male domesticated animals including man have in some rare cases grown
to full size and secreted milk perhaps offer an analogous case the
hind feet of dogs naturally include rudiments of a fifth toe and in
certain large breeds these toes though still rudimentary become
considerably developed and are furnished with claws in the common hen
the spurs and comb are rudimentary but in certain breeds these become
independently of age or disease of the ovaria well developed the
stallion has canine teeth but the mare has only traces of the alveoli
which as i am informed by the eminent veterinarian mr g t brown
frequently contain minute irregular nodules of bone these nodules
however sometimes become developed into imperfect teeth protruding
through the gums and coated with enamel and occasionally they grow to
a fourth or even a third of the length of the canines in the stallion
with plants i do not know whether the redevelopment of rudimentary
organs occurs more frequently under culture than under nature perhaps
the peartree may be a case in point for when wild it bears thorns
which consist of branches in a rudimentary condition and serve as a
protection but when the tree is cultivated they are reconverted into
branches

all parts of the organisation are to a certain extent connected
together but the connection may be so slight that it hardly exists as
with compound animals or the buds on the same tree even in the higher
animals various parts are not at all closely related for one part may
be wholly suppressed or rendered monstrous without any other part of
the body being affected but in some cases when one part varies
certain other parts always or nearly always simultaneously vary they
are then subject to the law of correlated variation the whole body is
admirably coordinated for the peculiar habits of life of each organic
being and may be said as the duke of argyll insists in his reign of
law to be correlated for this purpose again in large groups of
animals certain structures always coexist for instance a peculiar
form of stomach with teeth of peculiar form and such structures may in
one sense be said to be correlated but these cases have no necessary
connection with the law to be discussed in the present chapter for we
do not know that the initial or primary variations of the several parts
were in any way related slight modifications or individual differences
may have been preserved first in one and then in another part until
the final and perfectly coadapted structure was acquired but to this
subject i shall presently recur again in many groups of animals the
males alone are furnished with weapons or are ornamented with gay
colours and these characters manifestly stand in some sort of
correlation with the male reproductive organs for when the latter are
destroyed these characters disappear but it was shown in the twelfth
chapter that the very same peculiarity may become attached at any age
to either sex and afterwards be exclusively transmitted to the same
sex at a corresponding age in these cases we have inheritance limited
by both sex and age but we have no reason for supposing that the
original cause of the variation was necessarily connected with the
reproductive organs or with the age of the affected being
in cases of true correlated variation we are sometimes able to see the
nature of the connection but in most cases it is hidden from us and
certainly differs in different cases we can seldom say which of two
correlated parts first varies and induces a change in the other or
whether the two are the effects of some common cause correlated
variation is an important subject for us for when one part is modified
through continued selection either by man or under nature other parts
of the organisation will be unavoidably modified from this correlation
it apparently follows that with our domesticated animals and plants
varieties rarely or never differ from one another by a single character
alone
one of the simplest cases of correlation is that a modification which
arises during an early stage of growth tends to influence the
subsequent development of the same part as well as of other and
intimately connected parts isidore geoffroy sainthilaire states1
that this may constantly be observed with monstrosities in the animal
kingdom and moquintandon2 remarks that as with plants the axis
cannot become monstrous without in some way affecting the organs
subsequently produced from it so axial anomalies are almost always
accompanied by deviations of structure in the appended parts we shall
presently see that with shortmuzzled races of the dog certain
histological changes in the basal elements of the bones arrest their
development and shorten them and this affects the position of the
subsequently developed molar teeth it is probable that certain
modifications in the larv of insects would affect the structure of the
mature insects but we must be careful not to extend this view too far
for during the normal course of development certain species pass
through an extraordinary course of change whilst other and closely
allied species arrive at maturity with little change of structure
another simple case of correlation is that with the increased or
decreased dimensions of the whole body or of any particular part
certain organs are increased or diminished in number or are otherwise
modified thus pigeon fanciers have gone on selecting pouters for
length of body and we have seen that their vertebrae are generally
increased not only in size but in number and their ribs in breadth
tumblers have been selected for their small bodies and their ribs and
primary wingfeathers are generally lessened in number fantails have
been selected for their large widelyexpanded tails with numerous
tailfeathers and the caudal vertebrae are increased in size and
number carriers have been selected for length of beak and their
tongues have become longer but not in strict accordance with the
length of beak in this latter breed and in others having large feet
the number of the scutellae on the toes is greater than in the breeds
with small feet many similar cases could be given in germany it has
been observed that the period of gestation is longer in large than in
small breeds of cattle with our highlyimproved breeds of all kinds
the periods of maturity and of reproduction have advanced with respect
to the age of the animal and in correspondence with this the teeth
are now developed earlier than formerly so that to the surprise of
agriculturists the ancient rules for judging of the age of an animal
by the state of its teeth are no longer trustworthy3
correlated variation of homologous partsparts which are homologous
tend to vary in the same manner and this is what might have been
expected for such parts are identical in form and structure during an
early period of embryonic development and are exposed in the egg or
womb to similar conditions the symmetry in most kinds of animals of
the corresponding or homologous organs on the right and left sides of
the body is the simplest case in point but this symmetry sometimes
fails as with rabbits having only one ear or stags with one horn or
with manyhorned sheep which sometimes carry an additional horn on one
side of their heads with flowers which have regular corollas all the
petals generally vary in the same manner as we see in the complicated
and symmetrical pattern on the flowers for instance of the chinese
pink but with irregular flowers though the petals are of course
homologous this symmetry often fails as with the varieties of the
antirrhinum or snapdragon or that variety of the kidneybean
phaseolus which has a white standardpetal
in the vertebrata the front and hind limbs are homologous and they
tend to vary in the same manner as we see in long and short legged or
in thick and thin legged races of the horse and dog isidore
geoffroy4 has remarked on the tendency of supernumerary digits in man
to appear not only on the right and left sides but on the upper and
lower extremities meckel has insisted5 that when the muscles of the
arm depart in number or arrangement from their proper type they almost
always imitate those of the leg and so conversely the varying muscles
of the leg imitate the normal muscles of the arm
in several distinct breeds of the pigeon and fowl the legs and the two
outer toes are heavily feathered so that in the trumpeter pigeon they
appear like little wings in the featherlegged bantam the boots or
feathers which grow from the outside of the leg and generally from the
two outer toes have according to the excellent authority of mr
hewitt6 been seen to exceed the wingfeathers in length and in one
case were actually nine and a half inches long as mr blyth has
remarked to me these legfeathers resemble the primary wingfeathers
and are totally unlike the fine down which naturally grows on the legs
of some birds such as grouse and owls hence it may be suspected that
excess of food has first given redundancy to the plumage and then that
the law of homologous variation has led to the development of feathers
on the legs in a position corresponding with those on the wing
namely on the outside of the tarsi and toes i am strengthened in this
belief by the following curious case of correlation which for a long
time seemed to me utterly inexplicable namely that in pigeons of any
breed if the legs are feathered the two outer toes are partially
connected by skin these two outer toes correspond with our third and
fourth toes7 now in the wing of the pigeon or of any other bird
the first and fifth digits are aborted the second is rudimentary and
carries the socalled bastardwing whilst the third and fourth
digits are completely united and enclosed by skin together forming the
extremity of the wing so that in featherfooted pigeons not only does
the exterior surface support a row of long feathers like
wingfeathers but the very same digits which in the wing are
completely united by skin become partially united by skin in the feet
and thus by the law of the correlated variation of homologous parts we
can understand the curious connection of feathered legs and membrane
between the two outer toes
andrew knight8 has remarked that the face or head and the limbs
usually vary together in general proportions compare for instance
the limbs of a dray and race horse or of a greyhound and mastiff what
a monster a greyhound would appear with the head of a mastiff the
modern bulldog however has fine limbs but this is a
recentlyselected character from the measurements given in the sixth
chapter we see that in several breeds of the pigeon the length of the
beak and the size of the feet are correlated the view which as before
explained seems the most probable is that disuse in all cases tends
to diminish the feet the beak becoming at the same time shorter
through correlation but that in some few breeds in which length of
beak has been a selected point the feet notwithstanding disuse have
increased in size through correlation in the following case some kind
of correlation is seen to exist between the feet and beak several
specimens have been sent to mr bartlett at different times as hybrids
between ducks and fowls and i have seen one these were as might be
expected ordinary ducks in a semimonstrous condition and in all of
them the swimmingweb between the toes was quite deficient or much
reduced and in all the beak was narrow and illshaped
with the increased length of the beak in pigeons not only the tongue
increases in length but likewise the orifice of the nostrils but the
increased length of the orifice of the nostrils perhaps stands in
closer correlation with the development of the corrugated skin or
wattle at the base of the beak for when there is much wattle round the
eyes the eyelids are greatly increased or even doubled in length
there is apparently some correlation even in colour between the head
and the extremities thus with horses a large white star or blaze on
the forehead is generally accompanied by white feet9 with white
rabbits and cattle dark marks often coexist on the tips of the ears
and on the feet in black and tan dogs of different breeds
tancoloured spots over the eyes and tancoloured feet almost
invariably go together these latter cases of connected colouring may
be due either to reversion or to analogous variationsubjects to which
i shall hereafter returnbut this does not necessarily determine the
question of their original correlation mr h w jackson informs me
that he has observed many hundred whitefooted cats and he finds that
all are more or less conspicuously marked with white on the front of
the neck or chest
the lopping forwards and downwards of the immense ears of fancy rabbits
seems partly due to the disuse of the muscles and partly to the weight
and length of the ears which have been increased by selection during
many generations now with the increased size and changed direction of
the ears not only has the bony auditory meatus become changed in
outline direction and greatly in size but the whole skull has been
slightly modified this could be clearly seen in halflopsthat is
in rabbits with only one ear lopping forward for the opposite sides of
their skulls were not strictly symmetrical this seems to me a curious
instance of correlation between hard bones and organs so soft and
flexible as well as so unimportant under a physiological point of
view as the external ears the result no doubt is largely due to mere
mechanical action that is to the weight of the ears on the same
principle that the skull of a human infant is easily modified by
pressure
the skin and the appendages of hair feathers hoofs horns and teeth
are homologous over the whole body every one knows that the colour of
the skin and that of the hair usually vary together so that virgil
advises the shepherd to look whether the mouth and tongue of the ram
are black lest the lambs should not be purely white the colour of the
skin and hair and the odour emitted by the glands of the skin are
said10 to be connected even in the same race of men generally the
hair varies in the same way all over the body in length fineness and
curliness the same rule holds good with feathers as we see with the
laced and frizzled breeds both of fowls and pigeons in the common cock
the feathers on the neck and loins are always of a particular shape
called hackles now in the polish breed both sexes are characterised
by a tuft of feathers on the head and through correlation these
feathers in the male always assume the form of hackles the wing and
tailfeathers though arising from parts not homologous vary in length
together so that long or short winged pigeons generally have long or
short tails the case of the jacobinpigeon is more curious for the
wing and tail feathers are remarkably long and this apparently has
arisen in correlation with the elongated and reversed feathers on the
back of the neck which form the hood
the hoofs and hair are homologous appendages and a careful observer
namely azara11 states that in paraguay horses of various colours are
often born with their hair curled and twisted like that on the head of
a negro this peculiarity is strongly inherited but what is remarkable
is that the hoofs of these horses are absolutely like those of a
mule the hair also of their manes and tails is invariably much
shorter than usual being only from four to twelve inches in length so
that curliness and shortness of the hair are here as with the negro
apparently correlated
with respect to the horns of sheep youatt12 remarks that
multiplicity of horns is not found in any breed of much value it is
generally accompanied by great length and coarseness of the fleece
several tropical breeds of sheep which are clothed with hair instead of
wool have horns almost like those of a goat sturm13 expressly
declares that in different races the more the wool is curled the more
the horns are spirally twisted we have seen in the third chapter
where other analogous facts have been given that the parent of the
mauchamp breed so famous for its fleece had peculiarly shaped horns
the inhabitants of angora assert14 that only the white goats which
have horns wear the fleece in the long curly locks that are so much
admired those which are not horned having a comparatively close coat
from these cases we may infer that the hair or wool and the horns tend
to vary in a correlated manner15 those who have tried hydropathy are
aware that the frequent application of cold water stimulates the skin
and whatever stimulates the skin tends to increase the growth of the
hair as is well shown in the abnormal growth of hair near old inflamed
surfaces now professor low16 is convinced that with the different
races of british cattle thick skin and long hair depend on the humidity
of the climate which they inhabit we can thus see how a humid climate
might act on the hornsin the first place directly on the skin and
hair and secondly by correlation on the horns the presence or absence
of horns moreover both in the case of sheep and cattle acts as will
presently be shown by some sort of correlation on the skull
with respect to hair and teeth mr yarrell17 found many of the teeth
deficient in three hairless egyptian dogs and in a hairless terrier
the incisors canines and the premolars suffered most but in one case
all the teeth except the large tubercular molar on each side were
deficient with man several striking cases have been recorded18 of
inherited baldness with inherited deficiency either complete or
partial of the teeth i may give an analogous case communicated to me
by mr w wedderburn of a hindoo family in scinde in which ten men
in the course of four generations were furnished in both jaws taken
together with only four small and weak incisor teeth and with eight
posterior molars the men thus affected have very little hair on the
body and become bald early in life they also suffer much during hot
weather from excessive dryness of the skin it is remarkable that no
instance has occurred of a daughter being thus affected and this fact
reminds us how much more liable men are in england to become bald than
women though the daughters in the above family are never affected
they transmit the tendency to their sons and no case has occurred of a
son transmitting it to his sons the affection thus appears only in
alternate generations or after longer intervals there is a similar
connection between hair and teeth according to mr sedgwick in those
rare cases in which the hair has been renewed in old age for this has
usually been accompanied by a renewal of the teeth i have remarked
in a former part of this volume that the great reduction in the size of
the tusks in domestic boars probably stands in close relation with
their diminished bristles due to a certain amount of protection and
that the reappearance of the tusks in boars which have become feral
and are fully exposed to the weather probably depends on the
reappearance of the bristles i may add though not strictly connected
with our present point that an agriculturist19 asserts that pigs
with little hair on their bodies are most liable to lose their tails
showing a weakness of the tegumental structure it may be prevented by
crossing with a more hairy breed
in the previous cases deficient hair and teeth deficient in number or
size are apparently connected in the following cases abnormally
redundant hair and teeth either deficient or redundant are likewise
connected mr crawfurd20 saw at the burmese court a man thirty
years old with his whole body except the hands and feet covered with
straight silky hair which on the shoulders and spine was five inches
in length at birth the ears alone were covered he did not arrive at
puberty or shed his milk teeth until twenty years old and at this
period he acquired five teeth in the upper jaw namely four incisors
and one canine and four incisor teeth in the lower jaw all the teeth
were small this man had a daughter who was born with hair within her
ears and the hair soon extended over her body when captain yule21
visited the court he found this girl grown up and she presented a
strange appearance with even her nose densely covered with soft hair
like her father she was furnished with incisor teeth alone the king
had with difficulty bribed a man to marry her and of her two children
one a boy fourteen months old had hair growing out of his ears with
a beard and moustache this strange peculiarity has therefore been
inherited for three generations with the molar teeth deficient in the
grandfather and mother whether these teeth would likewise fail in the
infant could not then be told
a parallel case of a man fiftyfive years old and of his son with
their faces covered with hair has recently occurred in russia dr
alex brandt has sent me an account of this case together with
specimens of the extremely fine hair from the cheeks the man is
deficient in teeth possessing only four incisors in the lower and two
in the upper jaw his son about three years old has no teeth except
four lower incisors the case as dr brandt remarks in his letter no
doubt is due to an arrest of development in the hair and teeth we here
see how independent of the ordinary conditions of existence such
arrests must be for the lives of a russian peasant and of a native of
burmah are as different as possible22
here is another and somewhat different case communicated to me by mr
wallace on the authority of dr purland a dentist julia pastrana a
spanish dancer was a remarkably fine woman but she had a thick
masculine beard and a hairy forehead she was photographed and her
stuffed skin was exhibited as a show but what concerns us is that she
had in both the upper and lower jaw an irregular double set of teeth
one row being placed within the other of which dr purland took a
cast from the redundancy of teeth her mouth projected and her face
had a gorillalike appearance these cases and those of the hairless
dogs forcibly call to mind the fact that the two orders of
mammalsnamely the edentata and cetaceawhich are the most abnormal in
their dermal covering are likewise the most abnormal either by
deficiency or redundancy of teeth
the organs of sight and hearing are generally admitted to be homologous
with one another and with various dermal appendages hence these parts
are liable to be abnormally affected in conjunction mr white cowper
says that in all cases of double microphthalmia brought under his
notice he has at the same time met with defective development of the
dental system certain forms of blindness seem to be associated with
the colour of the hair a man with black hair and a woman with
lightcoloured hair both of sound constitution married and had nine
children all of whom were born blind of these children five with
dark hair and brown iris were afflicted with amaurosis the four
others with lightcoloured hair and blue iris had amaurosis and
cataract conjoined several cases could be given showing that some
relation exists between various affections of the eyes and ears thus
liebreich states that out of 241 deafmutes in berlin no less than
fourteen suffered from the rare disease called pigmentary retinitis
mr white cowper and dr earle have remarked that inability to
distinguish different colours or colourblindness is often
associated with a corresponding inability to distinguish musical
sounds23
here is a more curious case white cats if they have blue eyes are
almost always deaf i formerly thought that the rule was invariable
but i have heard of a few authentic exceptions the first two notices
were published in 1829 and relate to english and persian cats of the
latter the rev w t bree possessed a female and he states that of
the offspring produced at one and the same birth such as like the
mother were entirely white with blue eyes were like her invariably
deaf while those that had the least speck of colour on their fur as
invariably possessed the usual faculty of hearing24 the rev w
darwin fox informs me that he has seen more than a dozen instances of
this correlation in english persian and danish cats but he adds
that if one eye as i have several times observed be not blue the
cat hears on the other hand i have never seen a white cat with eyes
of the common colour that was deaf in france dr sichel25 has
observed during twenty years similar facts he adds the remarkable case
of the iris beginning at the end of four months to grow
darkcoloured and then the cat first began to hear
this case of correlation in cats has struck many persons as marvellous
there is nothing unusual in the relation between blue eyes and white
fur and we have already seen that the organs of sight and hearing are
often simultaneously affected in the present instance the cause
probably lies in a slight arrest of development in the nervous system
in connection with the senseorgans kittens during the first nine
days whilst their eyes are closed appear to be completely deaf i
have made a great clanging noise with a poker and shovel close to their
heads both when they were asleep and awake without producing any
effect the trial must not be made by shouting close to their ears for
they are even when asleep extremely sensitive to a breath of air
now as long as the eyes continue closed the iris is no doubt blue
for in all the kittens which i have seen this colour remains for some
time after the eyelids open hence if we suppose the development of
the organs of sight and hearing to be arrested at the stage of the
closed eyelids the eyes would remain permanently blue and the ears
would be incapable of perceiving sound and we should thus understand
this curious case as however the colour of the fur is determined
long before birth and as the blueness of the eyes and the whiteness of
the fur are obviously connected we must believe that some primary
cause acts at a much earlier period
the instances of correlated variability hitherto given have been
chiefly drawn from the animal kingdom and we will now turn to plants
leaves sepals petals stamens and pistils are all homologous in
double flowers we see that the stamens and pistils vary in the same
manner and assume the form and colour of the petals in the double
columbine aquilegia vulgaris the successive whorls of stamens are
converted into cornucopias which are enclosed within one another and
resemble the true petals in hoseinhose flowers the sepals mock the
petals in some cases the flowers and leaves vary together in tint in
all the varieties of the common pea which have purple flowers a
purple mark may be seen on the stipules
m faivre states that with the varieties of  primula sinensis the
colour of the flower is evidently correlated with the colour of the
under side of the leaves and he adds that the varieties with
fimbriated flowers almost always have voluminous balloonlike
calyces26 with other plants the leaves and fruit or seeds vary
together in colour as in a curious paleleaved variety of the
sycamore which has recently been described in france27 and as in
the purpleleaved hazel in which the leaves the husk of the nut and
the pellicle round the kernel are all coloured purple28 pomologists
can predict to a certain extent from the size and appearance of the
leaves of their seedlings the probable nature of the fruit for as
van mons remarks29 variations in the leaves are generally accompanied
by some modification in the flower and consequently in the fruit in
the serpent melon which has a narrow tortuous fruit above a yard in
length the stem of the plant the peduncle of the female flower and
the middle lobe of the leaf are all elongated in a remarkable manner
on the other hand several varieties of cucurbita which have dwarfed
stems all produce as naudin remarks leaves of the same peculiar
shape mr g maw informs me that all the varieties of the scarlet
pelargoniums which have contracted or imperfect leaves have contracted
flowers the difference between brilliant and its parent tom thumb
is a good instance of this it may be suspected that the curious case
described by risso30 of a variety of the orange which produces on
the young shoots rounded leaves with winged petioles and afterwards
elongated leaves on long but wingless petioles is connected with the
remarkable change in form and nature which the fruit undergoes during
its development
in the following instance we have the colour and the form of the petals
apparently correlated and both dependent on the nature of the season
an observer skilled in the subject writes31 i noticed during the
year 1842 that every dahlia of which the colour had any tendency to
scarlet was deeply notchedindeed to so great an extent as to give
the petals the appearance of a saw the indentures were in some
instances more than a quarter of an inch deep again dahlias which
have their petals tipped with a different colour from the rest of the
flower are very inconstant and during certain years some or even all
the flowers become uniformly coloured and it has been observed with
several varieties32 that when this happens the petals grow much
elongated and lose their proper shape this however may be due to
reversion both in colour and form to the aboriginal species
in this discussion on correlation we have hitherto treated of cases in
which we can partly understand the bond of connection but i will now
give cases in which we cannot even conjecture or can only very
obscurely see the nature of the bond isidore geoffroy sainthilaire
in his work on monstrosities insists33 que certaines anomalies
coexistent rarement entrelles dautres frquemment dautres enfin
presque constamment malgr la diffrence trsgrande de leur nature
et quoiquelles puissent paratre compltement indpendantes les unes
des autres we see something analogous in certain diseases thus in a
rare affection of the renal capsules of which the functions are
unknown the skin becomes bronzed and in hereditary syphilis as i
hear from sir j paget both the milk and the second teeth assume a
peculiar and characteristic form professor rolleston also informs me
that the incisor teeth are sometimes furnished with a vascular rim in
correlation with intrapulmonary deposition of tubercles in other
cases of phthisis and of cyanosis the nails and fingerends become
clubbed like acorns i believe that no explanation has been offered of
these and of many other cases of correlated disease
what can be more curious and less intelligible than the fact previously
given on the authority of mr tegetmeier that young pigeons of all
breeds which when mature have white yellow silverblue or
duncoloured plumage come out of the egg almost naked whereas pigeons
of other colours when first born are clothed with plenty of down white
peafowls as has been observed both in england and france34 and as
i have myself seen are inferior in size to the common coloured kind
and this cannot be accounted for by the belief that albinism is always
accompanied by constitutional weakness for white or albino moles are
generally larger than the common kind
to turn to more important characters the niata cattle of the pampas
are remarkable from their short foreheads upturned muzzles and curved
lower jaws in the skull the nasal and premaxillary bones are much
shortened the maxillaries are excluded from any junction with the
nasals and all the bones are slightly modified even to the plane of
the occiput from the analogous case of the dog hereafter to be given
it is probable that the shortening of the nasal and adjoining bones is
the proximate cause of the other modifications in the skull including
the upward curvature of the lower jaw though we cannot follow out the
steps by which these changes have been effected
polish fowls have a large tuft of feathers on their heads and their
skulls are perforated by numerous holes so that a pin can be driven
into the brain without touching any bone that this deficiency of bone
is in some way connected with the tuft of feathers is clear from tufted
ducks and geese likewise having perforated skulls the case would
probably be considered by some authors as one of balancement or
compensation in the chapter on fowls i have shown that with polish
fowls the tuft of feathers was probably at first small by continued
selection it became larger and then rested on a fibrous mass and
finally as it became still larger the skull itself became more and
more protuberant until it acquired its present extraordinary structure
through correlation with the protuberance of the skull the shape and
even the relative connection of the premaxillary and nasal bones the
shape of the orifice of the nostrils the breadth of the frontal bone
the shape of the postlateral processes of the frontal and squamosal
bones and the direction of the bony cavity of the ear have all been
modified the internal configuration of the skull and the whole shape
of the brain have likewise been altered in a truly marvellous manner
after this case of the polish fowl it would be superfluous to do more
than refer to the details previously given on the manner in which the
changed form of the comb has affected the skull in various breeds of
the fowl causing by correlation crests protuberances and depressions
on its surface
with our cattle and sheep the horns stand in close connection with the
size of the skull and with the shape of the frontal bones thus
cline35 found that the skull of a horned ram weighed five times as
much as that of a hornless ram of the same age when cattle become
hornless the frontal bones are materially diminished in breadth
towards the poll and the cavities between the bony plates are not so
deep nor do they extend beyond the frontals36 it may be well here
to pause and observe how the effects of correlated variability of the
increased use of parts and of the accumulation of socalled
spontaneous variations through natural selection are in many cases
inextricably commingled we may borrow an illustration from mr herbert
spencer who remarks that when the irish elk acquired its gigantic
horns weighing above one hundred pounds numerous coordinated changes
of structure would have been indispensablenamely a thickened skull
to carry the horns strengthened cervical vertebrae with strengthened
ligaments enlarged dorsal vertebrae to support the neck with powerful
forelegs and feet all these parts being supplied with proper muscles
bloodvessels and nerves how then could these admirably coordinated
modifications of structure have been acquired according to the
doctrine which i maintain the horns of the male elk were slowly gained
through sexual selectionthat is by the bestarmed males conquering
the worsearmed and leaving a greater number of descendants but it is
not at all necessary that the several parts of the body should have
simultaneously varied each stag presents individual characteristics
and in the same district those which had slightly heavier horns or
stronger necks or stronger bodies or were the most courageous would
secure the greater number of does and consequently have a greater
number of offspring the offspring would inherit in a greater or less
degree these same qualities would occasionally intercross with one
another or with other individuals varying in some favourable manner
and of their offspring those which were the best endowed in any
respect would continue multiplying and so onwards always progressing
sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another towards the
excellently coordinated structure of the male elk to make this clear
let us reflect on the probable steps as shown in the twentieth
chapter by which our race and dray horses have arrived at their
present state of excellence if we could view the whole series of
intermediate forms between one of these animals and an early unimproved
progenitor we should behold a vast number of animals not equally
improved in each generation throughout their entire structure but
sometimes a little more in one point and sometimes in another yet on
the whole gradually approaching in character to our present race or
dray horses which are so admirably fitted in the one case for
fleetness and in the other for draught
although natural selection would thus37 tend to give to the male elk
its present structure yet it is probable that the inherited effects of
use and of the mutual action of part on part have been equally or
more important as the horns gradually increased in weight the muscles
of the neck with the bones to which they are attached would increase
in size and strength and these parts would react on the body and legs
nor must we overlook the fact that certain parts of the skull and the
extremities would judging by analogy tend from the first to vary in a
correlated manner the increased weight of the horns would also act
directly on the skull in the same manner as when one bone is removed
in the leg of a dog the other bone which has to carry the whole
weight of the body increases in thickness but from the fact given
with respect to horned and hornless cattle it is probable that the
horns and skull would immediately act on each other through the
principle of correlation lastly the growth and subsequent wear and
tear of the augmented muscles and bones would require an increased
supply of blood and consequently increased supply of food and this
again would require increased powers of mastication digestion
respiration and excretion
      colour as correlated with constitutional peculiarities
it is an old belief that with man there is a connection between
complexions and constitution and i find that some of the best
authorities believe in this to the present day38 thus dr beddoe by
his tables shows39 that a relation exists between liability to
consumption and the colour of the hair eyes and skin it has been
affirmed40 that in the french army which invaded russia soldiers
having a dark complexion from the southern parts of europe withstood
the intense cold better than those with lighter complexions from the
north but no doubt such statements are liable to error
in the second chapter on selection i have given several cases proving
that with animals and plants differences in colour are correlated with
constitutional differences as shown by greater or less immunity from
certain diseases from the attacks of parasitic plants and animals
from scorching by the sun and from the action of certain poisons when
all the individuals of any one variety possess an immunity of this
nature we do not know that it stands in any sort of correlation with
their colour but when several similarly coloured varieties of the same
species are thus characterised whilst other coloured varieties are not
thus favoured we must believe in the existence of a correlation of
this kind thus in the united states purplefruited plums of many
kinds are far more affected by a certain disease than green or
yellowfruited varieties on the other hand yellowfleshed peaches of
various kinds suffer from another disease much more than the
whitefleshed varieties in the mauritius red sugarcanes are much less
affected by a particular disease than the white canes white onions and
verbenas are the most liable to mildew and in spain the greenfruited
grapes suffered from the vinedisease more than other coloured
varieties darkcoloured pelargoniums and verbenas are more scorched by
the sun than varieties of other colours red wheats are believed to be
hardier than white and redflowered hyacinths were more injured during
one particular winter in holland than other coloured varieties with
animals white terriers suffer most from the distemper white chickens
from a parasitic worm in their tracheae white pigs from scorching by
the sun and white cattle from flies but the caterpillars of the
silkmoth which yield white cocoons suffered in france less from the
deadly parasitic fungus than those producing yellow silk
the cases of immunity from the action of certain vegetable poisons in
connexion with colour are more interesting and are at present wholly
inexplicable i have already given a remarkable instance on the
authority of professor wyman of all the hogs excepting those of a
black colour suffering severely in virginia from eating the root of
the lachnanthes tinctoria according to spinola and others41
buckwheat po1ygonum fagopyrum when in flower is highly injurious
to white or whitespotted pigs if they are exposed to the heat of the
sun but is quite innocuous to black pigs according to two accounts
the hypericum crispum in sicily is poisonous to white sheep alone
their heads swell their wool falls off and they often die but this
plant according to lecce is poisonous only when it grows in swamps
nor is this improbable as we know how readily the poisonous principle
in plants is influenced by the conditions under which they grow
three accounts have been published in eastern prussia of white and
whitespotted horses being greatly injured by eating mildewed and
honeydewed vetches every spot of skin bearing white hairs becoming
inflamed and gangrenous the rev j rodwell informs me that his father
turned out about fifteen carthorses into a field of tares which in
parts swarmed with black aphides and which no doubt were honeydewed
and probably mildewed the horses with two exceptions were chestnuts
and bays with white marks on their faces and pasterns and the white
parts alone swelled and became angry scabs the two bay horses with no
white marks entirely escaped all injury in guernsey when horses eat
fools parsley thusa cynapium they are sometimes violently purged
and this plant has a peculiar effect on the nose and lips causing
deep cracks and ulcers particularly on horses with white muzzles42
with cattle independently of the action of any poison cases have been
published by youatt and erdt of cutaneous diseases with much
constitutional disturbance in one instance after exposure to a hot
sun affecting every single point which bore a white hair but
completely passing over other parts of the body similar cases have
been observed with horses43
we thus see that not only do those parts of the skin which bear white
hair differ in a remarkable manner from those bearing hair of any other
colour but that some great constitutional difference must be
correlated with the colour of the hair for in the abovementioned
cases vegetable poisons caused fever swelling of the head as well as
other symptoms and even death to all the white or whitespotted
animals

homologous partscompensation of growthmechanical pressurerelative
position of flowers with respect to the axis and of seeds in the
ovary as inducing variationanalogous or parallel varietiessummary of
the three last chapters
the fusion of homologous partsgeoffroy sainthilaire formerly
propounded what he called la loi de laffinit de soi pour soi which
has been discussed and illustrated by his son isidore with respect to
monsters in the animal kingdom1 and by moquintandon with respect
to monstrous plants this law seems to imply that homologous parts
actually attract one another and then unite no doubt there are many
wonderful cases in which such parts become intimately fused together
this is perhaps best seen in monsters with two heads which are united
summit to summit or face to face or januslike back to back or
obliquely side to side in one instance of two heads united almost face
to face but a little obliquely four ears were developed and on one
side a perfect face which was manifestly formed by the fusion of two
halffaces whenever two bodies or two heads are united each bone
muscle vessel and nerve on the line of junction appears as if it had
sought out its fellow and had become completely fused with it
lereboullet2 who carefully studied the development of double
monsters in fishes observed in fifteen instances the steps by which
two heads gradually became united into one in all such cases it is now
thought by the greater number of capable judges that the homologous
parts do not attract each other but that in the words of mr lowne3
as union takes place before the differentiation of distinct organs
occurs these are formed in continuity with each other he adds that
organs already differentiated probably in no case become united to
homologous ones m dareste does not speak4 quite decisively against
the law of soi pour soi but concludes by saying on se rend
parfaitement compte de la formation des monstres si lon admet que les
embryons qui se soudent appartiennent  un mme uf quils sunissent
en mme temps quils se forment et que la soudure ne se produit que
pendant la premire priode de la vie embryonnaire celle ou les
organes ne sont encore constitus que par des blastmes homognes
by whatever means the abnormal fusion of homologous parts is effected
such cases throw light on the frequent presence of organs which are
double during an embryonic period and throughout life in other and
lower members of the same class but which afterwards unite by a normal
process into a single medial organ in the vegetable kingdom
moquintandon5 gives a long list of cases showing how frequently
homologous parts such as leaves petals stamens and pistils
flowers and aggregates of homologous parts such as buds as well as
fruit become blended both normally and abnormally with perfect
symmetry into one another
the variability of multiple and homologous partsisidore geoffroy6
insists that when any part or organ is repeated many times in the same
animal it is particularly liable to vary both in number and structure
with respect to number the proposition may i think be considered as
fully established but the evidence is chiefly derived from organic
beings living under their natural conditions with which we are not
here concerned whenever such parts as the vertebrae or teeth the rays
in the fins of fishes or the feathers in the tails of birds or
petals stamens pistils or seeds are very numerous the number is
generally variable with respect to the structure of multiple parts
the evidence of variability is not so decisive but the fact as far as
it may be trusted probably depends on multiple parts being of less
physiological importance than single parts consequently their
structure has been less rigorously guarded by natural selection
compensation of growth or balancementthis law as applied to
natural species was propounded by goethe and geoffroy sainthilaire at
nearly the same time it implies that when much organised matter is
used in building up some one part other parts are starved and become
reduced several authors especially botanists believe in this law
others reject it as far as i can judge it occasionally holds good
but its importance has probably been exaggerated it is scarcely
possible to distinguish between the supposed effects of such
compensation and the effects of longcontinued selection which may
lead to the augmentation of one part and simultaneously to the
diminution of another anyhow there can be no doubt that an organ may
be greatly increased without any corresponding diminution of an
adjoining part to recur to our former illustration of the irish elk
it may be asked what part has suffered in consequence of the immense
development of the horns
it has already been observed that the struggle for existence does not
bear hard on our domesticated productions and consequently the
principle of economy of growth will seldom come into play so that we
ought not to expect to find with them frequent evidence of
compensation we have however some such cases moquintandon
describes a monstrous bean7 in which the stipules were enormously
developed and the leaflets apparently in consequence completely
aborted this case is interesting as it represents the natural
condition of lathyrus aphaca with its stipules of great size and
its leaves reduced to mere threads which act as tendrils de
candolle8 has remarked that the varieties of raphanus sativus which
have small roots yield numerous seed containing much oil whilst those
with large roots are not productive in oil and so it is with brassica
asperifolia the varieties of cucurbita pepo which bear large fruit
yield a small crop according to naudin whilst those producing small
fruit yield a vast number lastly i have endeavoured to show in the
eighteenth chapter that with many cultivated plants unnatural treatment
checks the full and proper action of the reproductive organs and they
are thus rendered more or less sterile consequently in the way of
compensation the fruit becomes greatly enlarged and in double
flowers the petals are greatly increased in number
with animals it has been found difficult to produce cows which yield
much milk and are afterwards capable of fattening well with fowls
which have large topknots and beards the comb and wattles are
generally much reduced in size though there are exceptions to this
rule perhaps the entire absence of the oilgland in fantail pigeons
may be connected with the great development of their tails
mechanical pressure as a cause of modificationsin some few cases
there is reason to believe that mere mechanical pressure has affected
certain structures vrolik and weber9 maintain that the shape of the
human head is influenced by the shape of the mothers pelvis the
kidneys in different birds differ much in form and st ange10
believes that this is determined by the form of the pelvis which
again no doubt stands in close relation with their power of
locomotion in snakes the viscera are curiously displaced in
comparison with their position in other vertebrates and this has been
attributed by some authors to the elongation of their bodies but here
as in so many previous cases it is impossible to disentangle a direct
result of this kind from that consequent on natural selection godron
has argued11 that the abortion of the spur on the inner side of the
flowers in corydalis is caused by the buds at a very early period of
growth whilst underground being closely pressed against one another and
against the stem some botanists believe that the singular difference
in the shape both of the seed and corolla in the interior and exterior
florets in certain compositous and umbelliferous plants is due to the
pressure to which the inner florets are subjected but this conclusion
is doubtful
the facts just given do not relate to domesticated productions and
therefore do not strictly concern us but here is a more appropriate
case h mller12 has shown that in shortfaced races of the dog some
of the molar teeth are placed in a slightly different position to that
which they occupy in other dogs especially in those having elongated
muzzles and as he remarks any inherited change in the arrangement of
the teeth deserves notice considering their classificatory importance
this difference in position is due to the shortening of certain facial
bones and the consequent want of space and the shortening results from
a peculiar and abnormal state of the embryonal cartilages of the bones
      relative position of flowers with respect to the axis and of
      seeds in the ovary as inducing variation
in the thirteenth chapter various peloric flowers were described and
their production was shown to be due either to arrested development or
to reversion to a primordial condition moquintandon has remarked that
the flowers which stand on the summit of the main stem or of a lateral
branch are more liable to become peloric than those on the sides13
and he adduces amongst other instances that of teucrium
campanulatum in another labiate plant grown by me viz the
galeobdolon luteum the peloric flowers were always produced on the
summit of the stem where flowers are not usually borne in
pelargonium a single flower in the truss is frequently peloric and
when this occurs i have during several years invariably observed it to
be the central flower this is of such frequent occurrence that one
observer14 gives the names of ten varieties flowering at the same
time in every one of which the central flower was peloric
occasionally more than one flower in the truss is peloric and then of
course the additional ones must be lateral these flowers are
interesting as showing how the whole structure is correlated in the
common pelargonium the upper sepal is produced into a nectary which
coheres with the flowerpeduncle the two upper petals differ a little
in shape from the three lower ones and are marked with dark shades of
colour the stamens are graduated in length and upturned in the
peloric flowers the nectary aborts all the petals become alike both
in shape and colour the stamens are generally reduced in number and
become straight so that the whole flower resembles that of the allied
genus erodium the correlation between these changes is well shown when
one of the two upper petals alone loses its dark mark for in this case
the nectary does not entirely abort but is usually much reduced in
length15
morren has described16 a marvellous flaskshaped flower of the
calceolaria nearly four inches in length which was almost completely
peloric it grew on the summit of the plant with a normal flower on
each side prof westwood also has described17 three similar peloric
flowers which all occupied a central position on the flowerbranches
in the orchideous genus phalnopsis the terminal flower has been seen
to become peloric
in a laburnumtree i observed that about a fourth part of the racemes
produced terminal flowers which had lost their papilionaceous
structure these were produced after almost all the other flowers on
the same racemes had withered the most perfectly pelorised examples
had six petals each marked with black striae like those on the
standardpetal the keel seemed to resist the change more than the
other petals dutrochet has described18 an exactly similar case in
france and i believe these are the only two instances of pelorism in
the laburnum which have been recorded dutrochet remarks that the
racemes on this tree do not properly produce a terminal flower so that
as in the case of the galeobdolon their position as well as structure
are both anomalies which no doubt are in some manner related dr
masters has briefly described another leguminous plant19 namely a
species of clover in which the uppermost and central flowers were
regular or had lost their papilionaceous structure in some of these
plants the flowerheads were also proliferous
lastly linaria produces two kinds of peloric flowers one having
simple petals and the other having them all spurred the two forms as
naudin remarks20 not rarely occur on the same plant but in this
case the spurred form almost invariably stands on the summit of the
spike
the tendency in the terminal or central flower to become peloric more
frequently than the other flowers probably results from the bud which
stands on the end of a shoot receiving the most sap it grows out into
a stronger shoot than those situated lower down21 i have discussed
the connection between pelorism and a central position partly because
some few plants are known normally to produce a terminal flower
different in structure from the lateral ones but chiefly on account of
the following case in which we see a tendency to variability or to
reversion connected with the same position a great judge of
auriculas22 states that when one throws up a side bloom it is pretty
sure to keep its character but that if it grows from the centre or
heart of the plant whatever the colour of the edging ought to be it
is just as likely to come in any other class as in the one to which it
properly belongs this is so notorious a fact that some florists
regularly pinch off the central trusses of flowers whether in the
highly improved varieties the departure of the central trusses from
their proper type is due to reversion i do not know mr dombrain
insists that whatever may be the commonest kind of imperfection in
each variety this is generally exaggerated in the central truss thus
one variety sometimes has the fault of producing a little green floret
in the centre of the flower and in central blooms these become
excessive in size in some central blooms sent to me by mr dombrain
all the organs of the flower were rudimentary in structure of minute
size and of a green colour so that by a little further change all
would have been converted into small leaves in this case we clearly
see a tendency to prolificationa term which i may explain for those
who have never attended to botany to mean the production of a branch
or flower or head of flowers out of another flower now dr
masters23 states that the central or uppermost flower on a plant is
generally the most liable to prolification thus in the varieties of
the auricula the loss of their proper character and a tendency to
prolification also a tendency to prolification with pelorism are all
connected together and are due either to arrested development or to
reversion to a former condition
the following is a more interesting case metzger24 cultivated in
germany several kinds of maize brought from the hotter parts of
america and he found as previously described that in two or three
generations the grains became greatly changed in form size and
colour and with respect to two races he expressly states that in the
first generation whilst the lower grains on each head retained their
proper character the uppermost grains already began to assume that
character which in the third generation all the grains acquired as we
do not know the aboriginal parent of the maize we cannot tell whether
these changes are in any way connected with reversion
in the two following cases reversion comes into play and is determined
by the position of the seed in the capsule the blue imperial pea is
the offspring of the blue prussian and has larger seed and broader
pods than its parent now mr masters of canterbury a careful
observer and a raiser of new varieties of the pea states25 that the
blue imperial always has a strong tendency to revert to its
parentstock and the reversion occurs in this manner the last or
uppermost pea in the pod is frequently much smaller than the rest and
if these small peas are carefully collected and sown separately very
many more in proportion will revert to their origin than those taken
from the other parts of the pod again m chat26 says that in
raising seedling stocks he succeeds in getting eighty per cent to bear
double flowers by leaving only a few of the secondary branches to
seed but in addition to this at the time of extracting the seeds
the upper portion of the pod is separated and placed aside because it
has been ascertained that the plants coming from the seeds situated in
this portion of the pod give eighty per cent of single flowers now
the production of singleflowering plants from the seed of
doubleflowering plants is clearly a case of reversion these latter
facts as well as the connection between a central position and
pelorism and prolification show in an interesting manner how small a
differencenamely a little greater or less freedom in the flow of sap
towards one part of the plantdetermines important changes of
structure
analogous or parallel variationby this term i mean that similar
characters occasionally make their appearance in the several varieties
or races descended from the same species and more rarely in the
offspring of widely distinct species we are here concerned not as
hitherto with the causes of variation but with the results but this
discussion could not have been more conveniently introduced elsewhere
the cases of analogous variation as far as their origin is concerned
may be grouped disregarding minor subdivisions under two main heads
firstly those due to unknown causes acting on similarly constituted
organisms and which consequently have varied in a similar manner and
secondly those due to the reappearance of characters which were
possessed by a more or less remote progenitor but these two main
divisions can often be separated only conjecturally and graduate as
we shall presently see into each other
under the first head of analogous variations not due to reversion we
have the many cases of trees belonging to quite different orders which
have produced pendulous and fastigiate varieties the beech hazel and
barberry have given rise to purpleleaved varieties and as bernhardi
remarks27 a multitude of plants as distinct as possible have
yielded varieties with deeplycut or laciniated leaves varieties
descended from three distinct species of brassica have their stems or
socalled roots enlarged into globular masses the nectarine is the
offspring of the peach and the varieties of peaches and nectarines
offer a remarkable parallelism in the fruit being white red or yellow
fleshedin being clingstones or freestonesin the flowers being large
or smallin the leaves being serrated or crenated furnished with
globose or reniform glands or quite destitute of glands it should be
remarked that each variety of the nectarine has not derived its
character from a corresponding variety of the peach the several
varieties also of a closely allied genus namely the apricot differ
from one another in nearly the same parallel manner there is no reason
to believe that any of these varieties have merely reacquired longlost
characters and in most of them this certainly is not the case
three species of cucurbita have yielded a multitude of races which
correspond so closely in character that as naudin insists they may be
arranged in almost strictly parallel series several varieties of the
melon are interesting from resembling in important characters other
species either of the same genus or of allied genera thus one
variety has fruit so like both externally and internally the fruit of
a perfectly distinct species namely the cucumber as hardly to be
distinguished from it another has long cylindrical fruit twisting
about like a serpent in another the seeds adhere to portions of the
pulp in another the fruit when ripe suddenly cracks and falls into
pieces and all these highly remarkable peculiarities are
characteristic of species belonging to allied genera we can hardly
account for the appearance of so many unusual characters by reversion
to a single ancient form but we must believe that all the members of
the family have inherited a nearly similar constitution from an early
progenitor our cereal and many other plants offer similar cases
with animals we have fewer cases of analogous variation independently
of direct reversion we see something of the kind in the resemblance
between the shortmuzzled races of the dog such as the pug and
bulldog in featherfooted races of the fowl pigeon and canarybird
in horses of the most different races presenting the same range of
colour in all blackandtan dogs having tancoloured eyespots and
feet but in this latter case reversion may possibly have played a
part low has remarked28 that several breeds of cattle are
sheetedthat is have a broad band of white passing round their
bodies like a sheet this character is strongly inherited and
sometimes originates from a cross it may be the first step in
reversion to an early type for as was shown in the third chapter
white cattle with dark ears dark feet and tip of tail formerly
existed and now exist in feral or semiferal condition in several
quarters of the world
under our second main division namely of analogous variations due to
reversion the best cases are afforded by pigeons in all the most
distinct breeds subvarieties occasionally appear coloured exactly
like the parent rockpigeon with black wingbars white loins banded
tail etc and no one can doubt that these characters are due to
reversion so with minor details turbits properly have white tails
but occasionally a bird is born with a darkcoloured and banded tail
pouters properly have their primary wingfeathers white but not rarely
a swordflighted bird appears that is one with the few first
primaries darkcoloured and in these cases we have characters proper
to the rockpigeon but new to the breed evidently appearing from
reversion in some domestic varieties the wingbars instead of being
simply black as in the rockpigeon are beautifully edged with
different zones of colour and they then present a striking analogy
with the wingbars in certain natural species of the same family such
as phaps chalcoptera and this may probably be accounted for by all
the species of the family being descended from the same remote
progenitor and having a tendency to vary in the same manner thus
also we can perhaps understand the fact of some laugherpigeons cooing
almost like turtledoves and for several races having peculiarities in
their flight since certain natural species viz c torquatrix and
palumbus display singular vagaries in this respect in other cases
a race instead of imitating a distinct species resembles some other
race thus certain runts tremble and slightly elevate their tails
like fantails and turbits inflate the upper part of their oesophagus
like pouterpigeons
it is a common circumstance to find certain coloured marks persistently
characterising all the species of a genus but differing much in tint
and the same thing occurs with the varieties of the pigeon thus
instead of the general plumage being blue with the wingbars black
there are snowwhite varieties with red bars and black varieties with
white bars in other varieties the wingbars as we have seen are
elegantly zoned with different tints the spot pigeon is characterised
by the whole plumage being white excepting a spot on the forehead and
the tail but these parts may be red yellow or black in the
rockpigeon and in many varieties the tail is blue with the outer
edges of the outer feathers white but in the subvariety of the
monkpigeon we have a reversed style of coloration for the tail is
white except the outer edges of the outer feathers which are
black29
with some species of birds for instance with gulls certain coloured
parts appear as if almost washed out and i have observed exactly the
same appearance in the terminal dark tailbar in certain pigeons and
in the whole plumage of certain varieties of the duck analogous facts
in the vegetable kingdom could be given
many subvarieties of the pigeon have reversed and somewhat lengthened
feathers on the back part of their heads and this is certainly not due
to reversion to the parentspecies which shows no trace of such
structure but when we remember that subvarieties of the fowl turkey
canarybird duck and goose all have either topknots or reversed
feathers on their heads and when we remember that scarcely a single
large natural group of birds can be named in which some members have
not a tuft of feathers on their heads we may suspect that reversion to
some extremely remote form has come into action
several breeds of the fowl have either spangled or pencilled feathers
and these cannot be derived from the parentspecies the gallus
bankiva though of course it is possible that one early progenitor of
this species may have been spangled and another pencilled but as
many gallinaceous birds are either spangled or pencilled it is a more
probable view that the several domestic breeds of the fowl have
acquired this kind of plumage from all the members of the family
inheriting a tendency to vary in a like manner the same principle may
account for the ewes in certain breeds of sheep being hornless like
the females of some other hollowhorned ruminants it may account for
certain domestic cats having slightlytufted ears like those of the
lynx and for the skulls of domestic rabbits often differing from one
another in the same characters by which the skulls of the various
species of the genus lepus differ
i will only allude to one other case already discussed now that we
know that the wild parent of the ass commonly has striped legs we may
feel confident that the occasional appearance of stripes on the legs of
the domestic ass is due to reversion but this will not account for the
lower end of the shoulderstripe being sometimes angularly bent or
slightly forked so again when we see dun and other coloured horses
with stripes on the spine shoulders and legs we are led from
reasons formerly given to believe that they reappear through reversion
to the wild parenthorse but when horses have two or three
shoulderstripes with one of them occasionally forked at the lower
end or when they have stripes on their faces or are faintly striped
as foals over nearly their whole bodies with the stripes angularly
bent one under the other on the forehead or irregularly branched in
other parts it would be rash to attribute such diversified characters
to the reappearance of those proper to the aboriginal wild horse as
three african species of the genus are much striped and as we have
seen that the crossing of the unstriped species often leads to the
hybrid offspring being conspicuously stripedbearing also in mind that
the act of crossing certainly causes the reappearance of longlost
charactersit is a more probable view that the abovespecified stripes
are due to reversion not to the immediate wild parenthorse but to
the striped progenitor of the whole genus
i have discussed this subject of analogous variation at considerable
length because it is well known that the varieties of one species
frequently resemble distinct speciesa fact in perfect harmony with the
foregoing cases and explicable on the theory of descent secondly
because these facts are important from showing as remarked in a former
chapter that each trifling variation is governed by law and is
determined in a much higher degree by the nature of the organisation
than by the nature of the conditions to which the varying being has
been exposed thirdly because these facts are to a certain extent
related to a more general law namely that which mr b d walsh30
has called the law of equable variability or as he explains it
if any given character is very variable in one species of a group it
will tend to be variable in allied species and if any given character
is perfectly constant in one species of a group it will tend to be
constant in allied species
this leads me to recall a discussion in the chapter on selection in
which it was shown that with domestic races which are now undergoing
rapid improvement those parts or characters vary the most which are
the most valued this naturally follows from recently selected
characters continually tending to revert to their former less improved
standard and from their being still acted on by the same agencies
whatever these may be which first caused the characters in question to
vary the same principle is applicable to natural species for as
stated in my origin of species generic characters are less variable
than specific characters and the latter are those which have been
modified by variation and natural selection since the period when all
the species belonging to the genus branched off from a common
progenitor whilst generic characters are those which have remained
unaltered from a much more remote epoch and accordingly are now less
variable this statement makes a near approach to mr walshs law of
equable variability secondary sexual characters it may be added
rarely serve to characterise distinct genera for they usually differ
much in the species of the same genus and they are highly variable in
the individuals of the same species we have also seen in the earlier
chapters of this work how variable secondary sexual characters become
under domestication
      summary of the three previous chapters on the laws of
      variation
in the twentythird chapter we saw that changed conditions
occasionally or even often act in a definite manner on the
organisation so that all or nearly all the individuals thus exposed
become modified in the same manner but a far more frequent result of
changed conditions whether acting directly on the organisation or
indirectly through the reproductive system is indefinite and
fluctuating variability in the three last chapters some of the laws
by which such variability is regulated have been discussed
increased use adds to the size of muscles together with the
bloodvessels nerves ligaments the crests of bone and the whole
bones to which they are attached increased functional activity
increases the size of various glands and strengthens the senseorgans
increased and intermittent pressure thickens the epidermis a change in
the nature of the food sometimes modifies the coats of the stomach and
augments or decreases the length of the intestines continued disuse
on the other hand weakens and diminishes all parts of the
organisation animals which during many generations have taken but
little exercise have their lungs reduced in size and as a consequence
the bony fabric of the chest and the whole form of the body become
modified with our anciently domesticated birds the wings have been
little used and they are slightly reduced with their decrease the
crest of the sternum the scapulae coracoids and furculum have all
been reduced
with domesticated animals the reduction of a part from disuse is never
carried so far that a mere rudiment is left whereas we have reason to
believe that this has often occurred under nature the effects of
disuse in this latter case being aided by economy of growth together
with the intercrossing of many varying individuals the cause of this
difference between organisms in a state of nature and under
domestication probably is that in the latter case there has not been
time sufficient for any very great change and that the principle of
economy of growth does not come into action on the contrary
structures which are rudimentary in the parentspecies sometimes
become partially redeveloped in our domesticated productions such
rudiments as occasionally make their appearance under domestication
seem always to be the result of a sudden arrest of development
nevertheless they are of interest as showing that rudiments are the
relics of organs once perfectly developed
corporeal periodical and mental habits though the latter have been
almost passed over in this work become changed under domestication
and the changes are often inherited such changed habits in an organic
being especially when living a free life would often lead to the
augmented or diminished use of various organs and consequently to
their modification from longcontinued habit and more especially from
the occasional birth of individuals with a slightly different
constitution domestic animals and cultivated plants become to a
certain extent acclimatised or adapted to a climate different from that
proper to the parentspecies
through the principle of correlated variability taken in its widest
sense when one part varies other parts vary either simultaneously or
one after the other thus an organ modified during an early embryonic
period affects other parts subsequently developed when an organ such
as the beak increases or decreases in length adjoining or correlated
parts as the tongue and the orifice of the nostrils tend to vary in
the same manner when the whole body increases or decreases in size
various parts become modified thus with pigeons the ribs increase or
decrease in number and breadth homologous parts which are identical
during their early development and are exposed to similar conditions
tend to vary in the same or in some connected manneras in the case of
the right and left sides of the body and of the front and hind limbs
so it is with the organs of sight and hearing for instance white cats
with blue eyes are almost always deaf there is a manifest relation
throughout the body between the skin and various dermal appendages
such as hair feathers hoofs horns and teeth in paraguay horses
with curly hair have hoofs like those of a mule the wool and the horns
of sheep often vary together hairless dogs are deficient in their
teeth men with redundant hair have abnormal teeth either by
deficiency or excess birds with long wingfeathers usually have long
tailfeathers when long feathers grow from the outside of the legs and
toes of pigeons the two outer toes are connected by membrane for the
whole leg tends to assume the structure of the wing there is a
manifest relation between a crest of feathers on the head and a
marvellous amount of change in the skull of various fowls and in a
lesser degree between the greatly elongated lopping ears of rabbits
and the structure of their skulls with plants the leaves various
parts of the flower and the fruit often vary together to a correlated
manner
in some cases we find correlation without being able even to conjecture
what is the nature of the connection as with various monstrosities and
diseases this is likewise the case with the colour of the adult
pigeon in connection with the presence of down on the young bird
numerous curious instances have been given of peculiarities of
constitution in correlation with colour as shown by the immunity of
individuals of one colour from certain diseases from the attacks of
parasites and from the action of certain vegetable poisons
correlation is an important subject for with species and in a lesser
degree with domestic races we continually find that certain parts have
been greatly modified to serve some useful purpose but we almost
invariably find that other parts have likewise been more or less
modified without our being able to discover any advantage in the
change no doubt great caution is necessary with respect to this latter
point for it is difficult to overrate our ignorance on the use of
various parts of the organisation but from what we have seen we may
believe that many modifications are of no direct service having arisen
in correlation with other and useful changes
homologous parts during their early development often become fused
together multiple and homologous organs are especially liable to vary
in number and probably in form as the supply of organised matter is
not unlimited the principle of compensation sometimes comes into
action so that when one part is greatly developed adjoining parts
are apt to be reduced but this principle is probably of much less
importance than the more general one of the economy of growth through
mere mechanical pressure hard parts occasionally affect adjoining
parts with plants the position of the flowers on the axis and of the
seeds in the ovary sometimes leads through a more or less free flow
of sap to changes of structure but such changes are often due to
reversion modifications in whatever manner caused will be to a
certain extent regulated by that coordinating power or socalled
nisus formativus which is in fact a remnant of that simple form of
reproduction displayed by many lowly organised beings in their power
of fissiparous generation and budding finally the effects of the laws
which directly or indirectly govern variability may be largely
regulated by mans selection and will so far be determined by natural
selection that changes advantageous to any race will be favoured and
disadvantageous changes will be checked
domestic races descended from the same species or from two or more
allied species are liable to revert to characters derived from their
common progenitor and as they inherit a somewhat similar
constitution they are liable to vary in the same manner from these
two causes analogous varieties often arise when we reflect on the
several foregoing laws imperfectly as we understand them and when we
bear in mind how much remains to be discovered we need not be
surprised at the intricate and to us unintelligible manner in which our
domestic productions have varied and still go on varying

chapter xxvii provisional hypothesis of pangenesis

single point of view namely the various kinds of

independence of the units of the
bodyvariabilityinheritancereversionsecond part statement of the
hypothesishow far the necessary assumptions are improbableexplanation
by aid of the hypothesis of the several classes of facts specified in
the first partconclusion
in the previous chapters large classes of facts such as those bearing
on budvariation the various forms of inheritance the causes and laws
of variation have been discussed and it is obvious that these
subjects as well as the several modes of reproduction stand in some
sort of relation to one another i have been led or rather forced to
form a view which to a certain extent connects these facts by a
tangible method every one would wish to explain to himself even in an
imperfect manner how it is possible for a character possessed by some
remote ancestor suddenly to reappear in the offspring how the effects
of increased or decreased use of a limb can be transmitted to the
child how the male sexual element can act not solely on the ovules
but occasionally on the motherform how a hybrid can be produced by
the union of the cellular tissue of two plants independently of the
organs of generation how a limb can be reproduced on the exact line of
amputation with neither too much nor too little added how the same
organism may be produced by such widely different processes as budding
and true seminal generation and lastly how of two allied forms one
passes in the course of its development through the most complex
metamorphoses and the other does not do so though when mature both
are alike in every detail of structure i am aware that my view is
merely a provisional hypothesis or speculation but until a better one
be advanced it will serve to bring together a multitude of facts which
are at present left disconnected by any efficient cause as whewell
the historian of the inductive sciences remarkshypotheses may often
be of service to science when they involve a certain portion of
incompleteness and even of error under this point of view i venture
to advance the hypothesis of pangenesis which implies that every
separate part of the whole organisation reproduces itself so that
ovules spermatozoa and pollengrainsthe fertilised egg or seed as
well as budsinclude and consist of a multitude of germs thrown off
from each separate part or unit1
in the first part i will enumerate as briefly as i can the groups of
facts which seem to demand connection but certain subjects not
hitherto discussed must be treated at disproportionate length in the
second part the hypothesis will be given and after considering how far
the necessary assumptions are in themselves improbable we shall see
whether it serves to bring under a single point of view the various
facts
part i
reproduction may be divided into two main classes namely sexual and
asexual the latter is effected in many waysby the formation of buds
of various kinds and by fissiparous generation that is by spontaneous
or artificial division it is notorious that some of the lower animals
when cut into many pieces reproduce so many perfect individuals
lyonnet cut a nais or freshwater worm into nearly forty pieces and
these all reproduced perfect animals2 it is probable that
segmentation could be carried much further in some of the protozoa and
with some of the lowest plants each cell will reproduce the
parentform johannes mller thought that there was an important
distinction between gemmation and fission for in the latter case the
divided portion however small is more fully developed than a bud
which also is a younger formation but most physiologists are now
convinced that the two processes are essentially alike3 prof huxley
remarks fission is little more than a peculiar mode of budding and
prof h j clark shows in detail that there is sometimes a compromise
between selfdivision and budding when a limb is amputated or when
the whole body is bisected the cut extremities are said to bud
forth4 and as the papilla which is first formed consists of
undeveloped cellular tissue like that forming an ordinary bud the
expression is apparently correct we see the connection of the two
processes in another way for trembley observed with the hydra that
the reproduction of the head after amputation was checked as soon as
the animal put forth reproductive gemm5
between the production by fissiparous generation of two or more
complete individuals and the repair of even a very slight injury
there is so perfect a gradation that it is impossible to doubt that
the two processes are connected as at each stage of growth an
amputated part is replaced by one in the same state of development we
must also follow sir j paget in admitting that the powers of
development from the embryo are identical with those exercised for the
restoration from injuries in other words that the powers are the same
by which perfection is first achieved and by which when lost it is
recovered6 finally we may conclude that the several forms of
budding fissiparous generation the repair of injuries and
development are all essentially the results of one and the same power
sexual generationthe union of the two sexual elements seems at
first sight to make a broad distinction between sexual and asexual
generation but the conjugation of alg by which process the contents
of two cells unite into a single mass capable of development
apparently gives us the first step towards sexual union and
pringsheim in his memoir on the pairing of zoospores7 shows that
conjugation graduates into true sexual reproduction moreover the now
wellascertained cases of parthenogenesis prove that the distinction
between sexual and asexual generation is not nearly so great as was
formerly thought for ova occasionally and even in some cases
frequently become developed into perfect beings without the concourse
of the male with most of the lower animals and even with mammals the
ova show a trace of parthenogenetic power for without being fertilised
they pass through the first stages of segmentation8 nor can pseudova
which do not need fertilisation be distinguished from true ova as was
first shown by sir j lubbock and is now admitted by siebold so
again the germballs in the larv of cecidomyia are said by
leuckart9 to be formed within the ovarium but they do not require to
be fertilised it should also be observed that in sexual generation
the ovules and the male element have equal power of transmitting every
single character possessed by either parent to their offspring we see
this clearly when hybrids are paired inter se for the characters of
both grandparents often appear in the progeny either perfectly or by
segments it is an error to suppose that the male transmits certain
characters and the female other characters although no doubt from
unknown causes one sex sometimes has a much stronger power of
transmission than the other
it has however been maintained by some authors that a bud differs
essentially from a fertilised germ in always reproducing the perfect
character of the parentstock whilst fertilised germs give birth to
variable beings but there is no such broad distinction as this in the
eleventh chapter numerous cases were advanced showing that buds
occasionally grow into plants having quite new characters and the
varieties thus produced can be propagated for a length of time by buds
and occasionally by seed nevertheless it must be admitted that beings
produced sexually are much more liable to vary than those produced
asexually and of this fact a partial explanation will hereafter be
attempted the variability in both cases is determined by the same
general causes and is governed by the same laws hence new varieties
arising from buds cannot be distinguished from those arising from seed
although budvarieties usually retain their character during successive
budgenerations yet they occasionally revert even after a long series
of budgenerations to their former character this tendency to
reversion in buds is one of the most remarkable of the several points
of agreement between the offspring from bud and seminal reproduction
but there is one difference between organisms produced sexually and
asexually which is very general the former pass in the course of
their development from a very low stage to their highest stage as we
see in the metamorphoses of insects and of many other animals and in
the concealed metamorphoses of the vertebrata animals propagated
asexually by buds or fission on the other hand commence their
development at that stage at which the budding or selfdividing animal
may happen to be and therefore do not pass through some of the lower
developmental stages10 afterwards they often advance in
organisation as we see in the many cases of alternate generation in
thus speaking of alternate generation i follow those naturalists who
look at this process as essentially one of internal budding or of
fissiparous generation some of the lower plants however such as
mosses and certain alg according to dr l radlkofer11 when
propagated asexually do undergo a retrogressive metamorphosis as far
as the final cause is concerned we can to a certain extent understand
why beings propagated by buds should not pass through all the early
stages of development for with each organism the structure acquired at
each stage must be adapted to its peculiar habits and if there are
places for the support of many individuals at some one stage the
simplest plan will be that they should be multiplied at this stage and
not that they should first retrograde in their development to an
earlier or simpler structure which might not be fitted for the then
surrounding conditions
from the several foregoing considerations we may conclude that the
difference between sexual and asexual generation is not nearly so great
as at first appears the chief difference being that an ovule cannot
continue to live and to be fully developed unless it unites with the
male element but even this difference is far from invariable as shown
by the many cases of parthenogenesis we are therefore naturally led to
inquire what the final cause can be of the necessity in ordinary
generation for the concourse of the two sexual elements
seeds and ova are often highly serviceable as the means of
disseminating plants and animals and of preserving them during one or
more seasons in a dormant state but unimpregnated seeds or ova and
detached buds would be equally serviceable for both purposes we can
however indicate two important advantages gained by the concourse of
the two sexes or rather of two individuals belonging to opposite
sexes for as i have shown in a former chapter the structure of every
organism appears to be especially adapted for the concurrence at least
occasionally of two individuals when species are rendered highly
variable by changed conditions of life the free intercrossing of the
varying individuals tends to keep each form fitted for its proper place
in nature and crossing can be effected only by sexual generation but
whether the end thus gained is of sufficient importance to account for
the first origin of sexual intercourse is extremely doubtful secondly
i have shown from a large body of facts that as a slight change in
the conditions of life is beneficial to each creature so in an
analogous manner is the change effected in the germ by sexual union
with a distinct individual and i have been led from observing the
many widelyextended provisions throughout nature for this purpose and
from the greater vigour of crossed organisms of all kinds as proved by
direct experiments as well as from the evil effects of close
interbreeding when long continued to believe that the advantage thus
gained is very great
why the germ which before impregnation undergoes a certain amount of
development ceases to progress and perishes unless it be acted on by
the male element and why conversely the male element which in the
case of some insects is enabled to keep alive for four or five years
and in the case of some plants for several years likewise perishes
unless it acts on or unites with the germ are questions which cannot
be answered with certainty it is however probable that both sexual
elements perish unless brought into union simply from including too
little formative matter for independent development quatrefages has
shown in the case of the teredo12 as did formerly prevost and dumas
with other animals that more than one spermatozoon is requisite to
fertilise an ovum this has likewise been shown by newport13 who
proved by numerous experiments that when a very small number of
spermatozoa are applied to the ova of batrachians they are only
partially impregnated and an embryo is never fully developed the rate
also of the segmentation of the ovum is determined by the number of the
spermatozoa with respect to plants nearly the same results were
obtained by klreuter and grtner this last careful observer after
making successive trials on a malva with more and more pollengrains
found14 that even thirty grains did not fertilise a single seed but
when forty grains were applied to the stigma a few seeds of small size
were formed in the case of mirabilis the pollen grains are
extraordinarily large and the ovarium contains only a single ovule
and these circumstances led naudin15 to make the following
experiments a flower was fertilised by three grains and succeeded
perfectly twelve flowers were fertilised by two grains and seventeen
flowers by a single grain and of these one flower alone in each lot
perfected its seed and it deserves especial notice that the plants
produced by these two seeds never attained their proper dimensions and
bore flowers of remarkably small size from these facts we clearly see
that the quantity of the peculiar formative matter which is contained
within the spermatozoa and pollengrains is an allimportant element in
the act of fertilisation not only for the full development of the
seed but for the vigour of the plant produced from such seed we see
something of the same kind in certain cases of parthenogenesis that
is when the male element is wholly excluded for m jourdan16 found
that out of about 58000 eggs laid by unimpregnated silkmoths many
passed through their early embryonic stages showing that they were
capable of selfdevelopment but only twentynine out of the whole
number produced caterpillars the same principle of quantity seems to
hold good even in artificial fissiparous reproduction for hackel17
found that by cutting the segmented and fertilised ova or larva of
siphonophor jellyfishes into pieces the smaller the pieces were
the slower was the rate of development and the larv thus produced
were by so much the more imperfect and inclined to monstrosity it
seems therefore probable that with the separate sexual elements
deficient quantity of formative matter is the main cause of their not
having the capacity for prolonged existence and development unless
they combine and thus increase each others bulk the belief that it is
the function of the spermatozoa to communicate life to the ovule seems
a strange one seeing that the unimpregnated ovule is already alive and
generally undergoes a certain amount of independent development sexual
and asexual reproduction are thus seen not to differ essentially and
we have already shown that asexual reproduction the power of regrowth
and development are all parts of one and the same great law
regrowth of amputated partsthis subject deserves a little further
discussion a multitude of the lower animals and some vertebrates
possess this wonderful power for instance spallanzani cut off the
legs and tail of the same salamander six times successively and
bonnet18 did so eight times and on each occasion the limbs were
reproduced on the exact line of amputation with no part deficient or
in excess an allied animal the axolotl had a limb bitten off which
was reproduced in an abnormal condition but when this was amputated it
was replaced by a perfect limb19 the new limbs in these cases bud
forth and are developed in the same manner as during the regular
development of a young animal for instance with the amblystoma
lurida three toes are first developed then the fourth and on the
hindfeet the fifth and so it is with a reproduced limb20
the power of regrowth is generally much greater during the youth of an
animal or during the earlier stages of its development than during
maturity the larv or tadpoles of the batrachians are capable of
reproducing lost members but not so the adults21 mature insects
have no power of regrowth excepting in one order whilst the larv of
many kinds have this power animals low in the scale are able as a
general rule to reproduce lost parts far more easily than those which
are more highly organised the myriapods offer a good illustration of
this rule but there are some strange exceptions to itthus nemerteans
though lowly organised are said to exhibit little power of regrowth
with the higher vertebrata such as birds and mammals the power is
extremely limited22
in the case of those animals which may be bisected or chopped into
pieces and of which every fragment will reproduce the whole the power
of regrowth must be diffused throughout the whole body nevertheless
there seems to be much truth in the view maintained by prof
lessona23 that this capacity is generally a localised and special
one serving to replace parts which are eminently liable to be lost in
each particular animal the most striking case in favour of this view
is that the terrestrial salamander according to lessona cannot
reproduce lost parts whilst another species of the same genus the
aquatic salamander has extraordinary powers of regrowth as we have
just seen and this animal is eminently liable to have its limbs tail
eyes and jaws bitten off by other tritons24 even with the aquatic
salamander the capacity is to a certain extent localised for when m
philipeaux25 extirpated the entire fore limb together with the
scapula the power of regrowth was completely lost it is also a
remarkable fact standing in opposition to a very general rule that
the young of the aquatic salamander do not possess the power of
repairing their limbs in an equal degree with the adults26 but i do
not know that they are more active or can otherwise better escape the
loss of their limbs than the adults the walkingstick insect
diapheromera femorata like other insects of the same order can
reproduce its legs in the mature state and these from their great
length must be liable to be lost but the capacity is localised as in
the case of the salamander for dr scudder found27 that if the
limb was removed within the trochantofemoral articulation it was
never renewed when a crab is seized by one of its legs this is thrown
off at the basal joint being afterwards replaced by a new leg and it
is generally admitted that this is a special provision for the safety
of the animal lastly with gasteropod molluscs which are well known
to have the power of reproducing their heads lessona shows that they
are very liable to have their heads bitten off by fishes the rest of
the body being protected by the shell even with plants we see
something of the same kind for nondeciduous leaves and young stems
have no power of regrowth these parts being easily replaced by growth
from new buds whilst the bark and subjacent tissues of the trunks of
trees have great power of regrowth probably on account of their
increase in diameter and of their liability to injury from being
gnawed by animals
grafthybridsit is well known from innumerable trials made in all
parts of the world that buds may be inserted into a stock and that
the plants thus raised are not affected in a greater degree than can be
accounted for by changed nutrition nor do the seedlings raised from
such inserted buds partake of the character of the stock though they
are more liable to vary than are seedlings from the same variety
growing on its own roots a bud also may sport into a new and
stronglymarked variety without any other bud on the same plant being
in the least degree affected we may therefore infer in accordance
with the common view that each bud is a distinct individual and that
its formative elements do not spread beyond the parts subsequently
developed from it nevertheless we have seen in the abstract on
grafthybridisation in the eleventh chapter that buds certainly include
formative matter which can occasionally combine with that included in
the tissues of a distinct variety or species a plant intermediate
between the two parentforms being thus produced in the case of the
potato we have seen that the tubers produced from a bud of one kind
inserted into another are intermediate in colour size shape and state
of surface that the stems foliage and even certain constitutional
peculiarities such as precocity are likewise intermediate with these
wellestablished cases the evidence that grafthybrids have also been
produced with the laburnum orange vine rose etc seems sufficient
but we do not know under what conditions this rare form of reproduction
is possible from these several cases we learn the important fact that
formative elements capable of blending with those of a distinct
individual and this is the chief characteristic of sexual generation
are not confined to the reproductive organs but are present in the
buds and cellular tissue of plants and this is a fact of the highest
physiological importance
direct action of the male element on the femalein the eleventh
chapter abundant proofs were given that foreign pollen occasionally
affects in a direct manner the motherplant thus when gallesio
fertilised an orangeflower with pollen from the lemon the fruit bore
stripes of perfectly characterised lemonpeel with peas several
observers have seen the colour of the seedcoats and even of the pod
directly affected by the pollen of a distinct variety so it has been
with the fruit of the apple which consists of the modified calyx and
upper part of the flowerstalk in ordinary cases these parts are
wholly formed by the motherplant we here see that the formative
elements included within the male element or pollen of one variety can
affect and hybridise not the part which they are properly adapted to
affect namely the ovules but the partiallydeveloped tissues of a
distinct variety or species we are thus brought halfway towards a
grafthybrid in which the formative elements included within the
tissues of one individual combine with those included in the tissues of
a distinct variety or species thus giving rise to a new and
intermediate form independently of the male or female sexual organs
with animals which do not breed until nearly mature and of which all
the parts are then fully developed it is hardly possible that the male
element should directly affect the female but we have the analogous
and perfectly wellascertained case of the male element affecting as
with the quagga and lord mortons mare the female or her ova in such
a manner that when she is impregnated by another male her offspring are
affected and hybridised by the first male the explanation would be
simple if the spermatozoa could keep alive within the body of the
female during the long interval which has sometimes elapsed between the
two acts of impregnation but no one will suppose that this is possible
with the higher animals
developmentthe fertilised germ reaches maturity by a vast number of
changes these are either slight and slowly effected as when the child
grows into the man or are great and sudden as with the metamorphoses
of most insects between these extremes we have every gradation even
within the same class thus as sir j lubbock has shown28 there is
an ephemerous insect which moults above twenty times undergoing each
time a slight but decided change of structure and these changes as he
further remarks probably reveal to us the normal stages of
development which are concealed and hurried through or suppressed in
most other insects in ordinary metamorphoses the parts and organs
appear to become changed into the corresponding parts in the next stage
of development but there is another form of development which has
been called by professor owen metagenesis in this case the new parts
are not moulded upon the inner surface of the old ones the plastic
force has changed its course of operation the outer case and all that
gave form and character to the precedent individual perish and are
cast off they are not changed into the corresponding parts of the new
individual these are due to a new and distinct developmental process
etc29 metamorphosis however graduates so insensibly into
metagenesis that the two processes cannot be distinctly separated for
instance in the last change which cirripedes undergo the alimentary
canal and some other organs are moulded on preexisting parts but the
eyes of the old and the young animal are developed in entirely
different parts of the body the tips of the mature limbs are formed
within the larval limbs and may be said to be metamorphosed from them
but their basal portions and the whole thorax are developed in a plane
at right angles to the larval limbs and thorax and this may be called
metagenesis the metagenetic process is carried to an extreme point in
the development of some echinoderms for the animal in the second stage
of development is formed almost like a bud within the animal of the
first stage the latter being then cast off like an old vestment yet
sometimes maintaining for a short period an independent vitality30
if instead of a single individual several were to be thus developed
metagenetically within a preexisting form the process would be called
one of alternate generation the young thus developed may either
closely resemble the encasing parentform as with the larv of
cecidomyia or may differ to an astonishing degree as with many
parasitic worms and jellyfishes but this does not make any essential
difference in the process any more than the greatness or abruptness of
the change in the metamorphoses of insects
the whole question of development is of great importance for our
present subject when an organ the eye for instance is
metagenetically formed in a part of the body where during the previous
stage of development no eye existed we must look at it as a new and
independent growth the absolute independence of new and old
structures although corresponding in structure and function is still
more obvious when several individuals are formed within a previous
form as in the cases of alternate generation the same important
principle probably comes largely into play even in the case of
apparently continuous growth as we shall see when we consider the
inheritance of modifications at corresponding ages
we are led to the same conclusion namely the independence of parts
successively developed by another and quite distinct group of facts
it is well known that many animals belonging to the same order and
therefore not differing widely from each other pass through an
extremely different course of development thus certain beetles not in
any way remarkably different from others of the same order undergo
what has been called a hypermetamorphosisthat is they pass through
an early stage wholly different from the ordinary grublike larva in
the same suborder of crabs namely the macroura as fritz mller
remarks the river crayfish is hatched under the same form which it
ever afterwards retains the young lobster has divided legs like a
mysis the palmon appears under the form of a zoea and peneus under
the naupliusform and how wonderfully these larval forms differ from
one another is known to every naturalist31 some other crustaceans
as the same author observes start from the same point and arrive at
nearly the same end but in the middle of their development are widely
different from one another still more striking cases could be given
with respect to the echinodermata with the medus or jellyfishes
professor allman observes the classification of the hydroida would be
a comparatively simple task if as has been erroneously asserted
genericallyidentical medusoids always arose from genericallyidentical
polypoids and on the other hand that genericallyidentical polypoids
always gave origin to genericallyidentical medusoids so again dr
strethill wright remarks in the lifehistory of the hydroid any
phase planuloid polypoid or medusoid may be absent32
according to the belief now generally accepted by our best naturalists
all the members of the same order or class for instance the medus or
the macrourous crustaceans are descended from a common progenitor
during their descent they have diverged much in structure but have
retained much in common and this has occurred though they have passed
through and still pass through marvellously different metamorphoses
this fact well illustrates how independent each structure is from that
which precedes and that which follows it in the course of development
the functional independence of the elements or units of the
bodyphysiologists agree that the whole organism consists of a
multitude of elemental parts which are to a great extent independent
of one another each organ says claude bernard33 has its proper
life its autonomy it can develop and reproduce itself independently
of the adjoining tissues a great german authority virchow34
asserts still more emphatically that each system consists of an
enormous mass of minute centres of action    every element has its
own special action and even though it derive its stimulus to activity
from other parts yet alone effects the actual performance of duties 
  every single epithelial and muscular fibrecell leads a sort of
parasitical existence in relation to the rest of the body    every
single bonecorpuscle really possesses conditions of nutrition peculiar
to itself each element as sir j paget remarks lives its appointed
time and then dies and is replaced after being cast off or
absorbed35 i presume that no physiologist doubts that for instance
each bonecorpuscle of the finger differs from the corresponding
corpuscle in the corresponding joint of the toe and there can hardly
be a doubt that even those on the corresponding sides of the body
differ though almost identical in nature this near approach to
identity is curiously shown in many diseases in which the same exact
points on the right and left sides of the body are similarly affected
thus sir j paget36 gives a drawing of a diseased pelvis in which
the bone has grown into a most complicated pattern but there is not
one spot or line on one side which is not represented as exactly as it
would be in a mirror on the other
many facts support this view of the independent life of each minute
element of the body virchow insists that a single bonecorpuscle or a
single cell in the skin may become diseased the spur of a cock after
being inserted into the ear of an ox lived for eight years and
acquired a weight of 396 grammes nearly fourteen ounces and the
astonishing length of twentyfour centimetres or about nine inches so
that the head of the ox appeared to bear three horns37 the tail of a
pig has been grafted into the middle of its back and reacquired
sensibility dr ollier38 inserted a piece of periosteum from the
bone of a young dog under the skin of a rabbit and true bone was
developed a multitude of similar facts could be given the frequent
presence of hairs and of perfectly developed teeth even teeth of the
second dentition in ovarian tumours39 are facts leading to the same
conclusion mr lawson tait refers to a tumour in which over 300 teeth
were found resembling in many respects milkteeth and to another
tumour full of hair which had grown and been shed from one little
spot of skin not bigger than the tip of my little finger the amount of
hair in the sac had it grown from a similarly sized area of the scalp
would have taken almost a lifetime to grow and be shed
whether each of the innumerable autonomous elements of the body is a
cell or the modified product of a cell is a more doubtful question
even if so wide a definition be given to the term as to include
celllike bodies without walls and without nuclei40 the doctrine of
omnis cellula e cellul is admitted for plants and widely prevails
with respect to animals41 thus virchow the great supporter of the
cellular theory whilst allowing that difficulties exist maintains
that every atom of tissue is derived from cells and these from
preexisting cells and these primarily from the egg which he regards
as a great cell that cells still retaining the same nature increase
by selfdivision or proliferation is admitted by every one but when
an organism undergoes great changes of structure during development
the cells which at each stage are supposed to be directly derived from
previously existing cells must likewise be greatly changed in nature
this change is attributed by the supporters of the cellular doctrine to
some inherent power which the cells possess and not to any external
agency others maintain that cells and tissues of all kinds may be
formed independently of preexisting cells from plastic lymph or
blastema whichever view may be correct every one admits that the body
consists of a multitude of organic units all of which possess their
own proper attributes and are to a certain extent independent of all
others hence it will be convenient to use indifferently the terms
cells or organic units or simply units
variability and inheritancewe have seen in the twentysecond
chapter that variability is not a principle coordinate with life or
reproduction but results from special causes generally from changed
conditions acting during successive generations the fluctuating
variability thus induced is apparently due in part to the sexual system
being easily affected so that it is often rendered impotent and when
not so seriously affected it often fails in its proper function of
transmitting truly the characters of the parents to the offspring but
variability is not necessarily connected with the sexual system as we
see in the cases of budvariation although we are seldom able to trace
the nature of the connection many deviations of structure no doubt
result from changed conditions acting directly on the organisation
independently of the reproductive system in some instances we may feel
sure of this when all or nearly all the individuals which have been
similarly exposed are similarly and definitely affected of which
several instances have been given but it is by no means clear why the
offspring should be affected by the exposure of the parents to new
conditions and why it is necessary in most cases that several
generations should have been thus exposed
how again can we explain the inherited effects of the use or disuse
of particular organs the domesticated duck flies less and walks more
than the wild duck and its limbbones have become diminished and
increased in a corresponding manner in comparison with those of the
wild duck a horse is trained to certain paces and the colt inherits
similar consensual movements the domesticated rabbit becomes tame from
close confinement the dog intelligent from associating with man the
retriever is taught to fetch and carry and these mental endowments and
bodily powers are all inherited nothing in the whole circuit of
physiology is more wonderful how can the use or disuse of a particular
limb or of the brain affect a small aggregate of reproductive cells
seated in a distant part of the body in such a manner that the being
developed from these cells inherits the characters of either one or
both parents even an imperfect answer to this question would be
satisfactory
in the chapters devoted to inheritance it was shown that a multitude of
newly acquired characters whether injurious or beneficial whether of
the lowest or highest vital importance are often faithfully
transmittedfrequently even when one parent alone possesses some new
peculiarity and we may on the whole conclude that inheritance is the
rule and noninheritance the anomaly in some instances a character is
not inherited from the conditions of life being directly opposed to
its development in many instances from the conditions incessantly
inducing fresh variability as with grafted fruittrees and
highlycultivated flowers in the remaining cases the failure may be
attributed to reversion by which the child resembles its grandparents
or more remote progenitors instead of its parents
inheritance is governed by various laws characters which first appear
at any particular age tend to reappear at a corresponding age they
often become associated with certain seasons of the year and reappear
in the offspring at a corresponding season if they appear rather late
in life in one sex they tend to reappear exclusively in the same sex
at the same period of life
the principle of reversion recently alluded to is one of the most
wonderful of the attributes of inheritance it proves to us that the
transmission of a character and its development which ordinarily go
together and thus escape discrimination are distinct powers and these
powers in some cases are even antagonistic for each acts alternately
in successive generations reversion is not a rare event depending on
some unusual or favourable combination of circumstances but occurs so
regularly with crossed animals and plants and so frequently with
uncrossed breeds that it is evidently an essential part of the
principle of inheritance we know that changed conditions have the
power of evoking longlost characters as in the case of animals
becoming feral the act of crossing in itself possesses this power in a
high degree what can be more wonderful than that characters which
have disappeared during scores or hundreds or even thousands of
generations should suddenly reappear perfectly developed as in the
case of pigeons and fowls both when purely bred and especially when
crossed or as with the zebrine stripes on duncoloured horses and
other such cases many monstrosities come under this same head as when
rudimentary organs are redeveloped or when an organ which we must
believe was possessed by an early progenitor of the species but of
which not even a rudiment is left suddenly reappears as with the
fifth stamen in some scrophulariace we have already seen that
reversion acts in budreproduction and we know that it occasionally
acts during the growth of the same individual animal especially but
not exclusively if of crossed parentageas in the rare cases
described of fowls pigeons cattle and rabbits which have reverted
to the colours of one of their parents or ancestors as they advanced in
years
we are led to believe as formerly explained that every character
which occasionally reappears is present in a latent form in each
generation in nearly the same manner as in male and female animals the
secondary characters of the opposite sex lie latent and ready to be
evolved when the reproductive organs are injured this comparison of
the secondary sexual characters which lie latent in both sexes with
other latent characters is the more appropriate from the case recorded
of a hen which assumed some of the masculine characters not of her
own race but of an early progenitor she thus exhibited at the same
time the redevelopment of latent characters of both kinds in every
living creature we may feel assured that a host of longlost characters
lie ready to be evolved under proper conditions how can we make
intelligible and connect with other facts this wonderful and common
capacity of reversionthis power of calling back to life longlost
characters
part ii
i have now enumerated the chief facts which every one would desire to
see connected by some intelligible bond this can be done if we make
the following assumptions and much may be advanced in favour of the
chief one the secondary assumptions can likewise be supported by
various physiological considerations it is universally admitted that
the cells or units of the body increase by selfdivision or
proliferation retaining the same nature and that they ultimately
become converted into the various tissues and substances of the body
but besides this means of increase i assume that the units throw off
minute granules which are dispersed throughout the whole system that
these when supplied with proper nutriment multiply by selfdivision
and are ultimately developed into units like those from which they were
originally derived these granules may be called gemmules they are
collected from all parts of the system to constitute the sexual
elements and their development in the next generation forms a new
being but they are likewise capable of transmission in a dormant state
to future generations and may then be developed their development
depends on their union with other partially developed or nascent cells
which precede them in the regular course of growth why i use the term
union will be seen when we discuss the direct action of pollen on the
tissues of the motherplant gemmules are supposed to be thrown off by
every unit not only during the adult state but during each stage of
development of every organism but not necessarily during the continued
existence of the same unit lastly i assume that the gemmules in their
dormant state have a mutual affinity for each other leading to their
aggregation into buds or into the sexual elements hence it is not the
reproductive organs or buds which generate new organisms but the units
of which each individual is composed these assumptions constitute the
provisional hypothesis which i have called pangenesis views in many
respects similar have been propounded by various authors42
before proceeding to show firstly how far these assumptions are in
themselves probable and secondly how far they connect and explain the
various groups of facts with which we are concerned it may be useful
to give an illustration as simple as possible of the hypothesis if
one of the protozoa be formed as it appears under the microscope of a
small mass of homogeneous gelatinous matter a minute particle or
gemmule thrown off from any part and nourished under favourable
circumstances would reproduce the whole but if the upper and lower
surfaces were to differ in texture from each other and from the central
portion then all three parts would have to throw off gemmules which
when aggregated by mutual affinity would form either buds or the sexual
elements and would ultimately be developed into a similar organism
precisely the same view may be extended to one of the higher animals
although in this case many thousand gemmules must be thrown off from
the various parts of the body at each stage of development these
gemmules being developed in union with preexisting nascent cells in
due order of succession
physiologists maintain as we have seen that each unit of the body
though to a large extent dependent on others is likewise to a certain
extent independent or autonomous and has the power of increasing by
selfdivision i go one step further and assume that each unit casts
off free gemmules which are dispersed throughout the system and are
capable under proper conditions of being developed into similar units
nor can this assumption be considered as gratuitous and improbable it
is manifest that the sexual elements and buds include formative matter
of some kind capable of development and we now know from the
production of grafthybrids that similar matter is dispersed throughout
the tissues of plants and can combine with that of another and
distinct plant giving rise to a new being intermediate in character
we know also that the male element can act directly on the partially
developed tissues of the motherplant and on the future progeny of
female animals the formative matter which is thus dispersed throughout
the tissues of plants and which is capable of being developed into
each unit or part must be generated there by some means and my chief
assumption is that this matter consists of minute particles or gemmules
cast off from each unit or cell43
but i have further to assume that the gemmules in their undeveloped
state are capable of largely multiplying themselves by selfdivision
like independent organisms delpino insists that to admit of
multiplication by fissiparity in corpuscles analogous to seeds or buds
   is repugnant to all analogy but this seems a strange objection
as thuret44 has seen the zoospore of an alga divide itself and each
half germinated haeckel divided the segmented ovum of a siphonophora
into many pieces and these were developed nor does the extreme
minuteness of the gemmules which can hardly differ much in nature from
the lowest and simplest organisms render it improbable that they
should grow and multiply a great authority dr beale45 says that
minute yeast cells are capable of throwing off buds or gemmules much
less than the 1100000 of an inch in diameter and these he thinks are
capable of subdivision practically ad infinitum
a particle of smallpox matter so minute as to be borne by the wind
must multiply itself many thousandfold in a person thus inoculated and
so with the contagious matter of scarlet fever46 it has recently
been ascertained47 that a minute portion of the mucous discharge from
an animal affected with rinderpest if placed in the blood of a healthy
ox increases so fast that in a short space of time the whole mass of
blood weighing many pounds is infected and every small particle of
that blood contains enough poison to give within less than fortyeight
hours the disease to another animal
the retention of free and undeveloped gemmules in the same body from
early youth to old age will appear improbable but we should remember
how long seeds lie dormant in the earth and buds in the bark of a tree
their transmission from generation to generation will appear still more
improbable but here again we should remember that many rudimentary and
useless organs have been transmitted during an indefinite number of
generations we shall presently see how well the longcontinued
transmission of undeveloped gemmules explains many facts
as each unit or group of similar units throughout the body casts off
its gemmules and as all are contained within the smallest ovule and
within each spermatozoon or pollengrain and as some animals and
plants produce an astonishing number of pollengrains and ovules48
the number and minuteness of the gemmules must be something
inconceivable but considering how minute the molecules are and how
many go to the formation of the smallest granule of any ordinary
substance this difficulty with respect to the gemmules is not
insuperable from the data arrived at by sir w thomson my son george
finds that a cube of 110000 of an inch of glass or water must consist
of between 16 million millions and 131 thousand million million
molecules no doubt the molecules of which an organism is formed are
larger from being more complex than those of an inorganic substance
and probably many molecules go to the formation of a gemmule but when
we bear in mind that a cube of 110000 of an inch is much smaller than
any pollengrain ovule or bud we can see what a vast number of
gemmules one of these bodies might contain
the gemmules derived from each part or organ must be thoroughly
dispersed throughout the whole system we know for instance that even
a minute fragment of a leaf of a begonia will reproduce the whole
plant and that if a freshwater worm is chopped into small pieces
each will reproduce the whole animal considering also the minuteness
of the gemmules and the permeability of all organic tissues the
thorough dispersion of the gemmules is not surprising that matter may
be readily transferred without the aid of vessels from part to part of
the body we have a good instance in a case recorded by sir j paget of
a lady whose hair lost its colour at each successive attack of
neuralgia and recovered it again in the course of a few days with
plants however and probably with compound animals such as corals
the gemmules do not ordinarily spread from bud to bud but are confined
to the parts developed from each separate bud and of this fact no
explanation can be given
the assumed elective affinity of each gemmule for that particular cell
which precedes it in due order of development is supported by many
analogies in all ordinary cases of sexual reproduction the male and
female elements certainly have a mutual affinity for each other thus
it is believed that about ten thousand species of composit exist and
there can be no doubt that if the pollen of all these species could be
simultaneously or successively placed on the stigma of any one species
this one would elect with unerring certainty its own pollen this
elective capacity is all the more wonderful as it must have been
acquired since the many species of this great group of plants branched
off from a common progenitor on any view of the nature of sexual
reproduction the formative matter of each part contained within the
ovules and the male element act on each other by some law of special
affinity so that corresponding parts affect one another thus a calf
produced from a shorthorned cow by a longhorned bull has its horns
affected by the union of the two forms and the offspring from two
birds with differently coloured tails have their tails affected
the various tissues of the body plainly show as many physiologists
have insisted49 an affinity for special organic substances whether
natural or foreign to the body we see this in the cells of the kidneys
attracting urea from the blood in curare affecting certain nerves
lytta vesicatoria the kidneys and the poisonous matter of various
diseases as smallpox scarletfever hoopingcough glanders and
hydrophobia affecting certain definite parts of the body
it has also been assumed that the development of each gemmule depends
on its union with another cell or unit which has just commenced its
development and which precedes it in due order of growth that the
formative matter within the pollen of plants which by our hypothesis
consists of gemmules can unite with and modify the partially developed
cells of the motherplant we have clearly seen in the section devoted
to this subject as the tissues of plants are formed as far as is
known only by the proliferation of preexisting cells we must
conclude that the gemmules derived from the foreign pollen do not
become developed into new and separate cells but penetrate and modify
the nascent cells of the motherplant this process may be compared
with what takes place in the act of ordinary fertilisation during
which the contents of the pollentubes penetrate the closed embryonic
sac within the ovule and determine the development of the embryo
according to this view the cells of the motherplant may almost
literally be said to be fertilised by the gemmules derived from the
foreign pollen in this case and in all others the proper gemmules must
combine in due order with preexisting nascent cells owing to their
elective affinities a slight difference in nature between the gemmules
and the nascent cells would be far from interfering with their mutual
union and development for we well know in the case of ordinary
reproduction that such slight differentiation in the sexual elements
favours in a marked manner their union and subsequent development as
well as the vigour of the offspring thus produced
thus far we have been able by the aid of our hypothesis to throw some
obscure light on the problems which have come before us but it must be
confessed that many points remain altogether doubtful thus it is
useless to speculate at what period of development each unit of the
body casts off its gemmules as the whole subject of the development of
the various tissues is as yet far from clear we do not know whether
the gemmules are merely collected by some unknown means at certain
seasons within the reproductive organs or whether after being thus
collected they rapidly multiply there as the flow of blood to these
organs at each breeding season seems to render probable nor do we know
why the gemmules collect to form buds in certain definite places
leading to the symmetrical growth of trees and corals we have no means
of deciding whether the ordinary wear and tear of the tissues is made
good by means of gemmules or merely by the proliferation of
preexisting cells if the gemmules are thus consumed as seems
probable from the intimate connection between the repair of waste
regrowth and development and more especially from the periodical
changes which many male animals undergo in colour and structure then
some light would be thrown on the phenomena of old age with its
lessened power of reproduction and of the repair of injuries and on
the obscure subject of longevity the fact of castrated animals which
do not cast off innumerable gemmules in the act of reproduction not
being longerlived than perfect males seems opposed to the belief that
gemmules are consumed in the ordinary repair of wasted tissues unless
indeed the gemmules after being collected in small numbers within the
reproductive organs are there largely multiplied50
that the same cells or units may live for a long period and continue
multiplying without being modified by their union with free gemmules of
any kind is probable from such cases as that of the spur of a cock
which grew to an enormous size when grafted into the ear of an ox how
far units are modified during their normal growth by absorbing peculiar
nutriment from the surrounding tissues independently of their union
with gemmules of a distinct nature is another doubtful point51 we
shall appreciate this difficulty by calling to mind what complex yet
symmetrical growths the cells of plants yield when inoculated by the
poison of a gallinsect with animals various polypoid excrescences and
tumours are generally admitted52 to be the direct product through
proliferation of normal cells which have become abnormal in the
regular growth and repair of bones the tissues undergo as virchow
remarks53 a whole series of permutations and substitutions the
cartilage cells may be converted by a direct transformation into
marrowcells and continue as such or they may first be converted into
osseous and then into medullary tissue or lastly they may first be
converted into marrow and then into bone so variable are the
permutations of these tissues in themselves so nearly allied and yet
in their external appearance so completely distinct but as these
tissues thus change their nature at any age without any obvious change
in their nutrition we must suppose in accordance with our hypothesis
that gemmules derived from one kind of tissue combine with the cells of
another kind and cause the successive modifications
we have good reason to believe that several gemmules are requisite for
the development of one and the same unit or cell for we cannot
otherwise understand the insufficiency of a single or even of two or
three pollengrains or spermatozoa but we are far from knowing whether
the gemmules of all the units are free and separate from one another
or whether some are from the first united into small aggregates a
feather for instance is a complex structure and as each separate
part is liable to inherited variations i conclude that each feather
generates a large number of gemmules but it is possible that these may
be aggregated into a compound gemmule the same remark applies to the
petals of flowers which are sometimes highly complex structures with
each ridge and hollow contrived for a special purpose so that each
part must have been separately modified and the modifications
transmitted consequently separate gemmules according to our
hypothesis must have been thrown off from each cell or unit but as
we sometimes see half an anther or a small portion of a filament
becoming petaliform or parts or mere stripes of the calyx assuming
the colour and texture of the corolla it is probable that with petals
the gemmules of each cell are not aggregated together into a compound
gemmule but are free and separate even in so simple a case as that of
a perfect cell with its protoplasmic contents nucleus nucleolus and
walls we do not know whether or not its development depends on a
compound gemmule derived from each part54
having now endeavoured to show that the several foregoing assumptions
are to a certain extent supported by analogous facts and having
alluded to some of the most doubtful points we will consider how far
the hypothesis brings under a single point of view the various cases
enumerated in the first part all the forms of reproduction graduate
into one another and agree in their product for it is impossible to
distinguish between organisms produced from buds from selfdivision
or from fertilised germs such organisms are liable to variations of
the same nature and to reversions of the same kind and as according
to our hypothesis all the forms of reproduction depend on the
aggregation of gemmules derived from the whole body we can understand
this remarkable agreement parthenogenesis is no longer wonderful and
if we did not know that great good followed from the union of the
sexual elements derived from two distinct individuals the wonder would
be that parthenogenesis did not occur much oftener than it does on any
ordinary theory of reproduction the formation of grafthybrids and the
action of the male element on the tissues of the motherplant as well
as on the future progeny of female animals are great anomalies but
they are intelligible on our hypothesis the reproductive organs do not
actually create the sexual elements they merely determine the
aggregation and perhaps the multiplication of the gemmules in a special
manner these organs however together with their accessory parts
have high functions to perform they adapt one or both elements for
independent temporary existence and for mutual union the stigmatic
secretion acts on the pollen of a plant of the same species in a wholly
different manner to what it does on the pollen of one belonging to a
distinct genus or family the spermatophores of the cephalopoda are
wonderfully complex structures which were formerly mistaken for
parasitic worms and the spermatozoa of some animals possess attributes
which if observed in an independent animal would be put down to
instinct guided by senseorgansas when the spermatozoa of an insect
find their way into the minute micropyle of the egg
the antagonism which has long been observed55 with certain
exceptions between growth and the power of sexual
reproduction56between the repair of injuries and gemmationand with
plants between rapid increase by buds rhizomes etc and the
production of seed is partly explained by the gemmules not existing in
sufficient numbers for these processes to be carried on simultaneously
hardly any fact in physiology is more wonderful than the power of
regrowth for instance that a snail should be able to reproduce its
head or a salamander its eyes tail and legs exactly at the points
where they have been cut off such cases are explained by the presence
of gemmules derived from each part and disseminated throughout the
body i have heard the process compared with that of the repair of the
broken angles of a crystal by recrystallisation and the two processes
have this much in common that in the one case the polarity of the
molecules is the efficient cause and in the other the affinity of the
gemmules for particular nascent cells but we have here to encounter
two objections which apply not only to the regrowth of a part or of a
bisected individual but to fissiparous generation and budding the
first objection is that the part which is reproduced is in the same
stage of development as that of the being which has been operated on or
bisected and in the case of buds that the new beings thus produced
are in the same stage as that of the budding parent thus a mature
salamander of which the tail has been cut off does not reproduce a
larval tail and a crab does not reproduce a larval leg in the case of
budding it was shown in the first part of this chapter that the new
being thus produced does not retrograde in developmentthat is does
not pass through those earlier stages which the fertilised germ has to
pass through nevertheless the organisms operated on or multiplying
themselves by buds must by our hypothesis include innumerable
gemmules derived from every part or unit of the earlier stages of
development and why do not such gemmules reproduce the amputated part
or the whole body at a corresponding early stage of development
the second objection which has been insisted on by delpino is that
the tissues for instance of a mature salamander or crab of which a
limb has been removed are already differentiated and have passed
through their whole course of development and how can such tissues in
accordance with our hypothesis attract and combine with the gemmules of
the part which is to be reproduced in answer to these two objections
we must bear in mind the evidence which has been advanced showing that
at least in a large number of cases the power of regrowth is a
localised faculty acquired for the sake of repairing special injuries
to which each particular creature is liable and in the case of buds or
fissiparous generation for the sake of quickly multiplying the
organism at a period of life when it can be supported in large numbers
these considerations lead us to believe that in all such cases a stock
of nascent cells or of partially developed gemmules are retained for
this special purpose either locally or throughout the body ready to
combine with the gemmules derived from the cells which come next in due
succession if this be admitted we have a sufficient answer to the
above two objections anyhow pangenesis seems to throw a considerable
amount of light on the wonderful power of regrowth
it follows also from the view just given that the sexual elements
differ from buds in not including nascent cells or gemmules in a
somewhat advanced stage of development so that only the gemmules
belonging to the earliest stages are first developed as young animals
and those which stand low in the scale generally have a much greater
capacity for regrowth than older and higher animals it would also
appear that they retain cells in a nascent state or partially
developed gemmules more readily than do animals which have already
passed through a long series of developmental changes i may here add
that although ovules can be detected in most or all female animals at
an extremely early age there is no reason to doubt that gemmules
derived from parts modified during maturity can pass into the ovules
with respect to hybridism pangenesis agrees well with most of the
ascertained facts we must believe as previously shown that several
gemmules are requisite for the development of each cell or unit but
from the occurrence of parthenogenesis more especially from those
cases in which an embryo is only partially formed we may infer that
the female element generally includes gemmules in nearly sufficient
number for independent development so that when united with the male
element the gemmules are superabundant now when two species or races
are crossed reciprocally the offspring do not commonly differ and
this shows that the sexual elements agree in power in accordance with
the view that both include the same gemmules hybrids and mongrels are
also generally intermediate in character between the two parentforms
yet occasionally they closely resemble one parent in one part and the
other parent in another part or even in their whole structure nor is
this difficult to understand on the admission that the gemmules in the
fertilised germ are superabundant in number and that those derived
from one parent may have some advantage in number affinity or vigour
over those derived from the other parent crossed forms sometimes
exhibit the colour or other characters of either parent in stripes or
blotches and this occurs in the first generation or through reversion
in succeeding bud and seminal generations of which fact several
instances were given in the eleventh chapter in these cases we must
follow naudin57 and admit that the essence or element of the two
speciesterms which i should translate into the gemmuleshave an
affinity for their own kind and thus separate themselves into distinct
stripes or blotches and reasons were given when discussing in the
fifteenth chapter the incompatibility of certain characters to unite
for believing in such mutual affinity when two forms are crossed one
is not rarely found to be prepotent in the transmission of its
characters over the other and this we can explain by again assuming
that the one form has some advantage over the other in the number
vigour or affinity of its gemmules in some cases however certain
characters are present in the one form and latent in the other for
instance there is a latent tendency in all pigeons to become blue
and when a blue pigeon is crossed with one of any other colour the
blue tint is generally prepotent the explanation of this form of
prepotency will be obvious when we come to the consideration of
reversion
when two distinct species are crossed it is notorious that they do not
yield the full or proper number of offspring and we can only say on
this head that as the development of each organism depends on such
nicelybalanced affinities between a host of gemmules and nascent
cells we need not feel at all surprised that the commixture of
gemmules derived from two distinct species should lead to partial or
complete failure of development with respect to the sterility of
hybrids produced from the union of two distinct species it was shown
in the nineteenth chapter that this depends exclusively on the
reproductive organs being specially affected but why these organs
should be thus affected we do not know any more than why unnatural
conditions of life though compatible with health should cause
sterility or why continued close interbreeding or the illegitimate
unions of heterostyled plants induce the same result the conclusion
that the reproductive organs alone are affected and not the whole
organisation agrees perfectly with the unimpaired or even increased
capacity in hybrid plants for propagation by buds for this implies
according to our hypothesis that the cells of the hybrids throw off
hybridised gemmules which become aggregated into buds but fail to
become aggregated within the reproductive organs so as to form the
sexual elements in a similar manner many plants when placed under
unnatural conditions fail to produce seed but can readily be
propagated by buds we shall presently see that pangenesis agrees well
with the strong tendency to reversion exhibited by all crossed animals
and plants
each organism reaches maturity through a longer or shorter course of
growth and development the former term being confined to mere increase
of size and development to changed structure the changes may be small
and insensibly slow as when a child grows into a man or many abrupt
and slight as in the metamorphoses of certain ephemerous insects or
again few and stronglymarked as with most other insects each newly
formed part may be moulded within a previously existing and
corresponding part and in this case it will appear falsely as i
believe to be developed from the old part or it may be formed within
a distinct part of the body as in the extreme cases of metagenesis an
eye for instance may be developed at a spot where no eye previously
existed we have also seen that allied organic beings in the course of
their metamorphoses sometimes attain nearly the same structure after
passing through widely different forms or conversely after passing
through nearly the same early forms arrive at widely different mature
forms in these cases it is very difficult to accept the common view
that the firstformed cells or units possess the inherent power
independently of any external agency of producing new structures
wholly different in form position and function but all these cases
become plain on the hypothesis of pangenesis the units during each
stage of development throw off gemmules which multiplying are
transmitted to the offspring in the offspring as soon as any
particular cell or unit becomes partially developed it unites with
or to speak metaphorically is fertilised by the gemmule of the next
succeeding cell and so onwards but organisms have often been
subjected to changed conditions of life at a certain stage of their
development and in consequence have been slightly modified and the
gemmules cast off from such modified parts will tend to reproduce parts
modified in the same manner this process may be repeated until the
structure of the part becomes greatly changed at one particular stage
of development but this will not necessarily affect other parts
whether previously or subsequently formed in this manner we can
understand the remarkable independence of structure in the successive
metamorphoses and especially in the successive metageneses of many
animals in the case however of diseases which supervene during old
age subsequently to the ordinary period of procreation and which
nevertheless are sometimes inherited as occurs with brain and heart
complaints we must suppose that the organs were affected at an early
age and threw off at this period affected gemmules but that the
affection became visible or injurious only after the prolonged growth
in the strict sense of the word of the part in all the changes of
structure which regularly supervene during old age we probably see the
effects of deteriorated growth and not of true development
the principle of the independent formation of each part owing to the
union of the proper gemmules with certain nascent cells together with
the superabundance of the gemmules derived from both parents and the
subsequent selfmultiplication of the gemmules throws light on a
widely different group of facts which on any ordinary view of
development appears very strange i allude to organs which are
abnormally transposed or multiplied for instance a curious case has
been recorded by dr elliott coues58 of a monstrous chicken with a
perfect additional right leg articulated to the left side of the
pelvis goldfish often have supernumerary fins placed on various parts
of their bodies when the tail of a lizard is broken off a double tail
is sometimes reproduced and when the foot of the salamander was
divided longitudinally by bonnet additional digits were occasionally
formed valentin injured the caudal extremity of an embryo and three
days afterwards it produced rudiments of a double pelvis and of double
hindlimbs59 when frogs toads etc are born with their limbs
doubled as sometimes happens the doubling as gervais remarks60
cannot be due to the complete fusion of two embryos with the exception
of the limbs for the larv are limbless the same argument is
applicable61 to certain insects produced with multiple legs or
antenn for these are metamorphosed from apodal or antennless larv
alphonse milneedwards62 has described the curious case of a
crustacean in which one eyepeduncle supported instead of a complete
eye only an imperfect cornea and out of the centre of this a portion
of an antenna was developed a case has been recorded63 of a man who
had during both dentitions a double tooth in place of the left second
incisor and he inherited this peculiarity from his paternal
grandfather several cases are known64 of additional teeth having
been developed in the orbit of the eye and more especially with
horses in the palate hairs occasionally appear in strange situations
as within the substance of the brain65 certain breeds of sheep
bear a whole crowd of horns on their foreheads as many as five spurs
have been seen on both legs of certain gamefowls in the polish fowl
the male is ornamented with a topknot of hackles like those on his
neck whilst the female has a topknot formed of common feathers in
featherfooted pigeons and fowls feathers like those on the wing arise
from the outer side of the legs and toes even the elemental parts of
the same feather may be transposed for in the sebastopol goose
barbules are developed on the divided filaments of the shaft imperfect
nails sometimes appear on the stumps of the amputated fingers of
man66 and it is an interesting fact that with the snakelike
saurians which present a series with more and more imperfect limbs
the terminations of the phalanges first disappear the nails becoming
transferred to their proximal remnants or even to parts which are not
phalanges67
analogous cases are of such frequent occurrence with plants that they
do not strike us with sufficient surprise supernumerary petals
stamens and pistils are often produced i have seen a leaflet low
down in the compound leaf of vicia sativa replaced by a tendril and
a tendril possesses many peculiar properties such as spontaneous
movement and irritability the calyx sometimes assumes either wholly
or by stripes the colour and texture of the corolla stamens are so
frequently converted into petals more or less completely that such
cases are passed over as not deserving notice but as petals have
special functions to perform namely to protect the included organs
to attract insects and in not a few cases to guide their entrance by
welladapted contrivances we can hardly account for the conversion of
stamens into petals merely by unnatural or superfluous nourishment
again the edge of a petal may occasionally be found including one of
the highest products of the plant namely pollen for instance i have
seen the pollenmass of an ophrys which is a very complex structure
developed in the edge of an upper petal the segments of the calyx of
the common pea have been observed partially converted into carpels
including ovules and with their tips converted into stigmas mr
salter and dr maxwell masters have found pollen within the ovules of
the passionflower and of the rose buds may be developed in the most
unnatural positions as on the petal of a flower numerous analogous
facts could be given68
i do not know how physiologists look at such facts as the foregoing
according to the doctrine of pangenesis the gemmules of the transposed
organs become developed in the wrong place from uniting with wrong
cells or aggregates of cells during their nascent state and this would
follow from a slight modification in their elective affinities nor
ought we to feel much surprise at the affinities of cells and gemmules
varying when we remember the many curious cases given in the
seventeenth chapter of plants which absolutely refuse to be fertilised
by their own pollen though abundantly fertile with that of any other
individual of the same species and in some cases only with that of a
distinct species it is manifest that the sexual elective affinities of
such plantsto use the term employed by grtnerhave been modified as
the cells of adjoining or homologous parts will have nearly the same
nature they will be particularly liable to acquire by variation each
others elective affinities and we can thus understand to a certain
extent such cases as a crowd of horns on the heads of certain sheep of
several spurs on the legs of fowls hacklelike feathers on the heads
of the males of other fowls and with the pigeon winglike feathers on
their legs and membrane between their toes for the leg is the
homologue of the wing as all the organs of plants are homologous and
spring from a common axis it is natural that they should be eminently
liable to transposition it ought to be observed that when any compound
part such as an additional limb or an antenna springs from a false
position it is only necessary that the few first gemmules should be
wrongly attached for these whilst developing would attract other
gemmules in due succession as in the regrowth of an amputated limb
when parts which are homologous and similar in structure as the
vertebr of snakes or the stamens of polyandrous flowers etc are
repeated many times in the same organism closely allied gemmules must
be extremely numerous as well as the points to which they ought to
become united and in accordance with the foregoing views we can to a
certain extent understand isid geoffroy sainthilaires law that
parts which are already multiple are extremely liable to vary in
number
variability often depends as i have attempted to show on the
reproductive organs being injuriously affected by changed conditions
and in this case the gemmules derived from the various parts of the
body are probably aggregated in an irregular manner some superfluous
and others deficient whether a superabundance of gemmules would lead
to the increased size of any part cannot be told but we can see that
their partial deficiency without necessarily leading to the entire
abortion of the part might cause considerable modifications for in
the same manner as plants if their own pollen be excluded are easily
hybridised so in the case of cells if the properly succeeding
gemmules were absent they would probably combine easily with other and
allied gemmules as we have just seen with transposed parts
in variations caused by the direct action of changed conditions of
which several instances have been given certain parts of the body are
directly affected by the new conditions and consequently throw off
modified gemmules which are transmitted to the offspring on any
ordinary view it is unintelligible how changed conditions whether
acting on the embryo the young or the adult can cause inherited
modifications it is equally or even more unintelligible on any
ordinary view how the effects of the longcontinued use or disuse of a
part or of changed habits of body or mind can be inherited a more
perplexing problem can hardly be proposed but on our view we have only
to suppose that certain cells become at last structurally modified and
that these throw off similarly modified gemmules this may occur at any
period of development and the modification will be inherited at a
corresponding period for the modified gemmules will unite in all
ordinary cases with the proper preceding cells and will consequently
be developed at the same period at which the modification first arose
with respect to mental habits or instincts we are so profoundly
ignorant of the relation between the brain and the power of thought
that we do not know positively whether a fixed habit induces any change
in the nervous system though this seems highly probable but when such
habit or other mental attribute or insanity is inherited we must
believe that some actual modification is transmitted69 and this
implies according to our hypothesis that gemmules derived from
modified nervecells are transmitted to the offspring
it is generally necessary that an organism should be exposed during
several generations to changed conditions or habits in order that any
modification thus acquired should appear in the offspring this may be
partly due to the changes not being at first marked enough to catch
attention but this explanation is insufficient and i can account for
the fact only by the assumption which we shall see under the head of
reversion is strongly supported that gemmules derived from each
unmodified unit or part are transmitted in large numbers to successive
generations and that the gemmules derived from the same unit after it
has been modified go on multiplying under the same favourable
conditions which first caused the modification until at last they
become sufficiently numerous to overpower and supplant the old
gemmules
a difficulty may be here noticed we have seen that there is an
important difference in the frequency though not in the nature of the
variations in plants propagated by sexual and asexual generation as
far as variability depends on the imperfect action of the reproductive
organs under changed conditions we can at once see why plants
propagated asexually should be far less variable than those propagated
sexually with respect to the direct action of changed conditions we
know that organisms produced from buds do not pass through the earlier
phases of development they will therefore not be exposed at that
period of life when structure is most readily modified to the various
causes inducing variability in the same manner as are embryos and young
larval forms but whether this is a sufficient explanation i know not
with respect to variations due to reversion there is a similar
difference between plants propagated from buds and seeds many
varieties can be propagated securely by buds but generally or
invariably revert to their parentforms by seed so also hybridised
plants can be multiplied to any extent by buds but are continually
liable to reversion by seedthat is to the loss of their hybrid or
intermediate character i can offer no satisfactory explanation of
these facts plants with variegated leaves phloxes with striped
flowers barberries with seedless fruit can all be securely propagated
by buds taken from the stem or branches but buds from the roots of
these plants almost invariably lose their character and revert to their
former condition this latter fact is also inexplicable unless buds
developed from the roots are as distinct from those on the stem as is
one bud on the stem from another and we know that these latter behave
like independent organisms
finally we see that on the hypothesis of pangenesis variability
depends on at least two distinct groups of causes firstly the
deficiency superabundance and transposition of gemmules and the
redevelopment of those which have long been dormant the gemmules
themselves not having undergone any modification and such changes will
amply account for much fluctuating variability secondly the direct
action of changed conditions on the organisation and of the increased
use or disuse of parts and in this case the gemmules from the modified
units will be themselves modified and when sufficiently multiplied
will supplant the old gemmules and be developed into new structures
turning now to the laws of inheritance if we suppose a homogeneous
gelatinous protozoon to vary and assume a reddish colour a minute
separated particle would naturally as it grew to full size retain the
same colour and we should have the simplest form of inheritance70
precisely the same view may be extended to the infinitely numerous and
diversified units of which the whole body of one of the higher animals
is composed the separated particles being our gemmules we have
already sufficiently discussed by implication the important principle
of inheritance at corresponding ages inheritance as limited by sex and
by the season of the year for instance with animals becoming white in
winter is intelligible if we may believe that the elective affinities
of the units of the body are slightly different in the two sexes
especially at maturity and in one or both sexes at different seasons
so that they unite with different gemmules it should be remembered
that in the discussion on the abnormal transposition of organs we
have seen reason to believe that such elective affinities are readily
modified but i shall soon have to recur to sexual and seasonal
inheritance these several laws are therefore explicable to a large
extent through pangenesis and on no other hypothesis which has as yet
been advanced
but it appears at first sight a fatal objection to our hypothesis that
a part or organ may be removed during several successive generations
and if the operation be not followed by disease the lost part
reappears in the offspring dogs and horses formerly had their tails
docked during many generations without any inherited effect although
as we have seen there is some reason to believe that the tailless
condition of certain sheepdogs is due to such inheritance
circumcision has been practised by the jews from a remote period and
in most cases the effects of the operation are not visible in the
offspring though some maintain that an inherited effect does
occasionally appear if inheritance depends on the presence of
disseminated gemmules derived from all the units of the body why does
not the amputation or mutilation of a part especially if effected on
both sexes invariably affect the offspring the answer in accordance
with our hypothesis probably is that gemmules multiply and are
transmitted during a long series of generationsas we see in the
reappearance of zebrine stripes on the horsein the reappearance of
muscles and other structures in man which are proper to his lowly
organised progenitors and in many other such cases therefore the
longcontinued inheritance of a part which has been removed during many
generations is no real anomaly for gemmules formerly derived from the
part are multiplied and transmitted from generation to generation
we have as yet spoken only of the removal of parts when not followed
by morbid action but when the operation is thus followed it is
certain that the deficiency is sometimes inherited in a former chapter
instances were given as of a cow the loss of whose horn was followed
by suppuration and her calves were destitute of a horn on the same
side of their heads but the evidence which admits of no doubt is that
given by brownsquard with respect to guineapigs which after their
sciatic nerves had been divided gnawed off their own gangrenous toes
and the toes of their offspring were deficient in at least thirteen
instances on the corresponding feet the inheritance of the lost part
in several of these cases is all the more remarkable as only one parent
was affected but we know that a congenital deficiency is often
transmitted from one parent alonefor instance the offspring of
hornless cattle of either sex when crossed with perfect animals are
often hornless how then in accordance with our hypothesis can we
account for mutilations being sometimes strongly inherited if they are
followed by diseased action the answer probably is that all the
gemmules of the mutilated or amputated part are gradually attracted to
the diseased surface during the reparative process and are there
destroyed by the morbid action
a few words must be added on the complete abortion of organs when a
part becomes diminished by disuse prolonged during many generations
the principle of economy of growth together with intercrossing will
tend to reduce it still further as previously explained but this will
not account for the complete or almost complete obliteration of for
instance a minute papilla of cellular tissue representing a pistil or
of a microscopically minute nodule of bone representing a tooth in
certain cases of suppression not yet completed in which a rudiment
occasionally reappears through reversion dispersed gemmules derived
from this part must according to our view still exist we must
therefore suppose that the cells in union with which the rudiment was
formerly developed fail in their affinity for such gemmules except in
the occasional cases of reversion but when the abortion is complete
and final the gemmules themselves no doubt perish nor is this in any
way improbable for though a vast number of active and longdormant
gemmules are nourished in each living creature yet there must be some
limit to their number and it appears natural that gemmules derived
from reduced and useless parts would be more liable to perish than
those freshly derived from other parts which are still in full
functional activity
the last subject that need be discussed namely reversion rests on
the principle that transmission and development though generally
acting in conjunction are distinct powers and the transmission of
gemmules with their subsequent development shows us how this is
possible we plainly see the distinction in the many cases in which a
grandfather transmits to his grandson through his daughter characters
which she does not or cannot possess but before proceeding it will
be advisable to say a few words about latent or dormant characters
most or perhaps all of the secondary characters which appertain to
one sex lie dormant in the other sex that is gemmules capable of
development into the secondary male sexual characters are included
within the female and conversely female characters in the male we
have evidence of this in certain masculine characters both corporeal
and mental appearing in the female when her ovaria are diseased or
when they fail to act from old age in like manner female characters
appear in castrated males as in the shape of the horns of the ox and
in the absence of horns in castrated stags even a slight change in the
conditions of life due to confinement sometimes suffices to prevent the
development of masculine characters in male animals although their
reproductive organs are not permanently injured in the many cases in
which masculine characters are periodically renewed these are latent
at other seasons inheritance as limited by sex and season being here
combined again masculine characters generally lie dormant in male
animals until they arrive at the proper age for reproduction the
curious case formerly given of a hen which assumed the masculine
characters not of her own breed but of a remote progenitor
illustrates the close connection between latent sexual characters and
ordinary reversion
with those animals and plants which habitually produce several forms
as with certain butterflies described by mr wallace in which three
female forms and one male form coexist or as with the trimorphic
species of lythrum and oxalis gemmules capable of reproducing these
different forms must be latent in each individual
insects are occasionally produced with one side or one quarter of their
bodies like that of the male with the other half or threequarters
like that of the female in such cases the two sides are sometimes
wonderfully different in structure and are separated from each other
by a sharp line as gemmules derived from every part are present in
each individual of both sexes it must be the elective affinities of
the nascent cells which in these cases differ abnormally on the two
sides of the body almost the same principle comes into play with those
animals for instance certain gasteropods and verruca amongst
cirripedes which normally have the two sides of the body constructed
on a very different plan and yet a nearly equal number of individuals
have either side modified in the same remarkable manner
reversion in the ordinary sense of the word acts so incessantly that
it evidently forms an essential part of the general law of inheritance
it occurs with beings however propagated whether by buds or seminal
generation and sometimes may be observed with advancing age even in
the same individual the tendency to reversion is often induced by a
change of conditions and in the plainest manner by crossing crossed
forms of the first generation are generally nearly intermediate in
character between their two parents but in the next generation the
offspring commonly revert to one or both of their grandparents and
occasionally to more remote ancestors how can we account for these
facts each unit in a hybrid must throw off according to the doctrine
of pangenesis an abundance of hybridised gemmules for crossed plants
can be readily and largely propagated by buds but by the same
hypothesis dormant gemmules derived from both pure parentforms are
likewise present and as these gemmules retain their normal condition
they would it is probable be enabled to multiply largely during the
lifetime of each hybrid consequently the sexual elements of a hybrid
will include both pure and hybridised gemmules and when two hybrids
pair the combination of pure gemmules derived from the one hybrid with
the pure gemmules of the same parts derived from the other would
necessarily lead to complete reversion of character and it is
perhaps not too bold a supposition that unmodified and undeteriorated
gemmules of the same nature would be especially apt to combine pure
gemmules in combination with hybridised gemmules would lead to partial
reversion and lastly hybridised gemmules derived from both
parenthybrids would simply reproduce the original hybrid form71 all
these cases and degrees of reversion incessantly occur
it was shown in the fifteenth chapter that certain characters are
antagonistic to each other or do not readily blend hence when two
animals with antagonistic characters are crossed it might well happen
that a sufficiency of gemmules in the male alone for the reproduction
of his peculiar characters and in the female alone for the
reproduction of her peculiar characters would not be present and in
this case dormant gemmules derived from the same part in some remote
progenitor might easily gain the ascendancy and cause the reappearance
of the longlost character for instance when black and white pigeons
or black and white fowls are crossedcolours which do not readily
blendblue plumage in the one case evidently derived from the
rockpigeon and red plumage in the other case derived from the wild
junglecock occasionally reappear with uncrossed breeds the same
result follows under conditions which favour the multiplication and
development of certain dormant gemmules as when animals become feral
and revert to their pristine character a certain number of gemmules
being requisite for the development of each character as is known to
be the case from several spermatozoa or pollengrains being necessary
for fertilisation and time favouring their multiplication will
perhaps account for the curious cases insisted on by mr sedgwick of
certain diseases which regularly appear in alternate generations this
likewise holds good more or less strictly with other weakly inherited
modifications hence as i have heard it remarked certain diseases
appear to gain strength by the intermission of a generation the
transmission of dormant gemmules during many successive generations is
hardly in itself more improbable as previously remarked than the
retention during many ages of rudimentary organs or even only of a
tendency to the production of a rudiment but there is no reason to
suppose that dormant gemmules can be transmitted and propagated for
ever excessively minute and numerous as they are believed to be an
infinite number derived during a long course of modification and
descent from each unit of each progenitor could not be supported or
nourished by the organism but it does not seem improbable that certain
gemmules under favourable conditions should be retained and go on
multiplying for a much longer period than others finally on the view
here given we certainly gain some insight into the wonderful fact that
the child may depart from the type of both its parents and resemble
its grandparents or ancestors removed by many hundreds of generations
      conclusion
the hypothesis of pangenesis as applied to the several great classes
of facts just discussed no doubt is extremely complex but so are the
facts the chief assumption is that all the units of the body besides
having the universally admitted power of growing by selfdivision
throw off minute gemmules which are dispersed through the system nor
can this assumption be considered as too bold for we know from the
cases of grafthybridisation that formative matter of some kind is
present in the tissues of plants which is capable of combining with
that included in another individual and of reproducing every unit of
the whole organism but we have further to assume that the gemmules
grow multiply and aggregate themselves into buds and the sexual
elements their development depending on their union with other nascent
cells or units they are also believed to be capable of transmission in
a dormant state like seeds in the ground to successive generations
in a highlyorganised animal the gemmules thrown off from each
different unit throughout the body must be inconceivably numerous and
minute each unit of each part as it changes during development and
we know that some insects undergo at least twenty metamorphoses must
throw off its gemmules but the same cells may long continue to
increase by selfdivision and even become modified by absorbing
peculiar nutriment without necessarily throwing off modified gemmules
all organic beings moreover include many dormant gemmules derived
from their grandparents and more remote progenitors but not from all
their progenitors these almost infinitely numerous and minute gemmules
are contained within each bud ovule spermatozoon and pollengrain
such an admission will be declared impossible but number and size are
only relative difficulties independent organisms exist which are
barely visible under the highest powers of the microscope and their
germs must be excessively minute particles of infectious matter so
small as to be wafted by the wind or to adhere to smooth paper will
multiply so rapidly as to infect within a short time the whole body of
a large animal we should also reflect on the admitted number and
minuteness of the molecules composing a particle of ordinary matter
the difficulty therefore which at first appears insurmountable of
believing in the existence of gemmules so numerous and small as they
must be according to our hypothesis has no great weight
the units of the body are generally admitted by physiologists to be
autonomous i go one step further and assume that they throw off
reproductive gemmules thus an organism does not generate its kind as a
whole but each separate unit generates its kind it has often been
said by naturalists that each cell of a plant has the potential
capacity of reproducing the whole plant but it has this power only in
virtue of containing gemmules derived from every part when a cell or
unit is from some cause modified the gemmules derived from it will be
in like manner modified if our hypothesis be provisionally accepted
we must look at all the forms of asexual reproduction whether
occurring at maturity or during youth as fundamentally the same and
dependent on the mutual aggregation and multiplication of the gemmules
the regrowth of an amputated limb and the healing of a wound is the
same process partially carried out buds apparently include nascent
cells belonging to that stage of development at which the budding
occurs and these cells are ready to unite with the gemmules derived
from the next succeeding cells the sexual elements on the other hand
do not include such nascent cells and the male and female elements
taken separately do not contain a sufficient number of gemmules for
independent development except in the cases of parthenogenesis the
development of each being including all the forms of metamorphosis and
metagenesis depends on the presence of gemmules thrown off at each
period of life and on their development at a corresponding period in
union with preceding cells such cells may be said to be fertilised by
the gemmules which come next in due order of development thus the act
of ordinary impregnation and the development of each part in each being
are closely analogous processes the child strictly speaking does not
grow into the man but includes germs which slowly and successively
become developed and form the man in the child as well as in the
adult each part generates the same part inheritance must be looked at
as merely a form of growth like the selfdivision of a lowlyorganised
unicellular organism reversion depends on the transmission from the
forefather to his descendants of dormant gemmules which occasionally
become developed under certain known or unknown conditions each animal
and plant may be compared with a bed of soil full of seeds some of
which soon germinate some lie dormant for a period whilst others
perish when we hear it said that a man carries in his constitution the
seeds of an inherited disease there is much truth in the expression
no other attempt as far as i am aware has been made imperfect as
this confessedly is to connect under one point of view these several
grand classes of facts an organic being is a microcosma little
universe formed of a host of selfpropagating organisms inconceivably
minute and numerous as the stars in heaven

chapter xxviii concluding remarks
domesticationnature and causes of variabilityselectiondivergence and
distinctness of characterextinction of racescircumstances favourable
to selection by manantiquity of certain racesthe question whether
each particular variation has been specially preordained
as summaries have been added to nearly all the chapters and as in the
chapter on pangenesis various subjects such as the forms of
reproduction inheritance reversion the causes and laws of
variability etc have been recently discussed i will here only make
a few general remarks on the more important conclusions which may be
deduced from the multifarious details given throughout this work
savages in all parts of the world easily succeed in taming wild
animals and those inhabiting any country or island when first visited
by man would probably have been still more easily tamed complete
subjugation generally depends on an animal being social in its habits
and on receiving man as the chief of the herd or family in order that
an animal should be domesticated it must be fertile under changed
conditions of life and this is far from being always the case an
animal would not have been worth the labour of domestication at least
during early times unless of service to man from these circumstances
the number of domesticated animals has never been large with respect
to plants i have shown in the ninth chapter how their varied uses were
probably first discovered and the early steps in their cultivation
man could not have known when he first domesticated an animal or
plant whether it would flourish and multiply when transported to other
countries therefore he could not have been thus influenced in his
choice we see that the close adaptation of the reindeer and camel to
extremely cold and hot countries has not prevented their domestication
still less could man have foreseen whether his animals and plants would
vary in succeeding generations and thus give birth to new races and
the small capacity of variability in the goose has not prevented its
domestication from a remote epoch
with extremely few exceptions all animals and plants which have been
long domesticated have varied greatly it matters not under what
climate or for what purpose they are kept whether as food for man or
beast for draught or hunting for clothing or mere pleasureunder all
these circumstances races have been produced which differ more from one
another than do the forms which in a state of nature are ranked as
different species why certain animals and plants have varied more
under domestication than others we do not know any more than why some
are rendered more sterile than others under changed conditions of life
but we have to judge of the amount of variation which our domestic
productions have undergone chiefly by the number and amount of
difference between the races which have been formed and we can often
clearly see why many and distinct races have not been formed namely
because slight successive variations have not been steadily
accumulated and such variations will never be accumulated if an animal
or plant be not closely observed much valued and kept in large
numbers
the fluctuating and as far as we can judge neverending variability
of our domesticated productionsthe plasticity of almost their whole
organisationis one of the most important lessons which we learn from
the numerous details given in the earlier chapters of this work yet
domesticated animals and plants can hardly have been exposed to greater
changes in their conditions of life than have many natural species
during the incessant geological geographical and climatal changes to
which the world has been subject but domesticated productions will
often have been exposed to more sudden changes and to less continuously
uniform conditions as man has domesticated so many animals and plants
belonging to widely different classes and as he certainly did not
choose with prophetic instinct those species which would vary most we
may infer that all natural species if exposed to analogous conditions
would on an average vary to the same degree few men at the present
day will maintain that animals and plants were created with a tendency
to vary which long remained dormant in order that fanciers in after
ages might rear for instance curious breeds of the fowl pigeon or
canarybird
from several causes it is difficult to judge of the amount of
modification which our domestic productions have undergone in some
cases the primitive parentstock has become extinct or it cannot be
recognised with certainty owing to its supposed descendants having
been so much modified in other cases two or more closelyallied forms
after being domesticated have crossed and then it is difficult to
estimate how much of the character of the present descendants ought to
be attributed to variation and how much to the influence of the
several parentstocks but the degree to which our domesticated breeds
have been modified by the crossing of distinct species has probably
been much exaggerated by some authors a few individuals of one form
would seldom permanently affect another form existing in greater
numbers for without careful selection the stain of the foreign blood
would soon be obliterated and during early and barbarous times when
our animals were first domesticated such care would seldom have been
taken
there is good reason to believe in the case of the dog ox pig and of
some other animals that several of our races are descended from
distinct wild prototypes nevertheless the belief in the multiple
origin of our domesticated animals has been extended by some few
naturalists and by many breeders to an unauthorised extent breeders
refuse to look at the whole subject under a single point of view i
have heard it said by a man who maintained that our fowls were
descended from at least halfadozen aboriginal species that the
evidence of the common origin of pigeons ducks and rabbits was of no
avail with respect to fowls breeders overlook the improbability of
many species having been domesticated at an early and barbarous period
they do not consider the improbability of species having existed in a
state of nature which if they resembled our present domestic breeds
would have been highly abnormal in comparison with all their congeners
they maintain that certain species which formerly existed have become
extinct or are now unknown although formerly known the assumption of
so much recent extinction is no difficulty in their eyes for they do
not judge of its probability by the facility or difficulty of the
extinction of other closelyallied wild forms lastly they often
ignore the whole subject of geographical distribution as completely as
if it were the result of chance
although from the reasons just assigned it is often difficult to judge
accurately of the amount of change which our domesticated productions
have undergone yet this can be ascertained in the cases in which all
the breeds are known to be descended from a single speciesas with the
pigeon duck rabbit and almost certainly with the fowl and by the
aid of analogy this can be judged of to a certain extent with
domesticated animals descended from several wild stocks it is
impossible to read the details given in the earlier chapters and in
many published works or to visit our various exhibitions without
being deeply impressed with the extreme variability of our domesticated
animals and cultivated plants no part of the organisation escapes the
tendency to vary the variations generally affect parts of small vital
or physiological importance but so it is with the differences which
exist between closelyallied species in these unimportant characters
there is often a greater difference between the breeds of the same
species than between the natural species of the same genus as isidore
geoffroy has shown to be the case with size and as is often the case
with the colour texture form etc of the hair feathers horns and
other dermal appendages
it has often been asserted that important parts never vary under
domestication but this is a complete error look at the skull of the
pig in any one of the highly improved breeds with the occipital
condyles and other parts greatly modified or look at that of the niata
ox or again in the several breeds of the rabbit observe the
elongated skull with the differently shaped occipital foramen atlas
and other cervical vertebrae the whole shape of the brain together
with the skull has been modified in polish fowls in other breeds of
the fowl the number of the vertebrae and the forms of the cervical
vertebrae have been changed in certain pigeons the shape of the lower
jaw the relative length of the tongue the size of the nostrils and
eyelids the number and shape of the ribs the form and size of the
oesophagus have all varied in certain quadrupeds the length of the
intestines has been much increased or diminished with plants we see
wonderful differences in the stones of various fruits in the
cucurbitaceae several highly important characters have varied such as
the sessile position of the stigmas on the ovarium the position of the
carpels and the projection of the ovarium out of the receptacle but
it would be useless to run through the many facts given in the earlier
chapters
it is notorious how greatly the mental disposition tastes habits
consensual movements loquacity or silence and tone of voice have
varied and been inherited in our domesticated animals the dog offers
the most striking instance of changed mental attributes and these
differences cannot be accounted for by descent from distinct wild
types
new characters may appear and old ones disappear at any stage of
development being inherited at a corresponding stage we see this in
the difference between the eggs the down on the chickens and the first
plumage of the various breeds of the fowl and still more plainly in
the differences between the caterpillars and cocoons of the various
breeds of the silkmoth these facts simple as they appear throw
light on the differences between the larval and adult states of allied
natural species and on the whole great subject of embryology new
characters first appearing late in life are apt to become attached
exclusively to that sex in which they first arose or they may be
developed in a much higher degree in this than in the other sex or
again after having become attached to one sex they may be transferred
to the opposite sex these facts and more especially the circumstance
that new characters seem to be particularly liable from some unknown
cause to become attached to the male sex have an important bearing on
the acquirement of secondary sexual characters by animals in a state of
nature
it has sometimes been said that our domestic races do not differ in
constitutional peculiarities but this cannot be maintained in our
improved cattle pigs etc the period of maturity including that of
the second dentition has been much hastened the period of gestation
varies much and has been modified in a fixed manner in one or two
cases in some breeds of poultry and pigeons the period at which the
down and the first plumage are acquired differs the number of moults
through which the larvae of silkmoths pass varies the tendency to
fatten to yield much milk to produce many young or eggs at a birth or
during life differs in different breeds we find different degrees of
adaptation to climate and different tendencies to certain diseases to
the attacks of parasites and to the action of certain vegetable
poisons with plants adaptation to certain soils the power of
resisting frost the period of flowering and fruiting the duration of
life the period of shedding the leaves or of retaining them throughout
the winter the proportion and nature of certain chemical compounds in
the tissues or seeds all vary
there is however one important constitutional difference between
domestic races and species i refer to the sterility which almost
invariably follows in a greater or less degree when species are
crossed and to the perfect fertility of the most distinct domestic
races with the exception of a very few plants when similarly crossed
it is certainly a most remarkable fact that many closelyallied
species which in appearance differ extremely little should yield when
crossed only a few more or less sterile offspring or none at all
whilst domestic races which differ conspicuously from each other are
when united remarkably fertile and yield perfectly fertile offspring
but this fact is not in reality so inexplicable as it at first appears
in the first place it was clearly shown in the nineteenth chapter that
the sterility of crossed species does not depend chiefly on differences
in their external structure or general constitution but on differences
in the reproductive system analogous to those which cause the lessened
fertility of the illegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic
plants in the second place the pallasian doctrine that species after
having been long domesticated lose their natural tendency to sterility
when crossed has been shown to be highly probable or almost certain
we cannot avoid this conclusion when we reflect on the parentage and
present fertility of the several breeds of the dog of the indian or
humped and european cattle and of the two chief kinds of pigs hence
it would be unreasonable to expect that races formed under
domestication should acquire sterility when crossed whilst at the same
time we admit that domestication eliminates the normal sterility of
crossed species why with closelyallied species their reproductive
systems should almost invariably have been modified in so peculiar a
manner as to be mutually incapable of acting on each otherthough in
unequal degrees in the two sexes as shown by the difference in
fertility between reciprocal crosses of the same specieswe do not
know but may with much probability infer the cause to be as follows
most natural species have been habituated to nearly uniform conditions
of life for an incomparably longer time than have domestic races and
we positively know that changed conditions exert an especial and
powerful influence on the reproductive system hence this difference
may well account for the difference in the power of reproduction
between domestic races when crossed and species when crossed it is
probably in chief part owing to the same cause that domestic races can
be suddenly transported from one climate to another or placed under
widely different conditions and yet retain in most cases their
fertility unimpaired whilst a multitude of species subjected to lesser
changes are rendered incapable of breeding
the offspring of crossed domestic races and of crossed species resemble
each other in most respects with the one important exception of
fertility they often partake in the same unequal degree of the
characters of their parents one of which is often prepotent over the
other and they are liable to reversion of the same kind by successive
crosses one species may be made to absorb completely another and so it
notoriously is with races the latter resemble species in many other
ways they sometimes inherit their newlyacquired characters almost or
even quite as firmly as species the conditions leading to variability
and the laws governing its nature appear to be the same in both
varieties can be classed in groups under groups like species under
genera and these under families and orders and the classification may
be either artificialthat is founded on any arbitrary characteror
natural with varieties a natural classification is certainly founded
and with species is apparently founded on community of descent
together with the amount of modification which the forms have
undergone the characters by which domestic varieties differ from one
another are more variable than those distinguishing species though
hardly more so than with certain polymorphic species but this greater
degree of variability is not surprising as varieties have generally
been exposed within recent times to fluctuating conditions of life and
are much more liable to have been crossed they are also in many cases
still undergoing or have recently undergone modification by mans
methodical or unconscious selection
domestic varieties as a general rule certainly differ from one another
in less important parts than do species and when important differences
occur they are seldom firmly fixed but this fact is intelligible if
we consider mans method of selection in the living animal or plant he
cannot observe internal modifications in the more important organs nor
does he regard them as long as they are compatible with health and
life what does the breeder care about any slight change in the molar
teeth of his pigs or for an additional molar tooth in the dog or for
any change in the intestinal canal or other internal organ the breeder
cares for the flesh of his cattle being well marbled with fat and for
an accumulation of fat within the abdomen of his sheep and this he has
effected what would the floriculturist care for any change in the
structure of the ovarium or of the ovules as important internal organs
are certainly liable to numerous slight variations and as these would
probably be transmitted for many strange monstrosities are inherited
man could undoubtedly effect a certain amount of change in these
organs when he has produced any modification in an important part he
has generally done so unintentionally in correlation with some other
conspicuous part for instance he has given ridges and protuberances
to the skulls of fowls by attending to the form of the comb or to the
plume of feathers on the head by attending to the external form of the
pouterpigeon he has enormously increased the size of the oesophagus
and has added to the number of the ribs and given them greater
breadth with the carrierpigeon by increasing through steady
selection the wattles on the upper mandible he has greatly modified
the form of the lower mandible and so in many other cases natural
species on the other hand have been modified exclusively for their
own good to fit them for infinitely diversified conditions of life to
avoid enemies of all kinds and to struggle against a host of
competitors hence under such complex conditions it would often
happen that modifications of the most varied kinds in important as
well as in unimportant parts would be advantageous or even necessary
and they would slowly but surely be acquired through the survival of
the fittest still more important is the fact that various indirect
modifications would likewise arise through the law of correlated
variation
domestic breeds often have an abnormal or semimonstrous character as
amongst dogs the italian greyhound bulldog blenheim spaniel and
bloodhoundsome breeds of cattle and pigsseveral breeds of the
fowland the chief breeds of the pigeon in such abnormal breeds
parts which differ but slightly or not at all in the allied natural
species have been greatly modified this may be accounted for by mans
often selecting especially at first conspicuous and semimonstrous
deviations of structure we should however be cautious in deciding
what deviations ought to be called monstrous there can hardly be a
doubt that if the brush of horselike hair on the breast of the
turkeycock had first appeared in the domesticated bird it would have
been considered as a monstrosity the great plume of feathers on the
head of the polish cock has been thus designated though plumes are
common on the heads of many kinds of birds we might call the wattle or
corrugated skin round the base of the beak of the english
carrierpigeon a monstrosity but we do not thus speak of the globular
fleshy excrescence at the base of the beak of the carpophaga
oceanica
some authors have drawn a wide distinction between artificial and
natural breeds although in extreme cases the distinction is plain in
many other cases it is arbitrary the difference depending chiefly on
the kind of selection which has been applied artificial breeds are
those which have been intentionally improved by man they frequently
have an unnatural appearance and are especially liable to lose their
characters through reversion and continued variability the socalled
natural breeds on the other hand are those which are found in
semicivilised countries and which formerly inhabited separate
districts in nearly all the european kingdoms they have been rarely
acted on by mans intentional selection more frequently by unconscious
selection and partly by natural selection for animals kept in
semicivilised countries have to provide largely for their own wants
such natural breeds will also have been directly acted on by the
differences though slight in the surrounding conditions
there is a much more important distinction between our several breeds
namely in some having originated from a stronglymarked or
semimonstrous deviation of structure which however may subsequently
have been augmented by selection whilst others have been formed in so
slow and insensible a manner that if we could see their early
progenitors we should hardly be able to say when or how the breed first
arose from the history of the racehorse greyhound gamecock etc
and from their general appearance we may feel nearly confident that
they were formed by a slow process of improvement and we know that
this has been the case with the carrierpigeon as well as with some
other pigeons on the other hand it is certain that the ancon and
mauchamp breeds of sheep and almost certain that the niata cattle
turnspit and pugdogs jumper and frizzled fowls shortfaced tumbler
pigeons hookbilled ducks etc suddenly appeared in nearly the same
state as we now see them so it has been with many cultivated plants
the frequency of these cases is likely to lead to the false belief that
natural species have often originated in the same abrupt manner but we
have no evidence of the appearance or at least of the continued
procreation under nature of abrupt modifications of structure and
various general reasons could be assigned against such a belief
on the other hand we have abundant evidence of the constant occurrence
under nature of slight individual differences of the most diversified
kinds and we are thus led to conclude that species have generally
originated by the natural selection of extremely slight differences
this process may be strictly compared with the slow and gradual
improvement of the racehorse greyhound and gamecock as every detail
of structure in each species has to be closely adapted to its habits of
life it will rarely happen that one part alone will be modified but
as was formerly shown the coadapted modifications need not be
absolutely simultaneous many variations however are from the first
connected by the law of correlation hence it follows that even
closelyallied species rarely or never differ from one another by one
character alone and the same remark is to a certain extent applicable
to domestic races for these if they differ much generally differ in
many respects
some naturalists boldly insist1 that species are absolutely distinct
productions never passing by intermediate links into one another
whilst they maintain that domestic varieties can always be connected
either with one another or with their parentforms but if we could
always find the links between the several breeds of the dog horse
cattle sheep pigs etc there would not have been such incessant
doubts whether they were descended from one or several species the
greyhound genus if such a term may be used cannot be closely
connected with any other breed unless perhaps we go back to the
ancient egyptian monuments our english bulldog also forms a very
distinct breed in all these cases crossed breeds must of course be
excluded for distinct natural species can thus be likewise connected
by what links can the cochin fowl be closely united with others by
searching for breeds still preserved in distant lands and by going
back to historical records tumblerpigeons carriers and barbs can be
closely connected with the parent rockpigeon but we cannot thus
connect the turbit or the pouter the degree of distinctness between
the various domestic breeds depends on the amount of modification which
they have undergone and more especially on the neglect and final
extinction of intermediate and lessvalued forms
it has often been argued that no light is thrown on the changes which
natural species are believed to undergo from the admitted changes of
domestic races as the latter are said to be mere temporary
productions always reverting as soon as they become feral to their
pristine form this argument has been well combated by mr wallace2
and full details were given in the thirteenth chapter showing that the
tendency to reversion in feral animals and plants has been greatly
exaggerated though no doubt it exists to a certain extent it would be
opposed to all the principles inculcated in this work if domestic
animals when exposed to new conditions and compelled to struggle for
their own wants against a host of foreign competitors were not
modified in the course of time it should also be remembered that many
characters lie latent in all organic beings ready to be evolved under
fitting conditions and in breeds modified within recent times the
tendency to reversion is particularly strong but the antiquity of some
of our breeds clearly proves that they remain nearly constant as long
as their conditions of life remain the same
it has been boldly maintained by some authors that the amount of
variation to which our domestic productions are liable is strictly
limited but this is an assertion resting on little evidence whether
or not the amount of change in any particular direction is limited the
tendency to general variability is as far as we can judge unlimited
cattle sheep and pigs have varied under domestication from the
remotest period as shown by the researches of rutimeyer and others
yet these animals have been improved to an unparalleled degree within
quite recent times and this implies continued variability of
structure wheat as we know from the remains found in the swiss
lakedwellings is one of the most anciently cultivated plants yet at
the present day new and better varieties frequently arise it may be
that an ox will never be produced of larger size and finer proportions
or a racehorse fleeter than our present animals or a gooseberry
larger than the london variety but he would be a bold man who would
assert that the extreme limit in these respects has been finally
attained with flowers and fruit it has repeatedly been asserted that
perfection has been reached but the standard has soon been excelled a
breed of pigeons may never be produced with a beak shorter than that of
the present shortfaced tumbler or with one longer than that of the
english carrier for these birds have weak constitutions and are bad
breeders but shortness and length of beak are the points which have
been steadily improved during the last 150 years and some of the best
judges deny that the goal has yet been reached from reasons which
could be assigned it is probable that parts which have now reached
their maximum development might after remaining constant during a
long period vary again in the direction of increase under new
conditions of life but there must be as mr wallace has remarked with
much truth3 a limit to change in certain directions both with
natural and domestic productions for instance there must be a limit
to the fleetness of any terrestrial animal as this will be determined
by the friction to be overcome the weight to be carried and the power
of contraction in the muscular fibres the english racehorse may have
reached this limit but it already surpasses in fleetness its own wild
progenitor and all other equine species the shortfaced tumblerpigeon
has a beak shorter and the carrier a beak longer relatively to the
size of their bodies than that of any natural species of the family
our apples pears and gooseberries bear larger fruit than those of any
natural species of the same genera and so in many other cases
it is not surprising seeing the great difference between many domestic
breeds that some few naturalists have concluded that each is descended
from a distinct aboriginal stock more especially as the principle of
selection has been ignored and the high antiquity of man as a breeder
of animals has only recently become known most naturalists however
freely admit that our various breeds however dissimilar are descended
from a single stock although they do not know much about the art of
breeding cannot show the connecting links nor say where and when the
breeds arose yet these same naturalists declare with an air of
philosophical caution that they will never admit that one natural
species has given birth to another until they behold all the
transitional steps fanciers use exactly the same language with respect
to domestic breeds thus an author of an excellent treatise on pigeons
says he will never allow that the carrier and fantail are the
descendants of the wild rockpigeon until the transitions have
actually been observed and can be repeated whenever man chooses to
set about the task no doubt it is difficult to realise that slight
changes added up during long centuries can produce such great results
but he who wishes to understand the origin of domestic breeds or of
natural species must overcome this difficulty
the causes which excite and the laws which govern variability have been
discussed so lately that i need here only enumerate the leading
points as domesticated organisms are much more liable to slight
deviations of structure and to monstrosities than species living under
their natural conditions and as widelyranging species generally vary
more than those which inhabit restricted areas we may infer that
variability mainly depends on changed conditions of life we must not
overlook the effects of the unequal combination of the characters
derived from both parents or reversion to former progenitors changed
conditions have an especial tendency to render the reproductive organs
more or less impotent as shown in the chapter devoted to this subject
and these organs consequently often fail to transmit faithfully the
parental characters changed conditions also act directly and
definitely on the organisation so that all or nearly all the
individuals of the same species thus exposed become modified in the
same manner but why this or that part is especially affected we can
seldom or ever say in most cases however a change in the conditions
seems to act indefinitely causing diversified variations in nearly the
same manner as exposure to cold or the absorption of the same poison
affects different individuals in different ways we have reason to
suspect that an habitual excess of highlynutritious food or an excess
relatively to the wear and tear of the organisation from exercise is a
powerful exciting cause of variability when we see the symmetrical and
complex outgrowths caused by a minute drop of the poison of a
gallinsect we may believe that slight changes in the chemical nature
of the sap or blood would lead to extraordinary modifications of
structure
the increased use of a muscle with its various attached parts and the
increased activity of a gland or other organ lead to their increased
development disuse has a contrary effect with domesticated
productions although their organs sometimes become rudimentary through
abortion we have no reason to suppose that this has ever followed
solely from disuse with natural species on the contrary many organs
appear to have been rendered rudimentary through disuse aided by the
principle of the economy of growth together with intercrossing
complete abortion can be accounted for only by the hypothesis given in
the last chapter namely the final destruction of the germs or
gemmules of useless parts this difference between species and domestic
varieties may be partly accounted for by disuse having acted on the
latter for an insufficient length of time and partly from their
exemption from any severe struggle for existence entailing rigid
economy in the development of each part to which all species under
nature are subjected nevertheless the law of compensation or
balancement which likewise depends on the economy of growth
apparently has affected to a certain extent our domesticated
productions
as almost every part of the organisation becomes highly variable under
domestication and as variations are easily selected both consciously
and unconsciously it is very difficult to distinguish between the
effects of the selection of indefinite variations and the direct action
of the conditions of life for instance it is possible that the feet
of our waterdogs and of the american dogs which have to travel much
over the snow may have become partially webbed from the stimulus of
widely extending their toes but it is more probable that the webbing
like the membrane between the toes of certain pigeons spontaneously
appeared and was afterwards increased by the best swimmers and the best
snowtravellers being preserved during many generations a fancier who
wished to decrease the size of his bantams or tumblerpigeons would
never think of starving them but would select the smallest individuals
which spontaneously appeared quadrupeds are sometimes born destitute
of hair and hairless breeds have been formed but there is no reason to
believe that this is caused by a hot climate within the tropics heat
often causes sheep to lose their fleeces on the other hand wet and
cold act as a direct stimulus to the growth of hair but who will
pretend to decide how far the thick fur of arctic animals or their
white colour is due to the direct action of a severe climate and how
far to the preservation of the bestprotected individuals during a long
succession of generations
of all the laws governing variability that of correlation is one of
the most important in many cases of slight deviations of structure as
well as of grave monstrosities we cannot even conjecture what is the
nature of the bond of connexion but between homologous partsbetween
the fore and hind limbsbetween the hair hoofs horns and teethwhich
are closely similar during their early development and which are
exposed to similar conditions we can see that they would be eminently
liable to be modified in the same manner homologous parts from having
the same nature are apt to blend together and when many exist to
vary in number
although every variation is either directly or indirectly caused by
some change in the surrounding conditions we must never forget that
the nature of the organisation which is acted on is by far the more
important factor in the result we see this in different organisms
which when placed under similar conditions vary in a different manner
whilst closelyallied organisms under dissimilar conditions often vary
in nearly the same manner we see this in the same modification
frequently reappearing in the same variety at long intervals of time
and likewise in the several striking cases given of analogous or
parallel variations although some of these latter cases are due to
reversion others cannot thus be accounted for
from the indirect action of changed conditions on the organisation
owing to the reproductive organs being thus affectedfrom the direct
action of such conditions and these will cause the individuals of the
same species either to vary in the same manner or differently in
accordance with slight differences in their constitutionfrom the
effects of the increased or decreased use of partsand from
correlationthe variability of our domesticated productions is
complicated to an extreme degree the whole organisation becomes
slightly plastic although each modification must have its own exciting
cause and though each is subjected to law yet we can so rarely trace
the precise relation between cause and effect that we are tempted to
speak of variations as if they arose spontaneously we may even call
them accidental but this must be only in the sense in which we say
that a fragment of rock dropped from a height owes its shape to
accident
it may be worth while briefly to consider the result of the exposure to
unnatural conditions of a large number of animals of the same species
and allowed to cross freely with no selection of any kind and
afterwards to consider the result when selection is brought into play
let us suppose that 500 wild rockpigeons were confined in their native
land in an aviary and fed in the same manner as pigeons usually are
and that they were not allowed to increase in number as pigeons
propagate so rapidly i suppose that a thousand or fifteen hundred
birds would have to be annually killed after several generations had
been thus reared we may feel sure that some of the young birds would
vary and the variations would tend to be inherited for at the present
day slight deviations of structure often occur and are inherited it
would be tedious even to enumerate the multitude of points which still
go on varying or have recently varied many variations would occur in
correlation with one another as the length of the wing and tail
feathersthe number of the primary wingfeathers as well as the number
and breadth of the ribs in correlation with the size and form of the
bodythe number of the scutellae with the size of the feetthe length
of the tongue with the length of the beakthe size of the nostrils and
eyelids and the form of lower jaw in correlation with the development
of wattlethe nakedness of the young with the future colour of the
plumagethe size of the feet with that of the beak and other such
points lastly as our birds are supposed to be confined in an aviary
they would use their wings and legs but little and certain parts of
the skeleton such as the sternum scapulae and feet would in
consequence become slightly reduced in size
as in our assumed case many birds have to be indiscriminately killed
every year the chances are against any new variety surviving long
enough to breed and as the variations which arise are of an extremely
diversified nature the chances are very great against two birds
pairing which have varied in the same manner nevertheless a varying
bird even when not thus paired would occasionally transmit its
character to its young and these would not only be exposed to the same
conditions which first caused the variation in question to appear but
would in addition inherit from their modified parent a tendency again
to vary in the same manner so that if the conditions decidedly tended
to induce some particular variation all the birds might in the course
of time become similarly modified but a far commoner result would be
that one bird would vary in one way and another bird in another way
one would be born with a beak a little longer and another with a
shorter beak one would gain some black feathers another some white or
red feathers and as these birds would be continually intercrossing
the final result would be a body of individuals differing from each
other in many ways but only slightly yet more than did the original
rockpigeons but there would not be the least tendency towards the
formation of several distinct breeds
if two separate lots of pigeons were treated in the manner just
described one in england and the other in a tropical country the two
lots being supplied with different kinds of food would they after many
generations differ when we reflect on the cases given in the
twentythird chapter and on such facts as the difference in former
times between the breeds of cattle sheep etc in almost every
district of europe we are strongly inclined to admit that the two lots
would be differently modified through the influence of climate and
food but the evidence on the definite action of changed conditions is
in most cases insufficient and with respect to pigeons i have had
the opportunity of examining a large collection of domesticated kinds
sent to me by sir w elliot from india and they varied in a remarkably
similar manner with our european birds
if two distinct breeds were mingled together in equal numbers there is
reason to suspect that they would to a certain extent prefer pairing
with their own kind but they would often intercross from the greater
vigour and fertility of the crossed offspring the whole body would by
this means become interblended sooner than would otherwise have
occurred from certain breeds being prepotent over others it does not
follow that the interblended progeny would be strictly intermediate in
character i have also proved that the act of crossing in itself
gives a strong tendency to reversion so that the crossed offspring
would tend to revert to the state of the aboriginal rockpigeon and in
the course of time they would probably be not much more heterogeneous
in character than in our first case when birds of the same breed were
confined together
i have just said that the crossed offspring would gain in vigour and
fertility from the facts given in the seventeenth chapter there can be
no doubt of this fact and there can be little doubt though the
evidence on this head is not so easily acquired that longcontinued
close interbreeding leads to evil results with hermaphrodites of all
kinds if the sexual elements of the same individual habitually acted
on each other the closest possible interbreeding would be perpetual
but we should bear in mind that the structure of all hermaphrodite
animals as far as i can learn permits and frequently necessitates a
cross with a distinct individual with hermaphrodite plants we
incessantly meet with elaborate and perfect contrivances for this same
end it is no exaggeration to assert that if the use of the talons and
tusks of a carnivorous animal or of the plumes and hooks on a seed
may be safely inferred from their structure we may with equal safety
infer that many flowers are constructed for the express purpose of
ensuring a cross with a distinct plant from these various
considerations not to mention the result of a long series of
experiments which i have tried the conclusion arrived at in the
chapter just referred tonamely that great good of some kind is
derived from the sexual concourse of distinct individualsmust be
admitted
to return to our illustration we have hitherto assumed that the birds
were kept down to the same number by indiscriminate slaughter but if
the least choice be permitted in their preservation the whole result
will be changed should the owner observe any slight variation in one
of his birds and wish to obtain a breed thus characterised he would
succeed in a surprisingly short time by careful selection as any part
which has once varied generally goes on varying in the same direction
it is easy by continually preserving the most strongly marked
individuals to increase the amount of difference up to a high
predetermined standard of excellence this is methodical selection
if the owner of the aviary without any thought of making a new breed
simply admired for instance shortbeaked more than longbeaked birds
he would when he had to reduce the number generally kill the latter
and there can be no doubt that he would thus in the course of time
sensibly modify his stock it is improbable if two men were to keep
pigeons and act in this manner that they would prefer exactly the same
characters they would as we know often prefer directly opposite
characters and the two lots would ultimately come to differ this has
actually occurred with strains or families of cattle sheep and
pigeons which have been long kept and carefully attended to by
different breeders without any wish on their part to form new and
distinct subbreeds this unconscious kind of selection will more
especially come into action with animals which are highly serviceable
to man for every one tries to get the best dogs horses cows or
sheep without thinking about their future progeny yet these animals
would transmit more or less surely their good qualities to their
offspring nor is any one so careless as to breed from his worst
animals even savages when compelled from extreme want to kill some of
their animals would destroy the worst and preserve the best with
animals kept for use and not for mere amusement different fashions
prevail in different districts leading to the preservation and
consequently to the transmission of all sorts of trifling
peculiarities of character the same process will have been pursued
with our fruittrees and vegetables for the best will always have been
the most largely cultivated and will occasionally have yielded
seedlings better than their parents
the different strains just alluded to which have been actually
produced by breeders without any wish on their part to obtain such a
result afford excellent evidence of the power of unconscious
selection this form of selection has probably led to far more
important results than methodical selection and is likewise more
important under a theoretical point of view from closely resembling
natural selection for during this process the best or most valued
individuals are not separated and prevented from crossing with others
of the same breed but are simply preferred and preserved yet this
inevitably leads to their gradual modification and improvement so that
finally they prevail to the exclusion of the old parentform
with our domesticated animals natural selection checks the production
of races with any injurious deviation of structure in the case of
animals which from being kept by savages or semicivilised people
have to provide largely for their own wants under different
circumstances natural selection will have played a more important
part hence it probably is that they often closely resemble natural
species
as there is no limit to mans desire to possess animals and plants more
and more useful in any respect and as the fancier always wishes owing
to fashions running into extremes to produce each character more and
more strongly pronounced there is through the prolonged action of
methodical and unconscious selection a constant tendency in every
breed to become more and more different from its parentstock and when
several breeds have been produced and are valued for different
qualities to differ more and more from each other this leads to
divergence of character as improved subvarieties and races are slowly
formed the older and less improved breeds are neglected and decrease
in number when few individuals of any breed exist within the same
locality close interbreeding by lessening their vigour and fertility
aids in their final extinction thus the intermediate links are lost
and the remaining breeds gain in distinctness of character
in the chapters on the pigeon it was proved by historical evidence and
by the existence of connecting subvarieties in distant lands that
several breeds have steadily diverged in character and that many old
and intermediate subbreeds have been lost other cases could be
adduced of the extinction of domestic breeds as of the irish wolfdog
the old english hound and of two breeds in france one of which was
formerly highly valued4 mr pickering remarks5 that the sheep
figured on the most ancient egyptian monuments is unknown at the
present day and at least one variety of the bullock formerly known in
egypt has in like manner become extinct so it has been with some
animals and with several plants cultivated by the ancient inhabitants
of europe during the neolithic period in peru von tschudi6 found in
certain tombs apparently prior to the dynasty of the incas two kinds
of maize not now known in the country with our flowers and culinary
vegetables the production of new varieties and their extinction has
incessantly recurred at the present time improved breeds sometimes
displace older breeds at an extraordinarily rapid rate as has recently
occurred throughout england with pigs the longhorn cattle in their
native home were suddenly swept away as if by some murderous
pestilence by the introduction of shorthorns7
what grand results have followed from the longcontinued action of
methodical and unconscious selection regulated to a certain extent by
natural selection we see on every side of us compare the many animals
and plants which are displayed at our exhibitions with their
parentforms when these are known or consult old historical records
with respect to their former state most of our domesticated animals
have given rise to numerous and distinct races but those which cannot
be easily subjected to selection must be exceptedsuch as cats the
cochineal insect and the hivebee in accordance with what we know of
the process of selection the formation of our many races has been slow
and gradual the man who first observed and preserved a pigeon with its
oesophagus a little enlarged its beak a little longer or its tail a
little more expanded than usual never dreamed that he had made the
first step in the creation of a pouter carrier and fantailpigeon
man can create not only anomalous breeds but others having their whole
structure admirably coordinated for certain purposes such as the
racehorse and drayhorse or the greyhound and bulldog it is by no
means necessary that each small change of structure throughout the
body leading towards excellence should simultaneously arise and be
selected although man seldom attends to differences in organs which
are important under a physiological point of view yet he has so
profoundly modified some breeds that assuredly if found wild they
would be ranked as distinct genera
the best proof of what selection has effected is perhaps afforded by
the fact that whatever part or quality in any animal and more
especially in any plant is most valued by man that part or quality
differs most in the several races this result is well seen by
comparing the amount of difference between the fruits produced by the
several varieties of fruittrees between the flowers of our
flowergarden plants between the seeds roots or leaves of our
culinary and agricultural plants in comparison with the other and not
valued parts of the same varieties striking evidence of a different
kind is afforded by the fact ascertained by oswald heer8 namely that
the seeds of a large number of plantswheat barley oats peas
beans lentils poppiescultivated for their seed by the ancient
lakeinhabitants of switzerland were all smaller than the seeds of our
existing varieties rtimeyer has shown that the sheep and cattle which
were kept by the earlier lakeinhabitants were likewise smaller than
our present breeds in the middens of denmark the earliest dog of
which the remains have been found was the weakest this was succeeded
during the bronze age by a stronger kind and this again during the
iron age by one still stronger the sheep of denmark during the bronze
period had extraordinarily slender limbs and the horse was smaller
than our present animal9 no doubt in most of these cases the new and
larger breeds were introduced from foreign lands by the immigration of
new hordes of men but it is not probable that each larger breed which
in the course of time has supplanted a previous and smaller breed was
the descendant of a distinct and larger species it is far more
probable that the domestic races of our various animals were gradually
improved in different parts of the great europaeoasiatic continent
and thence spread to other countries this fact of the gradual increase
in size of our domestic animals is all the more striking as certain
wild or halfwild animals such as reddeer aurochs parkcattle and
boars10 have within nearly the same period decreased in size
the conditions favourable to selection by man arethe closest
attention to every characterlongcontinued perseverancefacility in
matching or separating animalsand especially a large number being
kept so that the inferior individuals may be freely rejected or
destroyed and the better ones preserved when many are kept there will
also be a greater chance of the occurrence of wellmarked deviations of
structure length of time is allimportant for as each character in
order to become strongly pronounced has to be augmented by the
selection of successive variations of the same kind this can be
effected only during a long series of generations length of time will
also allow any new feature to become fixed by the continued rejection
of those individuals which revert or vary and by the preservation of
those which still inherit the new character hence although some few
animals have varied rapidly in certain respects under new conditions of
life as dogs in india and sheep in the west indies yet all the
animals and plants which have produced strongly marked races were
domesticated at an extremely remote epoch often before the dawn of
history as a consequence of this no record has been preserved of the
origin of our chief domestic breeds even at the present day new
strains or subbreeds are formed so slowly that their first appearance
passes unnoticed a man attends to some particular character or merely
matches his animals with unusual care and after a time a slight
difference is perceived by his neighboursthe difference goes on being
augmented by unconscious and methodical selection until at last a new
subbreed is formed receives a local name and spreads but by this
time its history is almost forgotten when the new breed has spread
widely it gives rise to new strains and subbreeds and the best of
these succeed and spread supplanting other and older breeds and so
always onwards in the march of improvement
when a wellmarked breed has once been established if not supplanted
by still further improved subbreeds and if not exposed to greatly
changed conditions of life inducing further variability or reversion to
longlost characters it may apparently last for an enormous period we
may infer that this is the case from the high antiquity of certain
races but some caution is necessary on this head for the same
variation may appear independently after long intervals of time or in
distant places we may safely assume that this has occurred with the
turnspitdog of which one is figured on the ancient egyptian
monumentswith the solidhoofed swine11 mentioned by aristotlewith
fivetoed fowls described by columellaand certainly with the
nectarine the dogs represented on the egyptian monuments about 2000
bc show us that some of the chief breeds then existed but it is
extremely doubtful whether any are identically the same with our
present breeds a great mastiff sculptured on an assyrian tomb 640
bc is said to be the same with the dog still imported from thibet
into the same region the true greyhound existed during the roman
classical period coming down to a later period we have seen that
though most of the chief breeds of the pigeon existed between two and
three centuries ago they have not all retained exactly the same
character to the present day but this has occurred in certain cases in
which no improvement was desired for instance in the case of the spot
and indian groundtumbler
de candolle12 has fully discussed the antiquity of various races of
plants he states that the black seeded poppy was known in the time of
homer the whiteseeded sesamum by the ancient egyptians and almonds
with sweet and bitter kernels by the hebrews but it does not seem
improbable that some of these varieties may have been lost and
reappeared one variety of barley and apparently one of wheat both of
which were cultivated at an immensely remote period by the
lakeinhabitants of switzerland still exist it is said13 that
specimens of a small variety of gourd which is still common in the
market of lima were exhumed from an ancient cemetery in peru de
candolle remarks that in the books and drawings of the sixteenth
century the principal races of the cabbage turnip and gourd can be
recognised this might have been expected at so late a period but
whether any of these plants are absolutely identical with our present
subvarieties is not certain it is however said that the brussels
sprout a variety which in some places is liable to degeneration has
remained genuine for more than four centuries in the district where it
is believed to have originated14
in accordance with the views maintained by me in this work and
elsewhere not only the various domestic races but the most distinct
genera and orders within the same great classfor instance mammals
birds reptiles and fishesare all the descendants of one common
progenitor and we must admit that the whole vast amount of difference
between these forms has primarily arisen from simple variability to
consider the subject under this point of view is enough to strike one
dumb with amazement but our amazement ought to be lessened when we
reflect that beings almost infinite in number during an almost
infinite lapse of time have often had their whole organisation
rendered in some degree plastic and that each slight modification of
structure which was in any way beneficial under excessively complex
conditions of life has been preserved whilst each which was in any way
injurious has been rigorously destroyed and the longcontinued
accumulation of beneficial variations will infallibly have led to
structures as diversified as beautifully adapted for various purposes
and as excellently coordinated as we see in the animals and plants
around us hence i have spoken of selection as the paramount power
whether applied by man to the formation of domestic breeds or by
nature to the production of species i may recur to the metaphor given
in a former chapter if an architect were to rear a noble and
commodious edifice without the use of cut stone by selecting from the
fragments at the base of a precipice wedgeformed stones for his
arches elongated stones for his lintels and flat stones for his roof
we should admire his skill and regard him as the paramount power now
the fragments of stone though indispensable to the architect bear to
the edifice built by him the same relation which the fluctuating
variations of organic beings bear to the varied and admirable
structures ultimately acquired by their modified descendants
some authors have declared that natural selection explains nothing
unless the precise cause of each slight individual difference be made
clear if it were explained to a savage utterly ignorant of the art of
building how the edifice had been raised stone upon stone and why
wedgeformed fragments were used for the arches flat stones for the
roof etc and if the use of each part and of the whole building were
pointed out it would be unreasonable if he declared that nothing had
been made clear to him because the precise cause of the shape of each
fragment could not be told but this is a nearly parallel case with the
objection that selection explains nothing because we know not the
cause of each individual difference in the structure of each being
the shape of the fragments of stone at the base of our precipice may be
called accidental but this is not strictly correct for the shape of
each depends on a long sequence of events all obeying natural laws on
the nature of the rock on the lines of deposition or cleavage on the
form of the mountain which depends on its upheaval and subsequent
denudation and lastly on the storm or earthquake which throws down the
fragments but in regard to the use to which the fragments may be put
their shape may be strictly said to be accidental and here we are led
to face a great difficulty in alluding to which i am aware that i am
travelling beyond my proper province an omniscient creator must have
foreseen every consequence which results from the laws imposed by him
but can it be reasonably maintained that the creator intentionally
ordered if we use the words in any ordinary sense that certain
fragments of rock should assume certain shapes so that the builder
might erect his edifice if the various laws which have determined the
shape of each fragment were not predetermined for the builders sake
can it be maintained with any greater probability that he specially
ordained for the sake of the breeder each of the innumerable variations
in our domestic animals and plantsmany of these variations being of
no service to man and not beneficial far more often injurious to the
creatures themselves did he ordain that the crop and tailfeathers of
the pigeon should vary in order that the fancier might make his
grotesque pouter and fantail breeds did he cause the frame and mental
qualities of the dog to vary in order that a breed might be formed of
indomitable ferocity with jaws fitted to pin down the bull for mans
brutal sport but if we give up the principle in one caseif we do not
admit that the variations of the primeval dog were intentionally guided
in order that the greyhound for instance that perfect image of
symmetry and vigour might be formedno shadow of reason can be
assigned for the belief that variations alike in nature and the result
of the same general laws which have been the groundwork through
natural selection of the formation of the most perfectly adapted
animals in the world man included were intentionally and specially
guided however much we may wish it we can hardly follow professor asa
gray in his belief that variation has been led along certain
beneficial lines like a stream along definite and useful lines of
irrigation if we assume that each particular variation was from the
beginning of all time preordained then that plasticity of
organisation which leads to many injurious deviations of structure as
well as the redundant power of reproduction which inevitably leads to a
struggle for existence and as a consequence to the natural selection
or survival of the fittest must appear to us superfluous laws of
nature on the other hand an omnipotent and omniscient creator ordains
everything and foresees everything thus we are brought face to face
with a difficulty as insoluble as is that of free will and
predestination
