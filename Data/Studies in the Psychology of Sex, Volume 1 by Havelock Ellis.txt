general preface
the origin of these studies dates from many years back as a youth i was
faced as others are by the problem of sex living partly in an
australian city where the ways of life were plainly seen partly in the
solitude of the bush i was free both to contemplate and to meditate many
things a resolve slowly grew up within me one main part of my lifework
should be to make clear the problems of sex
that was more than twenty years ago since then i can honestly say that in
all that i have done that resolve has never been very far from my
thoughts i have always been slowly working up to this central problem
and in a book published some three years agoman and woman a study of
human secondary sexual charactersi put forward what was in my own
eyes an introduction to the study of the primary questions of sexual
psychology
now that i have at length reached the time for beginning to publish my
results these results scarcely seem to me large as a youth i had hoped
to settle problems for those who came after now i am quietly content if i
do little more than state them for even that i now think is much it is
at least the half of knowledge in this particular field the evil of
ignorance is magnified by our efforts to suppress that which never can be
suppressed though in the effort of suppression it may become perverted i
have at least tried to find out what are the facts among normal people as
well as among abnormal people for while it seems to me that the
physicians training is necessary in order to ascertain the facts the
physician for the most part only obtains the abnormal facts which alone
bring little light i have tried to get at the facts and having got at
the facts to look them simply and squarely in the face if i cannot
perhaps turn the lock myself i bring the key which can alone in the end
rightly open the door the key of sincerity that is my one panacea
sincerity
i know that many of my friends people on whose side i too am to be
found retort with another word reticence it is a mistake they say to
try to uncover these things leave the sexual instincts alone to grow up
and develop in the shy solitude they love and they will be sure to grow
up and develop wholesomely but as a matter of fact that is precisely
what we can not and will not ever allow them to do there are very few
middleaged men and women who can clearly recall the facts of their lives
and tell you in all honesty that their sexual instincts have developed
easily and wholesomely throughout and it should not be difficult to see
why this is so let my friends try to transfer their feelings and theories
from the reproductive region to let us say the nutritive region the
only other which can be compared to it for importance suppose that eating
and drinking was never spoken of openly save in veiled or poetic
language and that no one ever ate food publicly because it was
considered immoral and immodest to reveal the mysteries of this natural
function we know what would occur a considerable proportion of the
community more especially the more youthful members possessed by an
instinctive and legitimate curiosity would concentrate their thoughts on
the subject they would have so many problems to puzzle over how often
ought i to eat what ought i to eat is it wrong to eat fruit which i
like ought i to eat grass which i dont like instinct notwithstanding
we may be quite sure that only a small minority would succeed in eating
reasonably and wholesomely the sexual secrecy of life is even more
disastrous than such a nutritive secrecy would be partly because we
expend such a wealth of moral energy in directing or misdirecting it
partly because the sexual impulse normally develops at the same time as
the intellectual impulse not in the early years of life when wholesome
instinctive habits might be formed and there is always some ignorant and
foolish friend who is prepared still further to muddle things eat a meal
every other day eat twelve meals a day never eat fruit always eat
grass the advice emphatically given in sexual matters is usually not less
absurd than this when however the matter is fully open the problems of
food are not indeed wholly solved but everyone is enabled by the
experience of his fellows to reach some sort of situation suited to his
own case and when the rigid secrecy is once swept away a sane and natural
reticence becomes for the first time possible
this secrecy has not always been maintained when the catholic church was
at the summit of its power and influence it fully realized the magnitude
of sexual problems and took an active and inquiring interest in all the
details of normal and abnormal sexuality even to the present time there
are certain phenomena of the sexual life which have scarcely been
accurately described except in ancient theological treatises as the type
of such treatises i will mention the great tome of sanchez de
matrimonio here you will find the whole sexual life of men and women
analyzed in its relationships to sin everything is set forth as clearly
and as concisely as it can bewithout morbid prudery on the one hand or
morbid sentimentality on the otherin the coldest scientific language
the right course of action is pointed out for all the cases that may
occur and we are told what is lawful what a venial sin what a mortal
sin now i do not consider that sexual matters concern the theologian
alone and i deny altogether that he is competent to deal with them in
his hands also undoubtedly they sometimes become prurient as they can
scarcely fail to become on the nonnatural and unwholesome basis of
asceticism and as they with difficulty become in the openair light of
science but we are bound to recognize the thoroughness with which the
catholic theologians dealt with these matters and from their own point
of view indeed the entire reasonableness we are bound to recognize the
admirable spirit in which successfully or not they sought to approach
them we need today the same spirit and temper applied from a different
standpoint these things concern everyone the study of these things
concerns the physiologist the psychologist the moralist we want to get
into possession of the actual facts and from the investigation of the
facts we want to ascertain what is normal and what is abnormal from the
point of view of physiology and of psychology we want to know what is
naturally lawful under the various sexual chances that may befall man not
as the born child of sin but as a naturally social animal what is a
venial sin against nature what a mortal sin against nature the answers
are less easy to reach than the theologians answers generally were but
we can at least put ourselves in the right attitude we may succeed in
asking that question which is sometimes even more than the half of
knowledge
it is perhaps a mistake to show so plainly at the outset that i approach
what may seem only a psychological question not without moral fervour but
i do not wish any mistake to be made i regard sex as the central problem
of life and now that the problem of religion has practically been
settled and that the problem of labor has at least been placed on a
practical foundation the question of sexwith the racial questions that
rest on itstands before the coming generations as the chief problem for
solution sex lies at the root of life and we can never learn to
reverence life until we know how to understand sexso at least it
seems to me
having said so much i will try to present such results as i have to
record in that cold and dry light through which alone the goal of
knowledge may truly be seen

preface to the third edition
the first edition of this volume was published in 1899 following sexual
inversion which now forms volume ii the second edition issued by the
present publishers and substantially identical with the first edition
appeared in the following year ten years have elapsed since then and this
new edition will be found to reflect the course of that long interval not
only is the volume greatly enlarged but nearly every page has been partly
rewritten this is mainly due to three causes much new literature
required to be taken into account my own knowledge of the historical and
ethnographic aspects of the sexual impulse has increased many fresh
illustrative cases of a valuable and instructive character have
accumulated in my hands it is to these three sources of improvement that
the book owes its greatly revised and enlarged condition and not to the
need for modifying any of its essential conclusions these far from
undergoing any change have by the new material been greatly strengthened
it may be added that the general preface to the whole work which was
originally published in 1898 at the beginning of sexual inversion now
finds its proper place at the outset of the present volume

preface to the first edition
the present volume contains three studies which seem to me to be necessary
prolegomena to that analysis of the sexual instinct which must form the
chief part of an investigation into the psychology of sex the first
sketches the main outlines of a complex emotional state which is of
fundamental importance in sexual psychology the second by bringing
together evidence from widely different regions suggests a tentative
explanation of facts that are still imperfectly known the third attempts
to show that even in fields where we assume our knowledge to be adequate a
broader view of the phenomena teaches us to suspend judgment and to adopt
a more cautious attitude so far as they go these studies are complete in
themselves their special use as an introduction to a more comprehensive
analysis of sexual phenomena is that they bring before us under varying
aspects a characteristic which though often ignored is of the first
importance in obtaining a clear understanding of the facts the tendency
of the sexual impulse to appear in a spontaneous and to some extent
periodic manner affecting women differently from men this is a tendency
which later i hope to make still more apparent for it has practical and
social as well as psychological implications hereand more especially
in the study of those spontaneous solitary manifestations which i call
autoerotici have attempted to clear the ground and to indicate the
main lines along which the progress of our knowledge in these fields may
best be attained
it may surprise many medical readers that in the third and longest study i
have said little save incidentally either of treatment or prevention
the omission of such considerations at this stage is intentional it may
safely be said that in no other field of human activity is so vast an
amount of strenuous didactic morality founded on so slender a basis of
facts in most other departments of life we at least make a pretence of
learning before we presume to teach in the field of sex we content
ourselves with the smallest and vaguest minimum of information often
ostentatiously secondhand usually unreliable i wish to emphasize the
fact that before we can safely talk either of curing or preventing these
manifestations we must know a great deal more than we know at present
regarding their distribution etiology and symptomatology and we must
exercise the same coolness and caution asif our work is to be
fruitfulwe require in any other field of serious study we must approach
these facts as physicians it is true but also as psychologists
primarily concerned to find out the workings of such manifestations in
fairly healthy and normal people if we found a divorcecourt judge
writing a treatise on marriage we should smile but it is equally absurd
for the physician so long as his knowledge is confined to disease to
write regarding sex at large valuable as the facts he brings forward may
be he can never be in a position to generalize concerning them and to
me at all events it seems that we have had more than enough pictures of
gross sexual perversity whether furnished by the asylum or the brothel
they are only really instructive when they are seen in their proper
perspective as the rare and ultimate extremes of a chain of phenomena
which we may more profitably study nearer home
yet although we are on every hand surrounded by the normal
manifestations of sex conscious or unconscious these manifestations are
extremely difficult to observe and in those cases in which we are best
able to observe them it frequently happens that we are unable to make any
use of our knowledge moreover even when we have obtained our data the
difficultiesat all events for an english investigatorare by no means
overcome he may take for granted that any serious and precise study of
the sexual instinct will not meet with general approval his work will be
misunderstood his motives will be called in question among those for
whom he is chiefly working he will find indifference indeed the pioneer
in this field may well count himself happy if he meets with nothing worse
than indifference hence it is that the present volume will not be
published in england but that availing myself of the generous sympathy
with which my work has been received in america i have sought the wider
medical and scientific audience of the united states in matters of faith
liberty of prophesying was centuries since eloquently vindicated for
englishmen the liberty of investigating facts is still called in
question under one pretence or another and to seek out the most vital
facts of life is still in england a perilous task
i desire most heartily to thank the numerous friends and correspondents
some living in remote parts of the world who have freely assisted me in
my work with valuable information and personal histories to mr fh
perrycoste i owe an appendix which is by far the most elaborate attempt
yet made to find evidence of periodicity in the spontaneous sexual
manifestations of sleep my debts to various medical and other
correspondents are duly stated in the text to many women friends and
correspondents i may here express my gratitude for the manner in which
they have furnished me with intimate personal records and for the
crossexamination to which they have allowed me to subject them i may
already say here what i shall have occasion to say more emphatically in
subsequent volumes that without the assistance i have received from women
of fine intelligence and high character my work would be impossible i
regret that i cannot make my thanks more specific

the evolution of modesty
i
the definition of modestythe significance of modestydifficulties in
the way of its analysisthe varying phenomena of modesty among different
peoples and in different ages
modesty which may be provisionally defined as an almost instinctive fear
prompting to concealment and usually centering around the sexual
processes while common to both sexes is more peculiarly feminine so that
it may almost be regarded as the chief secondary sexual character of women
on the psychical side the woman who is lacking in this kind of fear is
lacking also in sexual attractiveness to the normal and average man the
apparent exceptions seem to prove the rule for it will generally be found
that the women who are not immodest for immodesty is more closely
related to modesty than mere negative absence of the sense of modesty
but without that fear which implies the presence of a complex emotional
feminine organization to defend only make a strong sexual appeal to men
who are themselves lacking in the complementary masculine qualities as a
psychical secondary sexual character of the first rank it is necessary
before any psychology of sex can be arranged in order to obtain a clear
view of modesty
    the immense importance of feminine modesty in creating masculine
    passion must be fairly obvious i may however quote the
    observations of two writers who have shown evidence of insight
    and knowledge regarding this matter
    casanova describes how when at berne he went to the baths and
    was according to custom attended by a young girl whom he
    selected from a group of bath attendants she undressed him
    proceeded to undress herself and then entered the bath with him
    and rubbed him thoroughly all over the operation being performed
    in the most serious manner and without a word being spoken when
    all was over however he perceived that the girl had expected
    him to make advances and he proceeds to describe and discuss his
    own feelings of indifference under such circumstances though
    without gazing on the girls figure i had seen enough to
    recognize that she had all that a man can desire to find in a
    woman a beautiful face lively and wellformed eyes a beautiful
    mouth with good teeth a healthy complexion welldeveloped
    breasts and everything in harmony it is true that i had felt
    that her hands could have been smoother but i could only
    attribute this to hard work moreover my swiss girl was only
    eighteen and yet i remained entirely cold what was the cause of
    this that was the question that i asked myself
    it is clear wrote stendhal that three parts of modesty are
    taught this is perhaps the only law born of civilization which
    produces nothing but happiness it has been observed that birds
    of prey hide themselves to drink because being obliged to
    plunge their heads in the water they are at that moment
    defenceless after having considered what passes at otaheite i
    can see no other natural foundation for modesty love is the
    miracle of civilization among savage and very barbarous races we
    find nothing but physical love of a gross character it is
    modesty that gives to love the aid of imagination and in so
    doing imparts life to it modesty is very early taught to little
    girls by their mothers and with extreme jealousy one might say
    by esprit de corps they are watching in advance over the
    happiness of the future lover to a timid and tender woman there
    ought to be no greater torture than to allow herself in the
    presence of a man something which she thinks she ought to blush
    at i am convinced that a proud woman would prefer a thousand
    deaths a slight liberty taken on the tender side by the man she
    loves gives a woman a moment of keen pleasure but if he has the
    air of blaming her for it or only of not enjoying it with
    transport an awful doubt must be left in her mind for a woman
    above the vulgar level there is then everything to gain by very
    reserved manners the play is not equal she hazards against a
    slight pleasure or against the advantage of appearing a little
    amiable the danger of biting remorse and a feeling of shame
    which must render even the lover less dear an evening passed
    gaily and thoughtlessly without thinking of what comes after is
    dearly paid at this price the sight of a lover with whom one
    fears that one has had this kind of wrong must become odious for
    several days can one be surprised at the force of a habit the
    slightest infractions of which are punished with such atrocious
    shame as to the utility of modesty it is the mother of love as
    to the mechanism of the feeling nothing is simpler the mind is
    absorbed in feeling shame instead of being occupied with desire
    desires are forbidden and desires lead to actions it is evident
    that every tender and proud womanand these two things being
    cause and effect naturally go togethermust contract habits of
    coldness which the people whom she disconcerts call prudery the
    power of modesty is so great that a tender woman betrays herself
    with her lover rather by deeds than by words the evil of
    modesty is that it constantly leads to falsehood stendhal de
    lamour chapter xxiv
    it thus happens that as adler remarks die mangelhafte
    geschlechtsempfindung des weibes p 133 the sexual impulse in
    women is fettered by an inhibition which has to be conquered a
    thin veil of reticence shyness and anxiety is constantly cast
    anew over a womans love and her wooer in every act of
    courtship has the enjoyment of conquering afresh an oftwon
    woman
    an interesting testimony to the part played by modesty in
    effecting the union of the sexes is furnished by the factto
    which attention has often been calledthat the special modesty
    of women usually tends to diminish though not to disappear with
    the complete gratification of the sexual impulses this may be
    noted among savage as well as among civilized women the
    comparatively evanescent character of modesty has led to the
    argument venturi degenerazioni psicosessuali pp 9293
    that modesty pudore is possessed by women alone men
    exhibiting instead a sense of decency which remains at about
    the same level of persistency throughout life viazzi pudore
    nell uomo e nella donna rivista mensile di psichiatria
    forense 1898 on the contrary following sergi argues that
    men are throughout more modest than women but the points he
    brings forward though often just scarcely justify his
    conclusion while the young virgin however is more modest and
    shy than the young man of the same age the experienced married
    woman is usually less so than her husband and in a woman who is
    a mother the shy reticences of virginal modesty would be rightly
    felt to be ridiculous les petites pudeurs nexistent pas pour
    les mres remarks goncourt journal des goncourt vol iii
    p 5 she has put off a sexual livery that has no longer any
    important part to play in life and would indeed be
    inconvenient and harmful just as a bird loses its sexual plumage
    when the pairing season is over
    madame cline renooz in an elaborate study of the psychological
    sexual differences between men and women psychologie compare
    de lhomme et de la femme 1898 pp 8587 also believes that
    modesty is not really a feminine characteristic modesty she
    argues is masculine shame attributed to women for two reasons
    first because man believes that woman is subject to the same
    laws as himself secondly because the course of human evolution
    has reversed the psychology of the sexes attributing to women
    the psychological results of masculine sexuality this is the
    origin of the conventional lies which by a sort of social
    suggestion have intimidated women they have in appearance at
    least accepted the rule of shame imposed on them by men but
    only custom inspires the modesty for which they are praised it
    is really an outrage to their sex this reversal of psychological
    laws has however only been accepted by women with a struggle
    primitive woman proud of her womanhood for a long time
    defended her nakedness which ancient art has always represented
    and in the actual life of the young girl today there is a moment
    when by a secret atavism she feels the pride of her sex the
    intuition of her moral superiority and cannot understand why she
    must hide its cause at this moment wavering between the laws of
    nature and social conventions she scarcely knows if nakedness
    should or should not affright her a sort of confused atavistic
    memory recalls to her a period before clothing was known and
    reveals to her as a paradisaical ideal the customs of that human
    epoch
    in support of this view the authoress proceeds to point out that
    the dcollet constantly reappears in feminine clothing never
    in male that missionaries experience great difficulty in
    persuading women to cover themselves that while women accept
    with facility an examination by male doctors men cannot force
    themselves to accept examination by a woman doctor etc these
    and similar points had already been independently brought forward
    by sergi archivio di psichiatria vol xiii 1892
    it cannot be said that madame renoozs arguments will all bear
    examination if only on the ground that nakedness by no means
    involves absence of modesty but the point of view which she
    expresses is one which usually fails to gain recognition though
    it probably contains an important element of truth it is quite
    true as stendhal said that modesty is very largely taught from
    the earliest years a girl child is trained to show a modesty
    which she quickly begins really to feel this fact cannot fail to
    strike any one who reads the histories of pseudohermaphroditic
    persons really males who have from infancy been brought up in
    the belief that they are girls and who show and feel all the
    shrinking reticence and blushing modesty of their supposed sex
    but when the error is discovered and they are restored to their
    proper sex this is quickly changed and they exhibit all the
    boldness of masculinity see eg neugebauer beobachtungen
    aus dem gebiete des scheinzwittertumes jahrbuch fr sexuelle
    zwischenstufen jahrgang iv 1902 esp p 92 at the same time
    this is only one thread in the tangled skein with which we are
    here concerned the mass of facts which meets us when we turn to
    the study of modesty in women cannot be dismissed as a group of
    artificiallyimposed customs they gain rather than lose in
    importance if we have to realize that the organic sexual demands
    of women calling for coyness in courtship lead to the temporary
    suppression of another feminine instinct of opposite though
    doubtless allied nature
    but these somewhat conflicting though not really contradictory
    statements serve to bring out the fact that a womans modesty is
    often an incalculable element the woman who under some
    circumstances and at some times is extreme in her reticences
    under other circumstances or at other times may be extreme in
    her abandonment not that her modesty is an artificial garment
    which she throws off or on at will it is organic but like the
    snails shell it sometimes forms an impenetrable covering and
    sometimes glides off almost altogether a mans modesty is more
    rigid with little tendency to deviate toward either extreme
    thus it is that when uninstructed a man is apt to be impatient
    with a womans reticences and yet shocked at her abandonments
the significance of our inquiry becomes greater when we reflect that to
the reticences of sexual modesty in their progression expansion and
complication we largely owe not only the refinement and development of
the sexual emotionsla pudeur as guyau remarked a civilis
lamourbut the subtle and pervading part which the sexual instinct has
played in the evolution of all human culture
    it is certain that very much of what is best in religion art
    and life remark stanley hall and allin owes its charm to the
    progressivelywidening irradiation of sexual feeling perhaps the
    reluctance of the female first longcircuited the exquisite
    sensations connected with sexual organs and acts to the antics of
    animal and human courtship while restraint had the physiological
    function of developing the colors plumes excessive activity
    and exuberant life of the pairing season to keep certain parts
    of the body covered irradiated the sense of beauty to eyes
    hair face complexion dress form etc while many savage
    dances costumes and postures are irradiations of the sexual act
    thus reticence concealment and restraint are among the prime
    conditions of religion and human culture stanley hall and
    allin the psychology of tickling american journal of
    psychology 1897 p 31
    groos attributes the deepening of the conjugal relation among
    birds to the circumstance that the male seeks to overcome the
    reticence of the female by the display of his charms and
    abilities and in the human world he continues it is the
    same without the modest reserve of the woman that must in most
    cases be overcome by lovable qualities the sexual relationship
    would with difficulty find a singer who would extol in love the
    highest movements of the human soul groos spiele der
    menschen p 341
i have not however been able to find that the subject of modesty has
been treated in any comprehensive way by psychologists though valuable
facts and suggestions bearing on the sexual emotions on disgust the
origins of tatooing on ornament and clothing have been brought forward
by physiologists psychologists and ethnographists few or no attempts
appear to have been made to reach a general synthetic statement of these
facts and suggestions it is true that a great many unreliable slight or
fragmentary efforts have been made to ascertain the constitution or basis
of this emotion1 many psychologists have regarded modesty simply as the
result of clothing this view is overturned by the wellascertained fact
that many races which go absolutely naked possess a highlydeveloped sense
of modesty these writers have not realized that physiological modesty is
earlier in appearance and more fundamental than anatomical modesty a
partial contribution to the analysis of modesty has been made by professor
james who with his usual insight and lucidity has set forth certain of
its characteristics especially the element due to the application to
ourselves of judgments primarily passed upon our mates guyau in a very
brief discussion of modesty realized its great significance and touched
on most of its chief elements2 westermarck again followed by grosse
has very ably and convincingly set forth certain factors in the origin of
ornament and clothing a subject which many writers imagine to cover the
whole field of modesty more recently ribot in his work on the emotions
has vaguely outlined most of the factors of modesty but has not developed
a coherent view of their origins and relationships
    since the present study first appeared hohenemser who
    considers that my analysis of modesty is unsatisfactory has made
    a notable attempt to define the psychological mechanism of shame
    versuch einer analyse der scham archiv fr die gesamte
    psychologie bd ii heft 23 1903 he regards shame as a
    general psychophysical phenomenon a definite tension of the
    whole soul with an emotion superadded the state of shame
    consists in a certain psychic lameness or inhibition sometimes
    accompanied by physical phenomena of paralysis such as sinking
    of the head and inability to meet the eye it is a special case
    of lippss psychic stasis or damming up psychische stauung
    always produced when the psychic activities are at the same time
    drawn in two or more different directions in shame there is
    always something present in consciousness which conflicts with
    the rest of the personality and cannot be brought into harmony
    with it which cannot be brought that is into moral not
    logical relationship with it a young man in love with a girl is
    ashamed when told that he is in love because his reverence for
    one whom he regards as a higher being cannot be brought into
    relationship with his own lower personality a child in the same
    way feels shame in approaching a big grownup person who seems
    a higher sort of being sometimes likewise we feel shame in
    approaching a stranger for a new person tends to seem higher and
    more interesting than ourselves it is not so in approaching a
    new natural phenomenon because we do not compare it with
    ourselves another kind of shame is seen when this mental contest
    is lower than our personality and on this account in conflict
    with it as when we are ashamed of sexual thoughts sexual ideas
    tend to evoke shame hohenemser remarks because they so easily
    tend to pass into sexual feelings when they do not so pass as
    in scientific discussions they do not evoke shame
    it will be seen that this discussion of modesty is highly
    generalized and abstracted it deals simply with the formal
    mechanism of the process hohenemser admits that fear is a form
    of psychic stasis and i have sought to show that modesty is a
    complexus of fears we may very well accept the conception of
    psychic stasis at the outset the analysis of modesty has still
    to be carried very much further
the discussion of modesty is complicated by the difficulty and even
impossibility of excluding closelyallied emotionsshame shyness
bashfulness timidity etcall of which indeed however defined adjoin
or overlap modesty3 it is not however impossible to isolate the main
body of the emotion of modesty on account of its special connection on
the whole with the consciousness of sex i here attempt however
imperfectly to sketch out a fairlycomplete analysis of its constitution
and to trace its development
    in entering upon this investigation a few facts with regard to
    the various manifestations of modesty may be helpful to us i
    have selected these from scattered original sources and have
    sought to bring out the variety and complexity of the problems
    with which we are here concerned
    the new georgians of the solomon islands so low a race that they
    are ignorant both of pottery and weaving and wear only a loin
    cloth have the same ideas of what is decent with regard to

    difficult to observe whether they practice circumcision

    to the penis not at all from a sense of decency but to avoid

    most dangerous the natives of this savage island accordingly
    wrap the penis around with many yards of calico and other like
    materials winding and folding them until a preposterous bundle

    captain cook at tahiti in 1769 after performing divine service
    on sunday witnessed vespers of a very different kind a young
    man near six feet high performed the rites of venus with a
    little girl about eleven or twelve years of age before several
    of our people and a great number of the natives without the
    least sense of its being indecent or improper but as it
    appeared in perfect conformity to the custom of the place among
    the spectators were several women of superior rank who may
    properly be said to have assisted at the ceremony for they gave
    instructions to the girl how to perform her part which young as
    she was she did not seem much to stand in need of j

    at tahiti according to cook it was customary to gratify every
    appetite and passion before witnesses and it is added in the
    conversation of these people that which is the principal source
    of their pleasure is always the principal topic everything is
    mentioned without any restraint or emotion and in the most
    direct terms by both sexes hawkesworth op cit vol ii p

    i have observed captain cook wrote that our friends in the
    south seas have not even the idea of indecency with respect to
    any object or any action but this was by no means the case with
    the inhabitants of new zealand in whose carriage and
    conversation there was as much modest reserve and decorum with
    respect to actions which yet in their opinion were not criminal
    as are to be found among the politest people in europe the women
    were not impregnable but the terms and manner of compliance were
    as decent as those in marriage among us and according to their
    notions the agreement was as innocent when any of our people
    made an overture to any of their young women he was given to
    understand that the consent of her friends was necessary and by
    the influence of a proper present it was generally obtained but
    when these preliminaries were settled it was also necessary to
    treat the wife for a night with the same delicacy that is here
    required by the wife for life and the lover who presumed to take
    any liberties by which this was violated was sure to be
    disappointed hawkesworth op cit vol ii p 254
    cook found that the people of new zealand bring the prepuce over
    the gland and to prevent it from being drawn back by contraction
    of the part they tie the string which hangs from the girdle
    round the end of it the glans indeed seemed to be the only
    part of their body which they were solicitous to conceal for
    they frequently threw off all their dress but the belt and
    string with the most careless indifference but showed manifest
    signs of confusion when to gratify our curiosity they were
    requested to untie the string and never consented but with the
    utmost reluctance and shame the womens lower garment was
    always bound fast round them except when they went into the
    water to catch lobsters and then they took great care not to be
    seen by the men we surprised several of them at this employment
    and the chaste diana with her nymphs could not have discovered
    more confusion and distress at the sight of acton than these
    women expressed upon our approach some of them hid themselves
    among the rocks and the rest crouched down in the sea till they
    had made themselves a girdle and apron of such weeds as they
    could find and when they came out even with this veil we could
    see that their modesty suffered much pain by our presence

    in rotuma in polynesia where the women enjoy much freedom but
    where at all events in old days married people were as a rule
    faithful to each other the language is not chaste according to
    our ideas and there is a great deal of freedom in speaking of
    immoral vices in this connection a man and his wife will speak
    freely to one another before their friends i am informed
    though by european traders well conversant with the language
    that there are grades of language and that certain coarse

    in their own houses in the depths of the forest the dwarfs are

    boy he adds that the native dances are only an apparent
    exception being serious in character though indecent to our
    eyes almost constituting a religious ceremony the only really
    indecent dance indigenous to central africa is one which
    originally represented the act of coition but it is so altered
    to a stereotyped formula that its exact purport is not obvious

    be asserted that the negro race in central africa is much more

    lay especial emphasis on the fact that it is a shame for young
    wives to show their uncovered hair and feet to the male relatives
    of their husbands on the other side the male relatives of the
    husband ought to avoid showing to the young wife the body
    uncovered above the elbow or the sole of the foot and they ought
    to avoid indecent expressions and vulgar vituperations in her
    presence that these observances are not the result of a
    specially delicate modesty is proved by the fact that even young
    girls constantly twist thread upon the naked thigh unembarrassed
    by the presence of men who do not belong to the household nor do
    they show any embarrassment if a strange man comes upon them when

    the notion of the women exercising naked in the schools with the

    long since it was thought discreditable and ridiculous among the
    greeks as it is now among most barbarous nations for men to be
    seen naked and when the cretans first and after them the

    wits of the time had it in their power to make sport of those

    it is a law among the tyrrhenians that all their women should be
    in common and that the women pay the greatest attention to their
    persons and often practice gymnastic exercises naked among the
    men and sometimes with one another for that it is not accounted
    shameful for them to be seen naked nor is it reckoned among
    the tyrrhenians at all disgraceful either to do or suffer
    anything in the open air or to be seen while it is going on for
    it is quite the custom of their country and they are so far from
    thinking it disgraceful that they even say when the master of

    christianity seems to have profoundly affected habits of thought
    and feeling by uniting together the merely natural emotion of
    sexual reserve with on the one hand the masculine virtue of
    modestymodestiaand on the other the prescription of

    latter he remarks book ii chapter i salvationand not of
    women only but likewise of menconsists in the exhibition
    principally of modesty since we are all the temple of god
    modesty is the sacristan and priestess of that temple who is to
    suffer nothing unclean or profane to enter it for fear that the
    god who inhabits it should be offended most women either
    from simple ignorance or from dissimulation have the hardihood
    so to walk as if modesty consisted only in the integrity of the
    flesh and in turning away from fornication and there were no
    need for anything elsein dress and ornament the studied
    graces of formwearing in their gait the selfsame appearance
    as the women of the nations from whom the sense of true modesty
    is absent
    the earliest christian ideal of modesty not long maintained is
    well shown in an epistle which there is some reason to suppose
    was written by clement of rome and if we see it to be requisite
    to stand and pray for the sake of the woman and to speak words
    of exhortation and edification we call the brethren and all the
    holy sisters and maidens likewise all the other women who are
    there with all modesty and becoming behavior to come and feast
    on the truth and those among us who are skilled in speaking
    speak to them and exhort them in those words which god has given
    us and then we pray and salute one another the men the men
    but the women and the maidens will wrap their hands in their
    garments we also with circumspection and with all purity our
    eyes looking upward shall wrap our right hand in our garments

    who wish may see them at home shut up in their own baths for
    they are not ashamed to strip before spectators as if exposing
    their persons for sale the baths are opened promiscuously to men
    and women and there they strip for licentious indulgence for
    from looking men get to loving as if their modesty had been
    washed away in the bath those who have not become utterly
    destitute of modesty shut out strangers but bathe with their own
    servants and strip naked before their slaves and are rubbed by
    them giving to the crouching menial liberty to lust by
    permitting fearless handling for those who are introduced before
    their naked mistresses while in the bath study to strip
    themselves in order to show audacity in lust casting off fear in

    in the years 145070 the use of the codpiece was introduced
    whereby the attributes of manhood were accentuated in the most
    shameless manner it was in fact the avowed aim at that period
    to attract attention to these parts the codpiece was sometimes
    colored differently from the rest of the garments often stuffed
    out to enlarge it artificially and decorated with ribbons

    the first shirt began to be worn in germany in the sixteenth
    century from this fact as well as from the custom of public
    bathing we reach the remarkable result that for the german
    people the sight of complete nakedness was the daily rule up to
    the sixteenth century everyone undressed completely before going
    to bed and in the vaporbaths no covering was used again the
    dances both of the peasants and the townspeople were
    characterized by very high leaps into the air it was the chief
    delight of the dancers for the male to raise his partner as high
    as possible in the air so that her dress flew up that feminine
    modesty was in this respect very indifferent we know from
    countless references made in the fifteenth and sixteenth
    centuries it must not be forgotten that throughout the middle
    ages women wore no underclothes and even in the seventeenth
    century the wearing of drawers by italian women was regarded as
    singular that with the disappearance of the baths and the use
    of bodylinen a powerful influence was exerted on the creation
    of modesty there can be little doubt rudeck op cit pp

    in england the use of drawers was almost unknown among women
    half a century ago and was considered immodest and unfeminine

    on hygienic grounds thus understood he added the adoption

    drawers are an oriental garment and seem to have reached europe
    through venice the great channel of communication with the east
    like many other refinements of decency and cleanliness they were
    at first chiefly cultivated by prostitutes and on this account
    there was long a prejudice against them even at the present day

    them as essentially a french garment they were introduced at the

    sixteenth century were rendered almost necessary by the new
    fashion of the vertugale or farthingale in 1615 a ladys
    caleons are referred to as apparently an ordinary garment it
    is noteworthy that in london in the middle of the same century

    wore drawers which were seemingly of the closed kind diary

    book lart de la lingerie published in 1771 womens drawers
    are not even mentioned and mercier tableau de paris 1783
    vol vii p 54 says that except actresses parisian women do
    not wear drawers even by ballet dancers and actresses on the
    stage they were not invariably worn camargo the famous dancer
    who first shortened the skirt in dancing early in the eighteenth
    century always observed great decorum never showing the leg
    above the knee when appealed to as to whether she wore drawers
    she replied that she could not possibly appear without such a
    precaution but they were not necessarily worn by dancers and
    in 1727 a young ballerina having had her skirt accidentally
    torn away by a piece of stage machinery the police issued an
    order that in future no actress or dancer should appear on the
    stage without drawers this regulation does not appear however
    to have been long strictly maintained though schulz ueber

    a man married twenty years told me that he had never seen his

    many women though not wanting in esthetic feeling find no
    beauty in mans form some are positively repelled by the sight
    of nakedness even that of a husband or lover on the contrary
    most men delight in gazing upon the uncovered figure of women

    combined with the demands of modesty in england the regulations

    association require that the male swimmers costume shall extend
    not less than eight inches from the bifurcation downward and
    that the female swimmers costume shall extend to within not more
    than three inches from the knee a prolonged discussion we are

    three inches from the knee and the proposal of the youngest lady
    swimmer present that the costume ought to be very scanty met
    with little approval the modesty of women is thus seen to be
    greater than that of men by roughly speaking about two inches

    frequently made a great point of wearing bathing costumes it was
    frequently noticed that those who were most anxious to avoid

the fact that modesty itself has in english like virtue two distinct
meanings in its original form it has no special connection with sex or
women but may rather be considered as a masculine virtue cicero regards
modestia as the equivalent of the greek sphrosun this is the
modesty which mary wollstonecraft eulogized in the last century the

that modestylike all the closelyallied emotionsis based on fear one
of the most primitive of the emotions seems to be fairly evident4 the
association of modesty and fear is even a very ancient observation and is
found in the fragments of epicharmus while according to one of the most
recent definitions modesty is the timidity of the body modesty is
indeed an agglomeration of fears especially as i hope to show of two
important and distinct fears one of much earlier than human origin and
supplied solely by the female the other of more distinctly human
character and of social rather than sexual origin
a child left to itself though very bashful is wholly devoid of
modesty5 everyone is familiar with the shocking inconvenances of
children in speech and act with the charming ways in which they
innocently disregard the conventions of modesty their elders thrust upon
them or even when anxious to carry them out wholly miss the point at
issue as when a child thinks that to put a little garment round the neck
satisfies the demands of modesty julius moses states that modesty in the
uncovering of the sexual parts begins about the age of four but in cases
when this occurs it is difficult to exclude teaching and example under
civilized conditions the convention of modesty long precedes its real
development bell has found that in love affairs before the age of nine
the girl is more aggressive than the boy and that at that age she begins
to be modest6 it may fairly be said that complete development of
modesty only takes place at the advent of puberty7 we may admit with
perez one of the very few writers who touch on the evolution of this
emotion that modesty may appear at a very early age if sexual desire
appears early8 we should not however be justified in asserting that
on this account modesty is a purely sexual phenomenon the social impulses
also develop about puberty and to that coincidence the compound nature of
the emotion of modesty may well be largely due
the sexual factor is however the simplest and most primitive element of
modesty and may therefore be mentioned first anyone who watches a
bitch not in heat when approached by a dog with tail wagging gallantly
may see the beginnings of modesty when the dogs attentions become a
little too marked the bitch squats firmly down on the front legs and hind
quarters though when the period of oestrus comes her modesty may be flung
to the air and she eagerly turns her hind quarters to her admirers nose
and elevates her tail high in the air her attitude of refusal is
equivalent that is to say to that which in the human race is typified by
the classical example of womanly modesty in the medicean venus who
withdraws the pelvis at the same time holding one hand to guard the
pubes the other to guard the breasts9 the essential expression in each
case is that of defence of the sexual centers against the undesired
advances of the male10
    stratz who criticizes the above statement argues with
    photographs of nude women in illustration that the normal type
    of european surprised modesty is shown by an attitude in which
    the arms are crossed over the breast the most sexually
    attractive region while the thighs are pressed together one
    being placed before the other the shoulder raised and the back
    slightly curved occasionally he adds the hands may be used to
    cover the face and then the crossed arms conceal the breasts
    the medicean venus he remarks is only a pretty woman coquetting
    with her body canovas venus in the pitti who has drapery in
    front of her and presses her arms across her breast being a
    more accurate rendering of the attitude of modesty but stratz
    admits that when a surprised woman is gazed at for some time she
    turns her head away sinks or closes her eyes and covers her
    pubes or any other part she thinks is being gazed at with one
    hand while with the other she hides her breast or face this he
    terms the secondary expression of modesty stratz die
    frauenkleidung third ed p 23
    it is certainly true that the medicean venus merely represents an
    artistic convention a generalized tradition not founded on
    exact and precise observation of the gestures of modesty and it
    is equally true that all the instinctive movements noted by
    stratz are commonly resorted to by a woman whose nakedness is
    surprised but in the absence of any series of carefully recorded
    observations one may doubt whether the distinction drawn by
    stratz between the primary and the secondary expression of
    modesty can be upheld as the general rule while it is most
    certainly not true for every case when a young woman is
    surprised in a state of nakedness by a person of the opposite or
    even of the same sex it is her instinct to conceal the primary
    centers of sexual function and attractiveness in the first
    place the pubes in the second place the breasts the exact
    attitude and the particular gestures of the hands in achieving
    the desired end vary with the individual and with the
    circumstances the hand may not be used at all as a veil and
    indeed the instinct of modesty itself may inhibit the use of the
    hand for the protection of modesty to turn the back towards the
    beholder is often the chief impulse of blushing modesty even
    when clothed but the application of the hand to this end is
    primitive and natural the lowly fuegian woman depicted by
    hyades and deniker who holds her hand to her pubes while being
    photographed is one at this point with the roman venus described
    by ovid ars amatoria book  ii
        ipsa venus pubem quoties velamnia ponit
        protegitur lva semireducta manus
    it may be added that young men of the lower social classes at
    all events in england when bathing at the seaside in complete
    nudity commonly grasp the sexual organs with one hand for
    concealment as they walk up from the sea
the sexual modesty of the female animal is rooted in the sexual
periodicity of the female and is an involuntary expression of the organic
fact that the time for love is not now inasmuch as this fact is true of
the greater part of the lives of all female animals below man the
expression itself becomes so habitual that it even intrudes at those
moments when it has ceased to be in place we may see this again
illustrated in the bitch who when in heat herself runs after the male
and again turns to flee perhaps only submitting with much persuasion to
his embrace thus modesty becomes something more than a mere refusal of
the male it becomes an invitation to the male and is mixed up with his
ideas of what is sexually desirable in the female this would alone serve
to account for the existence of modesty as a psychical secondary sexual
character in this sense and in this sense only we may say with colin
scott that the feeling of shame is made to be overcome and is thus
correlated with its physical representative the hymen in the rupture of
which as groos remarks there is in some degree a disruption also of
modesty the sexual modesty of the female is thus an inevitable byproduct
of the naturally aggressive attitude of the male in sexual relationships
and the naturally defensive attitude of the female this again being
founded on the fact that whilein man and the species allied to himthe
sexual function in the female is periodic and during most of life a
function to be guarded from the opposite sex in the male it rarely or
never needs to be so guarded11
both male and female however need to guard themselves during the
exercise of their sexual activities from jealous rivals as well as from
enemies who might take advantage of their position to attack them it is
highly probable that this is one important sexual factor in the
constitution of modesty and it helps to explain how the male not less
than the female cultivates modesty and shuns publicity in the exercise
of sexual functions northcote has especially emphasized this element in
modesty as originating in the fear of rivals that from this seeking
after secrecy from motives of fear should arise an instinctive feeling
that the sexual act must always be hidden is a natural enough sequence
and since it is not a long step between thinking of an act as needing
concealment and thinking of it as wrong it is easily conceivable that
sexual intercourse comes to be regarded as a stolen and therefore in some
degree a sinful pleasure12
animals in a state of nature usually appear to seek seclusion for sexual
intercourse although this instinct is lost under domestication even the
lowest savages also if uncorrupted by civilized influences seek the
solitude of the forest or the protection of their huts for the same
purpose the rare cases in which coitus is public seem usually to involve
a ceremonial or social observance rather than mere personal
gratification at loango for instance it would be highly improper to
have intercourse in an exposed spot it must only be performed inside the
hut with closed doors at night when no one is present13
    it is on the sexual factor of modesty existing in a wellmarked
    form even among animals that coquetry is founded i am glad to
    find myself on this point in agreement with professor groos who
    in his elaborate study of the playinstinct has reached the same
    conclusion so far from being the mere heartless play by which a
    woman shows her power over a man groos points out that coquetry
    possesses high biological and psychological significance being
    rooted in the antagonism between the sexual instinct and inborn
    modesty he refers to the roe who runs away from the stagbut
    in a circle groos die spiele der menschen 1899 p 339
    also the same authors die spiele der thiere pp 288 et
    seq another example of coquetry is furnished by the female
    kingfisher alcedo ispida which will spend all the morning in
    teasing and flying away from the male but is careful constantly
    to look back and never to let him out of her sight many
    examples are given by bchner in liebe und liebesleben in der
    tierwelt robert mller sexualbiologie p 302 emphasizes
    the importance of coquetry as a lure to the male
    it is quite true a lady writes to me in a private letter
    that coquetry is a poor thing and that every milkmaid can
    assume it but a woman uses it principally in selfdefence while
    she is finding out what the man himself is like this is in
    accordance with the remark of marro that modesty enables a woman
    to put lovers to the test in order to select him who is best
    able to serve the natural ends of love it is doubtless the
    necessity for this probationary period as a test of masculine
    qualities which usually leads a woman to repel instinctively a
    too hasty and impatient suitor for as arthur macdonald remarks
    it seems to be instinctive in young women to reject the
    impetuous lover without the least consideration of his
    character ability and fitness
this essential element in courtship this fundamental attitude of pursuer
and pursued is clearly to be seen even in animals and savages it is
equally pronounced in the most civilized men and women manifesting itself
in crude and subtle ways alike shakespeares angelo whose virtue had
always resisted the temptations of vice discovered at last that
            modesty may more betray our sense
    than womans lightness
what asked the wise montaigne is the object of that virginal shame
that sedate coldness that severe countenance that pretence of not
knowing things which they understand better than we who teach them except
to increase in us the desire to conquer and curb to trample under our
appetite all that ceremony and those obstacles for there is not only
matter for pleasure but for pride also in ruffling and debauching that
soft sweetness and infantine modesty14 the masculine attitude in the
face of feminine coyness may easily pass into a kind of sadism but is
nevertheless in its origin an innocent and instinctive impulse restif de
la bretonne describing his own shame and timidity as a pretty boy whom
the girls would run after and kiss adds it is surprising that at the
same time i would imagine the pleasure i should have in embracing a girl
who resisted in inspiring her with timidity in making her flee and in
pursuing her that was a part which i burned to play15 it is the
instinct of the sophisticated and the unsophisticated alike the arabs
have developed an erotic ideal of sensuality but they emphasize the
importance of feminine modesty and declare that the best woman is she
who sees not men and whom they see not16 this deeprooted modesty of
women towards men in courtship is intimately interwoven with the marriage
customs and magic rites of even the most primitive peoples and has
survived in many civilized practices today17 the prostitute must be
able to simulate the modesty she may often be far from feeling and the
immense erotic advantage of the innocent over the vicious woman lies
largely in the fact that in her the exquisite reactions of modesty are
fresh and vigorous i cannot imagine anything that is more sexually
exciting remarks hans menjago than to observe a person of the opposite
sex who by some external or internal force is compelled to fight
against her physical modesty the more modest she is the more sexually
exciting is the picture she presents18 it is notable that even in
abnormal as well as in normal erotic passion the desire is for innocent
and not for vicious women and in association with this the desired
favor to be keenly relished must often be gained by sudden surprise and
not by mutual agreement a foot fetichist writes to me it is the
stolen glimpse of a pretty foot or ankle which produces the greatest
effect on me a urolagnic symbolist was chiefly excited by the act of
urination when he caught a young woman unawares in the act a fetichistic
admirer of the nates only desired to see this region in innocent girls
not in prostitutes the exhibitionist almost invariably only exposes
himself to apparently respectable girls
    a russian correspondent who feels this charm of women in a
    particularly strong degree is inclined to think that there is an
    element of perversity in it in the erotic action of the idea of
    feminine enjoyment he writes i think there are traces of a
    certain perversity in fact owing to the impressions of early
    youth woman even if we feel contempt for her in theory is
    placed above us on a certain pedestal as an almost sacred
    being and the more so because mysterious now sensuality and
    sexual desire are considered as rather vulgar and a little
    dirty even ridiculous and degrading not to say bestial the
    woman who enjoys it is therefore rather like a profaned altar
    or at least like a divinity who has descended on to the earth
    to give enjoyment to a woman is therefore like perpetrating a
    sacrilege or at least like taking a liberty with a god the
    feelings bequeathed to us by a long social civilization maintain
    themselves in spite of our rational and deliberate opinions
    reason tells us that there is nothing evil in sexual enjoyment
    whether in man or woman but an unconscious feeling directs our
    emotions and this feeling having a germ that was placed in
    modern men by christianity and perhaps by still older religions
    says that woman ought to be an absolutely pure being with
    ethereal sensations and that in her sexual enjoyment is out of
    place improper scandalous to arouse sexual emotions in a
    woman if not to profane a sacred host is at all events the
    staining of an immaculate peplos if not sacrilege it is at
    least irreverence or impertinence for all men the chaster a
    woman is the more agreeable it is to bring her to the orgasm
    that is felt as a triumph of the body over the soul of sin over
    virtue of earth over heaven there is something diabolic in such
    pleasure especially when it is felt by a man intoxicated with
    love and full of religious respect for the virgin of his
    election this feeling is from a rational point of view absurd
    and in its tendencies immoral but it is delicious in its
    sacredly voluptuous subtlety defloration thus has its powerful
    fascination in the respect consciously or unconsciously felt for
    womans chastity in marriage the feeling is yet more
    complicated in deflowering his bride the christian that is
    any man brought up in a christian civilization has the feeling
    of committing a sort of sin for the flesh is for him always
    connected with sin which by a special privilege has for him
    become legitimate he has received a special permit to corrupt
    innocence hence the peculiar prestige for civilized christians
    of the wedding night sung by shelley in ecstatic  verses
        oh joy oh fear what will be done
        in the absence of the sun
    this feeling has however its normal range and is not per
    se a perversity though it may doubtless become so when unduly
    heightened by christian sentiment and especially if it leads as
    to some extent it has led in my russian correspondent to an
    abnormal feeling of the sexual attraction of girls who have only
    or scarcely reached the age of puberty the sexual charm of this
    period of girlhood is well illustrated in many of the poems of
    thomas ashe and it is worthy of note as perhaps supporting the
    contention that this attraction is based on christian feeling
    that ashe had been a clergyman an attentiveness to the womans
    pleasure remains in itself very far from a perversion but
    increases as colin scott has pointed out with civilization
    while its absencethe indifference to the partners pleasureis
    a perversion of the most degraded kind
there is no such instinctive demand on the womans part for innocence in
the man19 in the nature of things that could not be such emotion is
required for properly playing the part of the pursued it is by no means
an added attraction on the part of the pursuer there is however an
allied and corresponding desire which is very often clearly or latently
present in the woman a longing for pleasure that is stolen or forbidden
it is a mistake to suppose that this is an indication of viciousness or
perversity it appears to be an impulse that occurs quite naturally in
altogether innocent women the exciting charm of the risky and dangerous
naturally arises on a background of feminine shyness and timidity we may
trace its recognition at a very early stage of history in the story of eve
and the forbidden fruit that has so often been the symbol of the masculine
organs of sex it is on this ground that many have argued the folly of
laying external restrictions on women in matters of love thus in quoting
the great italian writer who afterwards became pope pius ii robert burton
remarked i am of neas sylvius mind those jealous italians do very
ill to lock up their wives for women are of such a disposition they will
mostly covet that which is denied most and offend least when they have
free liberty to trespass20
it is the spontaneous and natural instinct of the lover to desire modesty
in his mistress and by no means any calculated opinion on his part that
modesty is the sign of sexual emotion it remains true however that
modesty is an expression of feminine erotic impulse we have here one of
the instances of which there are so many of that curious and
instinctive harmony by which nature has sought the more effectively to
bring about the ends of courtship as to the fact itself there can be
little doubt it constantly forces itself on the notice of careful
observers and has long been decided in the affirmative by those who have
discussed the matter venette one of the earliest writers on the
psychology of sex after discussing the question at length decided that
the timid woman is a more ardent lover than the bold woman21 it is the
most pudent girl remarked restif de la bretonne whose experience of
women was so extensive the girl who blushes most who is most disposed
to the pleasures of love he adds that in girls and boys alike shyness
is a premature consciousness of sex22 this observation has even become
embodied in popular proverbs do as the lasses dosay no but take it
is a scotch saying to which corresponds the welsh saying the more
prudish the more unchaste23
    it is not at first quite clear why an excessively shy and
    modest woman should be the most apt for intimate relationships
    with a man and in such a case the woman is often charged with
    hypocrisy there is however no hypocrisy in the matter the shy
    and reserved woman holds herself aloof from intimacy in ordinary
    friendship because she is acutely sensitive to the judgments of
    others and fears that any seemingly immodest action may make an
    unfavorable opinion with a lover however in whose eyes she
    feels assured that her actions can not be viewed unfavorably
    these barriers of modesty fall down and the resulting intimacy
    becomes all the more fascinating to the woman because of its
    contrast with the extreme reserve she is impelled to maintain in
    other relationships it thus happens that many modest women who
    in nonsexual relationships with their own sex are not able to
    act with the physical unreserve not uncommon with women among
    themselves yet feel no such reserve with a man when they are
    once confident of his good opinion much the same is true of
    modest and sensitive men in their relations with women
this fundamental animal factor of modesty rooted in the natural facts of
the sexual life of the higher mammals and especially man obviously will
not explain all the phenomena of modesty we must turn to the other great
primary element of modesty the social factor
we cannot doubt that one of the most primitive and universal of the social
characteristics of man is an aptitude for disgust founded as it is on a
yet more primitive and animal aptitude for disgust which has little or no
social significance in nearly all races even the most savage we seem
to find distinct traces of this aptitude for disgust in the presence of
certain actions of others an emotion naturally reflected in the
individuals own actions and hence a guide to conduct notwithstanding
our gastric community of disgust with lower animals it is only in man
that this disgust seems to become transformed and developed to possess a
distinctly social character and to serve as a guide to social
conduct24 the objects of disgust vary infinitely according to the
circumstances and habits of particular races but the reaction of disgust
is fundamental throughout
the best study of the phenomena of disgust known to me is without doubt
professor richets25 richet concludes that it is the dangerous and
the useless which evoke disgust the digestive and sexual excretions and
secretions being either useless or in accordance with widespread
primitive ideas highly dangerous the genitoanal region became a
concentrated focus of disgust26 it is largely for this reason no
doubt that savage men exhibit modesty not only toward women but toward
their own sex and that so many of the lowest savages take great
precautions in obtaining seclusion for the fulfillment of natural
functions the statement now so often made that the primary object of
clothes is to accentuate rather than to conceal has in itas i shall
point out latera large element of truth but it is by no means a
complete account of the matter it seems difficult not to admit that
alongside the impulse to accentuate sexual differences there is also in
both men and women a genuine impulse to concealment among the most
primitive peoples and the invincible repugnance often felt by savages to
remove the girdle or apron is scarcely accounted for by the theory that
it is solely a sexual lure
in this connection it seems to me instructive to consider a special form
of modesty very strongly marked among savages in some parts of the world
i refer to the feeling of immodesty in eating where this feeling exists
modesty is offended when one eats in public the modest man retires to
eat indecency said cook was utterly unknown among the tahitians but
they would not eat together even brothers and sisters had their separate
baskets of provisions and generally sat some yards apart with their
backs to each other when they ate27 the warrua of central africa
cameron found when offered a drink put up a cloth before their faces
while they swallowed it and would not allow anyone to see them eat or
drink so that every man or woman must have his own fire and cook for
himself28 karl von den steinen remarks in his interesting book on
brazil that though the bakairi of central brazil have no feeling of shame
about nakedness they are ashamed to eat in public they retire to eat
and hung their heads in shamefaced confusion when they saw him innocently
eat in public hrolf vaughan stevens found that when he gave an orang
laut malay woman anything to eat she not only would not eat it if her
husband were present but if any man were present she would go outside
before eating or giving her children to eat29 thus among these peoples
the act of eating in public produces the same feelings as among ourselves
the indecent exposure of the body in public30
it is quite easy to understand how this arises whenever there is any
pressure on the means of subsistence as among savages at some time or
another there nearly always is it must necessarily arouse a profound and
mixed emotion of desire and disgust to see another person putting into his
stomach what one might just as well have put into ones own31 the
special secrecy sometimes observed by women is probably due to the fact
that women would be less able to resist the emotions that the act of
eating would arouse in onlookers as social feeling develops a man
desires not only to eat in safety but also to avoid being an object of
disgust and to spare his friends all unpleasant emotions hence it
becomes a requirement of ordinary decency to eat in private a man who
eats in public becomeslike the man who in our cities exposes his person
in publican object of disgust and contempt
long ago when a hospital student on midwifery duty in london slums i had
occasion to observe that among the women of the poor and more especially
in those who had lost the first bloom of youth modesty consisted chiefly
in the fear of being disgusting there was an almost pathetic anxiety in
the face of pain and discomfort not to be disgusting in the doctors
eyes this anxiety expressed itself in the ordinary symptoms of modesty
but as soon as the woman realized that i found nothing disgusting in
whatever was proper and necessary to be done under the circumstances it
almost invariably happened that every sign of modesty at once
disappeared32 in the special and elementary conditions of parturition
modesty is reduced to this one fear of causing disgust so that when that
is negated the emotion is nonexistent and the subject becomes without
effort as direct and natural as a little child a fellowstudent on
similar duty who also discovered for himself the same character of
modestythat if he was careful to guard her modesty the woman was careful
also and that if he was not the woman was notremarked on it to me with
sadness it seemed to him derogatory to womanhood that what he had been
accustomed to consider its supreme grace should be so superficial that he
could at will set limits to it33 i thought then as i think still that
that was rather a perversion of the matter and that nothing becomes
degrading because we happen to have learned something about its
operations but i am more convinced than ever that the fear of causing
disgusta fear quite distinct from that of losing a sexual lure or
breaking a rule of social etiquetteplays a very large part in the
modesty of the more modest sex and in modesty generally our venuses as
lucretius long since remarked and montaigne after him are careful to
conceal from their lovers the vita postscenia and that fantastic fate
which placed so near together the supreme foci of physical attraction and
physical repugnance has immensely contributed to build up all the
subtlest coquetries of courtship whatever stimulates selfconfidence and
lulls the fear of evoking disgustwhether it is the presence of a beloved
person in whose good opinion complete confidence is felt or whether it is
merely the grosser narcotizing influence of a slight degree of
intoxicationalways automatically lulls the emotion of modesty34
together with the animal factor of sexual refusal this social fear of
evoking disgust seems to me the most fundamental element in modesty
it is of course impossible to argue that the fact of the sacropubic
region of the body being the chief focus of concealment proves the
importance of this factor of modesty but it may fairly be argued that it
owes this position not merely to being the sexual centre but also as
being the excretory centre even among many lower mammals as well as
among birds and insects there is a wellmarked horror of dirt somewhat
disguised by the varying ways in which an animal may be said to define
dirt many animals spend more time and energy in the duties of
cleanliness than human beings and they often show wellmarked anxiety to
remove their own excrement or to keep away from it35 thus this element
of modesty also may be said to have an animal basis
it is on this animal basis that the human and social fear of arousing
disgust has developed its probably wide extension is indicated not only
by the strong feeling attached to the constant presence of clothing on
this part of the bodysuch constant presence being quite uncalled for if
the garment or ornament is merely a sort of sexual warpaintbut by the
repugnance felt by many savages very low down in the scale to the public
satisfaction of natural needs and to their more than civilized
cleanliness in this connection36 it is further of interest to note that
in some parts of the world the covering is not in front but behind
though of this fact there are probably other explanations among civilized
people also it may be added the final and invincible seat of modesty is
sometimes not around the pubes but the anus that is to say that in such
cases the fear of arousing disgust is the ultimate and most fundamental
element of modesty37
    the concentration of modesty around the anus is sometimes very
    marked many women feel so high a degree of shame and reserve
    with regard to this region that they are comparatively
    indifferent to an anterior examination of the sexual organs a
    similar feeling is not seldom found in men i would permit of an
    examination of my genitals by a medical man without any feeling
    of discomfort a correspondent writes but i think i would
    rather die than submit to any rectal examination even
    physicians have been known to endure painful rectal disorders for
    years rather than undergo examination
    among ordinary english girls a medical correspondent writes
    i have often noticed that the dislike and shame of allowing a
    man to have sexual intercourse with them when newly married is
    simply due to the fact that the sexual aperture is so closely
    apposed to the anus and bladder if the vulva and vagina were
    situated between a womans shoulder blades and a man had a
    separate instrument for coitus not used for any excretory
    purpose i do not think women would feel about intercourse as
    they sometimes do again in their ignorance of anatomy women
    often look upon the vagina and womb as part of the bowel and its
    exit of discharge and sometimes say for instance
    inflammation of the bowel when they mean womb again
    many perhaps most women believe that they pass water through
    the vagina and are ignorant of the existence of the separate
    urethral orifice again women associate the vulva with the anus
    and so feel ashamed of it even when speaking to their husbands
    or to a doctor or among themselves they have absolutely no name
    for the vulva i mean among the upper classes and people of
    gentle birth but speak of it as down below low down etc
    even though this feeling is largely based on wrong and ignorant
    ideas it must still be recognized that it is to some extent
    natural and inevitable how much is risked exclaims dugas in
    the privacies of love the results may be disillusion disgust
    the consciousness of physical imperfection of brutality or
    coldness of sthetic disenchantment of a sentimental shock
    seen or divined to be without modesty that is to say to have
    no fear of the ordeals of love one must be sure of ones self
    of ones grace of ones physical emotions of ones feelings
    and be sure moreover of the effect of all these on the nerves
    the imagination and the heart of another person let us suppose
    modesty reduced to sthetic discomfort to a womans fear of
    displeasing or of not seeming beautiful enough even thus
    defined how can modesty avoid being always awake and restless
    what woman could repeat without risk the tranquil action of
    phryne and even in that action who knows how much may not have
    been due to mere professional insolence dugas la pudeur
    revue philosophique november 1903 men and women schurtz

    certainly the capacity mutually to supplement and enrich each
    other but when this completion fails or is not sought the
    difference may easily become a strong antipathy and he proceeds
    to develop the widereaching significance of this psychic fact
i have emphasized the proximity of the excretory centres to the sexual
focus in discussing this important factor of modesty because in
analyzing so complex and elusive an emotion as modesty it is desirable to
keep as near as possible to the essential and fundamental facts on which
it is based it is scarcely necessary to point out that in ordinary
civilized society these fundamental facts are not usually present at the
surface of consciousness and may even be absent altogether on the
foundation of them may arise all sorts of idealized fears of delicate
reserves of sthetic refinements as the emotions of love become more
complex and more subtle and the crude simplicity of the basis on which
they finally rest becomes inevitably concealed
another factor of modesty which reaches a high development in savagery
is the ritual element especially the idea of ceremonial uncleanness
based on a dread of the supernatural influences which the sexual organs
and functions are supposed to exert it may be to some extent rooted in
the elements already referred to and it leads us into a much wider field
than that of modesty so that it is only necessary to touch slightly on it
here it has been exhaustively studied by frazer and by crawley offences
against the ritual rendered necessary by this mysterious dread though
more serious than offences against sexual reticence or the fear of causing
disgust are so obviously allied that they all reinforce one another and
cannot easily be disentangled
nearly everywhere all over the world at a primitive stage of thought and
even to some extent in the highest civilization the sight of the sexual
organs or of the sexual act the image or even the names of the sexual
parts of either man or woman are believed to have a curiously potent
influence sometimes beneficent but quite as often maleficent the two
kinds of influence may even be combined and riedel quoted by ploss and
bartels38 states that the ambon islanders carve a schematic
representation of the vulva on their fruit trees in part to promote the
productiveness of the trees and in part to scare any unauthorized person
who might be tempted to steal the fruit the precautions prescribed as
regards coitus at loango39 are evidently associated with religious
fears in ceylon again as a medical correspondent there informs me
where the penis is worshipped and held sacred a native never allows it to
be seen except under compulsion by a doctor and even a wife must
neither see it nor touch it nor ask for coitus though she must grant as
much as the husband desires all savage and barbarous peoples who have
attained any high degree of ceremonialism have included the functions not
only of sex but also of excretion more or less stringently within the
bounds of that ceremonialism40 it is only necessary to refer to the
jewish ritual books of the old testament to hesiod and to the customs
prevalent among mohammedan peoples modesty in eating also has its roots
by no means only in the fear of causing disgust but very largely in this
kind of ritual and crawley has shown how numerous and frequent among
primitive peoples are the religious implications of eating and
drinking41 so profound is this dread of the sacred mystery of sex and
so widespread is the ritual based upon it that some have imagined that
here alone we may find the complete explanation of modesty and salomon
reinach declares that at the origin of the emotion of modesty lies a
taboo42
    durkheim la prohibition de linceste lanne sociologique
    1898 p 50 arguing that whatever sense of repugnance women may
    inspire must necessarily reach the highest point around the womb
    which is hence subjected to the most stringent taboo
    incidentally suggests that here is an origin of modesty the
    sexual organs must be veiled at an early period to prevent the
    dangerous effluvia which they give off from reaching the
    environment the veil is often a method of intercepting magic
    action once constituted the practice would be maintained and
    transformed
    it was doubtless as a secondary and derived significance that the
    veil became as reinach le voile de loblation op cit pp
    299311 shows it was alike among the romans and in the catholic
    church the sign of consecration to the gods
at an early stage of culture again menstruation is regarded as a process
of purification a dangerous expulsion of vitiated humors hence the term
katharsis applied to it by the greeks hence also the medival view of
women mulier speciosa templum dificatum super cloacam said
boethius the sacropubic region in women because it includes the source
of menstruation thus becomes a specially heightened seat of taboo
according to the mosiac law leviticus chapter xx v 18 if a man
uncovered a menstruating woman both were to be cut off
it is probable that the mohammedan custom of veiling the face and head
really has its source solely in another aspect of this ritual factor of
modesty it must be remembered that this custom is not mohammedan in its
origin since it existed long previously among the arabians and is
described by tertullian43 in early arabia very handsome men also veiled
their faces in order to preserve themselves from the evil eye and it has
been conjectured with much probability that the origin of the custom of
women veiling their faces may be traced to this magicoreligious
precaution44 among the jews of the same period according to
bchler45 the women had their heads covered and never cut their hair
to appear in the streets without such covering would be like a prostitute
and was adequate ground for divorce adulterous women were punished by
uncovering their heads and cutting their hair it is possible though not
certain that st pauls obscure injunction to women to cover their heads
because of the angels may really be based on the ancient reason that
when uncovered they would be exposed to the wanton assaults of spirits 1
corinthians ch xi vv 5646 exactly as singhalese women believe
that they must keep the vulva covered lest demons should have intercourse
with them even at the present day st pauls injunction is still observed
by christendom which is however far from accepting or even perhaps
understanding the folklore ground on which are based such injunctions
    crawley thus summarizes some of the evidence concerning the
    significance of the veil
    sexual shyness not only in woman but in man is intensified at
    marriage and forms a chief feature of the dangerous sexual
    properties mutually feared when fully ceremonial the idea takes
    on the meaning that satisfaction of these feelings will lead to
    their neutralization as in fact it does the bridegroom in
    ancient sparta supped on the wedding night at the mens mess and
    then visited his bride leaving her before daybreak this
    practice was continued and sometimes children were born before
    the pair had ever seen each others faces by day at weddings in
    the babar islands the bridegroom has to hunt for his bride in a
    darkened room this lasts a good while if she is shy in south
    africa the bridegroom may not see his bride till the whole of
    the marriage ceremonies have been performed in persia a husband
    never sees his wife till he has consummated the marriage at
    marriages in south arabia the bride and bridegroom have to sit
    immovable in the same position from noon till midnight fasting
    in separate rooms the bride is attended by ladies and the groom
    by men they may not see each other till the night of the fourth
    day in egypt the groom cannot see the face of his bride even
    by a surreptitious glance till she is in his absolute
    possession then comes the ceremony which he performs of
    uncovering her face in egypt of course this has been
    accentuated by the seclusion and veiling of women in morocco at
    the feast before the marriage the bride and groom sit together
    on a sort of throne all the time the poor brides eyes are
    firmly closed and she sits amidst the revelry as immovable as a
    statue on the next day is the marriage she is conducted after
    dark to her future home accompanied by a crowd with lanterns and
    candles she is led with closed eyes along the street by two
    relatives each holding one of her hands the brides head is
    held in its proper position by a female relative who walks
    behind her she wears a veil and is not allowed to open her eyes
    until she is set on the bridal bed with a girl friend beside
    her amongst the zulus the bridal party proceeds to the house of
    the groom having the bride hidden amongst them they stand
    facing the groom while the bride sings a song her companions
    then suddenly break away and she is discovered standing in the
    middle with a fringe of beads covering her face amongst the
    people of kumaun the husband sees his wife first after the
    joining of hands amongst the bedui of north east africa the
    bride is brought on the evening of the weddingday by her girl
    friends to the grooms house she is closely muffled up amongst
    the jews of jerusalem the bride at the marriage ceremony
    stands under the nuptial canopy her eyes being closed that she
    may not behold the face of her future husband before she reaches
    the bridal chamber in melanesia the bride is carried to her new
    home on some ones back wrapped in many mats with palmfans
    held about her face because she is supposed to be modest and
    shy among the damaras the groom cannot see his bride for four
    days after marriage when a damara woman is asked in marriage
    she covers her face for a time with the flap of a headdress made
    for this purpose at the thlinkeet marriage ceremony the bride
    must look down and keep her head bowed all the time during the
    weddingday she remains hiding in a corner of the house and the
    groom is forbidden to enter at a yezedee marriage the bride is
    covered from head to foot with a thick veil and when arrived at
    her new home she retires behind a curtain in the corner of a
    darkened room where she remains for three days before her
    husband is permitted to see her in corea the bride has to cover
    her face with her long sleeves when meeting the bridegroom at
    the wedding the manchurian bride uncovers her face for the first
    time when she descends from the nuptial couch it is dangerous
    even to see dangerous persons sight is a method of contagion in
    primitive science and the idea coincides with the psychological
    aversion to see dangerous things and with sexual shyness and
    timidity in the customs noticed we can distinguish the feeling
    that it is dangerous to the bride for her husbands eyes to be
    upon her and the feeling of bashfulness in her which induces her
    neither to see him nor to be seen by him these ideas explain the
    origin of the bridal veil and similar concealments the bridal
    veil is used to take a few instances in china burmah corea
    russia bulgaria manchuria and persia and in all these cases
    it conceals the face entirely e crawley the mystic rose

so far it has only been necessary to refer incidentally to the connection
of modesty with clothing i have sought to emphasize the unquestionable
but often forgotten fact that modesty is in its origin independent of
clothing that physiological modesty takes precedence of anatomical
modesty and that the primary factors of modesty were certainly developed
long before the discovery of either ornament or garments the rise of
clothing probably had its first psychical basis on an emotion of modesty
already compositely formed of the elements we have traced both the main
elementary factors it must be noted must naturally tend to develop and
unite in a more complex thoughit may well bemuch less intense
emotion the impulse which leads the female animal as it leads some
african women when found without their girdles to squat firmly down on
the earth becomes a more refined and extended play of gesture and
ornament and garment a very notable advance i may remark is made when
this primary attitude of defence against the action of the male becomes a
defence against his eyes we may thus explain the spread of modesty to
various parts of the body even when we exclude the more special influence
of the evil eye the breasts very early become a focus of modesty in
women this may be observed among many naked or nearly naked negro
races the tendency of the nates to become the chief seat of modesty in
many parts of africa may probably be in large part thus explained since
the full development of the gluteal regions is often the greatest
attraction an african woman can possess47 the same cause contributes
doubtless to the face becoming in some races the centre of modesty we
see the influence of this defence against strange eyes in the special
precautions in gesture or clothing taken by the women in various parts of
the world against the more offensive eyes of civilized europeans
but in thus becoming directed only against sight and not against action
the gestures of modesty are at once free to become merely those of
coquetry when there is no real danger of offensive action there is no
need for more than playful defence and no serious anxiety should that
defence be taken as a disguised invitation thus the road is at once fully
open toward the most civilized manifestations of the comedy of courtship
in the same way the social fear of arousing disgust combines easily and
perfectly with any new development in the invention of ornament or
clothing as sexual lures even among the most civilized races it has often
been noted that the fashion of feminine garments as also sometimes the
use of scents has the double object of concealing and attracting it is
so with the little apron of the young savage belle the heightening of the
attraction is indeed a logical outcome of the fear of evoking disgust
it is possible as some ethnographists have observed48 that intercrural
cords and other primitive garments have a physical ground inasmuch as
they protect the most sensitive and unprotected part of the body
especially in women we may note in this connection the significant
remarks of k von den steinen who argues that among brazilian tribes the
object of the uluri etc is to obtain a maximum of protection for the
mucous membrane with a minimum of concealment among the eskimo as nansen
noted the corresponding intercrural cord is so thin as to be often
practically invisible this may be noted i may add in the excellent
photographs of eskimo women given by holm
but it is evident that in the beginning protection is to little or no
extent the motive for attaching foreign substances to the body thus the
tribes of central australia wear no clothes although they often suffer
from the cold but in addition to armlets neckbands and headbands
they have string or hair girdles with for the women a very small apron
and for the men a pubic tassel the latter does not conceal the organs
being no larger than a coin and often brilliantly coated with white
pipeclay especially during the progress of corrobborees when a large
number of men and women meet together it serves the purpose of drawing
attention to the organs49 when forster visited the unspoilt islanders
of the pacific early in the eighteenth century he tells us that though
they wore no clothes they found it necessary to cover themselves with
various ornaments especially on the sexual parts but though their
males he remarks were to all appearances equally anxious in this
respect with their females this part of their dress served only to make
that more conspicuous which it intended to hide50 he adds the
significant remark that these ideas of decency and modesty are only
observed at the age of sexual maturity just as in central australia
women may only wear aprons after the initiation of puberty
there are certain things said montaigne which are hidden in order to
be shown and there can be no doubt that the contention of westermarck
and others that ornament and clothing were in the first place intended
not to conceal or even to protect the body but in large part to render
it sexually attractive is fully proved51 we cannot in the light of
all that has gone before regard ornaments and clothing as the sole cause
of modesty but the feelings that are thus gathered around the garment
constitute a highly important factor of modesty
    among some australian tribes it is said that the sexual organs
    are only covered during their erotic dances and it is further
    said that in some parts of the world only prostitutes are
    clothed the scanty covering as westermarck observes was
    found to act as the most powerful obtainable sexual stimulus it
    is undoubtedly true that this statement may be made not merely of
    the savage but of the most civilized world all observers agree
    that the complete nudity of savages unlike the civilized
    dcollet or dtrouss has no suggestion of sexual
    allurement westermarck quotes numerous testimonies on this
    point op cit pp 192 et seq dr rw felkin remarks

    than in uganda where the penalty of death is inflicted on an
    adult found naked in the street edinburgh medical journal
    april 1884 a study of pictures or statuary will alone serve to
    demonstrate that nakedness is always chaster in its effects than
    partial clothing as a wellknown artist du maurier has
    remarked in trilby it is a fact well known to all painters
    and sculptors who have used the nude model except a few shady
    pretenders whose purity not being of the right sort has gone
    rank from too much watching that nothing is so chaste as nudity

    burton in the anatomy of melancholy part iii sect ii
    subsect 3 deals at length with the allurements of love and
    concludes that the greatest provocations of lust are from our
    apparel the artists model as one informs me is much less
    exposed to liberties from men when nude than when she is
    partially clothed and it may be noted that in paris studios the
    model who poses naked undresses behind a screen
    an admirable poetic rendering of this element in the philosophy
    of clothing has been given by herrick that master of erotic
    psychology in a lily in crystal where he argues that a lily
    in crystal and amber in a stream and strawberries in cream
    gain an added delight from semiconcealment and so he
    concludes we obtain
        a rule how far to teach
        your nakedness must reach
    in this connection also it is worth noting that stanley hall
    in a report based on returns from nearly a thousand persons
    mostly teachers the early sense of self american journal of
    psychology 1898 p 366 finds that of the three functions of
    clothesprotection ornament and lotzean selffeelingthe
    second is by far the most conspicuous in childhood the attitude
    of children is testimony to the primitive attitude toward
    clothing
    it cannot however be said that the use of clothing for the sake
    of showing the natural forms of the body has everywhere been
    developed in japan where nakedness is accepted without shame
    clothes are worn to cover and conceal and not to reveal the
    body it is so also in china a distinguished chinese
    gentleman who had long resided in europe once told baelz that
    he had gradually learnt to grasp the european point of view but
    that it would be impossible to persuade his fellowcountrymen
    that a woman who used her clothes to show off her figure could
    possibly possess the least trace of modesty baelz zeitschrift
    fr ethnologie 1901 heft 2 p 179
the great artistic elaboration often displayed by articles of ornament or
clothing even when very small and the factas shown by karl von den
steinen regarding the brazilian ulurithat they may serve as common
motives in general decoration sufficiently prove that such objects
attract rather than avoid attention and while there is an invincible
repugnance among some peoples to remove these articles such repugnance
being often strongest when the adornment is most minute others have no
such repugnance or are quite indifferent whether or not their aprons are
accurately adjusted the mere presence or possession of the article gives
the required sense of selfrespect of human dignity of sexual
desirability thus it is that to unclothe a person is to humiliate him
this was so even in homeric times for we may recall the threat of
ulysses to strip thyestes52
when clothing is once established another element this time a
socialeconomic element often comes in to emphasize its importance and
increase the anatomical modesty of women i mean the growth of the
conception of women as property waitz followed by schurtz and
letourneau has insisted that the jealousy of husbands is the primary
origin of clothing and indirectly of modesty diderot in the eighteenth
century had already given clear expression to the same view it is
undoubtedly true that only married women are among some peoples clothed
the unmarried women though full grown remaining naked in many parts of
the world also as mantegazza and others have shown where the men are
naked and the women covered clothing is regarded as a sort of disgrace
and men can only with difficulty be persuaded to adopt it before marriage
a woman was often free and not bound to chastity and at the same time
was often naked after marriage she was clothed and no longer free to
the husbands mind the garment appearsillogically though naturallya
moral and physical protection against any attack on his property53 thus
a new motive was furnished this time somewhat artificially for making
nakedness in women at all events disgraceful as the conception of
property also extended to the fathers right over his daughters and the
appreciation of female chastity developed this motive spread to unmarried
as well as married women a woman on the west coast of africa must always
be chaste because she is first the property of her parents and afterwards
of her husband54 and even in the seventeenth century of christendom so
able a thinker as bishop burnet furnished precisely the same reason for
feminine chastity55 this conception probably constituted the chief and
most persistent element furnished to the complex emotion of modesty by the
barbarous stages of human civilization
this economic factor necessarily involved the introduction of a new moral
element into modesty if a womans chastity is the property of another
person it is essential that she shall be modest in order that men may not
be tempted to incur the penalties involved by the infringement of property
rights thus modesty is strictly inculcated on women in order that men may
be safeguarded from temptation the fact was overlooked that modesty is
itself a temptation immodesty being on this ground disapproved by men
a new motive for modesty is furnished to women in the book which the
knight of the tower landry wrote in the fourteenth century for the
instruction of his daughters this factor of modesty is navely revealed
he tells his daughters of the trouble that david got into through the
thoughtlessness of bathsheba and warns them that every woman ought
religiously to conceal herself when dressing and washing and neither out
of vanity nor yet to attract attention show either her hair or her neck
or her breast or any part which ought to be covered hinton went so far
as to regard what he termed body modesty as entirely a custom imposed
upon women by men with the object of preserving their own virtue while
this motive is far from being the sole source of modesty it must
certainly be borne in mind as an inevitable outcome of the economic factor
of modesty
in europe it seems probable that the generally accepted conceptions of
medival chivalry were not without influence in constituting the forms in
which modesty shows itself among us in the early middle ages there seems
to have been a much greater degree of physical familiarity between the
sexes than is commonly found among barbarians elsewhere there was
certainly considerable promiscuity in bathing and indifference to
nakedness it seems probable as durkheim points out56 that this state
of things was modified in part by the growing force of the dictates of
christian morality which regarded all intimate approaches between the
sexes as sinful and in part by the influence of chivalry with its
sthetic and moral ideals of women as the representative of all the
delicacies and elegancies of civilization this ideal was regarded as
incompatible with the familiarities of the existing social relationships
between the sexes and thus a separation which at first existed only in
art and literature began by a curious reaction to exert an influence on
real life
the chief new featureit is scarcely a new elementadded to modesty when
an advanced civilization slowly emerges from barbarism is the elaboration
of its social ritual57 civilization expands the range of modesty and
renders it at the same time more changeable the french seventeenth
century and the english eighteenth represent early stages of modern
european civilization and they both devoted special attention to the
elaboration of the minute details of modesty the frequenters of the hotel
rambouillet the prcieuses satirized by molire were not only engaged
in refining the language they were refining feelings and ideas and
enlarging the boundaries of modesty58 in england such famous and
popular authors as swift and sterne bear witness to a new ardor of modesty
in the sudden reticences the dashes and the asterisks which are found
throughout their works the altogether new quality of literary prurience
of which sterne is still the classical example could only have arisen on
the basis of the new modesty which was then overspreading society and
literature idle people mostly no doubt the women in salons and
drawingrooms people more familiar with books than with the realities of
life now laid down the rules of modesty and were ever enlarging it ever
inventing new subtleties of gesture and speech which it would be immodest
to neglect and which are ever being rendered vulgar by use and ever
changing
    it was at this time probably that the custom of inventing an
    arbitrary private vocabulary of words and phrases for the purpose
    of disguising references to functions and parts of the body
    regarded as immodest and indecent first began to become common
    such private slang growing up independently in families and
    especially among women as well as between lovers is now almost
    universal it is not confined to any european country and has
    been studied in italy by niceforo il gergo 1897 cap 1 and
    2 who regards it as a weapon of social defence against an
    inquisitive or hostile environment since it enables things to be
    said with a meaning which is unintelligible to all but the
    initiated person while it is quite true that the custom is
    supported by the consciousness of its practical advantages it
    has another source in a desire to avoid what is felt to be the
    vulgar immodesty of direct speech this is sufficiently shown by
    the fact that such slang is mostly concerned with the sacropubic
    sphere it is one of the chief contributions to the phenomena of
    modesty furnished by civilization the claims of modesty having
    effected the clothing of the body the impulse of modesty finds a
    further sphere of activityhalfplayful yet wholly
    imperativein the clothing of language
    modesty of speech has however a deep and primitive basis
    although in modern europe it only became conspicuous at the
    beginning of the eighteenth century all over the world as
    dufour put it to do is good to say is bad reticences of
    speech are not adequately accounted for by the statement that
    modesty tends to irradiate from the action to the words
    describing the action for there is a tendency for modesty to be
    more deeply rooted in the words than in the actions modest
    women as kleinpaul truly remarks have a much greater horror
    of saying immodest things than of doing them they believe that
    figleaves were especially made for the mouth kleinpaul
    sprache ohne worte p 309 it is a tendency which is linked
    on to the religious and ritual feeling which we have already
    found to be a factor of modesty and which even when applied to
    language appears to have an almost or quite instinctive basis
    for it is found among the most primitive savages who very
    frequently regard a name as too sacred or dangerous to utter
    among the tribes of central australia in addition to his
    ordinary name each individual has his sacred or secret name
    only known to the older and fully initiated members of his own
    totemic group among the warramunga it is not permitted to women
    to utter even a mans ordinary name though she knows it
    spencer and gillen northern tribes of central australia p
    581 in the mysterious region of sex this feeling easily takes
    root in many parts of the world men use among themselves and
    women use among themselves words and even languages which they
    may not use without impropriety in speaking to persons of the
    opposite sex and it has been shown that exogamy or the fact
    that the wife belongs to a different tribe will not always
    account for this phenomenon crawley the mystic rose p 46
    a special vocabulary for the generative organs and functions is
    very widespread thus in northwest central queensland there is
    both a decent and an indecent vocabulary for the sexual parts in
    mitakoodi language for instance mene may be used for the
    vulva in the best aboriginal society but koonja and pukkil

    words known to the natives w roth ethnological studies among
    the queensland aborigines p 184 among the malays puki is

    same thing is found in europe today and is sometimes more
    marked among young peasant women than among those of better

    necessity for using any definite name
    singular as it may seem the romans who in their literature
    impress us by their vigorous and naked grip of the most private
    facts of life showed in familiar intercourse a dread of obscene
    languagea dread ultimately founded it is evident on religious
    groundsfar exceeding that which prevails among ourselves today
    in civilization it is remarkable dufour observes that the
    prostitutes of ancient rome would have blushed to say an indecent
    word in public the little tender words used between lovers and
    their mistresses were not less correct and innocent when the
    mistress was a courtesan and the lover an erotic poet he called
    her his rose his queen his goddess his dove his light his
    star and she replied by calling him her jewel her honey her
    bird her ambrosia the apple of her eye and never with any
    licentious interjection but only i will love amabo a

    of obscenity that even physicians were compelled to use a

    in modern europe as seems fairly evident from the early
    realistic dramatic literature of various countries no special
    horror of speaking plainly regarding the sacropubic regions and
    their functions existed among the general population until the
    seventeenth century there is however one marked exception
    such a feeling clearly existed as regards menstruation it is not
    difficult to see why it should have begun at this function we
    have here not only a function confined to one sex and therefore
    easily lending itself to a vocabulary confined to one sex but
    what is even of more importance the belief which existed among
    the romans as elsewhere throughout the world concerning the
    specially dangerous and mysterious properties of menstruation
    survived throughout medival times see eg ploss and bartels
    das weib bd i xiv also havelock ellis man and woman
    fourth ed ch xi the very name menses monthlies is a
    euphemism and most of the old scientific names for this function
    are similarly vague as regards popular feminine terminology
    previous to the eighteenth century schurig gives us fairly ample
    information parthenologia 1729 pp 27 et seq he remarks
    that both in latin and germanic countries menstruation was
    commonly designated by some term equivalent to flowers
    because he says it is a blossoming that indicates the
    possibility of fruit german peasant women he tells us called
    it the rosewreath rosenkrantz among the other current
    feminine names for menstruation which he gives some are purely
    fanciful thus the italian women dignified the function with the
    title of marchese magnifico german ladies again would use
    the locution i have had a letter or would say that their
    cousin or aunt had arrived these are closely similar to the
    euphemisms still used by women
    it should be added that euphemisms for menstruation are not
    confined to europe and are found among savages according to
    hill tout journal of the anthropological institute 1904 p
    320 and 1905 p 137 one of these euphemisms was putting on
    the moccasin and in another branch of the same people putting
    the knees together going outside in allusion to the
    customary seclusion at this period in a solitary hut and so on
it would however be a mistake to suppose that this process is an
intensification of modesty it is on the contrary an attenuation of it
the observances of modesty become merely a part of a vast body of rules of
social etiquette though a somewhat stringent part on account of the vague
sense still persisting of a deeplying natural basis it is a significant
coincidence that the eighteenth century which was marked by this new
extension of the social ritual of modesty also saw the first appearance
of a new philosophic impulse not merely to analyze but to dissolve the
conception of modesty this took place more especially in france
the swift rise to supremacy during the seventeenth century of logical
and rational methods of thinking in conjunction with the new development
of geometrical and mathematical science led in the eighteenth century to
a widespread belief in france that human customs and human society ought
to be founded on a strictly logical and rational basis it was a belief
which ignored those legitimate claims of the emotional nature which the
nineteenth century afterwards investigated and developed but it was of
immense service to mankind in clearing away useless prejudices and
superstitions and it culminated in the reforms of the great revolution
which most other nations have since been painfully struggling to attain
modesty offered a tempting field for the eighteenth century philosophic
spirit to explore
the manner in which the most distinguished and adventurous minds of the
century approached it can scarcely be better illustrated than by a
conversation reported by madame depinay which took place in 1750 at the
table of mlle quinault the eminent actress a fine virtue duclos
remarked which one fastens on in the morning with pins he proceeded to
argue that a moral law must hold good always and everywhere which
modesty does not saintlambert the poet observed that it must be
acknowledged that one can say nothing good about innocence without being a
little corrupted and duclos added or of modesty without being
impudent saintlambert finally held forth with much poetic enthusiasm
concerning the desirability of consummating marriages in public59 this
view of modesty combined with the introduction of greek fashions gained
ground to such an extent that towards the end of the century women to the
detriment of their health were sometimes content to dress in transparent
gauze and even to walk abroad in the champs elyses without any clothing
that however was too much for the public60 the final outcome of the
eighteenth century spirit in this direction was as we know by no means
the dissolution of modesty but it led to a clearer realization of what is
permanent in its organic foundations and what is merely temporary in its
shifting manifestations that is a realization which is no mean task to
achieve and is difficult for many even yet so intelligent a traveler as
mrs bishop miss bird on her first visit to japan came to the
conclusion that japanese women had no modesty because they had no
objection to being seen naked when bathing twenty years later she
admitted to dr baelz that she had made a mistake and that a woman may
be naked and yet behave like a lady61 in civilized countries the
observances of modesty differ in different regions and in different
social classes but however various the forms may be the impulse itself
remains persistent62
modesty has thus come to have the force of a tradition a vague but
massive force bearing with special power on those who cannot reason and
yet having its root in the instincts of all people of all classes63 it
has become mainly transformed into the allied emotion of decency which
has been described as modesty fossilized into social customs the
emotion yields more readily than in its primitive state to any
sufficientlystrong motive even fashion in the more civilized countries
can easily inhibit anatomical modesty and rapidly exhibit or accentuate
in turn almost any part of the body while the savage indian woman of
america the barbarous woman of some mohammedan countries can scarcely
sacrifice her modesty in the pangs of childbirth even when among
uncivilized races the focus of modesty may be said to be eccentric and
arbitrary it still remains very rigid in such savage and barbarous
countries modesty possesses the strength of a genuine and irresistible
instinct in civilized countries however anyone who places
considerations of modesty before the claims of some real human need
excites ridicule and contempt

is very ancient and had impressed sculptors at a far earlier period

the milk and expresses the idea of exuberance and that the attitude of
the venus of medici as a symbol of modesty came later he remarks that as
regards both hands this attitude may be found in a figurine of cyprus
2000 years before christ this is no doubt correct and i may add that
babylonian figurines of ishtar the goddess of fertility represent her as
clasping her hands to her breasts or her womb
10 when there is no sexual fear the impulse of modesty may be entirely
inhibited french ladies under the old rgime as a franklin points out
in his vie prive dautrefois sometimes showed no modesty towards their
valets not admitting the possibility of any sexual advance and a lady
would for example stand up in her bath while a valet added hot water by
pouring it between her separated feet
11 i do not hereby mean to deny a certain degree of normal periodicity
even to the human male but such periodicity scarcely involves any element
of sexual fear or attitude of sexual defence in man because it is too
slight to involve complete latency of the sexual functions in other
species because latency of sexual function in the male is always
accompanied by corresponding latency in the female

with however special reference to sexual taboo i may remark that
english people of lower class especially women are often modest about
eating in the presence of people of higher class this feeling is no
doubt due in part to the consciousness of defective etiquette but that
very consciousness is in part a development of the fear of causing
disgust which is a component of modesty
30 shame in regard to eating it may be added occasionally appears as a
neurasthenic obsession in civilization and has been studied as a form of
psychasthenia by janet see eg raymond and janet les obsessions et
la psychasthnie vol ii p 386 the case of a young girl of 24 who
from the age of 12 or 13 the epoch of puberty had been ashamed to eat in
public thinking it nasty and ugly to do so and arguing that it ought
only to be done in private like urination
31 desire and disgust are curiously blended remarks crawley the
mystic rose p 139 when with ones own desire unsatisfied one sees
the satisfaction of another and here we may see the altruistic stage
beginning this has two sides the fear of causing desire in others and
the fear of causing disgust in each case personal isolation is the
psychological result
32 hohenemser argues that the fear of causing disgust cannot be a part
of shame but he also argues that shame is simply psychic stasis and it
is quite easy to see as in the above case that the fear of causing
disgust is simply a manifestation of psychic stasis there is a conflict
in the womans mind between the idea of herself which she has already
given and the more degraded idea of herself which she fears she is likely
to give and this conflict is settled when she is made to feel that the
first idea may still be maintained under the new circumstances
33 we neither of us knew that we had merely made afresh a very ancient
discovery casanova more than a century ago quoted the remark of a
friend of his that the easiest way to overcome the modesty of a woman is
to suppose it nonexistent and he adds a saying which he attributes to
clement of alexandria that modesty which seems so deeply rooted in
women only resides in the linen that covers them and vanishes when it
vanishes the passage to which casanova referred occurs in the
pdagogus and has already been quoted the observation seems to have
appealed strongly to the fathers always glad to make a point against
women and i have met with it in cyprians de habitu feminarum it also
occurs in jeromes treatise against jovinian jerome with more scholarly
instinct rightly presents the remark as a quotation scribit herodotus
quod mulier cum veste deponat et verecundiam in herodotus the saying is
attributed to gyges book i chapter viii we may thus trace very far
back into antiquity an observation which in english has received its
classical expression from chaucer who in his wife of baths prologue
has
    he sayde a woman cast hir shame away
    when she cast of hir smok
i need not point out that the analysis of modesty offered above robs this
venerable saying of any sting it may have possessed as a slur upon women
in such a case modesty is largely a doubt as to the spectators attitude
and necessarily disappears when that doubt is satisfactorily resolved as
we have seen the central australian maidens were very modest with regard
to the removal of their single garment but when that removal was
accomplished and accepted they were fearless
34 the same result occurs more markedly under the deadening influence of
insanity grimaldi il manicomio moderno 1888 found that modesty is
lacking in 50 per cent of the insane

the blush the sanction of modestythe phenomena of blushinginfluences
which modify the aptitude to blushdarkness concealment of the face
etc
it is impossible to contemplate this series of phenomena so radically
persistent whatever its changes of form and so constant throughout every
stage of civilization without feeling that although modesty cannot
properly be called an instinct there must be some physiological basis to
support it undoubtedly such a basis is formed by that vasomotor mechanism
of which the most obvious outward sign is in human beings the blush all
the allied emotional forms of fearshame bashfulness timidityare to
some extent upheld by this mechanism but such is especially the case with
the emotion we are now concerned with64 the blush is the sanction of
modesty
    the blush is indeed only a part almost perhaps an accidental
    part of the organic turmoil with which it is associated
    partridge who has studied the phenomena of blushing in one
    hundred and twenty cases pedagogical seminary april 1897
    finds that the following are the general symptoms tremors near
    the waist weakness in the limbs pressure trembling warmth
    weight or beating in the chest warm wave from feet upward
    quivering of heart stoppage and then rapid beating of heart
    coldness all over followed by heat dizziness tingling of toes
    and fingers numbness something rising in throat smarting of
    eyes singing in ears prickling sensations of face and pressure
    inside head partridge considers that the disturbance is
    primarily central a change in the cerebral circulation and that
    the actual redness of the surface comes late in the nerve storm
    and is really but a small part of it
    there has been some discussion as to why and indeed how far
    blushing is confined to the face henle ueber das errthen
    thought that we blush in the face because all nervous phenomena
    produced by mental states appear first in the face owing to the
    anatomical arrangement of the nerves of the body darwin
    expression of the emotions argued that attention to a part
    tends to produce capillary activity in the part and that the
    face has been the chief object of attention it has also been
    argued on the other hand that the blush is the vestigial
    remains of a general erethism of sex in which shame originated
    that the blush was thus once more widely diffused and is so
    still among the women of some lower races its limitation to the
    face being due to sexual selection and the enhanced beauty thus
    achieved fr once had occasion to examine when completely
    nude a boy of thirteen whose sexual organs were deformed when
    accused of masturbation he became covered by a blush which spread
    uniformly over his face neck body and limbs before and behind
    except only the hands and feet fr asks whether such a
    universal blush is more common than we imagine or whether the
    state of nudity favors its manifestation comptes rendus
    socit de biologie april 1 1905 it may be added that
    partridge mentions one case in which the hands blushed
the sexual relationships of blushing are unquestionable it occurs chiefly
in women it attains its chief intensity at puberty and during
adolescence its most common occasion is some more or less sexual
suggestion among one hundred and sixtytwo occasions of blushing
enumerated by partridge by far the most frequent cause was teasing
usually about the other sex an erection it has been said is a
blushing of the penis stanley hall seems to suggest that the sexual
blush is a vicarious genital flushing of blood diverted from the genital
sphere by an inhibition of fear just as in girls giggling is also very
frequently a vicarious outlet of shame the sexual blush would thus be the
outcome of an ancestral sexfear it is as an irradiation of sexual
erethism that the blush may contain an element of pleasure65
    bloch remarks that the blush is sexual because reddening of the
    face as well as of the genitals is an accompaniment of sexual
    emotion beitrge zur tiologie der psychopathia sexualis teil
    ii p 39 do you not think a correspondent writes that
    the sexual blush at least really represents a vasorelaxor
    effect quite the same as erection the embarrassment which arises
    is due to a perception of this fact under circumstances which are
    felt to be unsuited for such a condition there may arise the
    fear of awakening disgust by the exhibition of a state which is
    out of place i have noticed that such a blush is produced when a
    sufficiently young and susceptible woman is pumped full of
    compliments this blush seems accompanied by pleasure which does
    not always change to fear or disgust but is felt to be
    attractive when discomfort arises most women say that they feel
    this because it looks as if they had no control over
    themselves when they feel that there is no need for control
    they no longer feel fear and the relaxor effect has a wider
    field of operation producing a general rosiness erection of
    spinal sexual organs etc such a blush would thus be a partial
    sexual equivalent and allow of the inhibition of other sexual
    effects through the warning it gives and the fear aroused as
    well as being in itself a slight outlet of relaxor energy when
    the relationships of the persons concerned allow freedom to the
    special sexual stimuli as in marriage blushing does not occur
    so often and when it does it has not so often the consequent of
    fear
    there can be no doubt that the blush is sexually attractive the
    blush is the expression of an impulse to concealment and flight
    which tends automatically to arouse in the beholder the
    corresponding impulse of pursuit so that the central situation
    of courtship is at once presented women are more or less
    conscious of this as well as men and this recognition is an
    added source of embarrassment when it cannot become a source of
    pleasure the ancient use of rouge testifies to the beauty of the
    blush and darwin stated that in turkish slavemarkets the
    girls who readily blushed fetched the highest prices to evoke a
    blush even by producing embarrassment is very commonly a cause
    of masculine gratification
    savages both men and women blush even beneath a dusky skin for
    the phenomenon of blushing among different races see waitz
    anthropologie der naturvlker bd i pp 149150 and it is
    possible that natural selection as well as sexual selection has
    been favorable to the development of the blush it is scarcely an
    accident that as has been often observed criminals or the
    antisocial element of the communitywhether by the habits of
    their lives or by congenital abnormalityblush less easily than
    normal persons kroner das krperliche gefhl 1887 p 130
    remarks the origin of a specific connection between shame and
    blushing is the work of a social selection it is certainly an
    immediate advantage for a man not to blush indirectly however
    it is a disadvantage because in other ways he will be known as
    shameless and on that account as a rule he will be shut out
    from propagation this social selection will be specially
    exercised on the female sex and on this account women blush to
    a greater extent and more readily than men
the importance of the blush and the emotional confusion behind it as the
sanction of modesty is shown by the significant fact that by lulling
emotional confusion it is possible to inhibit the sense of modesty in
other words we are here in the presence of a fearto a large extent a
sexfearimpelling to concealment and dreading selfattention this fear
naturally disappears even though its ostensible cause remains when it
becomes apparent that there is no reason for fear
that is the reason why nakedness in itself has nothing to do with modesty
or immodesty it is the conditions under which the nakedness occurs which
determine whether or not modesty will be roused if none of the factors of
modesty are violated if no embarrassing selfattention is excited if
there is a consciousness of perfect propriety alike in the subject and in
the spectator nakedness is entirely compatible with the most scrupulous
modesty a duval a pupil of ingres tells that a female model was once
quietly posing completely nude at the cole des beaux arts suddenly she
screamed and ran to cover herself with her garments she had seen a
workman on the roof gazing inquisitively at her through a skylight66
and paola lombroso describes how a lady a diplomatists wife who went to
a gathering where she found herself the only woman in evening dress felt
to her own surprise such sudden shame that she could not keep back her
tears
it thus comes about that the emotion of modesty necessarily depends on
the feelings of the people around the absence of the emotion by no means
signifies immodesty provided that the reactions of modesty are at once
set in motion under the stress of a spectators eye that is seen to be
lustful inquisitive or reproachful this is proved to be the case among
primitive peoples everywhere the japanese woman naked as in daily life
she sometimes is remains unconcerned because she excites no disagreeable
attention but the inquisitive and unmannerly europeans eye at once
causes her to feel confusion stratz a physician and one moreover who
had long lived among the javanese who frequently go naked found that
naked japanese women felt no embarrassment in his presence
it is doubtless as a cloak to the blush that we must explain the curious
influence of darkness in restraining the manifestations of modesty as
many lovers have discovered and as we may notice in our cities after
dark this influence of darkness in inhibiting modesty is a very ancient
observation burton in the anatomy of melancholy quotes from dandinus
the saying nox facit impudentes directly associating this with
blushing and bargagli the siennese novelist wrote in the sixteenth
century that it is commonly said of women that they will do in the dark
what they would not do in the light it is true that the immodesty of a
large city at night is to some extent explained by the irruption of
prostitutes at that time prostitutes being habitually nearer to the
threshold of immodesty are more markedly affected by this influence but
it is an influence to which the most modest women are at all events in
some degree susceptible it has indeed been said that a woman is always
more her real self in the dark than in the glare of daylight this is part
of what chamberlain calls her nightinspiration
    traces of the nightinspiration of the influence of the
    primitive firegroup abound in woman indeed it may be said
    the life of southern europe and of american society of today
    illustrates this point abundantly that she is in a sense a
    nightbeing for the activity physical and moral of modern
    women revealed eg in the dance and the nocturnal
    intellectualities of society in this direction is remarkable
    perhaps we may style a good deal of her ordinary daylabor as
    rest or the commonplaces and banalities of her existence her
    evening and night life being the true side of her activities
    af chamberlain work and rest popular science monthly
    march 1902 giessler who has studied the general influence of
    darkness on human psychic life reaches conclusions which
    harmonize with these cm giessler der einfluss der dunkelheit
    auf das seelenleben des menschen vierteljahrsschrift fr
    wissenschaftliche philosophie 1904 pp 255279 i have not
    been able to see giesslers paper but according to a summary of
    it he comes to the result that in the dark the souls activities
    are nearer to its motor pole than to its sensitive pole and that
    there is a tendency for phenomena belonging to the early period
    of development to be prominent motor memory functioning more
    than representative memory attention more than apperception
    imagination more than logical thinking egoistic more than
    altruistic morals
it is curious to note that shortsightedness naturally though
illogically tends to exert the same influence as darkness in this
respect i am assured by shortsighted persons of both sexes that they are
much more liable to the emotions of shyness and modesty with their glasses
than without them such persons with difficulty realize that they are not
so dim to others as others are to them to be in the company of a blind
person seems also to be a protection against shyness67 it is
interesting to learn that congenitally blind children are as sensitive to
appearances as normal children and blush as readily68 this would seem
to be due to the fact that the habitually blind have permanently adjusted
their mental focus to that of normal persons and react in the same manner
as normal persons blindness is not for them as it is for the
shortsighted without their glasses a temporary and relative almost
unconscious refuge from clear vision
it is of course not as the mere cloak of a possible blush that darkness
gives courage it is because it lulls detailed selfrealization such
conscious selfrealization being always a source of fears and the blush
their definite symbol and visible climax it is to the blush that we must
attribute a curious complementary relationship between the face and the
sacropubic region as centres of anatomical modesty the women of some
african tribes who go naked emin bey remarked cover the face with the
hand under the influence of modesty martial long since observed lib
iii lxviii that when an innocent girl looks at the penis she gazes
through her fingers where as among many mohammedan peoples the face is
the chief focus of modesty the exposure of the rest of the body
including sometimes even the sacropubic region and certainly the legs
and thighs often becomes a matter of indifference69
this concealment of the face is more than a convention it has a
psychological basis we may observe among ourselves the wellmarked
feminine tendency to hide the face in order to cloak a possible blush and
to hide the eyes as a method of lulling selfconsciousness a method
fabulously attributed to the ostrich with the same end of concealment70
a woman who is shy with her lover will sometimes experience little or no
difficulty in showing any part of her person provided she may cover her
face when in gynecological practice examination of the sexual organs is
necessary women frequently find evident satisfaction in concealing the
face with the hands although not the slightest attention is being
directed toward the face and when an unsophisticated woman is betrayed
into a confession which affects her modesty she is apt to turn her back to
her interlocutor when the face of woman is covered it has been said
her heart is bared and the catholic church has recognized this
psychological truth by arranging that in the confessional the penitents
face shall not be visible the gay and innocent freedom of southern women
during carnival is due not entirely to the permitted license of the season
or the concealment of identity but to the mask that hides the face in
england during queen elizabeths reign and at the restoration it was
possible for respectable women to be present at the theatre even during
the performance of the most freespoken plays because they wore masks
the fan has often subserved a similar end71
all such facts serve to show that though the forms of modesty may change
it is yet a very radical constituent of human nature in all stages of
civilization and that it is to a large extent maintained by the
mechanism of blushing

fear of causing disgust may be ascribed the objection of men to undress

summary of the factors of modestythe future of modestymodesty an
essential element of love
we have seen that the factors of modesty are numerous to attempt to
explain modesty by dismissing it as merely an example of psychic
paralysis of stauung is to elude the problem by the statement of what
is little more than a truism modesty is a complexus of emotions with
their concomitant ideas which we must unravel to comprehend
we have found among the factors of modesty 1 the primitive animal
gesture of sexual refusal on the part of the female when she is not at
that moment of her generative life at which she desires the males
advances 2 the fear of arousing disgust a fear primarily due to the
close proximity of the sexual centre to the points of exit of those
excretions which are useless and unpleasant even in many cases to
animals 3 the fear of the magic influence of sexual phenomena and the
ceremonial and ritual practices primarily based on this fear and
ultimately passing into simple rules of decorum which are signs and
guardians of modesty 4 the development of ornament and clothing
concomitantly fostering alike the modesty which represses male sexual
desire and the coquetry which seeks to allure it 5 the conception of
women as property imparting a new and powerful sanction to an emotion
already based on more natural and primitive facts
it must always be remembered that these factors do not usually occur
separately very often they are all of them implied in a single impulse of
modesty we unravel the cord in order to investigate its construction but
in real life the strands are more or less indistinguishably twisted
together
it may still be asked finally whether on the whole modesty really
becomes a more prominent emotion as civilization advances i do not think
this position can be maintained it is a great mistake as we have seen
to suppose that in becoming extended modesty also becomes intensified on
the contrary this very extension is a sign of weakness among savages
modesty is far more radical and invincible than among the civilized of
the araucanian women of chile treutler has remarked that they are
distinctly more modest than the christian white population and such
observations might be indefinitely extended it is as we have already
noted in a new and crude civilization eager to mark its separation from
a barbarism it has yet scarcely escaped that we find an extravagant and
fantastic anxiety to extend the limits of modesty in life and art and
literature in older and more mature civilizationsin classical
antiquity in old japan in francemodesty while still a very real
influence becomes a much less predominant and allpervading influence in
life it becomes subservient to human use in art to beauty in literature
to expression
among ourselves we may note that modesty is a much more invincible motive
among the lower social classes than among the more cultivated classes
this is so even when we should expect the influence of occupation to
induce familiarity thus i have been told of a balletgirl who thinks it
immodest to bathe in the fashion customary at the seaside and cannot make
up her mind to do so but she appears on the stage every night in tights
as a matter of course while fanny kemble in her reminiscences tells
of an actress accustomed to appear in tights who died a martyr to
modesty rather than allow a surgeon to see her inflamed knee modesty is
indeed a part of selfrespect but in the fullydeveloped human being
selfrespect itself holds in check any excessive modesty72
we must remember moreover that there are more definite grounds for the
subordination of modesty with the development of civilization we have
seen that the factors of modesty are many and that most of them are based
on emotions which make little urgent appeal save to races in a savage or
barbarous condition thus disgust as richet has truly pointed out
necessarily decreases as knowledge increases73 as we analyze and
understand our experiences better so they cause us less disgust a rotten
egg is disgusting but the chemist feels no disgust toward sulphuretted
hydrogen while a solution of propylamin does not produce the disgusting
impression of that human physical uncleanliness of which it is an odorous
constituent as disgust becomes analyzed and as selfrespect tends to
increased physical purity so the factor of disgust in modesty is
minimized the factor of ceremonial uncleanness again which plays so
urgent a part in modesty at certain stages of culture is today without
influence except in so far as it survives in etiquette in the same way
the socialeconomic factor of modesty based on the conception of women as
property belongs to a stage of human development which is wholly alien to
an advanced civilization even the most fundamental impulse of all the
gesture of sexual refusal is normally only imperative among animals and
savages thus civilization tends to subordinate if not to minimize
modesty to render it a grace of life rather than a fundamental social law
of life but an essential grace of life it still remains and whatever
delicate variations it may assume we can scarcely conceive of its
disappearance
in the art of love however it is more than a grace it must always be
fundamental modesty is not indeed the last word of love but it is the
necessary foundation for all loves most exquisite audacities the
foundation which alone gives worth and sweetness to what snancour calls
its delicious impudence74 without modesty we could not have nor
rightly value at its true worth that bold and pure candor which is at
once the final revelation of love and the seal of its sincerity
    even hohenemserwho argues that for the perfect man there could
    be no shame because shame rests on an inner conflict in ones
    own personality and the perfect man knows no inner
    conflictbelieves that since humanity is imperfect modesty
    possesses a high and indeed symptomatic value for its
    presence shows that according to the measure of a mans ideal
    personality his valuations are established
    dugas goes further and asserts that the ideals of modesty
    develop with human development and forever take on new and finer
    forms there is he declares a very close relationship
    between naturalness or sincerity and modesty for in love
    naturalness is the ideal attained and modesty is only the fear
    of coming short of that ideal naturalness is the sign and the
    test of perfect love it is the sign of it for when love can
    show itself natural and true one may conclude that it is
    purified of its unavowable imperfections or defects of its alloy
    of wretched and petty passions its grossness its chimerical
    notions that it has become strong and healthy and vigorous it
    is the ordeal of it for to show itself natural to be always
    true without shrinking it must have all the lovable qualities
    and have them without seeking as a second nature what we call
    natural is indeed really acquired it is the gift of a
    physical and moral evolution which it is precisely the object of
    modesty to keep modesty is the feeling of the true that is to
    say of the healthy in love it long exists as a vision not yet
    attained vague yet sufficiently clear for all that deviates
    from it to be repelled as offensive and painful at first a
    remote and seemingly inaccessible ideal as it comes nearer it
    grows human and individual and emerges from the region of dream
    ceasing not to be loved as ideal even when it is possessed as
    real
    at first sight it seems paradoxical to define modesty as an
    aspiration towards truth in love it seems on the contrary to
    be an altogether factitious feeling but to simplify the problem
    we have to suppose modesty reduced to its normal functions
    disengaged from its superstitions its variegated customs and
    prejudices the true modesty of simple and healthy natures as
    far removed from prudery as from immodesty and what we term the
    natural or the true in love is the singular mingling of two
    forms of imaginations wrongly supposed to be incompatible ideal
    aspiration and the sense for the realities of life thus defined
    modesty not only repudiates that cold and dissolving criticism
    which deprives love of all poetry and prepares the way for a
    brutal realism it also excludes that light and detached
    imagination which floats above love the mere idealism of heroic
    sentiments which cherishes poetic illusions and passes without
    seeing it the love that is real and alive true modesty implies
    a love not addressed to the heroes of vain romances but to
    living people with their feet on the earth but on the other
    hand modesty is the respect of love if it is not shocked by
    its physical necessities if it accepts physiological and
    psychological conditions it also maintains the ideal of those
    moral proprieties outside of which for all of us love cannot be
    enjoyed when love is really felt and not vainly imagined
    modesty is the requirement of an ideal of dignity conceived as
    the very condition of that love separate modesty from love that
    is from love which is not floating in the air but crystallized
    around a real person and its psychological reality its poignant
    and tragic character disappears dugas la pudeur revue

    virtue almost identical with the roman modestia

72 freud remarks that one may often hear concerning elderly ladies
that in their youth in the country they suffered almost to collapse
from hmorrhages from the genital passage because they were too modest to
seek medical advice and examination he adds that it is extremely rare to
find such an attitude among our young women today s freud zur
neurosenlehre 1906 p 182 it would be easy to find evidence of the
disappearance of misplaced signs of modesty formerly prevalent although
this mark of increasing civilization has not always penetrated to our laws
and regulations
73 disgust he remarks is a sort of synthesis which attaches to the
total form of objects and which must diminish and disappear as scientific
analysis separates into parts what as a whole is so repugnant

and around the menstrual periodits absence during the period frequently
apparent only
throughout the vegetable and animal worlds the sexual functions are
periodic from the usually annual period of flowering in plants with its
play of spermcell and germcell and consequent seedproduction through
the varying sexual energies of animals up to the monthly effervescence of
the generative organism in woman seeking not without the shedding of
blood for the gratification of its reproductive function from first to
last we find unfailing evidence of the periodicity of sex at first the
sun and then as some have thought the moon have marked throughout a
rhythmic impress on the phenomena of sex to understand these phenomena we
have not only to recognize the bare existence of that periodic fact but
to realize its implications
rhythm it is scarcely necessary to remark is far from characterizing
sexual activity alone it is the character of all biological activity
alike on the physical and the psychic sides all the organs of the body
appear to be in a perpetual process of rhythmic contraction and expansion
the heart is rhythmic so is the respiration the spleen is rhythmic so
also the bladder the uterus constantly undergoes regular rhythmic
contractions at brief intervals the vascular system down to the smallest
capillaries is acted on by three series of vibrations and every
separate fragment of muscular tissue possesses rhythmic contractility
growth itself is rhythmic and as mallinghansen and subsequent observers
have found follows a regular annual course as well as a larger cycle on
the psychic sides attention is rhythmic we are always irresistibly
compelled to impart a rhythm to every succession of sounds however
uniform and monotonous a familiar example of this is the rhythm we can
seldom refrain from hearing in the puffing of an engine a series of
experiments by bolton on thirty subjects showed that the clicks of an
electric telephone connected in an inductionapparatus nearly always fell
into rhythmic groups usually of two or four rarely of three or five the
rhythmic perception being accompanied by a strong impulse to make
corresponding muscular movements75
it is however with the influenceto some extent real to some extent
perhaps only apparentof cosmic rhythm that we are here concerned the
general tendency physical and psychic of nervous action to fall into
rhythm is merely interesting from the present point of view as showing a
biological predisposition to accept any periodicity that is habitually
imposed upon the organism76 menstruation has always been associated
with the lunar revolutions77 darwin without specifically mentioning
menstruation has suggested that the explanation of the allied cycle of
gestation in mammals as well as incubation in birds may be found in the
condition under which ascidians live at high and low water in consequence
of the phenomena of tidal change78 it must however be remembered that
the ascidian origin of the vertebrates has since been contested from many
sides and even if we admit that at all events some such allied
conditions in the early history of vertebrates and their ancestors tended
to impress a lunar cycle on the race it must still be remembered that the
monthly periodicity of menstruation only becomes well marked in the human
species79 bearing in mind the influence exerted on both the habits and
the emotions even of animals by the brightness of moonlight nights it is
perhaps not extravagant to suppose that on organisms already ancestrally
predisposed to the influence of rhythm in general and of cosmic rhythm in
particular the periodically recurring full moon not merely by its
stimulation of the nervous system but possibly by the special
opportunities which it gave for the exercise of the sexual functions
served to implant a lunar rhythm on menstruation how important such a
factor may be we have evidence in the fact that the daily life of even the
most civilized peoples is still regulated by a weekly cycle which is
apparently a segment of the cosmic lunar cycle
mantegazza has suggested that the sexual period became established with
relation to the lunar period because moonlight nights were favorable to
courting80 and nelson remarks that in his experience young and robust
persons are subject to recurrent periods of wakefulness at night which
they attribute to the action of the full moon one may perhaps refer also
to the tendency of bright moonlight to stir the emotions of the young
especially at puberty a tendency which in neurotic persons may become
almost morbid81
it is interesting to point out that the farther back we are able to trace
the beginnings of culture the more important we find the part played by
the moon next to the alteration of day and night the moons changes are
the most conspicuous and startling phenomena of nature they first suggest
a basis for reckoning time they are of the greatest use in primitive
agriculture and everywhere the moon is held to have vast influence on the
whole of organic life hahn has suggested that the reason why mythological
systems do not usually present the moon in the supreme position which we
should expect is that its immense importance is so ancient a fact that it
tends with mythological development to become overlaid by other
elements82 according to seler quetzalcouatl and tezeatlipoca the two
most considerable figures in the mexican pantheon are to be regarded
mainly as complementary forms of the moon divinity and the moon was the
chief mexican measurer of time83 even in babylonia where the sun was
most specially revered at the earliest period the moon ranked higher
being gradually superseded by the worship of the sun84 although such
considerations as these will by no means take us as far back as the
earliest appearance of menstruation they may serve to indicate that the
phases of the moon probably played a large part in the earliest evolution
of man with that statement we must at present rest content
it is possible that the monthly character of menstruation while
representing a general tendency of the human race always and everywhere
prevalent may be modified in the future it is a noteworthy fact that
among many primitive races menstruation only occurs at long intervals
thus among eskimo women menstruation follows the peculiar cosmic
conditions to which the people are subjected cook the ethnologist of the
peary north greenland expedition found that menstruation only began after
the age of nineteen and that it was usually suppressed during the winter
months when there is no sun only about one in ten women continuing to
menstruate during this period85 it was stated by velpeau that lapland
and greenland women usually only menstruate every three months or even
only two or three times during the year on the faroe islands it is said
that menstruation is frequently absent among the samoyeds mantegazza
mentions that menstruation is so slight that some travelers have denied
its existence azara noted among the guaranis of paraguay that
menstruation was not only slight in amount but the periods were separated
by long intervals among the indians in north america again menstruation
appears to be scanty thus holder speaking of his experience with the
crow indians of montana says i am quite sure that fullblood indians in
this latitude do not menstruate so freely as white women not usually
exceeding three days86 among the naked women of tierra del fuego it
is said that there is often no physical sign of the menses for six months
at a time these observations are noteworthy though they clearly
indicate on the whole that primitiveness in race is a very powerless
factor without a cold climate on the other hand again there is some
reason to suppose that in europe there is a latent tendency in some women
for the menstrual cycle to split up further into two cycles by the
appearance of a latent minor climax in the middle of the monthly interval
i allude to the phenomenon usually called mittelschmerz middle period
or intermenstrual pain
    since the investigations of goodman stephenson van ott reinl
    jacobi and others it has been generally recognized that
    menstruation is a continuous process the flow being merely the
    climax of a menstrual cycle a physiological wave which is in
    constant flux or reflux this cycle manifests itself in all a
    womans activities in metabolism respiration temperature
    etc as well as on the nervous and psychic side the healthier
    the woman is the less conscious is the cyclic return of her
    life but the cycle may be traced as hegar has found even
    before puberty takes place while salerni has found that even in
    amenorrhoea the menstrual cycle still manifests itself in the
    temperature and respiration rivista sperimentale di

    mittelschmerz is a condition of pain occurring about the middle
    of the intermenstrual period either alone or accompanied by a
    slight sanguineous discharge or more frequently a
    nonsanguineous discharge in a case described by van voornveld
    the manifestation was confined to a regularly occurring rise of
    temperature the phenomenon varies but seems usually to occur
    about the fourteenth day and to last two or three days laycock
    in 1840 nervous diseases of women p 46 gave instances of
    women with an intermenstrual period depaul and guniot

    menstruation p 694 speak of intermenstrual symptoms and
    even actual flow as occurring in women who are in a perfect
    state of health and constituting genuine rgles
    surnumraries the condition is however said to have been
    first fully described by valleix then in 18725 by sir william
    priestley and subsequently by fehling fasbender sorel

    menstruation pp 6869 fliess die beziehungen zwischen
    nase und weiblichen geschlechtsorganen p 118 goes so far as
    to assert that an intermenstrual period of menstrual
    symptomswhich he terms nebenmenstruationis a phenomenon
    well known to most healthy women observations are at present
    too few to allow any definite conclusions and in some of the
    cases so far recorded a pathological condition of the sexual
    organs has been found to exist rosner of cracow however found
    that only in one case out of twelve was there any disease present
    la gyncologie june 1905 and storer who has met with
    twenty cases insists on the remarkable and definite regularity
    of the manifestations wholly unlike those of neuralgia boston
    medical and surgical journal april 19 1900 there is no
    agreement as to the cause of mittelschmerz addinsell
    attributed it to disease of the fallopian tubes this however
    is denied by such competent authorities as cullingworth and bland
    sutton others like priestley and subsequently marsh american
    journal of obstetrics july 1897 have sought to find the
    explanation in the occurrence of ovulation this theory is
    however unsupported by facts and eventually rests on the
    exploded belief that ovulation is the cause of menstruation
    rosner following richelet vaguely attributes it to the diffused
    hypermia which is generally present van de velde also
    attributes it to an abnormal fall of vascular tone causing
    passive congestion of the pelvic viscera others again like
    armand routh and maclean in the course of an interesting
    discussion on mittelschmerz at the obstetric society of london
    on the second day of march 1898 believe that we may trace here
    a double menstruation and would explain the phenomenon by
    assuming that in certain cases there is an intermenstrual as well
    as a menstrual cycle the question is not yet ripe for
    settlement though it is fully evident that looking broadly at
    the phenomena of rut and menstruation the main basis of their
    increasing frequency as we rise toward civilized man is increase
    of nutrition heat and sunlight being factors of nutrition when
    dealing with civilized man however we are probably concerned
    not merely with general nutrition but with the nervous direction
    of that nutrition
at this stage it is natural to inquire what the corresponding phenomena
are among animals unfortunately imperfect as is our comprehension of the
human phenomena our knowledge of the corresponding phenomena among
animals is much more fragmentary and incomplete among most animals
menstruation does not exist being replaced by what is known as heat or
oestrus which usually occurs once or twice a year in spring and in
autumn sometimes affecting the male as well as the female87 there is
however a great deal of progression in the upward march of the phenomena
as we approach our own and allied zological series heat in domesticated
cows usually occurs every three weeks the female hippopotamus in the
zological gardens has been observed to exhibit monthly sexual excitement
with swelling and secretion from the vulva progression is not only toward
greater frequency with higher evolution or with increased domestication
but there is also a change in the character of the flow as wiltshire88
in his remarkable lectures on the comparative physiology of
menstruation asserted as a law the more highly evolved the animal the
more sanguineous the catamenial flow
it is not until we reach the monkeys that this character of the flow
becomes well marked monthly sanguineous discharges have been observed
among many monkeys in the seventeenth century various observers in many
parts of the worldbohnius peyer helbigius van der wiel and
othersnoted menstruation in monkeys89 buffon observed it among
various monkeys as well as in the orangutan jg st hilaire and cuvier
many years ago declared that menstruation exists among a variety of
monkeys and lower apes rengger described a vaginal discharge in a species
of cebus in paraguay while raciborski observed in the jardin des plantes
that the menstrual hmorrhage in guenons was so abundant that the floor of
the cage was covered by it to a considerable extent the same variety of
monkey was observed at surinam by hill a surgeon in the dutch army who
noted an abundant sanguineous flow occurring at every new moon and
lasting about three days the animal at this time also showing signs of
sexual excitement90
the macaque and the baboon appear to be the nonhuman animals in which
menstruation has been most carefully observed in the former besides the
flow bland sutton remarks that all the naked or palecolored parts of
the body such as the face neck and ischial regions assume a lively
pink color in some cases it is a vivid red91 the flow is slight but
the coloring lasts several days and in warm weather the labia are much
swollen
heape92 has most fully and carefully described menstruation in monkeys
he found at calcutta that the macacus cynomolgus menstruated regularly
on the 20th of december 20th of january and about the 20th of february
the cynocephalus porcaria and the semnopithecus entellus both
menstruated each month for about four days in the macaci rhesus and
cynomolgus at menstruation the nipples and vulva become swollen and
deeply congested and the skin of the buttocks swollen tense and of a
brilliantred or even purple color the abdominal wall also for a short
space upward and the inside of the thighs sometimes as far down as the
heel and the under surface of the tail for half its length or more are
all colored a vivid red while the skin of the face especially about the
eyes is flushed or blotched with red in late gestation the coloring is
still more vivid something similar is to be seen in the males also
distant who kept a female baboon for some time has recorded the dates of
menstruation during a year he found that nine periods occurred during the
year the average length between the periods was nearly six weeks but
they occurred more frequently in the late autumn and the winter than in
the summer93
it is an interesting fact heape noted that notwithstanding
menstruation the seasonal influence or rut still persisted in the
monkeys he investigated
in the anthropoid apes hartmann remarks that several observers have
recorded periodic menstruation in the chimpanzee with flushing and
enlargement of the external parts and protrusion of the external lips
which are not usually visible while there is often excessive enlargement
and reddening of these parts and of the posterior callosities during
sexual excitement very little however appears to be definitely known
regarding any form of menstruation in the higher apes m deniker who has
made a special study of the anthropoid apes informs me that he has so far
been unable to make definite observations regarding the existence of
menstruation moll remarks that he received information regarding such a
phenomenon in the orangutan a pair of orangutans was kept in the berlin
zological gardens some years ago and the female was stated to have at
intervals a menstrual flow resembling that of women and during this
period to refrain from sexual congress which was otherwise usually
exercised at regular intervals at least every two or three days moll
adds however that while his informant is a reliable man the length of
time that has elapsed may have led him to make mistakes in details keith
in a paper read before the zological society of london has described
menstruation in a chimpanzee it occurred every twentythird or
twentyfourth day and lasted for three days the discharge was profuse
and first appeared in about the ninth or tenth year94
what is menstruation it is easy to describe it by its obvious symptoms
as a monthly discharge of blood from the uterus but nearly as much as
that was known in the infancy of the world when we seek to probe more
intimately into the nature of menstruation we are still baffled not
merely as regards its cause but even as regards its precise mechanism
the primary cause of menstruation remains unexplained the cause of
menstruation remains as obscure as ever so conclude two of the most
thorough and cautious investigators into this subject95 it is however
widely accepted that the main cause of menstruation is a rhythmic
contraction of the uterusthe result of a disappointed preparation for
impregnationa kind of miniature childbirth this seems to be the most
reasonable view of menstruation ie as an abortion of a decidua
burdach according to beard was the first who described menstruation as
an abortive parturition the hypothesis marshall and jolly conclude
that the entire prooestrous process is of the nature of a preparation
for the lodgment of the ovum is in accordance with the facts96
fortunately since we are here primarily concerned with its psychological
aspects the precise biological cause and physiological nature of
menstruation do not greatly concern us
there is however one point which of late years has been definitely
determined and which should not be passed without mention the relation
of menstruation to ovulation it was once supposed that the maturation of
an ovule in the ovaries was the necessary accompaniment and even cause
of menstruation we now know that ovulation proceeds throughout the whole
of life even before birth and during gestation97 and that removal of
the ovaries by no means necessarily involves a cessation of menstruation
it has been shown that regular and even excessive menstruation may take
place in the congenital absence of a trace of ovaries or fallopian
tubes98 on the other hand a rudimentary state of the uterus and a
complete absence of menstruation may exist with welldeveloped ovaries
and normal ovulation99 we must regard the uterus as to some extent an
independent organ and menstruation as a process which arose no doubt
with the object teleologically speaking of cooperating more effectively
with ovulation but has become largely independent100
    it is sometimes stated that menstruation may be entirely absent
    in perfect health few cases of this condition have however
    been recorded with the detail necessary to prove the assertion
    one such case was investigated by dr hw mitchell and
    described in a paper read to the new york county medical society
    february 22 1892 to be found in medical reprints june
    1892 the subject was a young unmarried woman 24 years of age
    she was born in ireland and until her emigration lived quietly
    at home with her parents being then twenty years of age she
    left home and came to new york up to that time no signs of
    menstruation had appeared and she had never heard that such a
    function existed soon after her arrival in new york she
    obtained a situation as a waitingmaid and it was noticed after
    a time that she was not unwell at each month friends filled her
    ears with wild stories about the dreadful effects likely to
    follow the absence of menstruation this worried her greatly and
    as a consequence she became pale and anmic with loss of flesh
    appetite and sleep and a long train of imaginary nervous
    symptoms she presented herself for treatment and insisted upon
    a uterine examination this revealed no pathological condition
    of her uterus she was assured that she would not die or become
    insane nor a chronic invalid in consequence she soon forgot
    that she differed in any way from other girls a course of
    chalybeate tonics generous diet and proper care of her general
    health soon restored her to her normal condition after close
    observation for several years she submitted to a thorough
    examination although entirely free from any abnormal symptoms
    the examination revealed the following physical condition
    weight 105 pounds her weight before leaving ireland was 130
    girth of chest twentynine and a half inches girth of abdomen
    twentyfive inches girth of pelvis thirtyfour and a half
    inches girth of thigh upper third twenty inches heart
    healthy sounds and rhythm perfectly normal pulse 76 lungs
    healthy respiratory murmur clear and distinct over every part
    respiration easy and twenty per minute the mamm are well
    developed firm and round nipples small no areola her skin
    is soft smooth and healthy figure erect plump and
    symmetrical her bowels are regular kidneys healthy she has a
    good appetite sleeps well and in no particular shows any sign
    of ill health the uterine examination reveals a short vagina
    and a small round cervix uteri rather less in size than the
    average and projecting very slightly into the vaginal canal
    depth of uterus from os to fundus two and a quarter inches is
    very nearly normal no external sign of abnormal ovaries she is
    a welldeveloped healthy young woman performing all her
    physiological functions naturally and regularly except the
    single function of menstruation no vicarious menstruation takes
    the place of the natural function though she has been watched
    very closely during the past two years nor the least periodical
    excitement it is added that though the clitoris is normal the
    mons veneris is almost destitute of hair and the labia rather
    undeveloped while as far as is known sexual instincts and
    desire are entirely absent these latter facts i may add would
    seem to suggest that in spite of the health of the subject
    there is yet some concealed lack of development of the sexual
    system of congenital character in a case recorded by plant
    centralblatt fr gynkologie no 9 1896 summarized in the
    british medical journal april 4 1896 in which the internal
    sexual organs were almost wholly undeveloped and menstruation
    absent the labia were similarly undeveloped and the pubic hair
    scanty while the axillary hair was wholly absent though that of
    the head was long and strong
we may now regard as purely academic the discussion formerly carried on as
to whether menstruation is to be regarded as analogous to heat in female
animals for many centuries at least the resemblance has been sufficiently
obvious raciborski and pouchet who first established the regular
periodicity of ovulation in mammals identified heat and
menstruation101 during the past century there was notwithstanding an
occasional tendency to deny any real connection no satisfactory grounds
for this denial have however been brought forward lawson tait indeed
and more recently beard have stated that menstruation cannot be the
period of heat because women have a disinclination to the approach of the
male at that time102 but as we shall see later this statement is
unfounded an argument which might indeed be brought forward is the very
remarkable fact that while in animals the period of heat is the only
period for sexual intercourse among all human races from the very
lowest the period of menstruation is the one period during which sexual
intercourse is strictly prohibited sometimes under severe penalties even
life itself this however is a social not a physiological fact
    ploss and bartels call attention to the curious contrast in this
    respect between heat and menstruation the same authors also
    mention that in the middle ages however preachers found it
    necessary to warn their hearers against the sin of intercourse
    during the menstrual period it may be added that aquinas and
    many other early theologians held not only that such intercourse
    was a deadly sin but that it engendered leprous and monstrous
    children some later theologians however like sanchez argued
    that the mosaic enactments such as leviticus ch xx v 18 no
    longer hold good modern theologiansin part influenced by the
    tolerant traditions of liguori and in part like debreyne
    moechialogie pp 275 et seq informed by medical scienceno
    longer prohibit intercourse during menstruation or regard it as
    only a venial sin
we have here a remarkable but not an isolated example of the tendency of
the human mind in its development to rebel against the claims of primitive
nature the whole of religion is a similar remolding of nature a
repression of natural impulses an effort to turn them into new channels
prohibition of intercourse during menstruation is a fundamental element of
savage ritual an element which is universal merely because the conditions
which caused it are universal and becauseas is now beginning to be
generally recognizedthe causes of human psychic evolution are everywhere
the same a strictly analogous phenomenon in the sexual sphere itself is
the opposed attitude in barbarism and civilization toward the sexual
organs under barbaric conditions and among savages when no
magicoreligious ideas intervene the sexual organs are beautiful and
pleasurable objects under modern conditions this is not so this
difference of attitude is reflected in sculpture in savage and barbaric
carvings of human beings the sexual organs of both sexes are often
enormously exaggerated this is true of the archaic european figures on
which salomon reinach has thrown so much light but in modern sculpture
from the time when it reached its perfection in greece onward the sexual
regions in both men and women are systematically minimized103
with advancing cultureas again we shall see laterthere is a conflict
of claims and certain considerations are regarded as higher and more
potent than merely natural claims nakedness is more natural than
clothing and on many grounds more desirable under the average
circumstances of life yet everywhere under the stress of what are
regarded as higher considerations there is a tendency for all races to
add more and more to the burden of clothes in the same way it happens
that the tendency of the female to sexual intercourse during
menstruation104 has everywhere been overlaid by the ideas of a culture
which has insisted on regarding menstruation as a supernatural phenomenon
which for the protection of everybody must be strictly tabooed105
this tendency is reinforced and in high civilization replaced by the
claims of an sthetic regard for concealment and reserve during this
period such facts are significant for the early history of culture but
they must not blind us to the real analogy between heat and menstruation
an analogy or even identity which may be said to be accepted now by most
careful investigators106
if it is perhaps somewhat excessive to declare with johnstone that
woman is the only animal in which rut is omnipresent we must admit that
the two groups of phenomena merge into or replace each other that their
object is identical that they involve similar psychic conditions here
also we see a striking example of the way in which women preserve a
primitive phenomenon which earlier in the zological series was common to
both sexes but which man has now lost heat and menstruation with
whatever difference of detail are practically the same phenomenon we
cannot understand menstruation unless we bear this in mind
on the psychic side the chief normal and primitive characteristic of the
menstrual state is the more predominant presence of the sexual impulse
there are other mental and emotional signs of irritability and instability
which tend to slightly impair complete mental integrity and to render in
some unbalanced individuals explosions of anger or depression in rarer
cases crime more common107 but the heightening of the sexual impulse
languor shyness and caprice are the more human manifestations of an
emotional state which in some of the lower female animals during heat may
produce a state of fury
the actual period of the menstrual flow at all events the first two or
three days does not among european women usually appear to show any
heightening of sexual emotion108 this heightening occurs usually a few
days before and especially during the latter part of the flow and
immediately after it ceases109 i have however convinced myself by
inquiry that this absence of sexual feeling during the height of the flow
is in large part apparent only no doubt the onset of the flow often
producing a general depression of vitality may tend directly to depress
the emotions which are heightened by the general emotional state and
local congestion of the days immediately preceding but among some women
at all events who are normal and in good health i find that the period
of menstruation itself is covered by the period of the climax of sexual
feeling thus a married lady writes my feelings are always very strong
not only just before and after but during the period very unfortunately
as of course they cannot then be gratified while a refined girl of 19
living a chaste life without either coitus or masturbation which she has
never practiced habitually feels very strong sexual excitement about the
time of menstruation and more especially during the period this desire
torments her life prevents her from sleeping at these times and she
looks upon it as a kind of illness110 i could quote many other similar
and equally emphatic statements and the fact that so cardinal a
relationship of the sexual life of women should be ignored or denied by
most writers on this matter is a curious proof of the prevailing
ignorance111
this ignorance has been fostered by the fact that women often disguise
even to themselves the real state of their feelings one lady remarks that
while she would be very ready for coitus during menstruation the thought
that it is impossible during that time makes her put the idea of it out of
her mind i have reason to think that this statement may be taken to
represent the real feelings of very many women the aversion to coitus is
real but it is often due not to failure of sexual desire but to the
inhibitory action of powerful extraneous causes the absence of active
sexual desire in women during the height of the flow may thus be regarded
as in part a physiological fact following from the correspondence of
the actual menstrual flow to the period of prooestrum and in part a
psychological fact due to the sthetic repugnance to union when in such a
condition and to the unquestioned acceptance of the general belief that
at such a period intercourse is out of the question some of the strongest
factors of modesty especially the fear of causing disgust and the sense
of the demands of ceremonial ritual would thus help to hold in check the
sexual emotions during this period and when under the influence of
insanity these motives are in abeyance the coincidence of sexual desire
with the menstrual flow often becomes more obvious112
it must be added that especially among the lower social classes the
primitive belief of the savage that coitus during menstruation is bad for
the man still persists ploss and bartels mention that among the peasants
in some parts of germany where it is believed that impregnation is
impossible during menstruation coitus at that time would be frequent were
it not thought dangerous for the man113 it has also been a common
belief both in ancient and modern times that coitus during menstruation
engenders monsters114
notwithstanding all the obstacles that are thus placed in the way of
coitus during menstruation there is nevertheless good reason to believe
that the first coitus very frequently takes place at this point of least
psychic resistance when still a student i was struck by the occurrence of
cases in which seduction took place during the menstrual flow though at
that time they seemed to me inexplicable except as evidencing brutality
on the part of the seducer ngrier115 in the lyingin wards of the
hteldieu at angers constantly found that the women from the country who
came there pregnant as the result of a single coitus had been impregnated
at or near the menstrual epoch more especially when the period coincided
with a feastday as st johns day or christmas
whatever doubt may exist as to the most frequent state of the sexual
emotions during the period of menstruation there can be no doubt whatever
that immediately before and immediately after very commonly at both
timesthis varying slightly in different womenthere is usually a
marked heightening of actual desire it is at this period and sometimes
during the menstrual flow that masturbation may take place in women who
at other times have no strong autoerotic impulse the only women who do
not show this heightening of sexual emotion seem to be those in whom
sexual feelings have not yet been definitely called into consciousness or
the small minority usually suffering from some disorder of sexual or
general health in whom there is a high degree of sexual ansthesia116
    the majority of authorities admit a heightening of sexual emotion
    before or after the menstrual crisis see eg krafftebing who
    places it at the postmenstrual period psychopathia sexualis
    eng translation of tenth edition p 27 adler states that
    sexual feeling is increased before during and after menstruation
    die mangelhafte geschlechtsempfindung des weibes 1904 p
    88 kossmann senator and kaminer health and disease in
    relation to marriage i 249 advises intercourse just after
    menstruation or even during the latter days of the flow as the
    period when it is most needed guyot says that the eight days
    after menstruation are the period of sexual desire in women
    brviaire de lamour exprimentale p 144 harry campbell
    investigated the periodicity of sexual desire in healthy women of
    the working classes in a series of cases by inquiries made of
    their husbands who were patients at a london hospital people of
    this class are not always skilful in observation and the method
    adopted would permit many facts to pass unrecorded it is
    therefore noteworthy that only in onethird of the cases had no
    connection between menstruation and sexual feeling been observed
    in the other twothirds sexual feeling was increased either
    before after or during the flow or at all of these times the
    proportion of cases in which sexual feeling was increased before
    the flow to those in which it was increased after was as three
    to two h campbell nervous organization of men and women p
    203
    even this elementary fact of the sexual life has however been
    denied and strange to say by two women doctors dr mary
    putnam jacobi of new york who furnished valuable contributions
    to the physiology of menstruation wrote some years ago in a
    paper on the theory of menstruation in reference to the
    question of the connection between oestrus and menstruation
    neither can any such rhythmical alternation of sexual instinct
    be demonstrated in women as would lead to the inference that the
    menstrual crisis was an expression of this ie of oestrus
    dr elizabeth blackwell again in her book on the human element
    in sex asserts that the menstrual flow itself affords complete
    relief for the sexual feelings in women like sexual emissions
    during sleep in men and thus practically denies the prevalence
    of sexual desire in the immediately postmenstrual period when
    on such a theory sexual feeling should be at its minimum it is
    fair to add that dr blackwells opinion is merely the survival
    of a view which was widely held a century ago when various
    writers bordeu roussel duffieux j arnould etc as icard
    has pointed out regarded menstruation as a device of providence
    for safeguarding the virginity of women

not prejudge the question of the inheritance of acquired characters

normal during menstruation and in some women persist during this period

menstrual period recurs without the natural interruption of pregnancy
the feeling abates and gives place to sensations of discomfort or pain
he ascribes this to the vital tissues being sapped of more blood than can
be replaced in the intervals the vital powers being thus kept in
abeyance the amative sensations are either not developed or destroyed

physiological periodicity of seminal emissions during sleeporiginal
observationsfortnightly and weekly rhythms
for some centuries at least inquisitive observers here and there have
thought they found reason to believe that men as well as women present
various signs of a menstrual physiological cycle it would be possible to
collect a number of opinions in favor of such a monthly physiological
periodicity in men precise evidence however is for the most part
lacking men have expended infinite ingenuity in establishing the remote
rhythms of the solar system and the periodicity of comets they have
disdained to trouble about the simpler task of proving or disproving the
cycles of their own organisms117 it is over half a century since
laycock wrote that the scientific observation and treatment of disease
are impossible without a knowledge of the mysterious revolutions
continually taking place in the system yet the task of summarizing the
whole of our knowledge regarding these mysterious revolutions is even
today no heavy one as to the existence of a monthly cycle in the sexual
instincts of men with a single exception i am not aware that any attempt
has been made to bring forward definite evidence118 a certain interest
and novelty attaches therefore to the evidence i am able to produce
although that evidence will not suffice to settle the question finally
the great italian physician sanctorius who was in so many ways the
precursor of our modern methods of physiological research by the means of
instruments of precision was the first so far as i am aware to suggest
a monthly cycle of the organism in men he had carefully studied the
weight of the body with reference to the amount of excretions and
believed that a monthly increase in weight to the amount of one or two
pounds occurred in men followed by a critical discharge of urine this
crisis being preceded by feelings of heaviness and lassitude119 gall
another great initiator of modern views likewise asserted a monthly cycle
in men he insisted that there is a monthly critical period more marked
in nervous people than in others and that at this time the complexion
becomes dull the breath stronger digestion more laborious while there
is sometimes disturbance of the urine together with general malaise in
which the temper takes part ideas are formed with more difficulty and
there is a tendency to melancholy with unusual irascibility and mental
inertia lasting a few days more recently stephenson who established the
cyclical wavetheory of menstruation argued that it exists in men also
and is really a general law of vital energy120
    sanctorius does not appear to have published the data on which
    his belief was founded keill an english follower of
    sanctorius in his medicina statica britannica 1718
    published a series of daily morning and evening bodyweights
    for the year without referring to the question of a monthly
    cycle a period of maximum weight is shown usually by keills
    figures to occur about once a month but it is generally
    irregular and cannot usually be shown to occur at definite
    intervals monthly discharges of blood from the sexual organs and
    other parts of the body in men have been recorded in ancient and
    modern times and were treated of by the older medical writers as
    an affliction peculiar to men with a feminine system laycock
    nervous diseases of women p 79 a summary of such cases will
    be found in gould and pyle anomalies and curiosities of
    medicine 1897 pp 2728 laycock lancet 184243 vols i
    and ii brought forward cases of monthly and fortnightly cycles
    in disease and asserted the general principle that there are
    greater and less cycles of movements going on in the system
    involving each other and closely connected with the organization
    of the individual he was inclined to accept lunar influence
    and believed that the physiological cycle is made up of definite
    fractions and multiples of a period of seven days especially a
    unit of three and a half days albrecht a somewhat erratic
    zologist put forth the view a few years ago that there are
    menstrual periods in men giving the following reasons 1 males
    are rudimentary females 2 in all males of mammals a
    rudimentary masculine uterus mllers ducts still persists 3
    totally hypospadic male individuals menstruate and believed that
    he had shown that in man there is a rudimentary menstruation
    consisting in an almost monthly periodic appearance lasting for
    three or four days of white corpuscles in the urine anomalo
    february 1890 dr campbell clark some years since made
    observations on asylum attendants in regard to the temperature
    during five weeks which tended to show that the normal male
    temperature varies considerably within certain limits and that
    so far as i have been able to observe there is one marked and
    prolonged rise every month or five weeks averaging three days
    occasional lesser rises appearing irregularly and of shorter
    duration these observations are only made in three cases and i
    have no proof that they refer to the sexual appetite campbell
    clark the sexual reproductive functions psychological
    section british medical association glasgow 1888 also
    private letters hammond treatise on insanity p 114 says
    i have certainly noted in some of my friends the tendency to
    some monthly periodic abnormal manifestations this may be in the
    form of a headache or a nasal hmorrhage or diarrhoea or
    abundant discharge of uric acid or some other unusual
    occurrence i think he adds this is much more common than is
    ordinarily supposed and a careful examination or inquiry will
    generally if not invariably establish the existence of a
    periodicity of the character referred to
    dr harry campbell in his book on differences in the nervous
    organization of men and women deals fully with the monthly
    rhythm pp 270 et seq and devotes a short chapter to the
    question is the menstrual rhythm peculiar to the female sex
    he brings forward a few pathological cases indicating such a
    rhythm but although he had written a letter to the lancet
    asking medical men to supply him with evidence bearing on this
    question it can scarcely be said that he has brought forward
    much evidence of a convincing kind and such as he has brought
    forward is purely pathological he believes however that we may
    accept a monthly cycle in men we may he concludes regard
    the human beingboth male and femaleas the subject of a
    monthly pulsation which begins with the beginning of life and
    continues till death menstruation being regarded as a function
    accidentally ingrafted upon this primordial rhythm
    it is not unreasonable to argue that the possibility of such a
    menstrual cycle is increased if we can believe that in women
    also the menstrual cycle persists even when its outward
    manifestations no longer occur atius said that menstrual
    changes take place during gestation in more modern times buffon
    was of the same opinion laycock also maintained that menstrual
    changes take place during pregnancy nervous diseases of women
    p 47 fliess considers that it is certainly incorrect to assert
    that the menstrual process is arrested during pregnancy and he
    refers to the frequency of monthly epistaxis and other nasal
    symptoms throughout this period w fliess beziehungen zwischen
    nase und geschlechtsorganen pp 44 et seq beard who
    attaches importance to the persistence of a cyclical period in
    gestation calls it the muffled striking of the clock harry
    campbell causation of disease p 54 has found
    postclimacteric menstrual rhythm in a fair sprinkling of cases
    up to the age of sixty
it is somewhat remarkable that so far as i have observed none of these
authors refer to the possibility of any heightening of the sexual appetite
at the monthly crisis which they believe to exist in men this omission
indicates that as is suggested by the absence of definite statements on
the matter of increase of sexual desire at menstruation it was an ignored
or unknown fact of recent years however many writers especially
alienists have stated their conviction that sexual desire in men tends to
be heightened at approximately monthly intervals though they have not
always been able to give definite evidence in support of their statements
    clouston for instance has frequently asserted this monthly
    periodic sexual heightening in men in the article
    developmental insanity in tukes psychological dictionary
    he refers to the periodic physiological heightening of the
    reproductive nisus and again in an article on alternation
    periodicity and relapse in mental diseases edinburgh medical
    journal july 1882 he records the case of an insane
    gentleman aged 49 who for the past twentysix years has been
    subject to the most regularly occurring brainexaltation every
    four weeks almost to a day it sometimes passes off without
    becoming acutely maniacal or even showing itself in outward
    acts at other times it becomes so and lasts for periods of from
    one to four weeks it is always preceded by an uncomfortable
    feeling in the head and pain in the back mental hebetude and
    slight depression the nisus generativus is greatly increased
    and he says that if in that condition he has full and free
    seminal emissions during sleep the excitement passes off if
    not it goes on a full dose of bromide or iodide of potassium
    often but not always has the effect of stopping the excitement

    i have for a long time been impressed with the relationship of
    the mental and bodily alternations and periodicities in insanity
    to the great physiological alternations and periodicities and i
    have generally been led to the conclusion that they are the same
    in all essential respects and only differ in degree of intensity
    or duration by far the majority of the cases in women follow the
    law of the menstrual and sexual periodicity the majority of the
    cases in men follow the law of the more irregular periodicities

    sexes follow the seasonal periodicity which perhaps in man is

it is in the domain of disease that the most strenuous and on the whole
the most successful efforts have been made to discover a menstrual cycle
in men such a field seems promising at the outset for many morbid
exaggerations or defects of the nervous system might be expected to
emphasize or to free from inhibition fundamental rhythmical processes of
the organism which in health and under the varying conditions of social
existence are overlaid by the higher mental activities and the pressure
of external stimuli in the eighteenth century erasmus darwin wrote a
remarkable and interesting chapter on the periods of disease dealing
with solar and lunar influence on biological processes121 since then
many writers have brought forward evidence especially in the domain of
nervous and mental disease which seems to justify a belief that under
pathological conditions a tendency to a male menstrual rhythm may be
clearly laid bare
we should expect an organ so primitive in character as the heart and with
so powerful a rhythm already stamped upon its nervous organization to be
peculiarly apt to display a menstrual rhythm under the stress of abnormal
conditions this expectation might be strengthened by the menstrual rhythm
which mr perrycoste has found reason to suspect in pulsefrequency
during health i am able to present a case in which such a periodicity
seems to be indicated it is that of a gentleman who suffered severely for
some years before his death from valvular disease of the heart with a
tendency to pulmonary congestion and attacks of cardiac asthma his
wife a lady of great intelligence kept notes of her husbands
condition122 and at last observed that there was a certain periodicity
in the occurrence of the exacerbations the periods were not quite
regular but show a curious tendency to recur at about thirty days
interval a few days before the end of every month it was during one of
these attacks that he finally died there was also a tendency to minor
attacks about ten days after the major attacks it is noteworthy that the
subject showed a tendency to periodicity when in health and once remarked
laughingly before his illness i am just like a woman always most
excitable at a particular time of the month
    periodicity has been noted in various disorders of nervous
    character periodic insanity has long been known and studied
    see eg pilcz die periodischen geistesstrungen 1901 it
    is much commoner in women than in men periodicity has been
    observed in stammering a sixweekly period in one case and
    notably in hemicrania or migraine by harry campbell osler etc
    the periodicity of a case of hemicrania has been studied in
    detail by d fraser harris edinburgh medical journal july
    1902 but the cycle in these cases is not always or even
    usually of a menstrual type
it is now possible to turn to an investigation which although of very
limited extent serves to place the question of a male menstrual cycle for
the first time on a sound basis if there is such a cycle analogous to
menstruation in women it must be a recurring period of nervous erethism
and it must be demonstrably accompanied by greater sexual activity in the
american journal of psychology for 1888 mr julius nelson afterward
professor of biology at the rutgers college of agriculture new brunswick
published a study of dreams in which he recorded the results of detailed
observations of his dreams and also of seminal emissions during sleep by
him termed gonekbole or ecbole during a period of something over two
years mr nelson found that both dreams and ecboles fell into a
physiological cycle of 28 days the climax of maximum dreaming as
determined by the number of words in the dream record and the climax of
maximum ecbole fell at the same point of the cycle the ecbolic climax
being more distinctly marked than the dream climax
    the question of cyclic physiological changes is considerably
    complicated by our uncertainty regarding the precise length of
    the cycle we may expect to find nelson finds a 28day cycle
    satisfactory perrycoste as we shall see accepts a strictly
    lunar cycle of 29 days fliess has argued that in both women and
    men many physiological facts fall into a cycle of 23 days which
    he calls male the 28day cycle being female w fliess die
    beziehungen zwischen nase und weiblichen geschlechtsorganen
    1897 pp 113 et seq although fliess brings forward a number of
    minutelyobserved cases i cannot say that i am yet convinced of
    the reality of this 23day cycle it is somewhat curious
    however that at the same time as fliess though in apparent
    independence and from a different point of view another worker
    also suggested that there is a 23day physiological cycle john
    beard the span of gestation and the cause of birth jena
    1897 beard approaches the question from the embryological
    standpoint and argues that there is what he terms an ovulation
    unit of about 23 days in the interval from the end of one
    menstruation to the beginning of the next two ovulation units
    make up one critical unit and the length of pregnancy
    according to beard is always a multiple of the critical unit
    in man the gestation period amounts to six critical units these
    attempts to prove a new physiological cycle deserve careful study
    and further investigation the possibility of such a cycle should
    be borne in mind but at present we are scarcely entitled to
    accept it
so far as i am aware professor nelsons very interesting series of
observations which for the first time placed the question of a
menstrual rhythm in men on a sound and workable basis have not directly
led to any further observations i am however in possession of a much
more extended series of ecbolic observations completed before nelsons
paper was published although the results have only been calculated at a
comparativelyrecent date i now propose to present a summary of these
observations and consider how far they confirm nelsons conclusions
these observations cover no less a period than twelve years between the
ages of 17 and 29 the subject wk being a student and afterward
schoolmaster leading on the whole a chaste life the records were
faithfully made throughout the whole of this long period here if
anywhere should be material for the construction of a menstrual rhythm
on an ecbolic basis while the results are in many respects instructive
it can scarcely perhaps be said that they absolutely demonstrate a
monthly cycle when summated in a somewhat similar manner to that adopted
by nelson in his ecbolic observations it is not difficult to regard the
maximum which is reached on the 19th to 21st days of the summated
physiological month as a real menstrual ecbolic climax for no other
three consecutive days at all approach these in number of ecboles while
there is a marked depression occurring four days earlier on the 16th day
of the month if however we split up the curve by dividing the period of
twelve years into two nearly equal periods the earlier of about seven
years and the latter of about four years and summate these separately
the two curves do not present any parallel as regards the menstrual cycle
it scarcely seems to me therefore that these curves present any
convincing evidence in this case of a monthly ecbolic cycle and
therefore i refrain from reproducing them although they seem to suggest
such a cycle nor is there any reason to suppose that by adopting a
different cycle of thirty days or of twentythree days any more
conclusive results would be obtained
it seems however when we look at these curves more closely that they
are not wholly without significance if i am justified in concluding that
they scarcely demonstrate a monthly cycle it may certainly be added that
they show a rudimentary tendency for the ecboles to fall into a
fortnightly rhythm and a very marked and unmistakable tendency to a
weekly rhythm the fortnightly rhythm is shown in the curve for the
earlier period but is somewhat disguised in the curve for the total
period because the first climax is spread over two days the 7th and 8th
of the month if we readjust the curve for the total period by presenting
the days in pairs the fortnightly tendency is more clearly brought out
chart i
a more pronounced tendency still is traceable to a weekly rhythm this is
indeed the most unquestionable fact brought out by these curves all the
maxima occur on saturday or sunday with the minima on tuesday wednesday
thursday or friday this very pronounced weekly rhythm will serve to
swamp more or less completely any monthly rhythm on a 28day basis
although here probably seen in an exaggerated form it is almost certainly
a characteristic of the ecbolic curve generally123 i have been told by
several young men and women especially those who work hard during the
week that saturday and especially sunday afternoon are periods when the
thoughts spontaneously go in an erotic direction and at this time there
is a special tendency to masturbation or to spontaneous sexual excitement
it is on friday saturday sunday and monday according to guerrys
tables124 that the fewest suicides are committed tuesday wednesday
and thursday with however a partial fall on wednesday those on which
most suicides are committed so that there would appear to be an
antagonism between sexual activity and the desire to throw off life it
also appears in the reports of the bavarian factory inspectors that
accidents in factories have a tendency to occur chiefly at the beginning
of the week and toward the end rather than in the middle125 even
growth as fleischmann has shown in the case of children tends to fall
into weekly cycles it is evident that the nervous system is profoundly
affected by the social influences resulting from the weekly cycle
the analysis of this series of ecbolic curves may thus be said to recall
the suggestion of laycock that the menstrual cycle is really made up of
four weekly cycles the periodic unit according to laycock being three
and onehalf days i think it would however be more correct to say that
the menstrual cycle perhaps originally formed with reference to the
influence of the moon on the sexual and social habits of men and other
animals tends to break up by a process of segmentation into fortnightly
and weekly cycles if we are justified in assuming that there is a male
menstrual cycle we must conclude that in such a case as that just
analyzed the weekly rhythm has become so marked as almost entirely to
obliterate the larger monthly rhythm
however constituted there seems little doubt that a physiological weekly
cycle really exists this was indeed very clearly indicated many years
ago by the observations of edward smith who showed that there are weekly
rhythms in pulse respiration temperature carbonic acid evolution urea
and bodyweight sunday being the great day of repair and increase of
weight126
in an appendix to this volume i am able to present the results of another
long series of observations of nocturnal ecbolic manifestations carried
out by mr perrycoste who has elaborately calculated the results and
has convinced himself that on the basis of a strictly lunar month thus
abolishing the disturbing influence of the weekly rhythm which in his
case also appears a real menstrual rhythm may be traced127
it does not appear to me however even yet that a final answer to the
question whether a menstrual sexual rhythm occurs in men can be decisively
given in the affirmative that such a cycle will be proved in many cases
seems to me highly probable but before this can be decisively affirmed it
is necessary that a much larger number of persons should be induced to
carry out on themselves the simple but protracted series of observations
that are required
    since the first edition of this volume appeared numerous series
    of ecbolic records have reached me from different parts of the
    world the most notable of these series comes from a professional
    man of scientific training who has for the past six years lived
    in different parts of india where the record was kept though
    the record extends over nearly six years there are two breaks in
    it due to a visit to england and to loss of interest both
    involuntary and voluntary discharges are included in the record
    the involuntary discharges occurred during sleep usually with an
    erotic dream in which the subject invariably awaked and
    frequently made an effort to check the emission the voluntary
    discharges in most cases commenced during sleep or in the
    halfwaking state deliberate masturbation when fully awake was
    comparatively rare the proportion of involuntary to more or less
    voluntary ecboles was about 3 to 1 a third kind of sexual
    manifestation of frequency intermediate between the other two
    forms is also included in which a high degree of erethism is
    induced during the half waking state culminating in an orgasm in
    which the power of preventing discharge has been artificially
    acquired the subject em was 32 years of age when the record
    began he belongs to a healthy family and is himself physically
    sound 5 feet 6 inches in height but weight low due to rickets
    in infancy in early life he stammered badly his temperament is
    emotional and selfconscious while his work is unusually
    exacting and he lives for most of the year in a very trying
    climate as a boy he was very religious and has always felt
    obliged to resist sexual vice to the utmost though there have
    been occasional lapses
    as regards lunar periodicity em has summated his results in a
    curve after the same manner as mr perrycoste beginning with
    the new moon the periods covered include 54 lunar months and
    the total number of discharges is 176 the average frequency is
    about 3 per month of twentyeight days the curve for the most
    part zigzags between a frequency of 4 and 9 but on the
    twentyfourth day it falls to 1 and then rises uninterruptedly
    to a height of 11 on the twentyseventh day falling to 2 on the
    next day whether a really menstrual rhythm is thus indicated i
    do not undertake to decide but i am inclined to agree with em
    himself that there is no definite evidence of it it looks to
    me he writes as if the only real rhythm putting aside the
    annual cycle will be found to be the average period between the
    ecboles varying in different persons but in my case about nine
    and oneeighth days may not the ecbolic period in men be
    compared to the menstrual period in women and be an example of
    the greater katabolic activity of men there is the period of
    tumescence and the ecbole constituting the detumescence the
    weekend holiday would hasten the detumescence but about every
    third weekend there would tend to be delay to enable the system
    to get back into its regulation nine or ten days stride this
    might possibly be the explanation of the curves the recent
    emissions were nearly all involuntary during sleep age may have
    something to do with the change in character
    ems curves frequently show the influence of weekly
    periodicity in the tendency to ecbole on sunday or sometimes on
    saturday or monday in recent years there has been some tendency
    for this climax to be thrown towards the middle of the week but
    on the whole wednesday is the point of lowest frequency
    in another case the subject an who has spent nearly all his
    life in the state of indiana has kept a record of sexual
    manifestations between the ages of 30 and 34 the data which
    cover four years have not been sent to me in a form which
    enables the possibility of a monthly curve to be estimated but
    an who has himself arranged the data on a lunar monthly basis
    considers that a monthly curve is thus revealed my memoranda
    he writes show that discharges occur most frequently on the
    first second and third days after new moon there is also
    another period on the fourteenth and fifteenth which might
    indicate a semilunar rhythm the days of minimum discharge are
    the seventh eighth twentysecond and twentythird it may be
    added that the yearly average of ecbolic manifestations varying
    between 50 and 55 comes out as 52 or exactly one per week
    a weekly periodicity is very definitely shown by ans data
    sunday once more stands at the head of the week as regards
    frequency in this case very decisively the figures are as  follows
        sun   mon   tues  wed  thurs  fri   sat
         48     21     24     35     28     26     27
    in another case which has reached me from the united states the
    data are slighter but deserve note as the subject is a trained
    psychologist and i quote the case in his own words here it
    will be seen there appears to be a tendency for the ecbolic
    cycle to cover a period of about six weeks in this case also
    there is a tendency for the climax to occur about saturday or
    sunday x is 38 years old unmarried fair health pretty good
    heredity university trained and engaged in academic pursuits
    he thinks he may have completed puberty at about 13 though he
    has no proof that he was in the full possession of his sexpowers
    until he was 15 years 3 months old when he had his first
    emission his sex life has been normal he masturbated somewhat
    when he slept with other boys or men during early manhood but
    not to excess
    during the autumn of 1889 when 28 years of age he observed
    that at certain times he had an itching feeling about the
    testicles that he felt slightly irritable that the penis
    erected with the slightest provocation and that this peculiar
    feeling usually passed away with a nightly emission indeed so
    regular was the matter that he usually wore a loin garment at
    these times to prevent the semen getting on the bedding this
    peculiar feeling ordinarily continued for two or three days he
    recalls at these times that he felt that he would like to wrestle
    with some one for there seemed to be a muscular tension these
    states returned with apparent regularity and the intervals
    seemed to be about six weeks though no effort was made to
    measure the periods until 1893 the following notes are taken
    from the diaries of  x
    thursday december 29 1892 the peculiar feeling
        this is the only entry
    thursday february 9 1893 the peculiar feeling
        the diary notes that x awoke nights to find erections and
        that the feeling continued until sunday night following when
        there was an emission
    friday march 27 1893 the peculiar feeling
        the diary notes that there was an emission the next night
        and that the feeling disappeared
    wednesday may 3 1893 the peculiar feeling
        the diary notes that it continued until saturday night when
        x had sexual relations and that it then disappeared
    wednesday june 14 1893 the peculiar feeling
        the diary states that the next night x had an emission
        and the disappearance of the feeling
    thursday july 27 1893 the peculiar feeling
        the diary notes that it was apparent at about 3 oclock
        that afternoon that night at 10 oclock x had sexual
        intercourse and the feeling was not noted the next day
    friday september 8 1893 the peculiar feeling
        continued until tuesday the 11th and then disappeared
        no sexual intercourse and no nightly emission
    wednesday october 25 1893 the peculiar feeling
        continued until saturday night when there was a nightly
        emission
    saturday december 9 1893 the peculiar feeling
        continued until monday night when there was sexual
        relations
    it will be noted that the intervals observed were of about six
    weeks duration excepting one that from september to october
    when it was nearly seven weeks
    these observations were not recorded after 1893 x thinks that
    in 1894 the intervals were longer an opinion which is based on
    the fact that for a period of six months he had no sexual
    intercourse and no nightly emissions the times during this six
    months when he had the peculiar feeling the sensation was so
    slight as to be scarcely noted in 1895 the feeling seemed more
    pronounced than ever before and x thinks that it may have
    recurred as often as once a month in 1896 1897 and 1898 the
    intervals he thinks lengthenedat times he thought wholly
    disappeared during 1899 while they did not recur often when
    they did come the sensation was pronounced although the
    emission was less common there was a peculiar heavy feeling
    about the testicles and a marked tendency towards erection of
    the penis especially at nighttime while sleeping x often
    awoke to find a tense erection moreover these feelings usually
    continued a week
    1 in general x is of the opinion that as he grows older these
    intervals lengthen though this inference is not based on
    recorded data
    2 he notes that a discharge through sexual intercourse or in
    sleep invariably brings the peculiar feeling to a close for the
    time being
    3 he notes that sexual intercourse at the time stops it but
    when there has been sexual intercourse within a week or ten days
    of the time based upon the observations of 1893 that it had no
    tendency to check the feeling
    in another case that of fc an irish farmer born in
    waterford the data are still more meagre though the periodicity
    is stated to be very pronounced he is chaste steady with
    occasional lapses from strict sobriety healthy and mentally
    normal living a regular openair life far from the artificial
    stimuli of towns the observations refer to a period when he was
    from 20 to 27 years of age during this period nocturnal
    emissions occurred at regular intervals of exactly a month they
    were ushered in by fits of irritability and depression and
    usually occurred in dreamless sleep the discharges were abundant
    and physically weakening but they relieved the psychic symptoms
    though they occasioned mental distress since fc is scrupulous
    in a religious sense and also apprehensive of bad constitutional
    effects the result of reading alarmist quack pamphlets
    in another case known to me a young man leading a chaste life
    experienced crises of sexual excitement every ten to fourteen
    days the crisis lasting for several days
    finally an interesting contribution to this subject suggested
    by this study has been made and published in the proceedings
    of the amsterdam international congress of psychology in 1907
    by the wellknown amsterdam neurologist and psychologist dr
    lsam von rmer under the title ueber das verhltniss
    zwischen mondalter und sexualitt von rmers data are made up
    not of nocturnal involuntary emissions but of the voluntary acts
    of sexual intercourse of an unmarried man during a period of
    four years von rmer believes that these to a much greater
    extent than those of a married man would be liable to periodic
    influence if such exist on making a curve of exact lunar length
    similarly to perrycoste he finds that there are every month
    two maxima and two minima in a way that approximately resemble
    perrycostes curve the main point in von rmers results is
    however the correspondence that he finds with the actual lunar
    phases the chief maximum occurs at the time of the full moon
    and the secondary maximum at the time of the new moon the minima
    being at the first and fourth quarters he hazards no theory in
    explanation of this coincidence but insists on the need for
    further observations it will be seen that ans results ante
    p 117 seem in the main to correspond to von rmers

    reproductive organs of woman in his nervous diseases of

    the system undergoes changes about the vernal and autumnal
    equinoxes and that these changes are largely sexual

    periodicity and indeed the first to make definite observations
    on a number of points bearing on it sums up in his remarkable
    book health and disease as influenced by daily seasonal and
    other cyclical changes in the human system 1861 to the effect
    that season is a more powerful influence on the system than
    temperature or atmospheric pressure in the early and middle
    parts of spring every function of the body is in its highest
    degree of efficiency while autumn is essentially a period of
    change from the minimum toward the maximum of vital conditions
    he found that in april and may most carbonic acid is evolved
    there being then a progressive diminution to september and then
    a progressive increase the respiratory rate also fell from a

    and that when pairing ceased to be strictly confined to these

    even among the civilized nations of europe he further argued

    of the forecast he further stated his belief in a primordial
    seasonal aptitude for procreation the impress of which still
    remains and to some extent governs the breedingtimes of

    westermarck in a chapter of his history of human marriage
    dealing with the question of a human pairing season in primitive
    times brings forward evidence showing that spring or rather
    early summer is the time for increase of the sexual instinct
    and argues that this is a survival of an ancient pairing season
    spring he points out is a season of want rather than
    abundance for a frugivorous species but when men took to herbs
    roots and animal food spring became a time of abundance and
    suitable for the birth of children he thus considers that in
    man as in lower animals the times of conception are governed by
    the times most suitable for birth
    rosenstadt as we shall see later also believes that men today
    have inherited a physiological custom of procreating at a certain
    epoch and he thus accounts for the seasonal changes in the
    birthrate
    heape who also believes that at one period of its existence the
    human species had a special breeding season follows wiltshire
    in suggesting that there is some reason to believe that the
    human female is not always in a condition to breed w heape

except however in one important respect with which we shall presently
have to deal few attempts have been made to demonstrate any annual
organic sexual rhythm the supposition of such annual cycle is usually
little more than a deduction from the existence of the wellmarked
seasonal sexual rhythm in animals most of the higher animals breed only
once or twice a year and at such a period that the young are born when
food is most plentiful at other periods the female is incapable of
breeding and without sexual desires while the male is either in the same
condition or in a condition of latent sexuality under the influence of
domestication animals tend to lose the strict periodicity of the wild
condition and become apt for breeding at more frequent intervals thus
among dogs in the wild state the bitch only experiences heat once a year
in the spring among domesticated dogs there is not only the spring
period of heat early in the year but also an autumn period about six
months later the primitive period however remains the most important
one and the best litters of pups are said to be produced in the spring
the mare is in season in spring and summer sheep take the ram in
autumn128 many of the menstruating monkeys also whether or not sexual
desire is present throughout the year only conceive in spring and in
autumn almost any time of the year may be an animals pairing season
this season being apparently in part determined by the economic conditions
which will prevail at birth while it is essential that animals should be
born during the season of greatest abundance it is equally essential that
pairing which involves great expenditure of energy should also take
place at a season of maximum physical vigor
    as an example of the sexual history of an animal through the
    year i may quote the following description by dr aw
    johnstone of the habits of the american deer our common
    american deer in wintertime is halfstarved for lack of
    vegetation in the woods the low temperature snow and ice make
    his conditions of life harder for lack of the proper amount of
    food whereby he becomes an easier prey to carnivorous animals
    he has difficulty even in preserving life in spring he sheds his
    winter coat and is provided with a suit of lighter hair and
    while this is going on the male grows antlers for defence the
    female about this time is far along in pregnancy and when the
    antlers are fully grown she drops the fawn when the fawns are
    dropped vegetation is plentiful and lactation sets in during
    this time the male is kept fully employed in getting food and
    guarding his more or less helpless family as the season advances
    the vegetation increases and the fawn begins to eat grass when
    the summer heat commences the little streams begin to dry up and
    the animal once more has difficulty in supporting life because of
    the enervating heat the effect of drought on the vegetation and
    the distance which has to be traveled to get water therefore
    fully ten months in each year the deer has all he can do to live
    without extra exertion incident to rutting soon after the autumn
    rains commence vegetation becomes more luxurious the antlers of
    the male and new suits of hair for both are fully grown heat of
    the summer is gone food and drink are plentiful everywhere the
    fawns are weaned and both sexes are in the very finest
    condition then and then only in the whole year comes the rut
    which to them as to most other animals means an unwonted amount
    of physical exercise besides the everyday runs for life from
    their natural enemies and an unusual amount of energy is used
    up if a doe dislikes the attention of a special buck miles of
    racing result if jealous males meet furious battles take place
    the strain on both sexes could not possibly be endured at any
    other season of the year with approach of cold weather climatic
    deprivations and winter dangers commence and rut closes in all
    wild animals rut occurs only when the climatic and other
    conditions favor the highest physical development this law holds
    good in all wild birds for it is then only that they can stand
    the strain incident to lovemaking the common american crow is a
    very good study in the winter he travels around the ricefields
    of the south leading a tramps existence in a country foreign to
    him and to which he goes only to escape the rigors of the
    northern climate for several weeks in the spring he goes about
    the fields gathering up the worms and grubs after his long
    flight from the south he experiences several weeks of an almost
    ideal existence his food is plentiful he becomes strong and
    hearty and then he turns to thoughts of love in the pairing
    season he does more work than at any other time in the year
    fantastic dances racing and chasing after the females and
    savage fights with rivals he endures more than would be possible
    in his ordinary physical state then come the care of the young
    and the long flights for water and food during the drought of the
    summer after the molt autumn finds him once more in flock and
    with the first frosts he is off again to the south in the wild
    state rut is the capstone of perfect physical condition aw

    the pairing season of a number of different animals
    with regard to the breeding seasons of monkeys little seems to
    be positively known heape made special inquiries with reference
    to the two species whose sexual life he investigated he was
    informed that semnopithecus entellus breeds twice a year in
    april and in october he accepts aitchesons statement that the
    macacus rhesus in simla copulates in october and adds that
    in the very different climate of the plains it appears to
    copulate in may he concludes that the breeding season varies
    greatly in dependence on climate but believes that the breeding
    season is always preserved and that it affects the sexual
    aptitude of the male he could not make his monkeys copulate
    during february or march but is unable to say whether or not
    sexual intercourse is generally admitted outside the breeding
    season he quotes the observation of breschet that monkeys
    copulate during pregnancy
in primitive human races we very frequently trace precisely the same
influence of the seasonal impulse as may be witnessed in the higher
animals although among human races it does not always result that the
children are born at the time of the greatest plenty and on account of
the development of human skill such a result is not necessary thus dr
cook found among the eskimo that during the long winter nights the
secretions are diminished muscular power is weak and the passions are
depressed soon after the sun appears a kind of rut affects the young
population they tremble with the intensity of sexual passion and for
several weeks much of the time is taken up with courtship and love hence
the majority of the children are born nine months later when the four
months of perpetual night are beginning a marked seasonal periodicity of
this kind is not confined to the arctic regions we may also find it in
the tropics in cambodia mondire has found that twice a year in april
and september men seem to experience a veritable rut and will
sometimes even kill women who resist them129
these two periods spring and autumnthe season for greeting the
appearance of life and the season for reveling in its final
fruitionseem to be everywhere throughout the world the most usual
seasons for erotic festivals in classical greece and rome in india
among the indians of north and south america spring is the most usual
season while in africa the yam harvest of autumn is the season chiefly
selected there are of course numerous exceptions to this rule and it
is common to find both seasons observed taking indeed a broad view of
festivals throughout the world we may say that there are four seasons
when they are held the winter solstice when the days begin to lengthen
and primitive man rejoices in the lengthening and seeks to assist it130
the vernal equinox the period of germination and the return of life the
summer solstice when the sun reaches its height and autumn the period
of fruition of thankfulness and of repose but it is rarely that we find
a people seriously celebrating more than two of these festival seasons
in australia according to mller as quoted by ploss and bartels marriage
and conception take place during the warm season when there is greatest
abundance of food and to some extent is even confined to that period
oldfield and others state that the australian erotic festivals take place
only in spring among some tribes mller adds such as the watschandis
conception is inaugurated by a festival called kaaro which takes place
in the warm season at the first new moon after the yams are ripe the
leading feature of this festival is a moonlight dance representing the
sexual act symbolically with their spears regarded as the symbols of the
male organ the men attack bushes which represent the female organs
they thus work themselves up to a state of extreme sexual excitement131
among the papuans of new guinea also according to mikluchomacleay
conceptions chiefly occur at the end of harvest and guise describes the
great annual festival of the year which takes place at the time of the yam
and banana harvest when the girls undergo a ceremony of initiation and
marriages are effected132 in central africa says sir hh johnston in
his central africa sexual orgies are seriously entered into at certain
seasons of the year but he neglects to mention what these seasons are
the people of new britain according to weisser as quoted by ploss and
bartels carefully guard their young girls from the young men at certain
times however a loud trumpet is blown in the evening and the girls are
then allowed to go away into the bush to mix freely with the young men in
ancient peru according to an account derived from a pastoral letter of
archbishop villagomez of lima in december when the fruit of the
paltay is ripe a festival was held preceded by a five days fast
during the festival which lasted six days and six nights men and women
met together in a state of complete nudity at a certain spot among the
gardens and all raced toward a certain hill every man who caught up with
a woman in the race was bound at once to have intercourse with her
very instructive from our present point of view is the account given by
dalton of the festivals of the various bengal races thus the hos a
kolarian tribe of bengal are a purely agricultural people and the
chief festival of the year with them is the mgh parah it is held in
the month of january when the granaries are full of grain and the
people to use their own expression full of devilry it is the festival
of the harvesthome the termination of the years toil and is always
held at full moon the festival is a saturnalia when all rules of duty
and decorum are forgotten and the utmost liberty is allowed to women and
girls who become like bacchantes the people believe that at this time
both men and women become overcharged with vitality and that a safety
valve is absolutely necessary the festival begins with a religious
sacrifice made by the village priest or elders and with prayers for the
departed and for the vouchsafing of seasonable rain and good crops the
religious ceremonies over the people give themselves up to feasting and
to drinking the homemade beer the preparation of which from fermented
rice is one of a girls chief accomplishments the ho population wrote
dalton are at other seasons quiet and reserved in manner and in their
demeanor toward women gentle and decorous even in their flirtations they
never transcend the bounds of decency the girls though full of spirits
and somewhat saucy have innate notions of propriety that make them modest
in demeanor though devoid of all prudery and of the obscene abuse so
frequently heard from the lips of common women in bengal they appear to
have no knowledge they are delicately sensitive under harsh language of
any kind and never use it to others and since their adoption of clothing
they are careful to drape themselves decently as well as gracefully but
they throw all this aside during the mgh feast their nature appears to
undergo a temporary change sons and daughters revile their parents in
gross language and parents their children men and women become almost
like animals in the indulgence of their amorous propensities they enact
all that was ever portrayed by prurient artists in a bacchanalian festival
or pandean orgy and as the light of the sun they adore and the presence
of numerous spectators seems to be no restraint on their indulgence it
cannot be expected that chastity is preserved when the shades of night
fall on such a scene of licentiousness and debauchery while however
thus representing the festival as a mere debauch dalton adds that
relationships formed at this time generally end in marriage there is also
a flower festival in april and may of religious nature but the dances
at this festival are quieter in character133
in burmah the great festival of the year is the full moon of october
following the buddhist lent season which is also the wet season during
which there is no sexual intercourse the other great festival is the new
year in march134
in classical times the great festivals were held at the same time as in
northern and modern europe the brumalia took place in midwinter when
the days were shortest and the rosalia according to early custom in
may or june and at a later time about easter after the establishment of
christianity the church made constant efforts to suppress this latter
festival and it was referred to by an eighth century council as a wicked
and reprehensible holidaymaking these festivals appear to be intimately
associated with dionysus worship and the flowerfestival of dionysus as
well as the roman liberales in honor of bacchus was celebrated in march
with worship of priapus the festivals of the delian apollo and of
artemis both took place during the first week in may and the roman
bacchanales in october135
the medival feast of fools was to a large extent a seasonal orgy licensed
by the church it may be traced directly back through the barbatories of
the lower empire to the roman saturnalia and at sens the ancient
ecclesiastical metropolis of france it was held at about the same time as
the saturnalia on the feast of the circumcision ie new years day
it was not however always held at this time thus at evreux it took
place on the 1st of may136
the easter bonfires of northerncentral europe the midsummer st johns
eve fires of southerncentral europe still bear witness to the ancient
festivals137 there is certainly a connection between these bonfires and
erotic festivals it is noteworthy that they occur chiefly at the period
of spring and early summer which on other grounds is widely regarded as
the time for the increase of the sexual instinct while the less frequent
period for the bonfires is that of the minor sexual climax mannhardt was
perhaps the first to show how intimately these spring and early summer
festivalsheld with bonfires and dances and the music of violinhave
been associated with lovemaking and the choice of a mate138 in spring
the first monday in lent quadrigesima and easter eve were frequent days
for such bonfires in may among the franks of the main the unmarried
women naked and adorned with flowers danced on the blocksberg before the
men as described by herbels in the tenth century139 in the central
highlands of scotland the beltane fires were kindled on the 1st of may
bonfires sometimes took place on halloween october 31st and christmas
but the great season all over europe for these bonfires then often held
with erotic ceremonial is the summer solstice the 23d of june the eve
of midsummer or st johns day140
the bohemians and other slavonic races formerly had meetings with sexual
license this was so up to the beginning of the sixteenth century on the
banks of rivers near novgorod the meetings took place as a rule the day
before the festival of john the baptist which in pagan times was that
of a divinity known by the name of jarilo equivalent to priapus half a
century later a new ecclesiastical code sought to abolish every vestige
of the early festivals held on christmas day on the day of the baptism
of our lord and on john the baptists day a general feature of all these
festivals says kowalewsky was the prevalence of the promiscuous
intercourse of the sexes among the ehstonians at the end of the
eighteenth century thousands of persons would gather around an old ruined
church in the fellinschen on the eve of st john light a bonfire and
throw sacrificial gifts into it sterile women danced naked among the
ruins much eating and drinking went on while the young men and maidens
disappeared into the woods to do what they would festivals of this
character still take place at the end of june in some districts young
unmarried couples jump barefoot over large fires usually near rivers or
ponds licentiousness is rare141 but in many parts of russia the
peasants still attach little value to virginity and even prefer women who
have been mothers the population of the grisons in the sixteenth century
held regular meetings not less licentious than those of the cossacks
these were abolished by law kowalewsky regards all such customs as a
survival of early forms of promiscuity142
    frazer golden bough 2d ed 1900 vol iii pp 236350
    fully describes and discusses the dances bonfires and festivals
    of spring and summer of halloween october 31 and christmas
    he also explains the sexual character of these festivals there
    are clear indications he observes p 305 that even human
    fecundity is supposed to be promoted by the genial heat of the
    fires it is an irish belief that a girl who jumps thrice over
    the midsummer bonfire will soon marry and become the mother of
    many children and in various parts of france they think that if
    a girl dances round nine fires she will be sure to marry within a
    year on the other hand in lechrain people say that if a young
    man and woman leaping over the midsummer fire together escape
    unsmirched the young woman will not become a mother within
    twelve monthsthe flames have not touched and fertilized her
    the rule observed in some parts of france and belgium that the
    bonfires on the first sunday in lent should be kindled by the
    person who was last married seems to belong to the same class of
    ideas whether it be that such a person is supposed to receive
    from or impart to the fire a generative and fertilizing
    influence the common practice of lovers leaping over the fires
    handinhand may very well have originated in a notion that
    thereby their marriage would be more likely to be blessed with
    offspring and the scenes of profligacy which appear to have
    marked the midsummer celebration among the ehstonians as they
    once marked the celebration of may day among ourselves may have
    sprung not from the mere license of holidaymakers but from a
    crude notion that such orgies were justified if not required by
    some mysterious bond which linked the life of man to the courses
    of the heavens at the turningpoint of the year
as regards these primitive festivals although the evidence is scattered
and sometimes obscure certain main conclusions clearly emerge in early
europe there were according to grimm only two seasons sometimes
regarded as spring and winter sometimes as spring and autumn and for
mythical purposes these seasons were alone available143 the appearance
of each of these two seasons was inaugurated by festivals which were
religious and often erotic in character the slavonic year began in march
at which time there was formerly it is believed a great festival not
only in slavonic but also in teutonic countries in northern germany there
were easter bonfires always associated with mountains or hills the celtic
bonfires were held at the beginning of may while the teutonic mayday or
walpurgisnacht is a very ancient sacred festival associated with
erotic ceremonial and regarded by grimm as having a common origin with
the roman floralia and the greek dionysia thus in europe grimm
concludes there are four different ways of welcoming summer in sweden
and gothland a battle of winter and summer a triumphal entry of the
latter in schonen denmark lower saxony and england simply mayriding
or fetching of the maywagon on the rhine merely a battle of winter and
summer without immersion without the pomp of an entry in franconia
thuringia meissen silesia and bohemia only the carrying out of wintry
death no battle no formal introduction of summer of these festivals the
first and second fall in may the third and fourth in march in the first
two the whole population take part with unabated enthusiasm in the last
two only the lower poorer class everything goes to prove that the
approach of summer was to our forefathers a holy tide welcomed by
sacrifice feast and dance and largely governing and brightening the
peoples life144 the early spring festival of march the festival of
ostara the goddess of spring has become identified with the christian
festival of resurrection just as the summer solstice festival has been
placed beneath the patronage of st john the baptist but there has been
only an amalgamation of closelyallied rites for the christian festival
also may be traced back to a similar origin among the early arabians the
great ragab feast identified by ewald and robertson smith with the
jewish paschal feast fell in the spring or early summer when the
camels and other domestic animals brought forth their young and the
shepherds offered their sacrifices145 babylonia the supreme early
centre of religious and cosmological culture presents a more decisive
example of the sex festival the festival of tammuz is precisely analogous
to the european festival of st johns day tammuz was the solar god of
spring vegetation and closely associated with ishtar also an
agricultural deity of fertility the tammuz festival was in the earliest
times held toward the summer solstice at the time of the first wheat and
barley harvest in babylonia as in primitive europe there were only two
seasons the festival of tammuz coming at the end of winter and the
beginning of summer was a fast followed by a feast a time of mourning
for winter of rejoicing for summer it is part of the primitive function
of sacred ritual to be symbolical of natural processes a mysterious
representation of natural processes with the object of bringing them
about146 the tammuz festival was an appeal to the powers of nature to
exhibit their generative functions its erotic character is indicated not
only by the wellknown fact that the priestesses of ishtar the kadishtu
or holy ones were prostitutes but by the statements in babylonian
legends concerning the state of the earth during ishtars winter absence
when the bull the ass and man ceased to reproduce it is evident that
the return of spring coincident with the tammuz festival was regarded as
the period for the return of the reproductive instinct even in man147
so that along this line also we are led back to a great procreative
festival
thus the great spring festivals were held between march and june
frequently culminating in a great orgy on midsummers eve the next great
season of festivals in europe was in autumn the beginning of august was a
great festival in celtic lands and the echoes of it rhys remarks have
not yet died out in wales148 the beginning of november both in celtic
and teutonic countries was a period of bonfires149 in germanic
countries especially there was a great festival at the time the germanic
year began at martinmas november 11th and the great festival of the
year was then held it is the oldest germanic festival on record and
retained its importance even in the middle ages there was feasting all
night and the cattle that were to be killed were devoted to the gods the
goose was associated with this festival150 these autumn festivals
culminated in the great festival of the winter solstice which we have
perpetuated in the celebrations of christmas and new year thus while
the two great primitive culminating festivals of spring and autumn
correspond exactly as we shall see with the seasons of maximum
fecundation even in the europe of today the earlier spring march
andthough less closelyautumn november festivals correspond with the
periods of maximum spontaneous sexual disturbance as far as i have been
able to obtain precise evidence of such disturbance that the maximum of
physiological sexual excitement should tend to appear earlier than the
maximum of fecundation is a result that might be expected
the considerations so far brought forward clearly indicate that among
primitive races there are frequently one or two seasons in the
yearespecially spring and autumnduring which sexual intercourse is
chiefly or even exclusively carried on and they further indicate that
these primitive customs persist to some extent even in europe today it
would still remain to determine whether any such influence affects the
whole mass of the civilized population and determines the times at which
intercourse or fecundation most frequently takes place
this question can be most conveniently answered by studying the seasonal
variation in the birthrate calculating back to the time of conception
wargentin in sweden first called attention to the periodicity of the
birthrate in 1767151 the matter seems to have attracted little further
attention until quetelet who instinctively scented unreclaimed fields of
statistical investigation showed that in belgium and holland there is a
maximum of births in february and consequently of conceptions in may
and a minimum of births about july with consequent minimum of conceptions
in october quetelet considered that the spring maximum of conceptions
corresponded to an increase of vitality after the winter cold he pointed
out that this sexual climax was better marked in the country than in
towns and accounted for this by the consideration that in the country
the winter cold is more keenly felt later wappus investigated the
matter in various parts of northern and southern europe as well as in
chile and found that there was a maximum of conceptions in may and june
attributable to season and in catholic countries strengthened by customs
connected with ecclesiastical seasons this maximum was he found
followed by a minimum in september october and november due to
gradually increasing exhaustion and the influence of epidemic diseases
as well as the strain of harvestwork the minimum is reached in the south
earlier than in the north about november conceptions again become more
frequent and reach the second maximum at about christmas and new year
this second maximum is very slightly marked in southern countries but
strongly marked in northern countries in sweden the absolute maximum of
conceptions is reached in december and is due in the opinion of
wappus solely to social causes villerm reached somewhat similar
results founding his study on 17000000 births he showed that in france
it was in april may and june or from the spring equinox to the summer
solstice and nearer to the solstice than the equinox that the maximum of
fecundations takes place while the minimum of births is normally in july
but is retarded by a wet and cold summer in such a manner that in august
there are scarcely more births than in july and on the other hand a
very hot summer accelerating the minimum of births causes it to fall in
june instead of in july152 he also showed that in buenos ayres where
the seasons are reversed the conceptionrate follows the reversed
seasons and is also raised by epochs of repose of plentiful food and of
increased social life sormani studied the periodicity of conception in
italy and found that the spring maximum in the southern provinces occurs
in may and gradually falls later as one proceeds northward until in the
extreme north of the peninsula it occurs in july in southern italy there
is only one maximum and one minimum in the north there are two the
minimum which follows the spring or summer maximum increases as we
approach the south while the minimum associated with the winter cold
increases as we approach the north153 beukemann who studied the matter
in various parts of germany found that seasonal influence was specially
marked in the case of illegitimate births the maximum of conceptions of
illegitimate children takes place in the spring and summer of europe
generally in russia it takes place in the autumn and winter when the
harvestworking months for the population are over and the period of
rest and also of minimum deathrate september october and november
comes round in russia the general conceptionrate has been studied by
various investigators here the maximum number of conceptions is in
winter the minimum varying among different elements of the population
looked at more closely there are maxima of conceptions in russia in
january and in april in russian towns however the maximum number of
conceptions occurs in the autumn the special characteristics of the
russian conceptionrate are held to be due to the prevalence of marriages
in autumn and winter154 to the severely observed fasts of spring and
to the exhausting harvestwork of summer
it is instructive to compare the conceptionrate of europe with that of a
noneuropean country such a comparison has been made by sa hill for the
northwest provinces of india here the holi and other erotic festivals
take place in spring but spring is not the period when conceptions
chiefly take place indeed the prevalence of erotic festivals in spring
appears to hill an argument in favor of those festivals having originated
in a colder climate the conceptions show a rise through october and
november to a maximum in december and january followed by a steady and
prolonged fall to a minimum in september this curve can be accounted for
by climatic and economic conditions september is near the end of the long
and depressing hot season when malarial influences are rapidly
increasing to a maximum the foodsupply is nearly exhausted and there is
the greatest tendency to suicide with october it forms the period of
greatest mortality december on the other hand is the month when food is
most abundant and it is also a very healthy month155
    for a summary of the chief researches into this question see

    den ursachen welche die zahl der conceptionen etc
    mittheilungen aus den embryologischen institute universitt
    wien second series fasc 4 1890 rosenstadt concludes that
    man has inherited from animal ancestors a physiological custom
    which has probably been further favored by climatic and social
    conditions primitive man he proceeds had inherited from his
    ancestors the faculty of only reproducing himself at determined
    epochs on the arrival of this period of rut fecundation took
    place on a large scale this being very easy thanks to the
    promiscuity in which primitive man lived with the development of
    civilization men give themselves up to sexual relations all the
    year around but the physiological custom of procreating at a
    certain epoch has not completely disappeared it remains as a
    survival of the animal condition and manifests itself in the
    recrudescence of the number of conceptions during certain months
    of the year o rosenbach bemerkungen ber das problem einer
    brunstzeit beim menschen archiv fr rassen und
    gesellschaftsbiologie bd iii heft 5 has also argued in
    favor of a chief sexual period in the year in man with secondary
    and even tertiary climaxes in march august and december he
    finds that in some families for several generations birthdays
    tend to fall in the same months but his paper is on the whole
    inconclusive
    some years ago prof jb haycraft argued on the basis of data
    furnished by scotland that the conceptionrate corresponds to
    the temperaturecurve haycraft physiological results of
    temperature variation transactions of the royal society of
    edinburgh vol xxix 1880 temperature he concluded is
    the main factor regulating the variations in the number of
    conceptions which occur during the year it increases their
    number with its elevation and this on an average of 05 per
    cent for an elevation of 1 f whether or not this theory may
    fit the facts as regards scotland it is certainly altogether
    untenable when we take a broader view of the phenomena
    recently dr paul gaedeken of copenhagen has argued in a detailed
    statistical study la raction de lorganisme sous linfluence
    physicochimiques des agents mtorologiques archives
    danthropologie criminelle feb 1909 that the
    conceptionrate as well as the periodicity of suicide and allied
    phenomena is due to the action of the chemical rays on the
    unpigmented skin in early spring this action being
    physiologically similar to that of alcohol he seeks thus to
    account for the marked and early occurrence of such periodic
    phenomena in greenland and other northern countries where there
    is much chemical action owing to the clear air in early spring
    but little heat this explanation would not cover an autumnal
    climax the existence of which gaedeken denies
in order to obtain a fairly typical conceptioncurve for europe and to
allow the variations of local habit and custom to some extent to
annihilate each other i have summated the figures given by mayr for about
a quarter of a million births in germany france and italy156
obtaining a curve chart 2 of the conceptionrate which may be said
roughly to be that of europe generally if we begin at september as the
lowest point we find an autumn rise culminating in the lesser maximum of
christmas followed by a minor depression in january and february then
comes the great spring rise culminating in may and followed after june
by a rapid descent to the minimum
    in canada see eg report of the registrar general of the
    province of ontario for 1904 the maximum and minimum of
    conceptions alike fall later than in europe the months of
    maximum conception are june july and august of minimum
    conception january february and march june is the favorite
    month for marriage
    it would be of some interest to know the conceptioncurve for the
    welltodo classes who are largely free from the industrial and
    social influences which evidently to a great extent control the
    conceptionrate it seems probable that the seasonal influence
    would here be specially well shown the only attempt i have made
    in this direction is to examine a wellfilled birthdaybook the
    entries show a very high and equally maintained maximum of
    conceptions throughout april may and june followed by a marked
    minimum during the next three months and an autumn rise very
    strongly marked in november there is no december rise as will
    be seen there is here a fairly exact resemblance to the yearly
    ecbolic curve of people of the same class the inquiry needs
    however to be extended to a very much larger number of cases
    mr john douglass brown of philadelphia has kindly prepared and
    sent me since the above was written a series of curves showing
    the annual periodicity of births among the educated classes in
    the state of pennsylvania using the statistics as to 4066
    births contained in the biographical catalogue of matriculates of
    the college of the university of pennsylvania mr brown prepared
    four curves the first covering the earliest period 17571859
    the second the period 18601876 the third 18771893 while the
    fourth presented the summated results for the whole period the
    dates named are those of the entry to classes and not of actual
    occurrence of birth a very definite and wellmarked curve is
    shown and the average number of births not conceptions per
    day for the whole period is as  follows
        jan feb mar apr  may june july aug sept oct nov dec
        105 114  11  83  102 105 115 126 123  116  12  117
    there is thus a wellmarked minimum of conceptions a depression
    appearing here in each of the three periods separately about
    the month of july in the second period however which contains
    the smallest number of births the minimum occurs in september
    from that low minimum there is steady and unbroken rise up to the
    chief maximum in november in the first period however the
    maximum is delayed till january and in the second period it is
    somewhat diffused there is a tendency to a minor maximum in
    february specially well marked in the third and most important
    period and in the first period delayed until march
a very curious and perhaps not accidental coincidence might be briefly
pointed out before we leave this part of the subject it is found157 by
taking 3000 cases of children dying under one year that among the general
population children born in february and september and therefore
conceived in may and december appear to possess the greatest vitality
and those born in june and therefore conceived in september the least
vitality158 as we have seen may and december are precisely the periods
when conceptions in europe generally are at a maximum and september is
precisely the period when they are at a minimum so that if this
coincidence is not accidental the strongest children are conceived when
there is the strongest tendency to procreate and the feeblest children
when that tendency is feeblest
nelson in his study of dreams and their relation to seasonal ecbolic
manifestations does not present any yearly ecbolic curve as the two
years and a half over which his observations extend scarcely supply a
sufficient basis on examining his figures however i find there is a
certain amount of evidence of a yearly rhythm there are spring and autumn
climaxes throughout in february and in november there is no december
rise during one year there is a marked minimum from may to september
though it is but slightly traceable in the succeeding year these figures
are too uncertain to prove anything but as far as they go they are in
fair agreement with the much more extensive record that of wk ante
p 113 which i have already made use of in discussing the question of a
monthly rhythm this record covering nearly twelve years shows a general
tendency when the year is divided into four periods novemberjanuary
februaryapril mayjuly augustoctober and the results summated to
rise steadily throughout from the minimum in the winter period to the
maximum in the autumn period this steady upward progress is not seen in
each year taken separately in three years there is a fall in passing from
the novemberjanuary to the februaryapril quarter always followed by a
rise in the subsequent quarter in three cases there is a fall in passing
from the second to the third quarter again always followed by a rise in
the following quarter and in two successive years there is a fall in
passing from the third to the fourth quarter if however beginning at
the second year we summate the results for each year with those for all
previous years a steady rise from season to season is seen throughout if
we analyze the data according to the months of the year still more
precise and interesting results as shown in the curve chart 3 are
obtained two maximum points are seen one in spring march one in
autumn october or rather augustoctober and each of these maximum
points is followed by a steep and sudden descent to the minimum points in
april and in december if we compare this result with perrycostes also
extending over a long series of years we find a marked similarity in
both alike there are spring and autumn maxima in both the autumn maximum
is the highest and in both also there is an intervening fall in both
cases again the maxima are followed by steep descents but while in both
the spring maximum occurs in march in perrycostes case the second
maximum though of precisely similar shape occurs earlier in
juneseptember instead of augustoctober in perrycostes case also
there is an apparently abnormal tendency only shown in the more recent
years of the record to an additional maximum in january the records
certainly show far more points of agreement than of discrepancy and by
their harmony as well with each other as with themselves when the years
are taken separately certainly go far to prove that there is a very
marked annual rhythm in the phenomena of seminal emissions during sleep
or as nelson has termed it the ecbolic curve we see also that the
great yearly organic climax of sexual effervescence corresponds with the
period following harvest which throughout the primitive world has been
a season of sexual erethism and orgy though those customs have died out
of our waking lives they are still imprinted on our nervous texture and
become manifest during sleep
    the fresh records that have reached me since the first edition of
    this book was published show wellmarked annual curves though
    each curve always has some slight personal peculiarities of its
    own the most interesting and significant is that of em see
    ante p 116 covering four years it is indicated by the
    following monthly frequencies summated for the four  years

    em lives in india april may and june are hot months but
    not unhealthy and during this season moreover he lives in the
    hills under favorable conditions getting plenty of outdoor
    exercise july august and september are nearly as hot but
    much damper and more trying during these months em is living
    in the city and his work is then also more exacting than at
    other times september is the worst month of all he has a short
    holiday at the end of it during december january and february
    the climate is very fine and ems work is easier it will be
    seen that his ecbolic curve corresponds to his circumstances and
    environment although until he analyzed the record he had no idea
    that any such relationship existed unfavorable climatic
    conditions and hard work favorable conditions and lighter work
    happen to coincide in his life and the former depress the
    frequency of seminal emissions the latter increase their
    frequency at the same time the curve is not out of harmony with
    the northern curves there is what corresponds to a late spring
    april climax and another still higher late autumn december
    climax a very interesting point is the general resemblance of
    the ecbolic curves to the indian conceptioncurves as set forth
    by hill ante p 140 the conceptioncurve is at its lowest
    point in september and at its highest point in decemberjanuary
    and this ecbolic curve follows it except that both the minimum
    and the maximum are reached a little earlier when compared with
    the english annual ecbolic curves wk and perrycoste both
    spring and autumn maxima fall rather later but all agree in
    representing the autumn rise as the chief climax
    the annual curve of an ante p 117 who lives in indiana
    usa also covers four years it presents the usual spring
    mayjune in this case and autumn septemberoctober climaxes

    in his book on adolescence stanley hall refers to three
    ecbolic records in his possession all made by men who were
    doctors of philosophy and all considering themselves normal the
    best of these records made by a virtuous active and able man
    covered nearly eight years stanley hall thus summarizes the
    records which are not presented in detail the best of these
    records averages about three and a half such experiences per
    month the most frequent being 514 for july and the least
    frequent 228 for september for all the years taken together
    there appears also a slight rise in april and another in
    november with a fall in december the frequency varies in the
    different individuals there was no tendency to a monthly cycle
    in the best case the minimum number for the year was
    thirtyseven and the maximum fifty fiftynine per cent of all
    were at an interval of a week or less forty per cent at an
    interval of from one to four days thirtyfour per cent at an
    interval of from eight to seventeen days the longest being
    fortytwo days poor condition overwork and undersleep led to
    infrequency early morning was the most common time normally
    there was a sense of distinct relief but in low conditions or
    with overfrequency depression gs hall adolescence vol

    emissions american journal of psychology jan 1904 is
    evidently a fuller presentation of the first of stanley halls
    three cases it is the history of a healthy unmarried chaste
    man who kept a record of his nocturnal emissions and their
    accompanying dreams from the age of thirty to thirtyeight in
    what american state he lived is not mentioned he was ignorant of
    the existence of any previous records the yearly average was 37
    to 50 remaining fairly constant the monthly average was 343 i

    here as in all the other curves we have been able to consider
    we may see the usual two points of climax in spring and in
    autumn the major climax covers april may june and july the
    minor autumnal climax is confined to november in the light of
    the evidence which has thus accumulated we may conclude that the
    existence of an annual ecbolic curve with its spring and autumn
    climaxes as described in the first edition of this book is now
    definitely established
if we are to believe as these records tend to show that the nocturnal
and involuntary voice of the sexual impulse usually speaks at least as
loudly in autumn as in spring we are confronted by a certain divergence
of the sleeping sexual impulse from the waking sexual instinct as
witnessed by the conceptioncurve and also it may be added by the
general voice of tradition and indeed of individual feeling which
concur on the whole in placing the chief epoch of sexual activity in
spring and early summer more especially as regards women159 it is not
impossible to reconcile the contradiction assuming it to be real but i
will refrain here from suggesting the various explanations which arise
we need a broader basis of facts
there are many facts to show that early spring and to a certain extent
autumn are periods of visible excitement mainly sexual in character we
have already seen that among the eskimo menstruation and sexual desire
occur chiefly in spring but cases are known of healthy women in temperate
climes who only menstruate twice a year and in such cases the menstrual
epochs appear to be usually in spring and autumn such at all events was
the case in a girl of 20 whose history has been recorded by dr mary
wenck of philadelphia160 she menstruated first when 15 years old six
months later the flow again appeared for the second time and lasted three
weeks without cessation since then for five years she menstruated
during march and september only each time for three weeks the flow being
profuse but not exhaustingly so without pain or systemic disturbance
examination revealed perfectly normal uterus and ovarian organs
treatment accompanied by sitzbaths during the time of month the flow
should appear accomplished nothing the semiannual flow continued and
the girl seemed in excellent health
it is a remarkable fact that as noted by dr hamilton wey at elmira
sexual outbursts among prisoners appear to occur at about march and
october beginning with the middle of february writes dr wey in a
private letter and continuing for about two months is a season of
ascending sexual wave also the latter half of september and the month of
october we are now march 30th in the midst of a wave
    according to chinese medicine it is the spring which awakens
    human passions in early greek tradition spring and summer were
    noted as the time of greatest wantonness in the season of
    toilsome summer says hesiod works and days xi 56990
    the goats are fattest wine is best women most wanton and men
    weakest it was so also in the experience of the romans pliny
    natural history bk xii ch xliii states that when the
    asparagus blooms and the cicada sings loudest is the season when
    women are most amorous but men least inclined to pleasure
    paulus gineta said that hysteria specially abounds during spring
    and autumn in lascivious girls and sterile women while more
    recent observers have believed that hysteria is particularly
    difficult to treat in autumn oribasius synopsis lib i cap
    6 quotes from rufus to the effect that sexual feeling is most
    strong in spring and least so in summer rabelais said that it
    was in march that the sexual impulse is strongest referring this
    to the early warmth of spring and that august is the month least
    favorable to sexual activity pantagruel liv v ch xxix
    nipho in his book on love dedicated to joan of aragon discussed
    the reasons why women are more lustful and amorous in summer
    and men in winter venette in his gnration de lhomme
    harmonized somewhat conflicting statements with the observation
    that spring is the season of love for both men and women in
    summer women are more amorous than men in autumn men revive to
    some extent but are still oppressed by the heat which
    sexually has a less depressing effect on women there is
    probably a real element of truth in this view and both extremes
    of heat and cold may be regarded as unfavorable to masculine
    virility it is highly probable that the wellrecognized tendency
    of piles to become troublesome in spring and in autumn is due to
    increased sexual activity piles are favored by congestion and
    sexual excitement is the most powerful cause of sudden congestion
    in the genitoanal region erasmus darwin called attention to the
    tendency of piles to recur about the equinoxes zonomia
    section xxxvi and since his days gant bonavia and cullimore
    have correlated this periodicity with sexual activity
    laycock quoting the opinions of some earlier authorities as to
    the prevalence of sexual feeling in spring stated that that
    popular opinion appears to be founded on fact nervous
    diseases of women p 69 i find that many people and perhaps
    especially women confirm from their own experience the
    statement that sexual feeling is strongest in spring and summer
    wichmann states that pollutions are most common in spring being
    perhaps the first to make that statement and also nymphomania
    in the eighteenth century schurig recorded a case of extreme
    and lifelong sexual desire in a woman whose salacity was always
    at its height towards the festival of st john gyncologia p
    16 a correspondent in the argentine republic writes to me that
    on big estancias where we have a good many shepherds nearly
    always married or rather i should say living with some woman
    for our standard of morality is not very high in these parts
    we always look out for trouble in springtime as it is a very
    common thing at this season for wives to leave their husbands and
    go and live with some other man a corresponding tendency has
    been noted even among children thus sanford bell the emotion
    of love between the sexes american journal psychology july
    1902 remarks the season of the year seems to have its effect
    upon the intensity of the emotion of sexlove among children one
    teacher from texas who furnished me with seventysix cases
    said that he had noticed that in the matter of love children
    seemed fairly to break out in the springtime many of the
    others who reported incidentally mentioned the love affairs as
    beginning in the spring this also agrees with my own
    observations
crichtonbrowne remarks that children in springtime exhibit restlessness
excitability perversity and indisposition to exertion that are not
displayed at other times this condition sometimes known as spring
fever has been studied in over a hundred cases both children and
adults by kline the majority of these report a feeling of tiredness
languor lassitude sometimes restlessness sometimes drowsiness there is
often a feeling of suffocation and a longing for nature and fresh air and
daydreams while work seems distasteful and unsatisfactory change is
felt to be necessary at all costs and sometimes there is a desire to
begin some new plan of life161 in both sexes there is frequently a wave
of sexual emotion a longing for love kline also found by examination of
a very large number of cases that between the ages of four and seventeen
it is in spring that running away from home most often occurs he suggests
that this whole group of phenomena may be due to the shifting of the
metabolic processes from the ordinary grooves into reproductive channels
and seeks to bring it into connection with the migrations of animals for
reproductive purposes162
it has long been known that the occurrence of insanity follows an annual
curve163 and though our knowledge of this curve being founded on the
date of admissions to asylums cannot be said to be quite precise it
fairly corresponds to the outbreaks of acute insanity the curve
presented in chart 4 shows the admissions to the london county council
lunatic asylums during the years 1893 to 1897 inclusive i have arranged
it in twomonth periods to neutralize unimportant oscillations in order
to show that this curve is not due to local or accidental circumstances
we may turn to france and take a special and chronic form of mental
disease garnier in his folie  paris presents an almost exactly
similar curve of the admissions of cases of general paralysis to the
infirmerie spciale at paris during the years 188688 chart 5 both
curves alike show a major climax in spring and a minor climax in autumn
    crime in general in temperate climates tends to reach its maximum
    at the beginning of the hot season usually in june thus in
    belgium the minimum is in february the maximum in june thence
    gradually diminishing lentz bulletin socit mdecine mentale
    belgique march 1901 in france lacassagne has summated the
    data extending over more than 40 years and finds that for all
    crimes june is the maximum month the minimum being reached in
    november he also gives the figures for each class of crime
    separately and every crime is found to have its own yearly
    curve poisonings show a chief maximum in may with slow fall and
    a minor climax in december assassinations have a february and a
    november climax parricides culminate in mayjune and in october
    lacassagnes tables are given by laurent les habitus des
    prisons de paris ch 1
    notwithstanding the general tendency for crime to reach its
    maximum in the first hot month a tendency not necessarily due to
    the direct influence of heat we also find when we consider the
    statistics of crime generally including sexual crime that
    there is another tendency for minor climaxes in spring and
    autumn thus in italy penta taking the statistics of nearly
    four thousand crimes murder highway robbery and sexual
    offences found the maximum in the first summer months but
    there were also minor climaxes in spring and in august and
    september penta rivista mensile di psichiatria 1899 in
    nearly all europe as is shown by a diagram given by lombroso and
    laschi at the end of the first volume of le crime politique
    while the chief climaxes occur about july there is in most
    countries a distinct tendency to spring usually about march
    and autumn september and november climaxes though they rarely
    rise as high as the july climax
    if we consider the separate periodicity of sexual offences we
    find that they follow the rule for crimes generally and usually
    show a chief maximum in early summer aschaffenburg finds that
    the annual periodicity of the sexual impulse appears more
    strongly marked the more abnormal its manifestations which he
    places in the following order of increasing periodicity

    corre in his crime en pays crole presents charts of the
    seasonal distribution of crime in guadeloupe with relation to
    temperature which show that while in a mild temperature like
    that of france and england crime attains its maximum in the hot
    season it is not so in a more tropical climate in july when in
    guadeloupe the heat attains its maximum degree crime of all
    kinds falls suddenly to a very low minimum even in the united
    states where the summer heat is often excessive it tends to
    produce a diminution of crime
    dexter in an elaborate study of the relationship of conduct to
    the weather shows that in the united states assaults present the
    maximum of frequency in april and october with a decrease during
    the summer and the winter the unusual and interesting fact
    demonstrated here with a certainty that cannot be doubted is he
    concludes that the unseasonably hot days of spring and autumn
    are the pugnacious ones even though the actual heat be much less
    than for summer we might infer from this that conditions of
    heat up to a certain extent are vitalizing while at the same
    time irritating but above that limit heat is so devitalizing
    in its effects as to leave hardly energy enough to carry on a
    fight eg dexter conduct and the weather 1899 pp 63 et
    seq
    it is not impossible that the phenomena of seasonal periodicity
    in crimes may possess a real significance in relation to sexual
    periodicity if as is possible the occurrence of spring and
    autumn climaxes of criminal activity is due less to any special
    exciting causes at these seasons than to the depressing
    influences of heat and cold in summer and winter it may appear
    reasonable to ask whether the spring and autumn climaxes of
    sexual activity are not really also largely due to a like
    depressing influence of extreme temperatures at the other two
    seasons
not only is there periodicity in criminal conduct but even within the
normal range of good and bad conduct seasonal periodicity may still be
traced in his physical and industrial training of criminals hd wey
gives charts of the conduct of seven prisoners during several years as
shown by the marks received these charts show that there is a very
decided tendency to good behavior during summer and winter while in
spring february march and april and in autumn august september and
october there are very marked falls to bad conduct each individual
tending to adhere to a conductcurve of his own wey does not himself
appear to have noticed this seasonal periodicity marro however has
investigated this question in turin on a large scale and reaches results
not very dissimilar from those shown by weys figures in new york he
noted the months in which over 4000 punishments were inflicted on
prisoners for assaults insults threatening language etc and shows the
annual curve in tavola vi of his caratteri dei delinquenti there is a
marked and isolated climax in may a still more sudden rise leads to the
chief maximum of punishment in august and from the minimum in october
there is rapid ascent during the two following months to a climax much
inferior to that of may
    the seasonal periodicity of bad conduct in prisons is of interest
    as showing that we cannot account for psychic periodicity by
    invoking exclusively social causes this theory of psychic
    periodicity has been seriously put forward but has been
    investigated and dismissed so far as crime in holland is

the general statistics of suicides in continental europe show a very
regular and unbroken curve attaining a maximum in june and a minimum in
december the curve rising steadily through the first six months sinking
steadily through the last six months but always reaching a somewhat
greater height in may than in july164 morselli shows that in various
european countries there is always a rise in spring and in autumn october
or november165 morselli attributes these spring and autumn rises to
the influence of the strain of the early heat and the early cold166 in
england also if we take a very large number of statistics for instance
the figures for london during the twenty years between 1865 and 1884 as
given by ogle in a paper read before the statistical society in 1886 we
find that although the general curve has the same maximum and minimum
points it is interrupted by a break on each side of the maximum and
these two breaks occur precisely at about march and october167 this is
shown in the curve in chart 6 which presents the daily average for the
different months
the growth of children follows an annual rhythm wahl the director of an
educational establishment for homeless girls in denmark who investigated
this question found that the increase of weight for all the ages
investigated was constantly about 33 per cent greater in the summer
halfyear than in the winter halfyear it was noteworthy that even the
children who had not reached schoolage and therefore could not be
influenced by schoollife showed a similar though slighter difference
in the same direction it is however mallinghansen the director of an
institution for deafmutes in copenhagen who has most thoroughly
investigated this matter over a great many years he finds that there are
three periods of growth throughout the year marked off in a fairly sharp
manner and that during each of these periods the growth in weight and
height shows constant characteristics from about the end of november up
to about the end of march is a period when growth both in height and
weight proceeds at a medium rate reaching neither a maximum nor a
minimum increase in weight is slight the increase in height although
trifling preponderating after this follows a period during which the
children show a marked increase in height while increase in weight is
reduced to a minimum the children constantly lose in weight during this
period of growth in height almost as much as they gain in the preceding
period this period lasts from march and april to july and august then
follows the third period which continues until november and december
during this period increase in height is very slight being at its early
minimum increase in weight on the other hand at the beginning of the
period in september and october is rapid and to the middle of december
very considerable daily increase in weight being three times as great as
during the winter months thus it may be said that the spring sexual
climax corresponds roughly with growth in height and arrest of growth in
weight while the autumn climax corresponds roughly with a period of
growth in weight and arrest of growth in height mallinghansen found that
slight variations in the growth of the children were often dependent on
changes in temperature in such a way that a rise of temperature even
lasting for only a few days caused an increase of growth and a fall of

increase in weight takes place in summer goepel found that increase in

even in healthy children
in the course of a study as to the consumption of bread in normal schools
during each month of the year as illustrating the relationship between
intellectual work and nutrition binet presents a number of curves which
bring out results to which he makes no allusion as they are outside his
own investigation almost without exception these curves show that there
is an increase in the consumption of bread in spring and in autumn the
spring rise being in february march and april the autumn rise in
october or november there are however certain fallacies in dealing with
institutions like normal schools where the conditions are not perfectly
regular throughout the year owing to vacations etc it is therefore
instructive to find that under the monotonous conditions of prisonlife
precisely the same spring and autumn rises are found binet takes the
consumption of bread in the womens prison at clermont where some four
hundred prisoners chiefly between the ages of thirty and forty are
confined and he presents two curves for the years 1895 and 1896 the
curves for these two years show certain marked disagreements with each
other but both unite in presenting a distinct rise in april preceded and
followed by a fall and both present a still more marked autumn rise in
one case in september and november in the other case in october169
    some years ago sir j crichtonbrowne stated that a
    manifestation of the sexual stimulus of spring is to be found in
    the large number of novels read during the month of march
    address in psychology at the annual meeting of the british
    medical association leeds 1889 lancet august 14 1889
    the statement was supported by figures furnished by lending
    libraries and has since been widely copied it would certainly
    be interesting if we could so simply show the connection between
    love and season by proving that when the birds began to sing
    their notes the young persons fancy naturally turns to brood
    over the pictures of mating in novels i accordingly applied to
    mr capel shaw chief librarian of the birmingham free libraries
    specially referred to by sir j crichtonbrowne who furnished
    me with the reports for 1896 and 189798 this latter report is
    carried on to the end of march 1898
    the readers who use the birmingham free lending libraries are
    about 30000 in number they consist very largely of young people
    between the ages of 14 and 25 somewhat less than half are women
    certainly we seem to have here a good field for the determination
    of this question the monthly figures for each of the ten
    birmingham libraries are given separately and it is clear at a
    glance that without exception the maximum number of readers of
    prosefiction at all the libraries during 189798 is found in the
    month of march i have chiefly taken into consideration the
    figures for 189798 the figures for 1896 are somewhat abnormal
    and irregular probably owing to a decrease in readers
    attributed to increased activity in trade and partly to a
    disturbing influence caused by the opening of a large new library
    in the course of the year suddenly increasing the number of
    readers and drafting off borrowers from some of the other
    libraries not only so but there is a second or autumnal
    climax almost equaling the spring climax and occuring with
    equal certainty appearing during 189798 either in october or
    november and during 1896 constantly in october thus the
    periodicity of the rate of consumption of prosefiction
    corresponds with the periodicity which is found to occur in the
    conception rate and in sexual ecbolic manifestations
    it is necessary however to examine somewhat more closely the
    tables presented in these reports and to compare the rate of the
    consumption of novels with that of other classes of literature
    in the first place if instead of merely considering the
    consumption of novels per month we make allowance for the
    varying length of the months and consider the average daily
    consumption per month the supremacy of march at once vanishes
    february is really the month during which most novels were read
    during the first quarter of 1898 except at two libraries where
    february and march are equal the result is similar if we
    ascertain the daily averages for the first quarter in 1897
    while in 1896 which however as i have already remarked is a
    rather abnormal year the daily average for march in many of the
    libraries falls below that for january as well as for february
    again when we turn to the other classes of books we find that
    this predominance which february possesses and to some extent
    shares with march and january by no means exclusively applies to
    novels it is not only shared by both music and poetrywhich
    would fit in well with the assumption of a sexual nisusbut
    the department of history biography voyages and travels
    shares it also with considerable regularity so also does that
    of arts sciences and natural history and it is quite well
    marked in theology moral philosophy etc and in juvenile
    literature we even have to admit that the promptings of the
    sexual instinct bring an increased body of visitors to the
    reference library where there are no novels for here also
    both the spring and autumnal climaxes are quite distinct
    certainly this theory carries us a little too far
    the main factor in producing this very marked annual periodicity
    seems to me to be wholly unconnected with the sexual impulse the
    winter half of the year from the beginning of october to the end
    of march when outdoor life has lost its attractions and much
    time must be spent in the house is naturally the season for
    reading but during the two central months of winter december
    and january the attraction of reading meets with a powerful
    counterattraction in the excitement produced by the approach of
    christmas and the increased activity of social life which
    accompanies and for several weeks follows christmas in this way
    the other four winter monthsoctober and november at the
    autumnal end and february and march at the spring endmust
    inevitably present the two chief reading climaxes of the year
    and so the reports of lending libraries present us with figures
    which show a striking but fallacious resemblance to the curves
    which are probably produced by more organic causes
    i am far from wishing to deny that the impulse which draws young
    men and women to imaginative literature is unconnected with the
    obscure promptings of the sexual instinct but until the
    disturbing influence i have just pointed out is eliminated i see
    no evidence here for any true seasonal periodicity possibly in
    prisonsthe value of which as laboratories of experimental
    psychology we have scarcely yet begun to realizemore reliable
    evidence might be obtained and those french and other prisons
    where novels are freely allowed to the prisoners might yield
    evidence as regards the consumption of fiction as instructive as
    that yielded at clermont concerning the consumption of bread
certain diseases show a very regular annual curve this is notably the
case with scarlet fever caiger found in a london fever hospital a marked
seasonal prevalence there was a minor climax in may repeated in july
and a great autumnal climax in october falling to a minimum in december
and january this curve corresponds closely to that usually observed in
london170 it is not peculiar to london or to urban districts for in
rural districts we find nearly the same spring minor maximum and major
autumnal maximum in russia it is precisely the same many other epidemic
diseases show very similar curves
an annual curve may be found in the expulsive force of the bladder as
measured by the distance to which the urinary stream can be projected
this curve as ascertained for one case is interesting on account of the
close relationship between sexual and vesical activity after a minimum
point in autumn there is a rise through the early part of the year to a
height maintained through spring and summer and reaching its maximum in
august171 this may be said to correspond with the general tendency
found in some cases of nocturnal seminal emissions from a winter minimum
to an autumn maximum
there is an annual curve in voluntary muscle strength thus in antwerp
where the scientific study of children is systematically carried out by a
pedological bureau schuyten found that measured by the dynamometer both
at the ages of 8 and 9 both boys and girls showed a gradual increase of
strength from october to january a fall from january to march and a rise
to june or july march was the weakest month june and july the
strongest172
schuyten also found an annual curve for mental ability as tested by power
of attention which for much of the year corresponded to the curve of
muscular strength being high during the cold winter months lobsien at
kiel seeking to test schuytens results and adopting a different method
so as to gauge memory as well as attention came to conclusions which
confirmed those of schuyten he found a very marked increase of ability in
december and january with a fall in april april and may were the
minimum months while july and october also stood low173 the inquiries
of schuyten and lobsien thus seem to indicate that the voluntary aptitudes
of muscular and mental force in children reach their maximum at a time of
the year when most of the more or less involuntary activities we have been
considering show a minimum of energy if this conclusion should be
confirmed by more extended investigations it would scarcely be matter for
surprise and would involve no true contradiction it would indeed be
natural to suppose that the voluntary and regulated activities of the
nervous system should work most efficiently at those periods when they are
least exposed to organic and emotional disturbance
so persistent a disturbing element in spring and autumn suggests that some
physiological conditions underlie it and that there is a real metabolic
disturbance at these times of the year so few continuous observations
have yet been made on the metabolic processes of the body that it is not
easy to verify such a surmise with absolute precision edward smiths
investigations so far as they go support it and perrycostes
longcontinued observations of pulsefrequency seem to show with fair
regularity a maximum in early spring and another maximum in late
autumn174 i may also note that haig who has devoted many years of
observations to the phenomena of uricacid excretion finds that uric acid
tends to be highest in the spring months march april may and lowest
at the first onset of cold in october175
thus while the sexual climaxes of spring and autumn are rooted in animal
procreative cycles which in man have found expression in primitive
festivalsthese again perhaps strengthening and developing the sexual
rhythmthey yet have a wider significance they constitute one among many
manifestations of spring and autumn physiological disturbance
corresponding with fair precision to the vernal and autumnal equinoxes
they resemble those periods of atmospheric tension of storm and wind
which accompany the spring and autumn phases in the earths rhythm and
they may fairly be regarded as ultimately a physiological reaction to
those cosmic influences

hystericaltheir frequently painful character
by autoerotism i mean the phenomena of spontaneous sexual emotion
generated in the absence of an external stimulus proceeding directly or
indirectly from another person in a wide sense which cannot be wholly
ignored here autoerotism may be said to include those transformations of
repressed sexual activity which are a factor of some morbid conditions as
well as of the normal manifestation of art and poetry and indeed more
or less color the whole of life
such a definition excludes the normal sexual excitement aroused by the
presence of a beloved person of the opposite sex it also excludes the
perverted sexuality associated with an attraction to a person of the same
sex it further excludes the manifold forms of erotic fetichism in which
the normal focus of sexual attraction is displaced and voluptuous
emotions are only aroused by some objecthair shoes garments
etcwhich to the ordinary lover are of subordinatethough still
indeed considerableimportance176 the autoerotic field remains
extensive it ranges from occasional voluptuous daydreams in which the
subject is entirely passive to the perpetual unashamed efforts at sexual
selfmanipulation witnessed among the insane it also includes though
chiefly as curiosities those cases in which individuals fall in love with
themselves among autoerotic phenomena or on the borderland we must
further include those religious sexual manifestations for an ideal object
of which we may find evidence in the lives of saints and ecstatics177
the typical form of autoerotism is the occurrence of the sexual orgasm
during sleep
i do not know that any apology is needful for the invention of the term
autoerotism178 there is no existing word in current use to indicate
the whole range of phenomena i am here concerned with we are familiar
with masturbation but that strictly speaking only covers a special
and arbitrary subdivision of the field although it is true the
subdivision with which physicians and alienists have chiefly occupied
themselves selfabuse is somewhat wider but by no means covers the
whole ground while for various reasons it is an unsatisfactory term
onanism is largely used especially in france and some writers even
include all forms of homosexual connection under this name it may be
convenient to do so from a physiological point of view but it is a
confusing and antiquated mode of procedure and from the psychological
standpoint altogether illegitimate onanism ought never to be used in
this connection if only on the ground that onans device was not
autoerotic but was an early example of withdrawal before emission or
coitus interruptus
while the name that i have chosen may possibly not be the best there
should be no question as to the importance of grouping all these phenomena
together it seems to me that this field has rarely been viewed in a
scientifically sound and morally sane light simply because it has not
been viewed as a whole we have made it difficult so to view it by
directing our attention on the special group of autoerotic factsthat
group included under masturbationwhich was most easy to observe and
which in an extreme form came plainly under medical observation in
insanity and allied conditions and we have wilfully torn this group of
facts away from the larger group to which it naturally belongs the
questions which have been so widely so diversely andit must
unfortunately be addedoften so mischievously discussed concerning the
nature and evils of masturbation are not seen in their true light and
proportions until we realize that masturbation is but a specialized form
of a tendency which in some form or in some degree normally affects not
only man but all the higher animals from a medical point of view it is
often convenient to regard masturbation as an isolated fact but in order
to understand it we must bear in mind its relationships in this study of
autoerotism i shall frequently have occasion to refer to the old entity
of masturbation because it has been more carefully studied than any
other part of the autoerotic field but i hope it will always be borne in
mind that the psychological significance and even the medical diagnostic
value of masturbation cannot be appreciated unless we realize that it is
an artificial subdivision of a great group of natural facts
the study of autoerotism is far from being an unimportant or merely
curious study yet psychologists medical and nonmedical almost without
exception treat its manifestationswhen they refer to them at allin a
dogmatic and offhand manner which is far from scientific it is not
surprising therefore that the most widely divergent opinions are
expressed nor is it surprising that ignorant and chaotic notions among
the general population should lead to results that would be ludicrous if
they were not pathetic to mention one instance known to me a married
lady who is a leader in socialpurity movements and an enthusiast for
sexual chastity discovered through reading some pamphlet against
solitary vice that she had herself been practicing masturbation for years
without knowing it the profound anguish and hopeless despair of this
woman in face of what she believed to be the moral ruin of her whole life
cannot well be described it would be easy to give further examples
though scarcely a more striking one to show the utter confusion into
which we are thrown by leaving this matter in the hands of blind leaders
of the blind moreover the conditions of modern civilization render
autoerotism a matter of increasing social significance as our
marriagerate declines and as illicit sexual relationships continue to be
openly discouraged it is absolutely inevitable that autoerotic phenomena
of one kind or another not only among women but also among men should
increase among us both in amount and intensity it becomes therefore a
matter of some importance both to the moralist and the physician to
investigate the psychological nature of these phenomena and to decide
precisely what their attitude should be toward them
i do not purpose to enter into a thorough discussion of all the aspects of
autoerotism that would involve a very extensive study indeed i wish to
consider briefly certain salient points concerning autoerotic phenomena
especially their prevalence their nature and their moral physical and
other effects i base my study partly on the facts and opinions which
during the last thirty years have been scattered through the periodical
and other medical literature of europe and america and partly on the
experience of individuals especially of fairly normal individuals
among animals in isolation and sometimes in freedomthough this can less
often be observedit is well known that various forms of spontaneous
solitary sexual excitement occur horses when leading a lazy life may be
observed flapping the penis until some degree of emission takes place
welsh ponies i learn from a man who has had much experience with these
animals habitually produce erections and emissions in their stalls they
do not bring their hind quarters up during this process and they close
their eyes which does not take place when they have congress with mares
the same informant observed that bulls and goats produce emissions by
using their forelegs as a stimulus bringing up their hind quarters and
mares rub themselves against objects i am informed by a gentleman who is
a recognized authority on goats that they sometimes take the penis into
the mouth and produce actual orgasm thus practicing autofellatio as
regards ferrets the rev h northcote states i am informed by a
gentleman who has had considerable experience of ferrets that if the
bitch when in heat cannot obtain a dog she pines and becomes ill if a
smooth pebble is introduced into the hutch she will masturbate upon it
thus preserving her normal health for one season but if this artificial
substitute is given to her a second season she will not as formerly be
content with it179
stags in the rutting season when they have no partners rub themselves
against trees to produce ejaculation sheep masturbate as also do camels
pressing themselves down against convenient objects and elephants
compress the penis between the hind legs to obtain emissions180
blumenbach observed a bear act somewhat similarly on seeing other bears
coupling and hyenas according to ploss and bartels have been seen
practicing mutual masturbation by licking each others genitals mammary
masturbation remarks fr is found in certain female and even male
animals like the dog and the cat181 apes are much given to
masturbation even in freedom according to the evidence of good
observers for while no female apes are celibates many of the males are
obliged to lead a life of celibacy182 male monkeys use the hand in
masturbation to rub and shake the penis183
in the human species these phenomena are by no means found in civilization
alone to whatever extent masturbation may have been developed by the
conditions of european life which carry to the utmost extreme the
concomitant stimulation and repression of the sexual emotions it is far
from being as mantegazza has declared it to be one of the moral
characteristics of europeans184 it is found among the people of nearly
every race of which we have any intimate knowledge however natural the
conditions under which men and women may live185 thus among the nama
hottentots among the young women at all events gustav fritsch found that
masturbation is so common that it is regarded as a custom of the country
no secret is made of it and in the stories and legends of the race it is
treated as one of the most ordinary facts of life it is so also among the
basutos and the kaffirs are addicted to the same habit186 the fuegians
have a word for masturbation and a special word for masturbation by
women187 when the spaniards first arrived at vizcaya in the
philippines they found that masturbation was universal and that it was
customary for the women to use an artificial penis and other abnormal
methods of sexual gratification among the balinese according to jacobs
as quoted by ploss and bartels masturbation is general in the boudoir
of many a bali beauty he adds and certainly in every harem may be found
a wax penis to which many hours of solitude are devoted throughout the
east as eram speaking from a long medical experience has declared
masturbation is very prevalent especially among young girls in egypt
according to sonnini it is prevalent in harems in india a medical
correspondent tells me he once treated the widow of a wealthy mohammedan
who informed him that she began masturbation at an early age just like
all other women the same informant tells me that on the faade of a
large temple in orissa are basreliefs representing both men and women
alone masturbating and also women masturbating men among the tamils of
ceylon masturbation is said to be common in cochin china lorion remarks
it is practiced by both sexes but especially by the married women188
japanese women have probably carried the mechanical arts of autoerotism
to the highest degree of perfection they use two hollow balls about the
size of a pigeons egg sometimes one alone is used which as described
by joest christian and others189 are made of very thin leaf of brass
one is empty the other called the little man contains a small heavy
metal ball or else some quicksilver and sometimes metal tongues which
vibrate when set in movement so that if the balls are held in the hand
side by side there is a continuous movement the empty one is first
introduced into the vagina in contact with the uterus then the other the
slightest movement of the pelvis or thighs or even spontaneous movement
of the organs causes the metal ball or the quicksilver to roll and the
resulting vibration produces a prolonged voluptuous titillation a gentle
shock as from a weak electric inductive apparatus the balls are called
rinnotama and are held in the vagina by a paper tampon the women who
use these balls delight to swing themselves in a hammock or rockingchair
the delicate vibration of the balls slowly producing the highest degree of
sexual excitement joest mentions that this apparatus though well known
by name to ordinary girls is chiefly used by the more fashionable
geishas as well as by prostitutes its use has now spread to china
annam and india japanese women also it is said frequently use an
artificial penis of paper or clay called eg among the atjeh again
according to jacobs as quoted by ploss the young of both sexes
masturbate and the elder girls use an artificial penis of wax in china
also the artificial penismade of rosin supple and like the classical
instrument described by herondas rosecoloredis publicly sold and
widely used by women190
it may be noticed that among noneuropean races it is among women and
especially among those who are subjected to the excitement of a life
professionally devoted to some form of pleasure that the use of the
artificial instruments of autoerotism is chiefly practiced the same is
markedly true in europe the use of an artificial penis in solitary sexual
gratification may be traced down from classic times and doubtless
prevailed in the very earliest human civilization for such an instrument
is said to be represented in old babylonian sculptures and it is referred
to by ezekiel ch xvi v 17 the lesbian women are said to have used
such instruments made of ivory or gold with silken stuffs and linen
aristophanes lysistrata v 109 speaks of the manufacture by the
milesian women of a leather artificial penis or olisbos in the british
museum is a vase representing a hetaira holding such instruments which
as found at pompeii may be seen in the museum at naples one of the best
of herondass mimes the private conversation presents a dialogue
between two ladies concerning a certain olisbos or nbn which one of
them vaunts as a dream of delight through the middle ages when from time
to time the clergy reprobated the use of such instruments191 they
continued to be known and after the fifteenth century the references to
them became more precise thus fortini the siennese novelist of the
sixteenth century refers in his novelle dei novizi 7th day novella
xxxix to the glass object filled with warm water which nuns use to calm
the sting of the flesh and to satisfy themselves as well as they can he
adds that widows and other women anxious to avoid pregnancy availed
themselves of it in elizabethan england at the same time it appears to
have been of similar character and marston in his satires tells how lucea
prefers a glassy instrument to her husbands lukewarm bed in
sixteenth century france also such instruments were sometimes made of
glass and brantme refers to the godemiche in eighteenth century germany
they were called samthanse and their use according to heinse as
quoted by dhren was common among aristocratic women in england by that
time the dildo appears to have become common archemholtz states that
while in paris they are only sold secretly in london a certain mrs
philips sold them openly on a large scale in her shop in leicester square
john bee in 1835 stating that the name was originally dildol remarks
that their use was formerly commoner than it was in his day in france
madame gourdan the most notorious brothelkeeper of the eighteenth
century carried on a wholesale trade in consolateurs as they were
called and at her death numberless letters from abbesses and simple nuns
were found among her papers asking for a consolateur to be sent192
the modern french instrument is described by gamier as of hardened red
rubber exactly imitating the penis and capable of holding warm milk or
other fluid for injection at the moment of orgasm the compressible
scrotum is said to have been first added in the eighteenth century193
in islam the artificial penis has reached nearly as high a development as
in christendom turkish women use it and it is said to be openly sold in
smyrna in the harems of zanzibar according to baumann it is of
considerable size carved out of ebony or ivory and commonly bored
through so that warm water may be injected it is here regarded as an arab
invention194
somewhat similar appliances may be traced in all centres of civilization
but throughout they appear to be frequently confined to the world of
prostitutes and to those women who live on the fashionable or
semiartistic verge of that world ignorance and delicacy combine with a
less versatile and perverted concentration on the sexual impulse to
prevent any general recourse to such highly specialized methods of
solitary gratification
on the other hand the use or rather abuse of the ordinary objects and
implements of daily life in obtaining autoerotic gratification among the
ordinary population in civilized modern lands has reached an
extraordinary degree of extent and variety we can only feebly estimate by
the occasional resulting mischances which come under the surgeons hands
because only a certain proportion of such instruments are dangerous thus
the banana seems to be widely used for masturbation by women and appears
to be marked out for the purpose by its size and shape195 it is
however innocuous and never comes under the surgeons notice the same
may probably be said of the cucumbers and other vegetables more especially
used by country and factory girls in masturbation a lady living near
vichy told pouillet that she had often heard and had herself been able to
verify the fact that the young peasant women commonly used turnips
carrots and beetroots in the eighteenth century mirabeau in his
erotikca biblion gave a list of the various objects used in convents
which he describes as vast theatres of such practices to obtain
solitary sexual excitement in more recent years the following are a few
of the objects found in the vagina or bladder whence they could only be
removed by surgical interference196 pencils sticks of sealingwax
cottonreels hairpins and in italy very commonly the bonepins used in
the hair bodkins knittingneedles crochetneedles needlecases
compasses glass stoppers candles corks tumblers forks toothpicks
toothbrushes pomadepots in a case recorded by schroeder with a
cockchafer inside a makeshift substitute for the japanese rinnotama
while in one recent english case a fullsized hens egg was removed from
the vagina of a middleaged married woman more than ninetenths of the
foreign bodies found in the female bladder or urethra are due to
masturbation the age of the individuals in whom such objects have been
found is usually from 17 to 30 but in a few cases they have been found in
girls below 14 infrequently in women between 40 and 50 the large
objects naturally are found chiefly in the vagina and in married
women197
hairpins have above all been found in the female bladder with special
frequency this point is worth some consideration as an illustration of
the enormous frequency of this form of autoerotism the female urethra is
undoubtedly a normal centre of sexual feeling as pouillet pointed out
many years ago a woman medical correspondent also writes that in some
women the maximum of voluptuous sensation is at the vesical sphincter or
orifice though not always so limited eh smith indeed considers that
the urethra is the part in which the orgasm occurs and remarks that in
sexual excitement mucus always flows largely from the urethra198 it
should be added that when once introduced the physiological mechanism of
the bladder apparently causes the organ to tend to swallow the foreign
object yet for every case in which the hairpin disappears and is lost
in the bladder from carelessness or the oblivion of the sexual spasm
there must be a vast number of cases in which the instrument is used
without any such unfortunate result there is thus great significance in
the frequency with which cases of hairpin in the bladder are strewn
through the medical literature of all countries
in 1862 a german surgeon found the accident so common that he invented a
special instrument for extracting hairpins from the female bladder as
indeed italian and french surgeons have also done in france denuc of
bordeaux came to the conclusion that hairpin in the bladder is the
commonest result of masturbation as known to the surgeon in england cases
are constantly being recorded lawson tait stating that most cases of
stone in the bladder in women are due to the introduction of a foreign
body very often a hairpin adds i have removed hairpins encrusted
with phosphates from ten different female bladders and not one of the
owners of these bladders would give any account of the incident199
stokes again records that during four years he had four cases of
hairpin in the female urethra200 in new york one physician met with
four cases in a short experience201 in switzerland professor reverdin
had a precisely similar experience202
there is however another class of material objects widely employed for
producing physical autoerotism which in the nature of things never
reaches the surgeon i refer to the effects that naturally or
unnaturally may be produced by many of the objects and implements of
daily life that do not normally come in direct contact with the sexual
organs children sometimes even when scarcely more than infants produce
sexual excitement by friction against the corner of a chair or other piece
of furniture and women sometimes do the same203 guttceit in russia
knew women who made a large knot in their chemises to rub against and
mentions a woman who would sit on her naked heel and rub it against her
girls in france i am informed are fond of riding on the
chevauxdebois or hobbyhorses because of the sexual excitement thus
aroused and that the sexual emotions play a part in the fascination
exerted by this form of amusement everywhere is indicated by the ecstatic
faces of its devotees204 at the temples in some parts of central india
i am told swings are hung up in pairs men and women swinging in these
until sexually excited during the months when the men in these districts
have to be away from home the girls put up swings to console themselves
for the loss of their husbands
    it is interesting to observe the very wide prevalence of
    swinging often of a religious or magic character and the
    evident sexual significance underlying it although this is not
    always clearly brought out groos discussing the frequency of
    swinging die spiele der menschen p 114 refers for
    instance to the custom of the gilbert islanders for a young man
    to swing a girl from a coco palm and then to cling on and swing
    with her in ancient greece women and grownup girls were fond
    of seesaws and swings the athenians had indeed a swinging
    festival athenus bk xiv ch x songs of a voluptuous
    character we gather from athenus were sung by the women at
    this festival jg frazer the golden bough vol ii note a
    swinging as a magical rite discusses the question and brings
    forward instances in which men or especially women swing the
    notion seems to be he states that the ceremony promotes
    fertility whether in the vegetable or in the animal kingdom
    though why it should be supposed to do so i confess myself
    unable to explain loc cit p 450 the explanation seems
    however not far to seek in view of the facts quoted above and
    frazer himself refers to the voluptuous character of the songs
    sometimes sung
    even apart from actual swinging of the whole body a swinging
    movement may suffice to arouse sexual excitement and mayat
    all events in womenconstitute an essential part of methods of
    attaining solitary sexual gratification kiernan thus describes
    the habitual autoerotic procedure of a young american woman
    the patient knelt before a chair let her elbows drop on its
    seat grasping the arms with a firm grip then commenced a
    swinging writhing motion seeming to fix her pelvis and moving
    her trunk and limbs the muscles were rigid the face took on a
    passionate expression the features were contorted the eyes
    rolled the teeth were set and the lips compressed while the
    cheeks were purple the condition bore a striking resemblance to
    the passional stage of grand hysteria the reveling took only a
    moment to commence but lasted a long time swaying induced a
    pleasurable sensation accompanied with a feeling of suction upon
    the clitoris almost immediately after a sensation of bursting
    caused by discharge from the vulvovaginal glands occurs
    followed by a rapture prolonged for an indefinite time the
    accompanying sexual imagery is so vivid as almost to become
    hallucinatory jg kiernan sex transformation and psychic
    impotence american journal of dermatology vol ix no 2
somewhat similarly sensations of sexual character are sometimes
experienced by boys when climbing up a pole it is not even necessary that
there should be direct external contact with the sexual organs and howe
states that gymnastic swinging poles around which boys swing while
supporting the whole weight on the hands may suffice to produce sexual
excitement
several writers have pointed out that riding especially in women may
produce sexual excitement and orgasm205 it is wellknown also that
both in men and women the vibratory motion of a railwaytrain frequently
produces a certain degree of sexual excitement especially when sitting
forward such excitement may remain latent and not become specifically
sexual206 i am not aware that this quality of railway traveling has
ever been fostered as a sexual perversion but the sewingmachine has
attracted considerable attention on account of its influence in exciting
autoerotic manifestations the early type of sewingmachine especially
was of very heavy character and involved much up and down movement of the
legs langdon down pointed out many years ago that this frequently
produced great sexual erethism which led to masturbation207 according
to one french authority it is a wellrecognized fact that to work a
sewingmachine with the body in a certain position produces sexual
excitement leading to the orgasm the occurrence of the orgasm is
indicated to the observer by the machine being worked for a few seconds
with uncontrollable rapidity this sound is said to be frequently heard in
large french workrooms and it is part of the duty of the superintendents
of the rooms to make the girls sit properly208
    during a visit which i once paid to a manufactory of military
    clothing pouillet writes i witnessed the following scene in
    the midst of the uniform sound produced by some thirty
    sewingmachines i suddenly heard one of the machines working
    with much more velocity than the others i looked at the person
    who was working it a brunette of 18 or 20 while she was
    automatically occupied with the trousers she was making on the
    machine her face became animated her mouth opened slightly her
    nostrils dilated her feet moved the pedals with constantly
    increasing rapidity soon i saw a convulsive look in her eyes
    her eyelids were lowered her face turned pale and was thrown
    backward hands and legs stopped and became extended a
    suffocated cry followed by a long sigh was lost in the noise of
    the workroom the girl remained motionless a few seconds drew
    out her handkerchief to wipe away the pearls of sweat from her
    forehead and after casting a timid and ashamed glance at her
    companions resumed her work the forewoman who acted as my
    guide having observed the direction of my gaze took me up to
    the girl who blushed lowered her face and murmured some
    incoherent words before the forewoman had opened her mouth to
    advise her to sit fully on the chair and not on its edge
    as i was leaving i heard another machine at another part of the
    room in accelerated movement the forewoman smiled at me and
    remarked that that was so frequent that it attracted no notice
    it was specially observed she told me in the case of young
    workgirls apprentices and those who sat on the edge of their
    seats thus much facilitating friction of the labia
in cases where the sewingmachine does not lead to direct selfexcitement
it has been held as by fothergill209 to predispose to frequency of
involuntary sexual orgasm during sleep from the irritation set up by the
movement of the feet in the sitting posture during the day the essential
movement in working the sewingmachine is the flexion and extension of the
ankle but the muscles of the thighs are used to maintain the feet firmly
on the treadle the thighs are held together and there is a considerable
degree of flexion or extension of the thighs on the trunk by a special
adjustment of the body and sometimes perhaps merely in the presence of
sexual hypersthesia it is thus possible to act upon the sexual organs
but this is by no means a necessary result of using the sewingmachine
and inquiry of various women with welldeveloped sexual feelings who are
accustomed to work the treadle has not shown the presence of any tendency
in this direction
sexual irritation may also be produced by the bicycle in women thus
moll210 remarks that he knows many married women and some unmarried
who experience sexual excitement when cycling in several cases he has
ascertained that the excitement is carried as far as complete orgasm this
result cannot however easily happen unless the seat is too high the
peak in contact with the organs and a rolling movement is adopted in the
absence of marked hypersthesia these results are only effected by a bad
seat or an improper attitude the body during cycling resting under proper
conditions on the buttocks and the work being mainly done by the muscles
of the thighs and legs which control the ankles flexion of the thigh on
the pelvis being very small most medical authorities on cycling are of
opinion that when cycling leads to sexual excitement the fault lies more
with the woman than with the machine this conclusion does not appear to
me to be absolutely correct i find on inquiry that with the oldfashioned
saddle with an elevated peak rising toward the pubes a certain degree of
sexual excitement not usually producing the orgasm but as one lady
expressed it making one feel quite ready for it is fairly common among
women lydston finds that irritation of the genital organs may
unquestionably be produced in both males and females by cycling the
aggravation of hmorrhoids sometimes produced by cycling indicates also
the tendency to local congestion with the improved flat saddles however
constructed with more definite adjustment to the anatomical formation of
the parts this general tendency is reduced to a negligible minimum
reference may be made at this point to the influence of tightlacing this
has been recognized by gyncologists as a factor of sexual excitement and
a method of masturbation211 women who have never worn corsets sometimes
find that on first putting them on sexual feeling is so intensified that
it is necessary to abandon their use212 the reason of this as siebert
points out in his buch fr eltern seems to be that the corset both
favors pelvic congestion and at the same time exerts a pressure on the
abdominal muscles which brings them into the state produced during coitus
it is doubtless for the same reason that as some women have found more
distension of the bladder is possible without corsets than with them
in a further class of cases no external object whatever is used to procure
the sexual orgasm but the more or less voluntary pressure of the thighs
alone is brought to bear upon the sexual regions it is done either when
sitting or standing the thighs being placed together and firmly crossed
and the pelvis rocked so that the sexual organs are pressed against the
inner and posterior parts of the thighs213 this is sometimes done by
men and is fairly common among women especially according to
martineau214 among those who sit much such as dressmakers and
milliners those who use the sewingmachine and those who ride vedeler
remarks that in his experience in scandinavia thighfriction is the
commonest form of masturbation in women the practice is widespread and a
medical correspondent in india tells me of a brahmin widow who confessed
to this form of masturbation i am told that in london board schools at
the present time thighrubbing is not infrequent among the girl scholars
the proportion mentioned in one school was about ten per cent of the
girls over eleven the thighrubbing is done more or less openly and is
interpreted by the uninitiated as due merely to a desire to relieve the
bladder it is found in female infants thus townsend records the case of
an infant 8 months old who would cross her right thigh over the left
close her eyes and clench her fists after a minute or two there would be
complete relaxation with sweating and redness of face this would occur
about once a week or oftener the child was quite healthy with no
abnormal condition of the genital organs215 the frequency of
thighfriction among women as a form of masturbation is due to the fact
that it is usually acquired innocently and it involves no indecorum thus
soutzo reports the case of a girl of 12 who at school when having to wait
her turn at the watercloset for fear of wetting herself would put her
clothes between her legs and press her thighs together moving them
backwards and forwards in the effort to control the bladder she
discovered that a pleasurable sensation was thus produced and acquired the
habit of practicing the manoeuvre for its own sake at the age of 17 she
began to vary it in different ways thus she would hang from a tree with
her legs swinging and her chemise pressed between her thighs which she
would rub together216 thighfriction in some of its forms is so
comparatively decorous a form of masturbation that it may even be
performed in public places thus a few years ago while waiting for a
train at a station on the outskirts of a provincial town i became aware
of the presence of a young woman sitting alone on a seat at a little
distance whom i could observe unnoticed she was leaning back with legs
crossed swinging the crossed foot vigorously and continuously this
continued without interruption for some ten minutes after i first observed
her then the swinging movement reached a climax she leant still further
back thus bringing the sexual region still more closely in contact with
the edge of the bench and straightened and stiffened her body and legs in
what appeared to be a momentary spasm there could be little doubt as to
what had taken place a few moments later she slowly walked from her
solitary seat into the waitingroom and sat down among the other waiting
passengers quite still now and with uncrossed legs a pale quiet young
woman possibly a farmers daughter serenely unconscious that her
manoeuvre had been detected and very possibly herself ignorant of its
true nature
there are many other forms in which the impulse of autoerotism presents
itself dancing is often a powerful method of sexual excitement not only
among civilized but among savage peoples and zache describes the erotic
dances of swaheli women as having a masturbatory object217 stimulation
of the nates is a potent adjuvant to the production of selfexcitement
and selfflagellation with rods etc is practiced by some individuals
especially young women218 urtication is another form of this
stimulation reverdin knew a young woman who obtained sexual gratification
by flogging herself with chestnut burrs and it is stated that in some
parts of france departments of the ain and cte dor it is not uncommon
for young girls to masturbate by rubbing the leaves of the linaria
cymbalaria here called pinton or timbarde on to the sexual parts
thus producing a burning sensation219 stimulation of the mamma
normally an erogenous centre in women may occasionally serve as a method
for obtaining autoerotic satisfaction including the orgasm in both
sexes i have been told of a case in a man and a medical correspondent in
india informs me that he knows a eurasian woman addicted to masturbation
who can only obtain the orgasm by rubbing the genitals with one hand while
with the other she rubs and finally squeezes her breasts the tactile
stimulation even of regions of the body which are not normally erogenous
zones in either sex may sometimes lead on to sexual excitement
hirschsprung as well as freud believes that this is often the case as
regards fingersucking and toesucking in infancy even stroking the chin
remarks debreyne may produce a pollution220 taylor refers to the case
of a young woman of 22 who was liable to attacks of choreic movements of
the hands which would terminate in alternately pressing the middle finger
on the tip of the nose and the tragus of the ear when a faraway
pleased expression would appear on her face she thus produced sexual
excitement and satisfaction she had no idea of wrongdoing and was
surprised and ashamed when she realized the nature of her act221
most of the foregoing examples of autoerotism are commonly included by
no means correctly under the heading of masturbation there are
however a vast number of people possessing strong sexual emotions and
living a solitary life who experience sometimes by instinct and
sometimes on moral grounds a strong repugnance for these manifestations
of autoerotism as one highly intelligent lady writes i have sometimes
wondered whether i could produce it complete sexual excitement
mechanically but i have a curious unreasonable repugnance to trying the
experiment it would materialize it too much the same repugnance may be
traced in the tendency to avoid so far as possible the use of the hands
it is quite common to find this instinctive unreasoning repugnance among
women a healthy repugnance not founded on any moral ground in men the
same repugnance exists more often combined with or replaced by a very
strong moral and sthetic objection to such practices but the presence of
such a repugnance however invincible is very far from carrying us
outside the autoerotic field the production of the sexual orgasm is not
necessarily dependent on any external contact or voluntary mechanical
cause
as an example though not of specifically autoerotic manifestations i
may mention the case of a man of 57 a somewhat eccentric preacher etc
who writes my whole nature goes out so to some persons and they thrill
and stir me so that i have an emission while sitting by them with no
thought of sex only the gladness of soul found its way out thus and a
glow of health suffused the whole body there was no spasmodic conclusion
but a pleasing gentle sensation as the few drops of semen passed in
reality no doubt not semen but urethral fluid this mans condition
may certainly be considered somewhat morbid he is attracted to both men
and women and the sexual impulse seems to be irritable and weak but a
similar state of things exists so often in women no doubt due to sexual
repression and in individuals who are in a general state of normal and
good health that in these it can scarcely be called morbid brooding on
sexual images which the theologians termed delectatio morosa may lead
to spontaneous orgasm in either sex even in perfectly normal persons
hammond described as a not uncommon form of psychic coitus a condition
in which the simple act of imagination alone in the presence of the
desired object suffices to produce orgasm in some public conveyance
theatre or elsewhere the man sees a desirable woman and by concentrating
his attention on her person and imagining all the stages of intimacy he
quickly succeeds in producing orgasm222 niceforo refers to an italian
workgirl of 14 who could obtain ejaculation of mucus four times a day in
the workroom in the presence of the other girls without touching herself
or moving her body by simply thinking of sexual things223
if the orgasm occurs spontaneously without the aid of mental impressions
or any manipulations ad hoc though under such conditions it ceases to
be sinful from the theological standpoint it certainly ceases also to be
normal srieux records the case of a somewhat neurotic woman of 50 who
had been separated from her husband for ten years and since lived a
chaste life at this age however she became subject to violent crises of
sexual orgasm which would come on without any accompaniment of voluptuous
thoughts macgillicuddy records three cases of spontaneous orgasm in women
coming under his notice224 such crises are frequently found in both men
and women who from moral reasons ignorance or on other grounds are
restrained from attaining the complete sexual orgasm but whose sexual
emotions are literally continually dribbling from them schrencknotzing
knows a lady who is spontaneously sexually excited on hearing music or
seeing pictures without anything lascivious in them she knows nothing of
sexual relationships another lady is sexually excited on seeing beautiful
and natural scenes like the sea sexual ideas are mixed up in her mind
with these things and the contemplation of a specially strong and
sympathetic man brings the orgasm on in about a minute both these ladies
masturbate in the streets restaurants railways theatres without
anyone perceiving it225 a brahmin woman informed a medical
correspondent in india that she had distinct though feeble orgasm with
copious outflow of mucus if she stayed long near a man whose face she
liked and this is not uncommon among european women evidently under such
conditions there is a state of hypersthetic weakness here however we
are passing the frontiers of strictly autoerotic phenomena
    delectatio morosa as understood by the theologians is
    distinct from desire and also distinct from the definite
    intention of effecting the sexual act although it may lead to
    those things it is the voluntary and complacent dallying in
    imagination with voluptuous thoughts when no effort is made to
    repel them it is as aquinas and others point out constituted
    by this act of complacent dallying and has no reference to the
    duration of the imaginative process debreyne in his
    moechialogie pp 149163 deals fully with this question and
    quotes the opinions of theologians i may add that in the early
    penitentials before the elaboration of catholic theology the
    voluntary emission of semen through the influence of evil
    thoughts was recognized as a sin though usually only if it
    occurred in church in egberts penitential of the eighth or
    ninth century cap ix 12 the penance assigned for this
    offence in the case of a deacon is 25 days in the case of a
    monk 30 days a priest 40 days a bishop 50 haddon and
    stubbs councils and ecclesiastical documents vol iii p
    426
    the frequency of spontaneous orgasm in women seems to have been
    recognized in the seventeenth century thus schurig
    syllepsilogia p 4 apparently quoting riolan states that
    some women are so wanton that the sight of a handsome man or of
    their lover or speech with such a one will cause them to
    ejaculate their semen
there is however a closely allied and indeed overlapping form of
autoerotism which may be considered here i mean that associated with
revery or daydreaming although this is a very common and important
form of autoerotism besides being in a large proportion of cases the
early stage of masturbation it appears to have attracted little
attention226 the daydream has indeed been studied in its chief form
in the continued story by mabel learoyd of wellesley college the
continued story is an imagined narrative more or less peculiar to the
individual by whom it is cherished with fondness and regarded as an
especially sacred mental possession to be shared only if at all with
very sympathizing friends it is commoner among girls and young women than
among boys and young men among 352 persons of both sexes 47 per cent
among the women and only 14 per cent among the men have any continued
story the startingpoint is an incident from a book or more usually
some actual experience which the subject develops the subject is nearly
always the hero or the heroine of the story the growth of the story is
favored by solitude and lying in bed before going to sleep is the time
specially sacred to its cultivation227 no distinct reference perhaps
naturally enough is made by miss learoyd to the element of sexual emotion
with which these stories are often strongly tinged and which is
frequently their real motive though by no means easy to detect these
elaborate and more or less erotic daydreams are not uncommon in young
men and especially in young women each individual has his own particular
dream which is always varying or developing but except in very
imaginative persons to no great extent such a daydream is often founded
on a basis of pleasurable personal experience and develops on that basis
it may involve an element of perversity even though that element finds no
expression in real life it is of course fostered by sexual abstinence
hence its frequency in young women most usually there is little attempt
to realize it it does not necessarily lead to masturbation though it
often causes some sexual congestion or even spontaneous sexual orgasm the
daydream is a strictly private and intimate experience not only from its
very nature but also because it occurs in images which the subject finds
great difficulty in translating into language even when willing to do so
in other cases it is elaborately dramatic or romantic in character the
hero or heroine passing through many experiences before attaining the
erotic climax of the story this climax tends to develop in harmony with
the subjects growing knowledge or experience at first merely a kiss it
may develop into any refinement of voluptuous gratification the daydream
may occur either in normal or abnormal persons rousseau in his
confessions describes such dreams in his case combined with masochism
and masturbation a distinguished american novelist hamlin garland has
admirably described in rose of dutchers coolly the part played in the
erotic daydreams of a healthy normal girl at adolescence by a
circusrider seen on the first visit to a circus and becoming a majestic
ideal to dominate the girls thoughts for many years228
raffalovich229 describes the process by which in sexual inverts the
vision of a person of the same sex perhaps seen in the streets or the
theatre is evoked in solitary reveries producing a kind of psychic
onanism whether or not it leads on to physical manifestations
although daydreaming of this kind has at present been very little
studied since it loves solitude and secrecy and has never been counted
of sufficient interest for scientific inquisition it is really a process
of considerable importance and occupies a large part of the autoerotic
field it is frequently cultivated by refined and imaginative young men
and women who lead a chaste life and would often be repelled by
masturbation in such persons under such circumstances it must be
considered as strictly normal the inevitable outcome of the play of the
sexual impulse no doubt it may often become morbid and is never a
healthy process when indulged in to excess as it is liable to be by
refined young people with artistic impulses to whom it is in the highest
degree seductive and insidious230 as we have seen however
daydreaming is far from always colored by sexual emotion yet it is a
significant indication of its really sexual origin that as i have been
informed by persons of both sexes even in these apparently nonsexual
cases it frequently ceases altogether on marriage
even when we have eliminated all these forms of autoerotic activity
however refined in which the subject takes a voluntary part we have
still left unexplored an important portion of the autoerotic field a
portion which many people are alone inclined to consider normal sexual
orgasm during sleep that under conditions of sexual abstinence in healthy
individuals there must inevitably be some autoerotic manifestations
during waking life a careful study of the facts compels us to believe
there can be no doubt also that under the same conditions the
occurrence of the complete orgasm during sleep with in men seminal
emissions is altogether normal even zeus himself as pausanias has
recorded was liable to such accidents a statement which at all events
shows that to the greek mind there was nothing derogatory in such an
occurrence231 the jews however regarded it as an impurity232 and
the same idea was transmitted to the christian church and embodied in the
word pollutio by which the phenomenon was designated in ecclesiastical
phraseology233 according to billuart and other theologians pollution
in sleep is not sin unless voluntarily caused if however it begins in
sleep and is completed in the halfwaking state with a sense of
pleasure it is a venial sin but it seems allowable to permit a nocturnal
pollution to complete itself on awaking if it occurs without intention
and st thomas even says si pollutio placeat ut natur exoneratio vel
alleviatio peccatum non creditur
    notwithstanding the fair and logical position of the more
    distinguished latin theologians there has certainly been a
    widely prevalent belief in catholic countries that pollution
    during sleep is a sin in the parsons tale chaucer makes the
    parson say another sin appertaineth to lechery that cometh in
    sleeping and the sin cometh oft to them that be maidens and eke
    to them that be corrupt and this sin men clepe pollution that
    cometh in four manners these four manners being 1 languishing
    of body from rank and abundant humors 2 infirmity 3 surfeit
    of meat and drink and 4 villainous thoughts four hundred
    years later madame roland in her mmoires particulires
    presented a vivid picture of the anguish produced in an innocent
    girls mind by the notion of the sinfulness of erotic dreams she
    menstruated first at the age of 14 before this she writes i
    had sometimes been awakened from the deepest sleep in a
    surprising manner imagination played no part i exercised it on
    too many serious subjects and my timorous conscience preserved
    it from amusement with other subjects so that it could not
    represent what i would not allow it to seek to understand but an
    extraordinary effervescence aroused my senses in the heat of
    repose and by virtue of my excellent constitution operated by
    itself a purification which was as strange to me as its cause
    the first feeling which resulted was i know not why a sort of
    fear i had observed in my philote that we are not allowed to
    obtain any pleasure from our bodies except in lawful marriage
    what i had experienced could be called a pleasure i was then
    guilty and in a class of offences which caused me the most shame
    and sorrow since it was that which was most displeasing to the
    spotless lamb there was great agitation in my poor heart
    prayers and mortifications how could i avoid it for indeed i
    had not foreseen it but at the instant when i experienced it i
    had not taken the trouble to prevent it my watchfulness became
    extreme i scrupulously avoided positions which i found specially
    exposed me to the accident my restlessness became so great that
    at last i was able to awake before the catastrophe when i was
    not in time to prevent it i would jump out of bed with naked
    feet on to the polished floor and with crossed arms pray to the
    saviour to preserve me from the wiles of the devil i would then
    impose some penance on myself and i have carried out to the
    letter what the prophet king probably only transmitted to us as a
    figure of oriental speech mixing ashes with my bread and
    watering it with my tears
to the early protestant mind as illustrated by luther there was
something diseased though not impure in sexual excitement during sleep
thus in his table talk luther remarks that girls who have such dreams
should be married at once taking the medicine which god has given it
is only of comparatively recent years that medical science has obtained
currency for the belief that this autoerotic process is entirely normal
blumenbach stated that nocturnal emissions are normal234 sir james
paget declared that he had never known celibate men who had not such
emissions from once or twice a week to twice every three months both
extremes being within the limits of good health while sir lauder brunton
considers once a fortnight or once a month about the usual frequency at
these periods the emissions often following two nights in succession
rohleder believes that they may normally follow for several nights in
succession hammond considers that they occur about once a fortnight235
ribbing regards ten to fourteen days as the normal interval236
lwenfeld puts the normal frequency at about once a week237 this seems
to be nearer the truth as regards most fairly healthy young men in proof
of this it is only necessary to refer to the exact records of healthy
young adults summarized in the study of periodicity in the present volume
it occasionally happens however that nocturnal emissions are entirely
absent i am acquainted with some cases in other fairly healthy young men
they seldom occur except at times of intellectual activity or of anxiety
and worry
    lately there has been some tendency for medical opinion to revert
    to the view of luther and to regard sexual excitement during
    sleep as a somewhat unhealthy phenomenon moll is a distinguished
    advocate of this view sexual excitement during sleep is the
    normal result of celibacy but it is another thing to say that it
    is on that account satisfactory we might then moll remarks
    maintain that nocturnal incontinence of urine is satisfactory
    since the bladder is thus emptied yet we take every precaution
    against this by insisting that the bladder shall be emptied
    before going to sleep libido sexualis bd i p 552 this
    remark is supported by the fact to which i find that both men
    and women can bear witness that sexual excitement during sleep
    is more fatiguing than in the waking state though this is not an
    invariable rule and it is sometimes found to be refreshing in
    a similar way eulenburg sexuale neuropathie p 55 states
    that nocturnal emissions are no more normal than coughing or
    vomiting
nocturnal emissions are usually though not invariably accompanied by
dreams of a voluptuous character in which the dreamer becomes conscious in
a more or less fantastic manner of the more or less intimate presence or
contact of a person of the opposite sex it would seem as a general rule
that the more vivid and voluptuous the dream the greater is the physical
excitement and the greater also the relief experienced on awakening
sometimes the erotic dream occurs without any emission and not
infrequently the emission takes place after the dreamer has awakened
    the widest and most comprehensive investigation of erotic dreams
    is that carried out by gualino in northern italy and based on
    inquiries among 100 normal mendoctors teachers lawyers
    etcwho had all had experience of the phenomenon l gualino
    il sogno erotico nell uomo normale rivista di psicologia
    janfeb 1907 gualino shows that erotic dreams with
    emissions whether or not seminal began somewhat earlier than
    the period of physical development as ascertained by marro for
    youths of the same part of northern italy gualino found that all
    his cases had had erotic dreams at the age of seventeen marro
    found 8 per cent of youths still sexually undeveloped at that
    age and while sexual development began at thirteen years erotic
    dreams began at twelve their appearance was preceded in most
    cases for some months by erections in 37 per cent of the cases
    there had been no actual sexual experiences either masturbation
    or intercourse in 23 per cent there had been masturbation in
    the rest some form of sexual contact the dreams are mainly
    visual tactual elements coming second and the dramatis
    persona is either an unknown woman 27 per cent cases or only
    known by sight 56 per cent and in the majority is at all
    events in the beginning an ugly or fantastic figure becoming
    more attractive later in life but never identical with the woman
    loved during waking life this as gualino points out accords
    with the general tendency for the emotions of the day to be
    latent in sleep masturbation only formed the subject of the
    dream in four cases the emotional state in the pubertal stage
    apart from pleasure was anxiety 37 per cent desire 17 per
    cent fear 14 per cent in the adult stage anxiety and fear
    receded to 7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively
    thirtythree of the subjects as a result of sexual or general
    disturbances had had nocturnal emissions without dreams these
    were always found exhausting normally in more than 90 per
    cent erotic dreams are the most vivid of all dreams in no case
    was there knowledge of any monthly or other cyclic periodicity in
    the occurrence of the manifestations in 34 per cent of cases
    they tended to occur very soon after sexual intercourse in
    numerous cases they were peculiarly frequent even three in one
    night during courtship when the young man was in the habit of
    kissing and caressing his betrothed but ceased after marriage
    it was not noted that position in bed or a full bladder exerted
    any marked influence in the occurrence of erotic dreams
    repletion of the seminal vesicles is regarded as the main factor
    in germany erotic dreams have been discussed by volkelt die
    traumphantasie 1875 pp 7882 and especially by lwenfeld
    sexualprobleme oct 1908 while in america stanley hall
    thus summarizes the general characteristics of erotic dreams in
    men in by far the most cases consciousness even when the act
    causes full awakening from sleep finds only scattered images
    single words gestures and acts many of which would perhaps
    normally constitute no provocation many times the mental
    activity seems to be remote and incidental and the mind retains
    in the morning nothing except perhaps a peculiar dress pattern
    the shape of a fingernail the back of a neck the toss of a
    head the movement of a foot or the dressing of the hair in
    such cases these images stand out for a time with the
    distinctness of a cameo and suggest that the origin of erotic
    fetichisms is largely to be found in sexual dreams very rarely
    is there any imagery of the organs themselves but the tendency
    to irradiation is so strong as to reenforce the suggestion of so
    many other phenomena in this field that nature designs this
    experience to be long circuited and that it may give a peculiar
    ictus to almost any experience when waking occurs just
    afterward it seems at least possible that there may be much
    imagery that existed but failed to be recalled to memory
    possibly because the flow of psychic impressions was over very
    familiar fields and this therefore was forgotten while any
    eruption into new or unwonted channels stood out with
    distinctness all these psychic phenomena although very
    characteristic of man in his prime are not so of the dreams of
    dawning puberty which are far more vivid g stanley hall
    adolescence vol i p 455
    i may further quote the experience of an anonymous
    contributora healthy and chaste man between 30 and 38 years of
    ageto the american journal of psychology nocturnal
    emissions jan 1904 legs and breasts often figured
    prominently in these dreams the other sexual parts however
    very seldom and then they turned out to be male organs in most
    cases there were but two instances of copulation dreamt girls
    and young women were the usual dramatis person and
    curiously enough often the aggressors sometimes the face or
    faces were well known sometimes only once seen sometimes
    entirely unknown the orgasm occurs at the most erotic part of
    the dream the physical and psychical running parallel this most
    erotic or suggestive part of the dream was very often quite an
    innocent looking incident enough as for example while passing
    a strange young woman overtaken on the street she calls after
    me some question at first i pay no heed but when she calls
    again i hesitate whether to turn back and answer or
    notemission again walking beside a young woman she said
    shall i take your arm i offered it and she took it entwining
    her arm around it and raising it highemission i could feel
    stronger erection as she asked the question sometimes a word
    was enough sometimes a gesture once emission took place on my
    noticing the young womans diminished fingernails another
    example of fetichism was my being curiously attracted in a dream
    by the pretty embroidered figure on a little girls dress as an
    illustration of the strange metamorphoses that occur in dreams i
    one night in my dream i had been observing partridges in the
    summer fell in love with a partridge which changed under my
    caresses to a beautiful girl who yet retained an indescribable
    wildbird innocence grace and charma sort of undina
    these experiences may be regarded as fairly typical of the erotic
    dreams of healthy and chaste young men the bird for instance
    that changes into a woman while retaining some elements of the
    bird has been encountered in erotic dreams by other young men
    it is indeed remarkable that as de gubernatis observes the
    bird is a wellknown phallic symbol while maeder finds
    interprtations de quelques rves archives de psychologie
    april 1907 that birds have a sexual significance both in life
    and in dreams the appearance of male organs in the dreamwoman
    is doubtless due to the dreamers greater familiarity with those
    organs but though it occurs occasionally it can scarcely be
    said to be the rule in erotic dreams even men who have never had
    connection with a woman are quite commonly aware of the presence
    of a womans sexual organs in their erotic dreams
    molls comparison of nocturnal emissions of semen with nocturnal
    incontinence of urine suggests an interesting resemblance and at
    the same time seeming contrast in both cases we are concerned
    with viscera which when overfilled or unduly irritable
    spasmodically eject their contents during sleep there is a
    further resemblance which usually becomes clear when as
    occasionally happens nocturnal incontinence of urine persists on
    to late childhood or adolescence both phenomena are frequently
    accompanied by vivid dreams of appropriate character see eg
    ries ueber enuresis nocturna monatsschrift fr
    harnkrankheiten und sexuelle hygiene 1904 ap buchan nearly
    a century ago pointed out the psychic element in the
    experiences of young persons who wetted the bed venus sine
    concubitu 1816 p 47 thus in one case known to me a child
    of seven who occasionally wetted the bed usually dreamed at the
    same time that she wanted to make water and was out of doors
    running to find a suitable spot which she at last found and on
    awaking discovered that she had wetted the bed fifteen years
    later she still sometimes had similar dreams which caused her
    much alarm until when thoroughly awake she realized that no
    accident had happened these later dreams were not the result of
    any actual strong desire to urinate in another case with which i
    am acquainted a little girl of eight after mental excitement or
    indigestible meals occasionally wetted the bed dreaming that
    she was frightened by some one running after her and wetted
    herself in consequence after the manner of the ganymede in the
    eagles clutch as depicted by rembrandt these two cases it may
    be noted belong to two quite different types in the first case
    the full bladder suggests to imagination the appropriate actions
    for relief and the bladder actually accepts the imaginative
    solution offered it is according to fioranis phrase
    somnambulism of the bladder in the other case there is no
    such somnambulism but a psychic and nervous disturbance not
    arising in the bladder at all irradiates convulsively and
    whether or not the bladder is overfull attacks a vesical nervous
    system which is not yet sufficiently wellbalanced to withstand
    the inflow of excitement in children of somewhat nervous
    temperament manifestations of this kind may occur as an
    occasional accident up to about the age of seven or eight and
    thereafter the nervous control of the bladder having become
    firmly established they cease to happen the nervous energy
    required to affect the bladder sufficing to awake the dreamer in
    very rare cases however the phenomenon may still occasionally
    happen even in adolescence or later in individuals who are
    otherwise quite free from it this is most apt to occur in young
    women even in waking life in men it is probably extremely rare
    the erotic dream seems to differ flagrantly from the vesical
    dream in that it occurs in adult life and is with difficulty
    brought under control the contrast is however very
    superficial when we remember that sexual activity only begins
    normally at puberty we realize that the youth of twenty is in
    the matter of sexual control scarcely much older than in the
    matter of vesical control he was at the age of six moreover if
    we were habitually from our earliest years to go to bed with a
    full bladder as the chaste man goes to bed with unrelieved
    sexual system it would be fully as difficult to gain vesical
    control during sleep as it now is to gain sexual control
    ultimately such sexual control is attained after the age of
    forty it seems that erotic dreams with emission become more and
    more rare either the dream occurs without actual emission
    exactly as dreams of urination occur in adults with full bladder
    or else the organic stress with or without dreams serves to
    awaken the sleeper before any emission has occurred but this
    stage is not easily or completely attained st augustine even
    at the period when he wrote his confessions mentions as a
    matter of course that sexual dreams not merely arouse pleasure
    but gain the consent of the will x 41 not infrequently
    there is a struggle in sleep just as the hypnotic subject may
    resist suggestions thus a lady of thirtyfive dreamed a sexual
    dream and awoke without excitement again she fell asleep and
    had another dream of sexual character but resisted the tendency
    to excitement and again awoke finally she fell asleep and had
    a third sexual dream which was this time accompanied by the
    orgasm this has recently been described also by ncke who
    terms it pollutio interrupta neurologisches centralblatt oct
    16 1909 the corresponding voluntary process in the waking state
    is described by rohleder and termed masturbatio interrupta
    zeitschrift fr sexualwissenschaft aug 1908 the factors
    involved in the acquirement of vesical and sexual control during
    sleep are the same but the conditions are somewhat different
    there is a very intimate connection between the vesical and the
    sexual spheres as i have elsewhere pointed out see eg in the
    third volume of these studies analysis of the sexual
    impulse this connection is psychic as well as organic both in
    men and women a full bladder tends to develop erotic dreams
    see eg ka scherner das leben des traums 1861 pp 187 et
    seq spitta also points out the connection between vesical and
    erotic dreams die schlaf und traumzustnde 2d ed 1882 pp
    250 et seq raymond and janet state les obscessions vol ii
    p 135 that nocturnal incontinence of urine accompanied by
    dreams of urination may be replaced at puberty by masturbation
    in the reverse direction freud believes monatsschrift fr
    psychiatrie bd xviii p 433 that masturbation plays a large
    part in causing the bedwetting of children who have passed the
    age when that usually ceases and he even finds that children are
    themselves aware of the connection
    the diagnostic value of sexual dreams as an indication of the
    sexual nature of the subject when awake has been emphasized by
    various writers eg moll die kontrre sexualempfindung
    ch ix ncke der traum als feinstes reagens fr die art des
    sexuellen empfindens monatsschrift fr kriminalpsychologie
    1905 p 500 sexual dreams tend to reproduce and even to
    accentuate those characteristics which make the strongest sexual
    appeal to the subject when awake
    at the same time this general statement has to be qualified
    more especially as regards inverted dreams in the first place a
    young man however normal who is not familiar with the feminine
    body when awake is not likely to see it when asleep even in
    dreams of women in the second place the confusions and
    combinations of dream imagery often tend to obliterate sexual
    distinctions however free from perversions the subjects may be
    thus a correspondent tells me of a healthy man of very pure
    character totally inexperienced in sexual matters and never
    having seen a woman naked who in his sexual dreams always sees
    the woman with male organs though he has never had any sexual
    inclinations for men and is much in love with a lady the
    confusions and associations of dream imagery leading to abnormal
    combinations may be illustrated by a dream which once occurred
    to me after reading joests account of how a young negress whose
    tattoomarks he was sketching having become bored suddenly
    pressed her hands to her breasts spirting two streams of
    lukewarm milk into his face and ran away laughing i dreamed of
    a woman performing a similar action not from her breasts
    however but from a penis with which she was furnished again by
    another kind of confusion a man dreams sexually that he is with
    a man although the figure of the partner revealed in the dream
    is a woman the following dream in a normal man who had never
    been or wished to be in the position shown by the dream may be
    quoted i dreamed that i was a big boy and that a younger boy
    lay close beside me and that we or certainly he had seminal
    emissions i was complacently passive and had a feeling of shame
    when the boy was discovered on awaking i found i had had no
    emission but was lying very close to my wife the day before i
    had seen boys in a swimmingmatch this was it seems to me an
    example of dream confusion and not an erotic inverted dream
    ncke also brings forward inverted dreams by normal persons see
    eg his beitrge zu den sexuellen trumen archiv fr
    kriminalanthropologie bd xx 1908 p 366
so far as i have been able to ascertain there seem to be generally
speaking certain differences in the manifestations of autoerotism during
sleep in men and women which i believe to be not without psychological
significance in men the phenomenon is fairly simple it usually appears
about puberty continues at intervals of varying duration during sexual
life provided the individual is living chastely and is generally though
not always accompanied by erotic dreams which lead up to the climax its
occurrence being to some extent influenced by a variety of
circumstances physical mental or emotional excitement alcohol taken
before retiring position in bed as lying on the back the state of the
bladder sometimes the mere fact of being in a strange bed and to some
extent apparently by the existence of monthly and yearly rhythms on the
whole it is a fairly definite and regular phenomenon which usually leaves
little conscious trace on awaking beyond probably some sense of fatigue
and occasionally a headache in women however the phenomena of
autoerotism during sleep seem to be much more irregular varied and
diffused so far as i have been able to make inquiries it is the
exception rather than the rule for girls to experience definitely erotic
dreams about the period of puberty or adolescence238 autoerotic
phenomena during sleep in women who have never experienced the orgasm when
awake are usually of a very vague kind while it is the rule in a chaste
youth for the orgasm thus to manifest itself it is the exception in a
chaste girl it is not as a rule until the orgasm has been definitely
produced in the waking stateunder whatever conditions it may have been
producedthat it begins to occur during sleep and even in a strongly
sexual woman living a repressed life it is often comparatively
infrequent239 thus a young medical woman who endeavors to deal
strenuously with her physical sexual emotions writes i sleep soundly
and do not dream at all occasionally but very rarely i have had
sensations which awakened me suddenly they can scarcely be called dreams
for they are mere impulses nothing connected or coherent yet prompted i
know by sexual feeling this is probably an experience common to all
another lady with a restrained psychosexual tendency to be attracted to
both sexes states that her first sexual sensations with orgasm were felt
in dreams at the age of 16 but these dreams which she has now forgotten
were not agreeable and not erotic two or three years later spontaneous
orgasm began to occur occasionally when awake and after this orgasm
took place regularly once or twice a week in sleep but still without
erotic dreams she merely dreamt that the orgasm was occurring and awoke
as it took place
it is possible that to the comparative rarity in chaste women of complete
orgasm during sleep we may in part attribute the violence with which
repressed sexual emotion in women often manifests itself240 there is
thus a difference here between men and women which is of some significance
when we are considering the natural satisfaction of the sexual impulse in
chaste women
in women who have become accustomed to sexual intercourse erotic dreams
of fully developed character occur with complete orgasm and accompanying
reliefas may occasionally be the case in women who are not acquainted
with actual intercourse241 some women however even when familiar with
actual coitus find that sexual dreams though accompanied by emissions
are only the symptoms of desire and do not produce actual relief
some interest attaches to cases in which young women even girls at
puberty experience dreams of erotic character or at all events dream
concerning coitus or men in erection although they profess and almost
certainly with truth to be quite ignorant of sexual phenomena several
such dreams of remarkable character have been communicated to me one can
imagine that the psychologists of some schools would see in these dreams
the spontaneous eruption of the experiences of the race i am inclined to
regard them as forgotten memories such as we know to occur sometimes in
sleep the child has somehow seen or heard of sexual phenomena and felt no
interest and the memory may subsequently be aroused in sleep under the
stimulation of newborn sexual sensations
    it is a curious proof of the ignorance which has prevailed in
    recent times concerning the psychic sexual nature of women that
    although in earlier ages the fact that women are normally liable
    to erotic dreams was fully recognized in recent times it has
    been denied even by writers who have made a special study of the
    sexual impulse in women eulenburg sexuale neuropathie 1895
    pp 31 79 appears to regard the appearances of sexual phenomena
    during sleep in women as the result of masturbation adler in
    what is in many respects an extremely careful study of sexual
    phenomena in women die mangelhafte geschlechtsempfindung des
    weibes 1904 p 130 boldly states that they do not have
    erotic dreams in 1847 e guibout des pollutions involontaires
    chez la femme union mdicale p 260 presented the case of a
    married lady who masturbated from the age of ten and continued
    the practice even after her marriage at twentyfour and at
    twentynine began to have erotic dreams with emissions every few
    nights and later sometimes even several times a night though
    they ceased to be voluptuous he believed the case to be the
    first ever reported of such a condition in a woman yet
    thousands of years ago the indian of vedic days recognized
    erotic dreams in women as an ordinary and normal occurrence
    lwenfeld quotes a passage to this effect from the oupnekhat
    sexualleben und nervenleiden 2d ed p 114 even savages
    recognize the occurrence of erotic dreams in women as normal for
    the papuans for instance believe that a young girls first
    menstruation is due to intercourse with the moon in the shape of
    a man the girl dreaming that a man is embracing her reports
    cambridge expedition to torres straits vol v p 206 in the
    seventeenth century rolfincius in a wellinformed study de
    pollutione nocturna a jena inaugural dissertation 1667
    concluded that women experience such manifestations and quotes
    aristotle galen and fernelius in the same sense sir thomas
    overbury in his characters written in the early part of the
    same century describing the ideal milkmaid says that her
    dreams are so chaste that she dare tell them clearly implying
    that it was not so with most women the notion that women are not
    subject to erotic dreams thus appears to be of comparatively
    recent origin
one of the most interesting and important characters by which the erotic
dreams of womenand indeed their dreams generallydiffer from those of
men is in the tendency to evoke a repercussion on the waking life a
tendency more rarely noted in mens erotic dreams and then only to a
minor extent this is very common even in healthy and normal women and
is exaggerated to a high degree in neurotic subjects by whom the dream
may even be interpreted as a reality and so declared on oath a fact of
practical importance

in a clever but highly neurotic young woman who writes for years i
have been trying to stamp out my passional nature and was beginning to
succeed when a strange thing happened to me last autumn one night as i
lay in bed i felt an influence so powerful that a man seemed present with
me i crimsoned with shame and wonder i remember that i lay upon my back
and marveled when the spell had passed the influence i was assured came
from a priest whom i believed in and admired above everyone in the world
i had never dreamed of love in connection with him because i always
thought him so far above me the influence has been upon me ever
sincesometimes by day and nearly always by night from it i generally go
into a deep sleep which lasts until morning i am always much refreshed
when i awake this influence has the best effect upon my life that
anything has ever had as regards health and mind it is the knowledge that
i am loved fittingly that makes me so indifferent to my future what
worries me is that i sometimes wonder if i suffer from a nervous disorder
merely the subject thus seemed to regard these occurrences as
objectively caused but was sufficiently sane to wonder whether her
experiences were not due to mental disorder243
the tendency of the autoerotic phenomena of sleep to be manifested with
such energy as to flow over into the waking life and influence conscious
emotion and action while very well marked in normal and healthy women is
seen to an exaggerated extent in hysterical women in whom it has
therefore chiefly been studied sante de sanctis who has investigated
the dreams of many classes of people remarks on the frequently sexual
character of the dreams of hysterical women and the repercussion of such
dreams on the waking life of the following day he gives a typical case of
hysterical erotic dreaming in an uneducated servantgirl of 23 in whom
such dreams occur usually a few days before the menstrual period her
dreams especially if erotic make an enormous impression on her in the
morning she is badtempered if they were unpleasant while she feels
lascivious and gives herself up to masturbation if she has had erotic
dreams of men she then has a feeling of pleasure throughout the day and
her sexual organs are bathed with moisture244 pitres and gilles de la
tourette two of charcots most distinguished pupils in their elaborate
works on hysteria both consider that dreams generally have a great
influence on the waking life of the hysterical and they deal with the
special influence of erotic dreams to which doubtless we must refer
those conceptions of incubi and succubi which played so vast and so
important a part in the demonology of the middle ages and while not
unknown in men were most frequent in women such erotic dreamsas these
observers confirming the experience of old writers have found among the
hysterical todayare by no means always or even usually of a
pleasurable character it is very rare pitres remarks when insisting
on the sexual character of the hallucinations of the hysterical for
these erotic hallucinations to be accompanied by agreeable voluptuous
sensations in most cases the illusion of sexual intercourse even provokes
acute pain the witches of old times nearly all affirmed that in their
relations with the devil they suffered greatly245 they said that his
organ was long and rough and pointed with scales which lifted on
withdrawal and tore the vagina it seems probable i may remark that
the witches representations both of the devil and of sexual intercourse
were largely influenced by familiarity with the coupling of animals as
gilles de la tourette is careful to warn his readers we must not too
hastily assume from the prevalence of nocturnal autoerotic phenomena in
hysterical women that such women are necessarily sexual and libidinous in
excess the disorder is in them psychic he points out and not physical
and they usually receive sexual approaches with indifference and
repugnance because their sexual centres are ansthetic or hypersthetic
during the period of sexual activity they seek much more the care and
delicate attention of men than the genital act which they often only
tolerate many households begun under the happiest auspicesthe bride
all the more apt to believe that she loves her betrothed in virtue of her
suggestibility easily exalted perhaps at the expense of the
sensesbecome hells on earth the sexual act has for the hysterical woman
more than one disillusion she cannot understand it it inspires her with
insurmountable repugnance246 i refer to these hysterical phenomena
because they present to us in an extreme form facts which are common
among women whom under the artificial conditions of civilized life we
are compelled to regard as ordinarily healthy and normal the frequent
painfulness of autoerotic phenomena is by no means an exclusively
hysterical phenomenon although often seen in a heightened form in
hysterical conditions it is probably to some extent simply the result of
a conflict in consciousness with a merely physical impulse which is strong
enough to assert itself in spite of the emotional and intellectual
abhorrence of the subject it is thus but an extreme form of the disgust
which all sexual physical manifestations tend to inspire in a person who
is not inclined to respond to them somewhat similar psychic disgust and
physical pain are produced in the attempts to stimulate the sexual
emotions and organs when these are exhausted by exercise in the detailed
history which moll presents of the sexual experiences of a sister in an
american nursing guilda most instructive history of a woman fairly
normal except for the results of repressed sexual emotion and with strong
moral tendenciesvarious episodes are narrated well illustrating the way
in which sexual excitement becomes unpleasant or even painful when it
takes place as a physical reflex which the emotions and intellect are all
the time struggling against247 it is quite probable however that
there is a physiological as well as a psychic factor in this phenomenon
and sollier in his elaborate study of the nature and genesis of hysteria
by insisting on the capital importance of the disturbance of sensibility
in hysteria and the definite character of the phenomena produced in the
passage between ansthesia and normal sensation has greatly helped to
reveal the mechanism of this feature of autoerotic excitement in the
hysterical
no doubt there has been a tendency to exaggerate the unpleasant character
of the autoerotic phenomena of hysteria that tendency was an inevitable
reaction against an earlier view according to which hysteria was little
more than an unconscious expression of the sexual emotions and as such was
unscientifically dismissed without any careful investigation i agree with
breuer and freud that the sexual needs of the hysterical are just as
individual and various as those of normal women but that they suffer from
them more largely through a moral struggle with their own instincts and
the attempt to put them into the background of consciousness248 in many
hysterical and psychically abnormal women autoerotic phenomena and
sexual phenomena generally are highly pleasurable though such persons
may be quite innocent of any knowledge of the erotic character of the
experience i have come across interesting and extreme examples of this in
the published experiences of the women followers of the american religious
leader tl harris founder of the brotherhood of the new life thus
in a pamphlet entitled internal respiration by respiro a letter is
quoted from a lady physician who writes one morning i awoke with a
strange new feeling in the womb which lasted for a day or two i was so
very happy but the joy was in my womb not in my heart249 at last
writes a lady quoted in the same pamphlet i fell into a slumber lying
on my back with arms and feet folded a position i almost always find
myself in when i awake no matter in which position i may go to sleep
very soon i awoke from this slumber with a most delightful sensation
every fibre tingling with an exquisite glow of warmth i was lying on my
left side something i am never able to do and was folded in the arms of
my counterpart unless you have seen it i cannot give you an idea of the
beauty of his flesh and with what joy i beheld and felt it think of it
luminous flesh and oh such tints you never could imagine without
seeing he folded me so closely in his arms etc in such cases there is
no conflict between the physical and the psychic and therefore the
resulting excitement is pleasurable and not painful
at this point our study of autoerotism brings us into the sphere of
mysticism leuba in a penetrating and suggestive essay on christian
mysticism after quoting the present study refers to the famous
passages in which st theresa describes how a beautiful little angel
inserted a flametipped dart into her heart until it descended into her
bowels and left her inflamed with divine love what physiological
difference he asks is there between this voluptuous sensation and that
enjoyed by the disciple of the brotherhood of new life st theresa says
bowels the woman doctor says womb that is all250
    the extreme form of autoerotism is the tendency for the sexual
    emotion to be absorbed and often entirely lost in
    selfadmiration this narcissuslike tendency of which the
    normal germ in women is symbolized by the mirror is found in a
    minor degree in some men and is sometimes well marked in women
    usually in association with an attraction for other persons to
    which attraction it is of course normally subservient the
    mirror remarks bloch beitrge 1 p 201 plays an
    important part in the genesis of sexual aberration it cannot
    be doubted that many a boy and girl have first experienced sexual
    excitement at the sight of their own bodies in a mirror
    valera the spanish novelist very well described this impulse in
    his genio y figura rafaela the heroine of this novel says
    that after her bath i fall into a puerility which may be
    innocent or vicious i cannot decide i only know that it is a
    purely contemplative act a disinterested admiration of beauty
    it is not coarse sensuality but sthetic platonism i imitate
    narcissus and i apply my lips to the cold surface of the mirror
    and kiss my image it is the love of beauty the expression of
    tenderness and affection for what god has made manifest in an
    ingenuous kiss imprinted on the empty and incorporeal
    reflection in the same spirit the real heroine of the tagebuch
    einer verlorenen p 114 at the point when she was about to
    become a prostitute wrote i am pretty it gives me pleasure to
    throw off my clothes one by one before the mirror and to look
    at myself just as i am white as snow and straight as a fir
    with my long fine hair like a cloak of black silk when i
    spread abroad the black stream of it with both hands i am like
    a white swan with black wings
    a typical case known to me is that of a lady of 28 brought up on
    a farm she is a handsome woman of very large and fine
    proportions active and healthy and intelligent with however
    no marked sexual attraction to the opposite sex at the same time
    she is not inverted though she would like to be a man and has a
    considerable degree of contempt for women she has an intense
    admiration for her own person especially her limbs she is
    never so happy as when alone and naked in her own bedroom and
    so far as possible she cultivates nakedness she knows by heart
    the various measurements of her body is proud of the fact that
    they are strictly in accordance with the canons of proportion
    and she laughs proudly at the thought that her thigh is larger
    than many a womans waist she is frank and assured in her
    manners without sexual shyness and while willing to receive
    the attention and admiration of others she makes no attempt to
    gain it and seems never to have experienced any emotions
    stronger than her own pleasure in herself i should add that i
    have had no opportunity of detailed examination and cannot speak
    positively as to the absence of masturbation
    in the extreme form in which alone the name of narcissus may
    properly be invoked there is comparative indifference to sexual
    intercourse or even the admiration of the opposite sex such a
    condition seems to be rare except perhaps in insanity since i
    called attention to this form of autoerotism alienist and
    neurologist april 1898 several writers have discussed the
    condition especially ncke who following out the suggestion
    terms the condition narcissism among 1500 insane persons ncke
    has found it in four men and one woman psychiatrische en
    neurologische bladen no 2 1899 dr ch hughes writes in a
    private letter that he is acquainted with such cases in which
    men have been absorbed in admiration of their own manly forms
    and of their sexual organs and women likewise absorbed in
    admiration of their own mamm and physical proportions
    especially of limbs the whole subject he adds is a singular
    phase of psychology and it is not all morbid psychology either
    it is closely allied to that sthetic sense which admires the
    nude in art

    the bestobserved cases of narcissism have however been
    recorded by rohleder who confers upon this condition the
    ponderous name of automonosexualism and believes that it has not
    been previously observed h rohleder der automonosexualismus
    being heft 225 of berliner klinik march 1907 in the two
    cases investigated by rohleder both men there was sexual
    excitement in the contemplation of the individuals own body
    actually or in a mirror with little or no sexual attraction to
    other persons rohleder is inclined to regard the condition as
    due to a congenital defect in the sexual centre of the brain

blackwell that while the sexual impulse in man is usually relieved by
seminal emissions during sleep in women it is relieved by the occurrence
of menstruation this latter statement is flagrantly at variance with the
facts but it may perhaps be quoted in support of the view expressed above
as to the comparative rarity of sexual excitement during sleep in young
girls
239 lwenfeld has recently expressed the same opinion rohleder believes
that pollutions are physically impossible in a real virgin but that
opinion is too extreme
240 it may be added that in more or less neurotic women and girls
erotic dreams may be very frequent and depressing thus jm fothergill
westriding asylum report 1876 vol vi remarks these dreams are
much more frequent than is ordinarily thought and are the cause of a
great deal of nervous depression among women women of a highlynervous
diathesis suffer much more from these drains than robust women not only
are these involuntary orgasms more frequent among such women but they
cause more disturbance of the general health in them than in other women
241 i may remark here that a russian correspondent considers that i have
greatly underestimated the frequency of erotic manifestations during sleep
in young girls all the women i have interrogated on this point he
informs me say that they have had such pollutions from the time of
puberty or even earlier accompanied by erotic dreams i have put the
question to some twenty or thirty women it is true that they were of
southern race italian spanish and french and i believe that
southerners are in this matter franker than northern women who consider
the activity of the flesh as shameful and seek to conceal it my
correspondent makes no reference to the chief point of sexual difference
so far as my observation goes which is that erotic dreams are
comparatively rare in those women who have yet had no sort of sexual
experience in waking life whether or not this is correct i do not
question the frequency of erotic dreams in girls who have had such
experience

guilty of attempt and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment on
the accusation of a girl of 13 who subsequently confessed that the charge
was imaginary in this case the jury found it impossible to believe that
so young a girl could have been lying or hallucinated because she
narrated the details of the alleged offence with such circumstantial
detail such cases are not uncommon and in some measure no doubt they
may be accounted for by autoerotic nocturnal hallucinations

modern viewscharcotthe revolt against charcots too absolute
conclusionsfallacies involvedcharcots attitude the outcome of his

complete charcotsat the same time they furnish a justification for the
earlier doctrine of hysteriabut they must not be regarded as finalthe
diffused hysteroid condition in normal personsthe physiological basis of
hysteriatrue pathological hysteria is linked on to almost normal states
especially to sexhunger
the nocturnal hallucinations of hysteria as all careful students of this
condition now seem to agree are closely allied to the hysterical attack
proper sollier indeed one of the ablest of the more recent
investigators of hysteria has argued with much force that the subjects of
hysteria really live in a state of pathological sleep of
vigilambulism251 he regards all the various accidents of hysteria as
having a common basis in disturbances of sensibility in the widest sense
of the word sensibilityas the very foundation of personalitywhile
ansthesia is the real sigillum hysteri whatever the form of
hysteria we are thus only concerned with a more or less profound state of
vigilambulism a state in which the subject seems often even to himself
to be more or less always asleep whether the sleep may be regarded as
local or general sollier agrees with fr that the disorder of
sensibility may be regarded as due to an exhaustion of the sensory centres
of the brain whether as the result of constitutional cerebral weakness
of the shock of a violent emotion or of some toxic influence on the
cerebral cells
we may therefore fitly turn from the autoerotic phenomena of sleep
which in women generally and especially in hysterical women seem to
possess so much importance and significance to the questionwhich has
been so divergently answered at different periods and by different
investigatorsconcerning the causation of hysteria and especially
concerning its alleged connection with conscious or unconscious sexual
emotion252
it was the belief of the ancient greeks that hysteria came from the womb
hence its name we first find that statement in platos timus in men
the organ of generationbecoming rebellious and masterful like an animal
disobedient to reason and maddened with the sting of lustseeks to gain
absolute sway and the same is the case with the socalled womb or
uterus of women the animal within them is desirous of procreating
children and when remaining unfruitful long beyond its proper time gets
discontented and angry and wandering in every direction through the
body closes up the passages of the breath and by obstructing
respiration253 drives them to extremity causing all varieties of
disease
plato it is true cannot be said to reveal anywhere a very scientific
attitude toward nature yet he was here probably only giving expression to
the current medical doctrine of his day we find precisely the same
doctrine attributed to hippocrates though without a clear distinction
between hysteria and epilepsy254 if we turn to the best roman
physicians we find again that aretus the esquirol of antiquity has
set forth the same view adding to his description of the movements of the
womb in hysteria it delights also in fragrant smells and advances
toward them and it has an aversion to foetid smells and flies from them
and on the whole the womb is like an animal within an animal255
consequently the treatment was by applying foetid smells to the nose and
rubbing fragrant ointments around the sexual parts256
the arab physicians who carried on the traditions of greek medicine
appear to have said nothing new about hysteria and possibly had little
knowledge of it in christian medival europe also nothing new was added
to the theory of hysteria it was indeed less known medically than it
had ever been and in part it may be as a result of this ignorance in
part as a result of general wretchedness the hysterical phenomena of
witchcraft reaching their height michelet points out in the fourteenth
century which was a period of special misery for the poor it flourished
more vigorously not alone have we the records of nervous epidemics but
illuminated manuscripts ivories miniatures basreliefs frescoes and
engravings furnish the most vivid iconographic evidence of the prevalence
of hysteria in its most violent forms during the middle ages much of this
evidence is brought to the service of science in the fascinating works of
dr p richer one of charcots pupils257
in the seventeenth century ambroise par was still talking like
hippocrates about suffocation of the womb forestus was still like
aretus applying friction to the vulva fernel was still reproaching
galen who had denied that the movements of the womb produced hysteria
it was in the seventeenth century 1618 that a french physician charles
lepois carolus piso physician to henry ii trusting as he said to
experience and reason overthrew at one stroke the doctrine of hysteria
that had ruled almost unquestioned for two thousand years and showed that
the malady occurred at all ages and in both sexes that its seat was not
in the womb but in the brain and that it must be considered a nervous
disease258 so revolutionary a doctrine could not fail to meet with
violent opposition but it was confirmed by willis and in 1681 we owe to
the genius of sydenham a picture of hysteria which for lucidity
precision and comprehensiveness has only been excelled in our own times
it was not possible any longer to maintain the womb theory of hippocrates
in its crude form but in modified forms and especially with the object
of preserving the connection which many observers continued to find
between hysteria and the sexual emotions it still found supporters in the
eighteenth and even the nineteenth centuries james in the middle of the
eighteenth century returned to the classical view and in his dictionary
of medicine maintained that the womb is the seat of hysteria louyer
villermay in 1816 asserted that the most frequent causes of hysteria are
deprivation of the pleasures of love griefs connected with this passion
and disorders of menstruation foville in 1833 and landouzy in 1846
advocated somewhat similar views the acute laycock in 1840 quoted as
almost a medical proverb the saying salacitas major major ad
hysteriam proclivitas fully indorsing it more recently still clouston
has defined hysteria as the loss of the inhibitory influence exercised on
the reproductive and sexual instincts of women by the higher mental and
moral functions a position evidently requiring some modification in view
of the fact that hysteria is by no means confined to women while the
same authority remarks that more or less concealed sexual phenomena are
the chief symptoms of hysterical insanity259 two gyncologists of
high position in different parts of the world hegar in germany and
ballsheadley in australia attribute hysteria as well as anmia largely
to unsatisfied sexual desire including the nonsatisfaction of the ideal
feelings260 lombroso and ferrero again while admitting that the
sexual feelings might be either heightened or depressed in hysteria
referred to the frequency of what they termed a paradoxical sexual
instinct in the hysterical by which for instance sexual frigidity is
combined with intense sexual preoccupations and they also pointed out
the significant fact that the crimes of the hysterical nearly always
revolve around the sexual sphere261 thus even up to the time when the
conception of hysteria which absolutely ignored and excluded any sexual
relationship whatever had reached its height independent views favoring
such a relationship still found expression
of recent years however such views usually aroused violent antagonism
the main current of opinion was with briquet 1859 who treating the
matter with considerable ability and a wide induction of facts
indignantly repelled the idea that there is any connection between
hysteria and the sexual facts of life physical or psychic as he himself
admitted briquet was moved to deny a sexual causation of hysteria by the
thought that such an origin would be degrading for women a quelque
chose de dgradant pour les femmes
it was however the genius of charcot and the influence of his able
pupils which finally secured the overthrow of the sexual theory of
hysteria charcot emphatically anathematized the visceral origin of
hysteria he declared that it is a psychic disorder and to leave no
loophole of escape for those who maintained a sexual causation he
asserted that there are no varieties of hysteria that the disease is one
and indivisible charcot recognized no primordial cause of hysteria beyond
heredity which here plays a more important part than in any other
neuropathic condition such heredity is either direct or more occasionally
by transformation any deviation of nutrition found in the ancestors
gout diabetes arthritis being a possible cause of hysteria in the
descendants we do not know anything about the nature of hysteria
charcot wrote in 1892 we must make it objective in order to recognize
it the dominant idea for us in the etiology of hysteria is in the widest
sense its hereditary predisposition the greater number of those
suffering from this affection are simply born hystrisables and on them
the occasional causes act directly either through autosuggestion or by
causing derangement of general nutrition and more particularly of the
nutrition of the nervous system262 these views were ably and
decisively stated in gilles de la tourettes trait de lhystrie
written under the inspiration of charcot
while charcots doctrine was thus being affirmed and generally accepted
there were at the same time workers in these fields who though they by no
means ignored this doctrine of hysteria or even rejected it were inclined
to think that it was too absolutely stated writing in the dictionary of
psychological medicine at the same time as charcot donkin while
deprecating any exclusive emphasis on the sexual causation pointed out
the enormous part played by the emotions in the production of hysteria
and the great influence of puberty in women due to the greater extent of
the sexual organs and the consequently large area of central innervation
involved and thus rendered liable to fall into a state of unstable
equilibrium enforced abstinence from the gratification of any of the
inherent and primitive desires he pointed out may be an adequate
exciting cause such a view as this indicated that to set aside the
ancient doctrine of a physical sexual cause of hysteria was by no means to
exclude a psychic sexual cause ten years earlier axenfeld and huchard had
pointed out that the reaction against the sexual origin of hysteria was
becoming excessive and they referred to the evidence brought forward by
veterinary surgeons showing that unsatisfied sexual desire in animals may
produce nervous symptoms very similar to hysteria263 the present
writer when in 1894 briefly discussing hysteria as an element in
secondary sexual characterization ventured to reflect the view confirmed
by his own observation that there was a tendency to unduly minimize the
sexual factor in hysteria and further pointed out that the old error of a
special connection between hysteria and the female sexual organs probably
arose from the fact that in woman the organic sexual sphere is larger than
in man264
when indeed we analyze the foundation of the once predominant opinions
of charcot and his school regarding the sexual relationships of hysteria
it becomes clear that many fallacies and misunderstandings were involved
briquet charcots chief predecessor acknowledged that his own view was
that a sexual origin of hysteria would be degrading to women that is to
say he admitted that he was influenced by a foolish and improper
prejudice for the belief that the unconscious and involuntary morbid
reaction of the nervous system to any disturbance of a great primary
instinct can have quelque chose de dgradant is itself an immoral
belief such disturbance of the nervous system might or might not be
caused but in any case the alleged degradation could only be the
fiction of a distorted imagination again confusion had been caused by
the ancient error of making the physical sexual organs responsible for
hysteria first the womb more recently the ovaries the outcome of this
belief was the extirpation of the sexual organs for the cure of hysteria
charcot condemned absolutely all such operations as unscientific and
dangerous declaring that there is no such thing as hysteria of menstrual
origin265 subsequently angelucci and pierracini carried out an
international inquiry into the results of the surgical treatment of
hysteria and condemned it in the most unqualified manner266 it is
clearly demonstrated that the physical sexual organs are not the seat of
hysteria it does not however follow that even physical sexual desire
when repressed is not a cause of hysteria the opinion that it was so
formed an essential part of the early doctrine of hysteria and was
embodied in the ancient maxim nubat illa et morbus effugiet the
womb it seemed to the ancients was crying out for satisfaction and when
that was received the disease vanished267 but when it became clear that
sexual desire though ultimately founded on the sexual apparatus is a
nervous and psychic fact to put the sexual organs out of count was not
sufficient for the sexual emotions may exist before puberty and persist
after complete removal of the sexual organs thus it has been the object
of many writers to repel the idea that unsatisfied sexual desire can be a
cause of hysteria briquet pointed out that hysteria is rare among nuns
and frequent among prostitutes krafftebing believed that most
hysterical women are not anxious for sexual satisfaction and declared
that hysteria caused through the nonsatisfaction of the coarse sensual
sexual impulse i have never seen268 while pitres and others refer to
the frequently painful nature of sexual hallucinations in the hysterical
but it soon becomes obvious that the psychic sexual sphere is not confined
to the gratification of conscious physical sexual desire it is not true
that hysteria is rare among nuns some of the most tremendous epidemics of
hysteria and the most carefully studied having occurred in
convents269 while the hysterical phenomena sometimes associated with
revivals are well known the supposed prevalence among prostitutes would
not be evidence against the sexual relationships of hysteria it has
however been denied even by so great an authority as parentduchtelet
who found it very rare even in prostitutes in hospitals when it was
often associated with masturbation in prostitutes however who returned
to a respectable life giving up their old habits he found hysteria
common and severe270 the frequent absence of physical sexual feeling
again may quite reasonably be taken as evidence of a disorder of the
sexual emotions while the undoubted fact that sexual intercourse usually
has little beneficial effect on pronounced hysteria and that sexual
excitement during sleep and sexual hallucinations are often painful in
the same condition is far from showing that injury or repression of the
sexual emotions had nothing to do with the production of the hysteria it
would be as reasonable to argue that the evil effect of a heavy meal on a
starving man must be taken as evidence that he was not suffering from
starvation the fact indeed on which gilles de la tourette and others
have remarked that the hysterical often desire not so much sexual
intercourse as simple affection would tend to show that there is here a
real analogy and that starvation or lesion of the sexual emotions may
produce like bodily starvation a rejection of those satisfactions which
are demanded in health thus even a mainly a priori examination of the
matter may lead us to see that many arguments brought forward in favor of
charcots position on this point fall to the ground when we realize that
the sexual emotions may constitute a highly complex sphere often hidden
from observation sometimes not conscious at all and liable to many
lesions besides that due to the nonsatisfaction of sexual desire at the
same time we are not thus enabled to overthrow any of the positive results
attained by charcot and his school
it may however be pointed out that charcots attitude toward hysteria
was the outcome of his own temperament he was primarily a neurologist
the bent of his genius was toward the investigation of facts that could be
objectively demonstrated his first interest in hysteria dating from as
far back as 1862 was in hysteroepileptic convulsive attacks and to the
last he remained indifferent to all facts which could not be objectively
demonstrated that was the secret of the advances he was enabled to make
in neurology for purely psychological investigation he had no liking and
probably no aptitude anyone who was privileged to observe his methods of
work at the salptrire will easily recall the great masters towering
figure the disdainful expression sometimes even it seemed a little
sour the lofty bearing which enthusiastic admirers called napoleonic the
questions addressed to the patient were cold distant sometimes
impatient charcot clearly had little faith in the value of any results so
attained one may well believe also that a man whose superficial
personality was so haughty and aweinspiring to strangers would in any
case have had the greatest difficulty in penetrating the mysteries of a
psychic world so obscure and elusive as that presented by the
hysterical271
the way was thus opened for further investigations on the psychic side
charcot had affirmed the power not only of physical traumatism but even
of psychic lesionsof moral shocksto provoke its manifestations but
his sole contribution to the psychology of this psychic maladyand this
was borrowed from the nancy schoollay in the one word suggestibility
the nature and mechanism of this psychic process he left wholly
unexplained this step has been taken by others in part by janet who
from 1889 onward has not only insisted that the emotions stand in the
first line among the causes of hysteria but has also pointed out some
portion of the mechanism of this process thus he saw the significance of
the fact already recognized that strong emotions tend to produce
ansthesia and to lead to a condition of mental disaggregation favorable
to abulia or abolition of willpower it remained to show in detail the
mechanism by which the most potent of all the emotions effects its
influence and by attempting to do this the viennese investigators
breuer and especially freud have greatly aided the study of
hysteria272 they have not it is important to remark overturned the
positive elements in their great forerunners work freud began as a
disciple of charcot and he himself remarks that in his earlier
investigations of hysteria he had no thought of finding any sexual
etiology for that malady he would have regarded any such suggestion as an
insult to his patient the results reached by these workers were the
outcome of long and detailed investigation freud has investigated many
cases of hysteria in minute detail often devoting to a single case over a
hundred hours of work the patients unlike those on whom the results of
the french school have been mainly founded all belonged to the educated
classes and it was thus possible to carry out an elaborate psychic
investigation which would be impossible among the uneducated breuer and
freud insist on the fine qualities of mind and character frequently found
among the hysterical they cannot accept suggestibility as an invariable
characteristic of hysteria only abnormal excitability they are far from
agreeing with janet although on many points at one with him that
psychic weakness marks hysteria there is merely an appearance of mental
weakness they say because the mental activity of the hysterical is split
up and only a part of it is conscious273 the superiority of character
of the hysterical is indicated by the fact that the conflict between their
ideas of right and the bent of their inclinations is often an element in
the constitution of the hysterical state breuer and freud are prepared to
assert that the hysterical are among the flower of humanity and they
refer to those qualities of combined imaginative genius and practical
energy which characterized st theresa the patron saint of the
hysterical
to understand the position of breuer and freud we may start from the
phenomenon of nervous shock produced by physical traumatism often of a
very slight character charcot had shown that such nervous shock with
the chain of resulting symptoms is nothing more or less than hysteria
breuer and freud may be linked on to charcot at this point they began by
regarding the most typical hysteria as really a psychic traumatism that
is to say that it starts in a lesion or rather in repeated lesions of
the emotional organism it is true that the school of charcot admitted the
influence of moral shock especially of the emotion of fear but that
merely as an agent provocateur and with a curious perversity gilles
de la tourette certainly reflecting the attitude of charcot in his
elaborate treatise on hysteria fails to refer to the sphere of the sexual
emotions even when enumerating the agents provocateurs274
the influence of fear is not denied by breuer and freud but they have
found that careful psychic analysis frequently shows that the shock of a
commonplace fear is really rooted in a lesion of the sexual emotions a
typical and very simple illustration is furnished in a case recorded by
breuer in which a young girl of seventeen had her first hysterical attack
after a cat sprang on her shoulders as she was going downstairs careful
investigation showed that this girl had been the object of somewhat ardent
attentions from a young man whose advances she had resisted although her
own sexual emotions had been aroused a few days before she had been
surprised by this young man on these same dark stairs and had forcibly
escaped from his hands here was the real psychic traumatism the
operation of which merely became manifest in the cat but in how many
cases asks breuer is a cat thus reckoned as a completely sufficient
causa efficiens
in every case that they have investigated breuer and freud have found some
similar secret lesion of the psychic sexual sphere in one case a
governess whose training has been severely upright is in spite of
herself and without any encouragement led to experience for the father of
the children under her care an affection which she refuses to acknowledge
even to herself in another a young woman finds herself falling in love
with her brotherinlaw again an innocent girl suddenly discovers her
uncle in the act of sexual intercourse with her playmate and a boy on his
way home from school is subjected to the coarse advances of a sexual
invert in nearly every case as freud eventually found reason to believe
a primary lesion of the sexual emotions dates from the period of puberty
and frequently of childhood and in nearly every case the intimately
private nature of the lesion causes it to be carefully hidden from
everyone and even to be unacknowledged by the subject of it in the
earlier cases breuer and freud found that a slight degree of hypnosis is
necessary to bring the lesion into consciousness and the accuracy of the
revelations thus obtained has been tested by independent witness freud
has however long abandoned the induction of any degree of hypnosis he
simply tries to arrange that the patient shall feel absolutely free to
tell her own story and so proceeds from the surface downwards slowly
finding and piecing together such essential fragments of the history as
may be recovered in the same way he remarks as the archologist
excavates below the surface and recovers and puts together the fragments
of an antique statue much of the material found however has only a
symbolic value requiring interpretation and is sometimes pure fantasy
freud now attaches great importance to dreams as symbolically representing
much in the subjects mental history which is otherwise difficult to
reach275 the subtle and slender clues which freud frequently follows in
interpreting dreams cannot fail sometimes to arouse doubt in his readers
minds but he certainly seems to have been often successful in thus
reaching latent facts in consciousness the primary lesion may thus act as
a foreign body in consciousness something is introduced into psychic
life which refuses to merge in the general flow of consciousness it
cannot be accepted simply as other facts of life are accepted it cannot
even be talked about and so submitted to the slow usure by which our
experiences are worn down and gradually transformed breuer illustrates
what happens by reference to the sneezing reflex when an irritation to
the nasal mucous membrane for some reason fails to liberate this reflex
a feeling of excitement and tension arises this excitement being unable
to stream out along motor channels now spreads itself over the brain
inhibiting other activities in the highest spheres of human activity
we may watch the same process it is a result of this process that as
breuer and freud found the mere act of confession may greatly relieve the
hysterical symptoms produced by this psychic mechanism and in some cases
may wholly and permanently remove them it is on this fact that they
founded their method of treatment devised by breuer and by him termed the
cathartic method though freud prefers to call it the analytic method
it is as freud points out the reverse of the hypnotic method of
suggestive treatment there is the same difference freud remarks between
the two methods as leonardo da vinci found for the two technical methods
of art per via di porre and per via di levare the hypnotic method
like painting works by putting in the cathartic or analytic method like
sculpture works by taking out276
it is part of the mechanism of this process as understood by these
authors that the physical symptoms of hysteria are constituted by a
process of conversion out of the injured emotions which then sink into
the background or altogether out of consciousness thus they found the
prolonged tension of nursing a near and dear relative to be a very
frequent factor in the production of hysteria for instance an originally
rheumatic pain experienced by a daughter when nursing her father becomes
the symbol in memory of her painful psychic excitement and this perhaps
for several reasons but chiefly because its presence in consciousness
almost exactly coincided with that excitement in another way again
nausea and vomiting may become a symbol through the profound sense of
disgust with which some emotional shock was associated then the symbol
begins to have a life of its own and draws hidden strength from the
emotion with which it is correlated breuer and freud have found by
careful investigation that the pains and physical troubles of hysteria are
far from being capricious but may be traced in a varying manner to an
origin in some incident some pain some action which was associated with
a moment of acute psychic agony the process of conversion was an
involuntary escape from an intolerable emotion comparable to the physical
pain sometimes sought in intense mental grief and the patient wins some
relief from the tortured emotions though at the cost of psychic
abnormality of a more or less divided state of consciousness and of
physical pain or else ansthesia in charcots third stage of the
hysterical convulsion that of attitudes passionnelles breuer and
freud see the hallucinatory reproduction of a recollection which is full
of significance for the origin of the hysterical manifestations
the final result reached by these workers is clearly stated by each
writer the main observation of our predecessors states breuer277
still preserved in the word hysteria is nearer to the truth than the
more recent view which puts sexuality almost in the last line with the
object of protecting the patient from moral reproaches certainly the
sexual needs of the hysterical are just as individual and as various in
force as those of the healthy but they suffer from them and in large
measure indeed they suffer precisely through the struggle with them
through the effort to thrust sexuality aside the weightiest fact
concludes freud278 on which we strike in a thorough pursuit of the
analysis is this from whatever side and from whatever symptoms we start
we always unfailingly reach the region of the sexual life here first of
all an etiological condition of hysterical states is revealed at the
bottom of every case of hysteriaand reproducible by an analytical effort
after even an interval of long yearsmay be found one or more facts of
precocious sexual experience belonging to earliest youth i regard this as
an important result as the discovery of a caput nili of
neuropathology ten years later enlarging rather than restricting his
conception freud remarks sexuality is not a mere deus ex machina
which intervenes but once in the hysterical process it is the motive
force of every separate symptom and every expression of a symptom the
morbid phenomena constitute to speak plainly the patients sexual
activity279 the actual hysterical fit freud now states may be
regarded as the substitute for a once practiced and then abandoned
autoerotic satisfaction and similarly it may be regarded as an
equivalent of coitus280
it is natural to ask how this conception affects that elaborate picture of
hysteria laboriously achieved by charcot and his school it cannot be said
that it abolishes any of the positive results reached by charcot but it
certainly alters their significance and value it presents them in a new
light and changes the whole perspective with his passion for getting at
tangible definite physical facts charcot was on very safe ground but he
was content to neglect the psychic analysis of hysteria while yet
proclaiming that hysteria is a purely psychic disorder he had no cause of
hysteria to present save only heredity freud certainly admits heredity
but as he points out the part it plays has been overrated it is too
vague and general to carry us far and when a specific and definite cause
can be found the part played by heredity recedes to become merely a
condition the soil on which the specific etiology works here probably
freuds enthusiasm at first carried him too far and the most important
modification he has made in his views occurs at this point he now
attaches a preponderant influence to heredity he has realized that sexual
activity in one form or another is far too common in childhood to make it
possible to lay very great emphasis on traumatic lesions of this
character and he has also realized that an outcrop of fantasies may
somewhat later develop on these childish activities intervening between
them and the subsequent morbid symptoms he is thus led to emphasize anew
the significance of heredity not however in charcots sense as general
neuropathic disposition but as sexual constitution the significance of
infantile sexual lesions has also tended to give place to that of
infantilism of sexuality281
the real merit of freuds subtle investigations is thatwhile possibly
furnishing a justification of the imperfectlyunderstood idea that had
floated in the mind of observers ever since the name hysteria was first
inventedhe has certainly supplied a definite psychic explanation of a
psychic malady he has succeeded in presenting clearly at the expense of
much labor insight and sympathy a dynamic view of the psychic processes
involved in the constitution of the hysterical state and such a view
seems to show that the physical symptoms laboriously brought to light by
charcot are largely but epiphenomena and byproducts of an emotional
process often of tragic significance to the subject which is taking
place in the most sensitive recess of the psychic organism that the
picture of the mechanism involved presented to us by professor freud
cannot be regarded as a final and complete account of the matter may
readily be admitted it has developed in freuds own hands and some of
the developments will require very considerable confirmation before they
can be accepted as generally true282 but these investigations have at
least served to open the door which charcot had inconsistently held
closed into the deeper mysteries of hysteria and have shown that here
if anywhere further research will be profitable they have also served to
show that hysteria may be definitely regarded as in very many cases at
least a manifestation of the sexual emotions and their lesions in other
words a transformation of autoerotism
the conception of hysteria so vigorously enforced by charcot and his
school is thus now beginning to appear incomplete but we have to
recognize that that incompleteness was right and necessary a strong
reaction was needed against a widespread view of hysteria that was in
large measure scientifically false it was necessary to show clearly that
hysteria is a definite disorder even when the sexual organs and emotions
are swept wholly out of consideration and it was also necessary to show
that the lying and dissimulation so widely attributed to the hysterical
were merely the result of an ignorant and unscientific misinterpretation
of psychic elements of the disease this was finally and triumphantly
achieved by charcots school
there is only one other point in the explanation of hysteria which i will
here refer to and that because it is usually ignored and because it has
relationship to the general psychology of the sexual emotions i refer to
that physiological hysteria which is the normal counterpart of the
pathological hysteria which has been described in its physical details by
charcot and to which alone the term should strictly be applied even
though hysteria as a disease may be described as one and indivisible
there are yet to be found among the ordinary and fairly healthy
population vague and diffused hysteroid symptoms which are dissipated in
a healthy environment or pass nearly unnoted only to develop in a small
proportion of cases under the influence of a more pronounced heredity or
a severe physical or psychic lesion into that definite morbid state which
is properly called hysteria
this diffused hysteroid condition may be illustrated by the results of a
psychological investigation carried on in america by miss gertrude stein
among the ordinary male and female students of harvard university and
radcliffe college the object of the investigation was to study with the
aid of a planchette the varying liability to automatic movements among
normal individuals nearly one hundred students were submitted to
experiment it was found that automatic responses could be obtained in two
sittings from all but a small proportion of the students of both sexes
but that there were two types of individual who showed a special aptitude
one type probably showing the embryonic form of neurasthenia was a
nervous highstrung imaginative type not easily influenced from
without and not so much suggestible as autosuggestible the other type
which is significant from our present point of view is thus described by
miss stein in general the individuals often blonde and pale are
distinctly phlegmatic if emotional decidedly of the weakest sentimental
order they may be either large healthy rather heavy and lacking in
vigor or they may be what we call anmic and phlegmatic their power of
concentrated attention is very small they describe themselves as never
being held by their work they say that their minds wander easily that
they work on after they are tired and just keep pegging away they are
very apt to have premonitory conversations they anticipate the words of
their friends they imagine whole conversations that afterward come true
the feeling of having been there is very common with them that is they
feel under given circumstances that they have had that identical
experience before in all its details they are often fatalistic in their
ideas they indulge in daydreams as a rule they are highly
suggestible283
there we have a picture of the physical constitution and psychic
temperament on which the classical symptoms of hysteria might easily be
built up284 but these persons were ordinary students and while a few
of their characteristics are what is commonly and vaguely called morbid
on the whole they must be regarded as ordinarily healthy individuals they
have the congenital constitution and predisposition on which some severe
psychic lesion at the psychological moment might develop the most
definite and obstinate symptoms of hysteria but under favorable
circumstances they will be ordinary men and women of no more than
ordinary abnormality or ordinary power they are among the many who have
been called to hysteria at birth they may never be among the few who are
chosen
we may have to recognize that on the side of the sexual emotions as well
as in general constitution a condition may be traced among normal persons
that is hysteroid in character and serves as the healthy counterpart of a
condition which in hysteria is morbid in women such a condition has been
traced though misnamed by dr king285
    dr king describes what he calls sexual hysteria in women
    which he considers a chief variety of hysteria he adds however
    that it is not strictly a disease but simply an automatic
    reaction of the reproductive system which tends to become
    abnormal under conditions of civilization and to be perpetuated
    in a morbid form in this condition he finds twelve characters
    1 time of life usually between puberty and climacteric 2
    attacks rarely occur when subject is alone 3 subject appears
    unconscious but is not really so 4 she is instinctively
    ashamed afterward 5 it occurs usually in single women or in
    those single or married whose sexual needs are unsatisfied 6
    no external evidence of disease and as aitken pointed out the
    nates are not flattened the womans physical condition is not
    impaired and she may be specially attractive to men 7 warmth
    of climate and the season of spring and summer are conducive to
    the condition 8 the paroxysm in short and temporary 9 while
    light touches are painful firm pressure and rough handling give
    relief 10 it may occur in the occupied but an idle
    purposeless life is conducive 11 the subject delights in
    exciting sympathy and in being fondled and caressed 12 there is
    defect of will and a strong stimulus is required to lead to
    action
    among civilized women the author proceeds this condition does
    not appear to subserve any useful purpose let us however go
    back to aboriginal womanto woman of the woods and the fields
    let us picture ourselves a young aboriginal venus in one of her
    earliest hysterical paroxysms in doing so let us not forget
    some of the twelve characteristics previously mentioned she will
    not be acting her part alone or if alone it will be in a
    place where someone else is likely soon to discover her let this
    venus be now discovered by a youthful apollo of the woods a man
    with fully developed animal instincts he and she like any other
    animals are in the free field of nature he cannot but observe
    to himself this woman is not dead she breathes and is warm
    she does not look ill she is plump and rosy he speaks to her
    she neither hears apparently nor responds her eyes are closed
    he touches moves and handles her at his pleasure she makes no
    resistance what will this primitive apollo do next he will cure
    the fit and bring the woman back to consciousness satisfy her
    emotions and restore her volitionnot by delicate touches that
    might be agonizing to her hyperesthetic skin but by vigorous
    massage passive motions and succussion that would be painless
    the emotional process on the part of the woman would end
    perhaps with mingled laughter tears and shame and when
    accused afterward of the part which the ancestrally acquired
    properties of her nervous system had compelled her to act as a
    preliminary to the event what woman would not deny it and be
    angry but the course of nature having been followed the natural
    purpose of the hysterical paroxysm accomplished there would
    remain as a result of the treatmentinstead of one discontented
    womantwo happy people and the possible beginning of a third
    natural primary sexual hysteria in woman king concludes is
    a temporary modification of the nervous government of the body
    and the distribution of nerveforce occurring for the most part
    as we see it today in prudish women of strong moral principle
    whose volition has disposed them to resist every sort of liberty
    or approach from the other sex consisting in a transient
    abdication of the general volitional and selfpreservational
    ego while the reins of government are temporarily assigned to
    the usurping power of the reproductive ego so that the
    reproductive government overrules the government by volition and
    thus as it were forcibly compels the womans organism to so
    dispose itself at a suitable time and place as to allow
    invite and secure the approach of the other sex whether she
    will or not to the end that natures imperious demand for
    reproduction shall be obeyed
this perhaps rather fantastic description is not a presentation of
hysteria in the technical sense but we may admit that it presents a state
which if not the real physiological counterpart of the hysterical
convulsion is yet distinctly analogous to the latter the sexual orgasm
has this correspondence with the hysterical fit that they both serve to
discharge the nervous centres and relieve emotional tension it may even
happen especially in the less severe forms of hysteria that the sexual
orgasm takes place during the hysterical fit this was found by rosenthal
of vienna to be always the case in the semiconscious paroxysms of a young
girl whose condition was easily cured286 no doubt such cases would be
more frequently found if they were sought for in severe forms of
hysteria however it frequently happens as so many observers have noted
that normal sexual excitement has ceased to give satisfaction has become
painful perverted paradoxical freud has enabled us to see how a shock
to the sexual emotions injuring the emotional life at its source can
scarcely fail sometimes to produce such a result but the necessity for
nervous explosion still persists287 it may indeed persist even in an
abnormally strong degree in consequence of the inhibition of normal
activities generally the convulsive fit is the only form of relief open
to the tension a lady whom i long attended remarks ashwell always
rejoiced when the fit was over since it relieved her system generally
and especially her brain from painful irritation which had existed for
several previous days that the fit mostly fails to give real
satisfaction and that it fails to cure the disease is due to the fact
that it is a morbid form of relief the same character of hysteria is
seen with more satisfactory results for the most part in the influence
of external nervous shock it was the misunderstood influence of such
shocks in removing hysteria which in former times led to the refusal to
regard hysteria as a serious disease during the rebellion of 174546 in
scotland cullen remarks that there was little hysteria the same was true
of the french revolution and of the irish rebellion while rush in a
study on the influence of the american revolution on the human body
observed that many hysterical women were restored to perfect health by
the events of the time in such cases the emotional tension is given an
opportunity of explosion in new and impersonal channels and the chain of
morbid personal emotions is broken
it has been urged by some that the fact that the sexual orgasm usually
fails to remove the disorder in true hysteria excludes a sexual factor of
hysteria it is really one may point out an argument in favor of such an
element as one of the factors of hysteria if there were no initial lesion
of the sexual emotions if the natural healthy sexual channel still
remained free for the passage of the emotional overflow then we should
expect that it would much oftener come into play in the removal of
hysteria in the more healthy merely hysteroid condition the psychic
sexual organism is not injured and still responds normally removing the
abnormal symptoms when allowed to do so it is the confusion between this
almost natural condition and the truly morbid condition alone properly
called hysteria which led to the ancient opinion inaugurated by plato
and hippocrates that hysteria may be cured by marriage288 the
difference may be illustrated by the difference between a distended
bladder which is still able to contract normally on its contents when at
last an opportunity of doing so is afforded and the bladder in which
distension has been so prolonged that nervous control had been lost and
spontaneous expulsion has become impossible the first condition
corresponds to the constitution which while simulating the hysterical
condition is healthy enough to react normally in spite of psychic
lesions the second corresponds to a state in which owing to the
prolonged stress of psychic traumatismsexual or nota definite
condition of hysteria has arisen the one state is healthy though
abnormal the other is one of pronounced morbidity
the condition of true hysteria is thus linked on to almost healthy states
and especially to a condition which may be described as one of sexhunger
such a suggestion may help us to see these puzzling phenomena in their
true nature and perspective
    at this point i may refer to the interesting parallel and
    probable real relationship between hysteria and chlorosis as
    luzet has said hysteria and chlorosis are sisters we have seen
    that there is some ground for regarding hysteria as an
    exaggerated form of a normal process which is really an
    autoerotic phenomenon there is some ground also for regarding
    chlorosis as the exaggeration of a physiological state connected
    with sexual conditions more specifically with the preparation
    for maternity hysteria is so frequently associated with anmic
    conditions that biernacki has argued that such conditions really
    constitute the primary and fundamental cause of hysteria
    neurologisches centralblatt march 1898 and centuries
    before biernacki sydenham had stated his belief that poverty of
    the blood is the chief cause of hysteria
    it would be some confirmation of this position if we could
    believe that chlorosis like hysteria is in some degree a
    congenital condition this was the view of virchow who regarded
    chlorosis as essentially dependent on a congenital hyoplasia of
    the arterial system stieda on the basis of an elaborate study
    of twentythree cases has endeavored to prove that chlorosis is
    due to a congenital defect of development zeitschrift fr
    geburtshlfe und gynkologie vol xxxii part i 1895 his
    facts tend to prove that in chlorosis there are signs of general
    illdevelopment and that in particular there is imperfect
    development of the breasts and sexual organs with a tendency to
    contracted pelvis charrin again regards uteroovarian
    inadequacy as at least one of the factors of chlorosis
    chlorosis in its extreme form may thus be regarded as a
    disorder of development a sign of physical degeneracy even if
    not strictly a cause a congenital condition may as stockman
    believes british medical journal december 14 1895 be a
    predisposing influence
    however it may be in extreme cases there is very considerable
    evidence to indicate that the ordinary anmia of young women may
    be due to a storing up of iron in the system and is so far
    normal being a preparation for the function of reproduction
    some observations of bunges seem to throw much light on the real
    cause of what may be termed physiological chlorosis he found by
    a series of experiments on animals of different ages that young
    animals contain a much greater amount of iron in their tissues
    than adult animals that for instance the body of a rabbit an
    hour after birth contains more than four times as much iron as
    that of a rabbit two and a half months old it thus appears
    probable that at the period of puberty and later there is a
    storage of iron in the system preparatory to the exercise of the
    maternal functions it is precisely between the ages of fifteen
    and twentythree as stockman found by an analysis of his own
    cases british medical journal december 14 1895 that the
    majority of cases occur there was indeed he found no case in
    which the first onset was later than the age of twentythree a
    similar result is revealed by the charts of lloyd jones which
    cover a vastly greater number of cases
    we owe to lloyd jones an important contribution to the knowledge
    of chlorosis in its physiological or normal relationships he has
    shown that chlorosis is but the exaggeration of a condition that
    is normal at puberty and in many women at each menstrual
    period and which there is good reason to believe even has a
    favorable influence on fertility he found that
    lightcomplexioned persons are more fertile than the
    darkcomplexioned and that at the same time the blood of the
    latter is of less specific gravity containing less hmoglobin
    lloyd jones also reached the generalization that girls who have
    had chlorosis are often remarkably pretty so that the tendency
    to chlorosis is associated with all the sexual and reproductive
    aptitudes that make a woman attractive to a man his conclusion
    is that the normal condition of which chlorosis is the extreme
    and pathological condition is a preparation for motherhood e
    lloyd jones chlorosis the special anmia of young women
    1897 also numerous reports to the british medical association
    published in the british medical journal there was an
    interesting discussion of the theories of chlorosis at the moscow
    international medical congress in 1898 see proceedings of the
    congress volume in section v pp 224 et seq
    we may thus perhaps understand why it is that hysteria and
    anmia are often combined and why they are both most frequently
    found in adolescent young women who have yet had no sexual
    experiences chlorosis is a physical phenomenon hysteria
    largely a psychic phenomenon yet both alike may to some extent
    at least be regarded as sexual aptitude showing itself in
    extreme and pathological forms

phenomena if however we proceed to investigate precisely the exact
extent degree and significance of such phenomena we are met by many
difficulties we find indeed that no attempts have been made to study
autoerotic phenomena except as regards the groupa somewhat artificial
group as i have already tried to showcollected under the term
masturbation while even here such attempts have only been made among
abnormal classes of people or have been conducted in a manner scarcely
likely to yield reliable results289 still there is a certain
significance in the more careful investigations which have been made to
ascertain the precise frequency of masturbation
berger an experienced specialist in nervous diseases concluded in his
vorlesungen that 99 per cent of young men and women masturbate
occasionally while the hundredth conceals the truth290 and hermann
cohn appears to accept this statement as generally true in germany so
high an estimate has of course been called in question and since it
appears to rest on no basis of careful investigation we need not
seriously consider it it is useless to argue on suppositions we must
cling to our definite evidence even though it yields figures which are
probably below the mark rohleder considers that during adolescence at
least 95 per cent of both sexes masturbate but his figures are not
founded on precise investigation291 julian marcuse on the basis of his
own statistics concludes that 92 per cent male individuals have to some
extent masturbated in youth perhaps also weight attaches to the opinion
of dukes physician to rugby school who states that from 90 to 95 per
cent of all boys at boarding school masturbate292 seerley of
springfield mass found that of 125 academic students only 8 assured him
they had never masturbated while of 347 who answered his questions 71
denied that they practiced masturbation which seems to imply that 79 per
cent admitted that they practiced it293 brockman also in america
among 232 theological students of the average age of 23 years and coming
from various parts of the united states found that 132 spontaneously
admitted that masturbation was their most serious temptation and all but
one of these admitted that he yielded 69 of them to a considerable
extent this is a proportion of at least 56 per cent the real proportion
being doubtless larger since no question had been asked as to sexual
offenses 75 practiced masturbation after conversion and 24 after they
had decided to become ministers only 66 mentioned sexual intercourse as
their chief temptation but altogether sexual temptations outnumbered all
others together294 moraglia who made inquiry of 200 women of the lower
class in italy found that 120 acknowledged either that they still
masturbate or that they had done so during a long period295 gualino
found that 23 per cent men of the professional classes in north italy
masturbate about puberty no account was taken of those who began later

all classes boys and girls are infested with the vice of onanism they
learn it early in the very beginning of life from their wetnurses
generally low mulatto women and many reasons help to foster the habit
the young men are often dissipated and the young women often remain
single296 niceforo who shows a special knowledge of the workinggirl
class at rome states that in many milliners and dressmakers workrooms
where young girls are employed it frequently happens that during the
hottest hours of the day between twelve and two when the mistress or
forewoman is asleep all the girls without exception give themselves up to
masturbation297 in france a country cur assured debreyne that among
the little girls who come up for their first communion 11 out of 12 were
given to masturbation298 the medical officer of a prussian reformatory
told rohleder that nearly all the inmates over the age of puberty
masturbated stanley hall knew a reform school in america where
masturbation was practiced without exception and he who could practice
it oftenest was regarded with heroworship299 ferriani who has made an
elaborate study of youthful criminality in italy states that even if all
boys and girls among the general population do not masturbate it is
certainly so among those who have a tendency to crime among 458 adult
male criminals marro as he states in his caratteri dei delinquenti
found that only 72 denied masturbation while 386 had practiced it from an
early age 140 of them before the age of thirteen among 30 criminal women
moraglia found that 24 acknowledged the practice at all events in early
youth 8 of them before the age of 10 a precocity accompanied by average
precocity in menstruation while he suspected that most of the remainder
were not unfamiliar with the practice among prostitutes of whatever class
or position moraglia found masturbation though it must be pointed out
that he does not appear to distinguish masturbation very clearly from
homosexual practices to be universal in one group of 50 prostitutes
everyone had practiced masturbation at some period 28 began between the
ages of 6 and 11 19 between 12 and 14 the most usual perioda
precocious oneof commencing puberty the remaining 3 at 15 and 16 the
average age of commencing masturbation it may be added was 11 while
that of the first sexual intercourse was 15300 in a larger group of 180
prostitutes belonging to genoa turin venice etc and among 23
elegant cocottes of italian and foreign origin moraglia obtained the
same results everyone admitted masturbation and not less than 113
preferred masturbation either solitary or mutual to normal coitus among
the insane as among idiots masturbation is somewhat more common among
males according to blandford in england as also it is in germany
according to ncke301 while venturi in italy has found it more common
among females302
there appears to be no limit to the age at which spontaneous masturbation
may begin to appear i have already referred to the practice of
thighrubbing in infants under one year of age jp west has reported in
detail 3 cases of masturbation in very early childhood2 in girls 1 in a
boyin which the practice had been acquired spontaneously and could only
be traced to some source of irritation in pressure from clothing
etc303 probably there is often in such cases some hereditary lack of
nervous stability block has recorded the case of a girlvery bright for
her age though excessively shy and taciturnwho began masturbating
spontaneously at the age of two in this case the mother had masturbated
all her life even continuing the practice after marriage and though she
succeeded in refraining during pregnancy her thoughts still dwelt upon
it while the maternal grandmother had died in an asylum from
masturbatory insanity
freud considers that autoerotic manifestations are common in infancy and
that the rhythmic function of any sensitive spot primarily the lips may
easily pass into masturbation he regards the infantile manifestations of
which thumbsucking is the most familiar example ldeln or lutschen in
german as autoerotic the germ arising in sucking the breasts since the
lips are an erogenous zone which may easily be excited by the warm stream
of milk but this only occurs he points out in subjects in whom the
sensitivity of the lip zone is heightened and especially in those who at a
later age are liable to become hysterical304 shuttleworth also points
out that the mere fidgetiness of a neurotic infant even when only a few
months old sometimes leads to the spontaneous and accidental discovery of
pleasurable sexual sensations which for a time appease the restlessness
of nervous instability though a vicious circle is thus established he
has found that especially among quite young girls of neurotic heredity
selfinduced excitement often in the form of thighfriction is more
common than is usually supposed305
normally there appears to be a varying aptitude to experience the sexual
organism or any voluptuous sensations before puberty i find on
eliciting the recollections of normal persons that in some cases there
have been voluptuous sensations from casual contact with the sexual organs
at a very early age in other cases there has been occasional slight
excitement from early years in yet other cases complete sexual ansthesia
until the age of puberty that the latter condition is not due to mere
absence of peripheral irritation is shown by a case i am acquainted with
in which a boy of 7 incited by a companion innocently attempted at
intervals during several weeks to produce erection by friction of the
penis no result of any kind followed although erections occurred
spontaneously at puberty with normal sexual feelings306
    i am indebted to a correspondent for the following notes
    from my observation during five years at a boardingschool it
    seems that eight out of ten boys were more or less addicted to
    the practice but i would not state positively that such was
    the proportion of masturbators among an average of thirty pupils
    though the habit was very common i know that in one bedroom
    sleeping seven boys the whole number masturbated frequently the
    act was performed in bed in the closets and sometimes in the
    classrooms during lessons inquiry among my friends as to onanism
    in the boardingschools to which they were sent elicited
    somewhat contradictory answers concerning the frequency of the
    habit dr  who went to a french school told me that all
    the older boys had younger accomplices in mutual masturbation he
    also spoke with experience of the prevalence of the practice in a
    wellknown public school in the west of england b said all
    the boys at his school masturbated g stated that most of his
    schoolmates were onanists l said more than half was the
    proportion
    at my school manual masturbation was both solitary and mutual
    and sometimes younger boys who had not acquired the habit were
    induced to manipulate bigger boys one very precocious boy of
    fifteen always chose a companion of ten because his hand was
    like a womans sometimes boys entered their friends bed for
    mutual excitement in afterlife they showed no signs of
    inversion another boy aged about fourteen who had been seduced
    by a servantgirl embraced the bolster the pleasurable
    sensations according to his statement were heightened by
    imagining that the bolster was a woman he said that the
    enjoyment of the act was greatly increased during the holidays
    when he was able to spread a pair of his sisters drawers upon
    the pillow and so intensify the illusion
    before puberty the boys appeared to be more continent than
    afterward a few of the older and more intelligent masturbators
    regulated the habit as some married men regulate intercourse
    the big boy referred to who chose always the same manipulator
    professed to indulge only once in twenty days his reason being
    that more frequent repetition of the act would injure his health
    about twice a week for boys who had reached puberty and once a
    week for younger boys was i think about the average
    indulgence i have never met with a parallel of one of those
    cases of excessive masturbation recorded by many doctors there
    may have been such cases at this school but if so the boys
    concealed the frequency of their gratifications
    my experience proved that many of the lads regarded masturbation
    as reprehensible but their plea was everyone does it some
    often those who indulged inordinately and more secretly than
    their companions gravely condemned the practice as sinful a few
    seemed to think there was no harm in it but that the habit
    might stunt the growth and weaken the body if practiced very
    frequently the greater number made no attempt to conceal the
    habit they enlarged upon the pleasure of it it was ever so
    much nicer than eating tarts etc
    the chief cause i believe to be initiation by an older
    schoolmate but i have known accidental causes such as the
    discovery that swarming up a pole pleasurably excited the organ
    rubbing to allay irritation and simple curious handling of the
    erect penis in the early morning before rising from bed
    i quote the foregoing communication as perhaps a fairly typical
    experience in a british school though i am myself inclined to
    think that the prevalence of masturbation in schools is often
    much overrated for while in some schools the practice is
    doubtless rampant in others it is practically unknown or at
    all events only practiced by a few individuals in secret my own
    early recollections of private schoollife fail to yield any
    reminiscences of any kind connected with either masturbation or
    homosexuality and while such happy ignorance may be the
    exception rather than the rule i am certainly inclined to
    believe thatowing to race and climate and healthier conditions
    of lifethe sexual impulse is less precocious and less
    prominently developed during the schoolage in england than in
    some continental countries it is probably to this delayed
    development that we should attribute the contrast that ferrero
    finds leuropa giovane pp 15156 and certainly states too
    absolutely between the sexual reserve of young englishmen and
    the sexual immodesty of his own countrymen
    in germany ncke has also stated kritisches zum kapitel der
    sexualitt archiv fr psychiatrie pp 35456 1899 that he
    heard nothing at school either of masturbation or homosexuality
    and he records the experience of medical friends who stated that
    such phenomena were only rare exceptions and regarded by the
    majority of the boys as exhibitions of schweinerei at other
    german schools as hoche has shown sexual practices are very
    prevalent it is evident that at different schools and even at
    the same school at different times these manifestations vary in
    frequency within wide limits
    such variations it seems to me are due to two causes in the
    first place they largely depend upon the character of the more
    influential elder boys in the second place they depend upon the
    attitude of the headmaster with reference to this point i may
    quote from a letter written by an experienced master in one of
    the most famous english public schools when i first came to
     a quarter of a century ago dr  was making a crusade
    against this failing boys were sent away wholesale the school
    was summoned and lectured solemnly and the more the severities
    the more rampant the disease i thought to myself that the remedy
    was creating the malady and i heard afterward from an old boy
    that in those days they used to talk things over by the fireside
    and think there must be something very choice in a sin that
    braved so much dr  went and under  we never spoke of
    such things curiosity died down and the thing itself i
    believe was lessened we were told to warn new boys of the
    dangers to health and morals of such offences lest the innocent
    should be caught in ignorance i have only spoken to a few i
    think the great thing is not to put it in boys heads i have
    noticed solitary faults most commonly and then i tell the boy
    how he is physically weakening himself if you notice it is
    puppies that seem to go against nature but grown dogs never
    so if two small boys acted thus i should think it merely an
    instinctive feeling after nature which would amend itself many
    here would consider it a heinous sin but those who think such
    things sins make them sins i have seen in the old days most
    delightful little children sent away branded with infamy and
    scarce knowing whyyou might as well expel a boy for scratching
    his head when it itched i am sure the soundest way is to treat
    it as a doctor would and explain to the boy the physical effects
    of overindulgence of any sort when it is combated from the
    monkish standpoint the evil becomes an epidemic i am however
    far from anxious to indorse the policy of ignoring the sexual
    phenomena of youth it is not the speaking about such things that
    should be called in question but the wisdom and good sense of
    the speaker we ought to expect a headmaster to possess both an
    adequate acquaintance with the nature of the phenomena of
    autoerotism and homosexuality and a reasonable amount of tact
    in dealing with boys he may then fairly be trusted to exercise
    his own judgment it may be doubted whether boys should be made
    too alive to the existence of sexual phenomena there can be no
    doubt about their teachers the same is of course true as
    regards girls among whom the same phenomena though less
    obtrusive are not less liable to occur
as to whether masturbation is more common in one sex than the other there
have been considerable differences of opinion tissot considered it more
prevalent among women christian believed it commoner among men deslandes
and iwan bloch hold that there are no sexual differences and garnier was
doubtful lawson tait in his diseases of women stated his opinion that
in england while very common among boys it is relatively rare among
women and then usually taught spitzka in america also found it
relatively rare among women and dana considers it commoner in boys than
in girls or adults307 moll is inclined to think that masturbation is
less common in women and girls than in the male sex rohleder believes
that after puberty when it is equally common in both sexes it is more
frequently found in men but that women masturbate with more passion and
imaginative fervor308 kellogg in america says it is equally prevalent
in both sexes but that women are more secretive morris also in america
considers on the other hand that persistent masturbation is commoner in
women and accounts for this by the healthier life and traditions of boys
pouillet who studied the matter with considerable thoroughness in france
came to the conclusion that masturbation is commoner among women among
whom he found it to be equally prevalent in rich and poor and especially
so in the great centres of civilization in russia guttceit states in his
dreissig jahre praxis that from the ages of 10 to 16 boys masturbate
more than girls who know less about the practice which has not for them
the charm of the forbidden but after 16 he finds the practice more
frequent in girls and women than in youths and men ncke in germany
believes that there is much evidence pointing in the same direction and
adler considers masturbation very common in women moraglia is decidedly
of the opinion on the ground of his own observations already alluded to
that masturbation is more frequent among women he refers to the facta
very significant fact as i shall elsewhere have to point outthat while
in man there is only one sexual centre the penis in woman there are
several centresthe clitoris the vagina the uterus the
breasts309and he mentions that he knew a prostitute a welldeveloped
brunette of somewhat nervous temperament who boasted that she knew
fourteen ways of masturbating herself
my own opinion is that the question of the sexual distribution of
masturbation has been somewhat obscured by that harmful tendency to which
i have already alluded to concentrate attention on a particular set of
autoerotic phenomena we must group and divide our facts rationally if we
wish to command them if we confine our attention to very young children
the available evidence shows that the practice is much more common in
females310 and such a result is in harmony with the fact that
precocious puberty is most often found in female children311 at
puberty and adolescence occasional or frequent masturbation is common in
both boys and girls though i believe less common than is sometimes
supposed it is difficult to say whether it is more prevalent among boys
or girls one is inclined to conclude that it prevails more widely among
boys the sexual impulse and consequently the tendency to masturbation
tend to be aroused later and less easily in girls than in youths though
it must also be remembered that boys traditions and their more active
life keep the tendency in abeyance while in girls there is much less
frequently any restraining influence of corresponding character312 in
my study of inversion i have found that ignorance and the same absence of
tradition are probably factors in the prevalence of homosexual tendencies
among women313 after adolescence i think there can be no doubt that
masturbation is more common in women than in men men have by this time
mostly adopted some method of sexual gratification with the opposite sex
women are to a much larger extent shut out from such gratification
moreover while in rare cases women are sexually precocious it more often
happens that their sexual impulses only gain strength and
selfconsciousness after adolescence has passed i have been much
impressed by the frequency with which masturbation is occasionally
especially about the period of menstruation practiced by active
intelligent and healthy women who otherwise lead a chaste life this
experience is confirmed by others who are in a position to ascertain the
facts among normal people thus a lady who has received the confidence of
many women told me that she believes that all women who remain unmarried
masturbate as she found so much evidence pointing in this direction314
this statement certainly needs some qualification though i believe it is
not far from the truth as regards young and healthy women who after
having normal sexual relationships have been compelled for some reason or
other to break them off and lead a lonely life315 but we have to
remember that there are some women evidently with a considerable degree
of congenital sexual ansthesia no doubt in some respect or another
below the standard of normal health in whom the sexual instinct has
never been aroused and who not only do not masturbate but do not show
any desire for normal gratification while in a large proportion of other
cases the impulse is gratified passively in ways i have already referred
to the autoerotic phenomena which take place in this way spontaneously
by yielding to revery with little or no active interference certainly
occur much more frequently in women than in men on the other hand
contrary to what one might be led to expect the closelyrelated
autoerotic phenomena during sleep seem to take place more frequently in
men although in women as we have found ground for concluding they
reverberate much more widely and impressively on the waking psychical
life
    we owe to restif de la bretonne what is perhaps the earliest
    precise description of a woman masturbating in 1755 he knew a
    dark young woman plain but wellmade and of warm temperament
    educated in a convent she was observed one day when gazing from
    her window at a young man in whom she was tenderly interested to
    become much excited her movements became agitated i approached
    her and really believe that she was uttering affectionate
    expressions she had become red then she sighed deeply and
    became motionless stretching out her legs which she stiffened
    as if she felt pain it is further hinted that her hands took
    part in this manoeuvre monsieur nicolas vol vi p 143
    pictorial representations of a woman masturbating also occur in
    eighteenth century engravings thus in france baudouins le
    midi reproduced in fuchss das erotische element in der
    karikatur fig 92 represents an elegant young lady in a
    rococo gardenbower she has been reading a book she has now just
    dropped together with her sunshade she leans languorously back
    and her hand begins to find its way through her plackethole
    adler who has studied masturbation in women with more care than
    any previous writer has recorded in detail the autoerotic
    manifestations involved in the case of an intelligent and
    unprejudiced woman aged 30 who had begun masturbating when
    twenty and practiced it at intervals of a few weeks she
    experienced the desire for sexual gratification under the
    following circumstances 1 spontaneously directly before or
    after menstruation 2 as a method to cure sleeplessness 3
    after washing the parts with warm but not cold water 4 after
    erotic dreams 5 quite suddenly without definite cause the
    phenomena of the masturbatory process fell into two stages 1
    incomplete excitement 2 the highest pleasurable gratification
    it only took place in the evening or at night and a special
    position was necessary with the right knee bent and the right
    foot against the knee of the extended left leg the bent index
    and middle fingers of the right hand were then applied firmly to
    the lower third of the left labium minus which was rubbed
    against the underlying parts at this stage the manifestations
    sometimes stopped either from an effort of selfcontrol or from
    fatigue of the arm there was no emission of mucus or general
    perspiration but some degree of satisfaction and of fatigue
    followed by sleep if however the manipulation was continued
    the second stage was reached and the middle finger sank into the
    vagina while the index finger remained on the labium the rest
    of the hand holding and compressing the whole of the vulva from
    pubes to anus against the symphysis with a backwards and
    forwards movement the left hand also being frequently used to
    support and assist the right the parts now gave a mushroomlike
    feeling to the touch and in a few seconds or after a longer
    interval the complete feeling of pleasurable satisfaction was
    attained at the same moment there was but only after she had
    had experience of coitus an involuntary elevation of the pelvis
    together with emission of mucus making the hand wet this mucus
    having an odor and being quite distinct from the ordinary
    odorless mucus of the vagina at the same time the finger in the
    vagina felt slight contractions of the whole vaginal wall the
    climax of sexual pleasure lasted a few seconds with its
    concomitant vaginal contractions then slowly subsided with a
    feeling of general wellbeing the finger at the same time
    slipping out of the vagina and she was left in a state of
    general perspiration and sleep would immediately follow when
    this was not the case she was frequently conscious of some
    degree of sensibility in the sacrum lasting for several hours
    and especially felt when sitting when masturbation was the
    result of an erotic dream which occurred but seldom the first
    stage was already reached in sleep and the second was more
    quickly obtained during the act it was only occasionally that
    any thoughts of men or of coitus were present the attention
    being fixed on the coming climax the psychic state afterwards
    was usually one of selfreproach o adler die mangelhafte
    geschlechtsempfindung des weibes 1904 pp 2629 the
    phenomena in this case may be regarded as fairly typical but
    there are many individual variations mucus emissions and vaginal
    contractions frequently occur before actual orgasm and there is
    not usually any insertion of the finger into the vagina in women
    who have never experienced coitus or indeed even in those who
    have
we must now turn to that aspect of our subject which in the past has
always seemed the only aspect of autoerotic phenomena meriting attention
the symptoms and results of chronic masturbation it appears to have been
an englishman who at the beginning of the eighteenth century first
called popular attention to the supposed evils of masturbation his book
was published in london and entitled onania or the heinous sin of
selfpollution and all its frightful consequences in both sexes
considered with spiritual and physical advice etc it is not a serious
medical treatise but an early and certainly superior example of a kind of
literature which we have since become familiar with through the daily
newspapers a large part of the book which is cleverly written is
devoted in the later editions to the letters of nervous and
hypochondriacal young men and women who are too shy to visit the author
but request him to send a bottle of his strengthening tincture and
mention that they are inclosing half a guinea a guinea or still larger
sum concerning the composition of the strengthening tincture we are not
informed316 this work which was subsequently attributed to a writer
named bekkers is said to have passed through no less than eighty
editions and it was translated into german tissot a physician of
lausanne followed with his trait de lonanisme dissertation sur les
maladies produites par la masturbation first published in latin 1760
then in french 1764 and afterward in nearly all european languages he
regarded masturbation as a crime and as an act of suicide his book is
a production of amusing exaggeration and rhetoric zealously setting forth
the prodigious evils of masturbation in a style which combines as
christian remarks the strains of rousseau with a vein of religious piety
tissot included only manual selfabuse under the term onanism shortly
afterward voltaire in his dictionnaire philosophique took up the
subject giving it a wider meaning and still further popularizing it
finally lallemand at a somewhat later period 1836 wrote a book which
was indeed more scientific in character but which still sought to
represent masturbation as the source of all evils these four writersthe
author of onania tissot voltaire lallemandare certainly responsible
for much the mistaken notions of many medical authorities carried on by
tradition even down to our own time the powerful lever which has been
put into the hand of unscrupulous quacks the suffering dread and
remorse experienced in silence by many thousands of ignorant and often
innocent young people may all be traced in large measure back to these
four wellmeaning but on this question misguided authors

the signs and consequences of masturbation given by various prominent
authorities317
that many of these manifestations do occur in connection with masturbation
is unquestionable there is also good reason to believe that some of them
may be the results of masturbation acting on an imperfectly healthy
organism but in all such cases we must speak with great caution for
there appears to be little reliable evidence to show that simple
masturbation in a wellborn and healthy individual can produce any evil
results beyond slight functional disturbances and these only when it is
practiced in excess to illustrate the real pathological relationships of
masturbation a few typical and important disorders may be briefly
considered
the delicate mechanism of the eye is one of the first portions of the
nervous apparatus to be disturbed by any undue strain on the system it is
not surprising that masturbation should be widely incriminated as a cause
of eye troubles if however we inquire into the results obtained by the
most cautious and experienced ophthalmological observers it grows evident
that masturbation as a cause of disease of the eye becomes merged into
wider causes in germany hermann cohn the distinguished ophthalmic
surgeon of breslau has dealt fully with the question318 cohn who
believes that all young men and women masturbate to some extent finds
that masturbation must be excessive for eye trouble to become apparent in
most of his cases there was masturbation several times daily during from
five to seven years in many during ten years and in one during
twentythree years in such cases we are obviously dealing with abnormal
persons and no one will dispute the possibility of harmful results in
some of the cases when masturbation was stopped the eye trouble
improved even in these cases however the troubles were but slight the
chief being apparently photopsia a subjective sensation of light with
otherwise normal conditions of pupil vision colorsense and retina in
some cases there was photophobia and he has also found paralysis of
accommodation and conjunctivitis at a later date salmo cohn in his
comprehensive monograph on the relationship between the eye and the sexual
organs in women brought together numerous cases of eye troubles in young
women associated with masturbation but in most of these cases
masturbation had been practiced with great frequency for a long period and
the ocular affections were usually not serious319 in england power has
investigated the relations of the sexual system to eye disease he is
inclined to think that the effects of masturbation have been exaggerated
but he believes that it may produce such for the most part trivial
complaints as photopsis muscs muscular asthenopia possibly
blepharospasm and perhaps conjunctivitis he goes on however to point
out that more serious complaints of the eye are caused by excess in normal
coitus by sexual abstinence and especially by disordered menstruation
thus we see that even when we are considering a mechanism so delicately
poised and one so easily disturbed by any jar of the system as vision
masturbation produces no effect except when carried to an extent which
argues a hereditarily imperfect organism while even in these cases the
effects are usually but slight moreover in no respect specific but are
paralleled and even exceeded by the results of other disturbances of the
sexual system
let us turn to the supposed influence of masturbation in causing insanity
and nervous diseases here we may chiefly realize the immense influence
exerted on medical science by tissot and his followers during a hundred
years mental weakness is the cause and not the result of excessive
masturbation gall declared320 but he was a man of genius in
isolation sir william ellis an alienist of considerable reputation at
the beginning of the last century could write with scientific equanimity
i have no hesitation in saying that in a very large number of patients
in all public asylums the disease may be attributed to that cause he
does indeed admit that it may be only a symptom sometimes but goes on
to assert that masturbation has not hitherto been exhibited in the awful
light in which it deserves to be shown and that in by far the greater
number of cases it is the true cause of dementia321 esquirol lent his
name and influence to a similar view of the pernicious influence of
masturbation throughout the century even down to the present day this
point of view has been traditionally preserved in a modified form in
apparent ignorance of the enormous prevalence of masturbation and
without so far as can be seen any attempt to distinguish between cause
and effect or to eliminate the hereditary neuropathic element many
alienists have set down a large proportion of cases of insanity idiocy
epilepsy and disease of the spinal cord to uncomplicated masturbation
thus at the matteawan state hospital new york for criminal lunatics and
insane prisoners from 1875 to 1907 masturbation was the sole assigned
cause of insanity in 160 men out of 2595 while according to dr clara
barrus among 121 cases of insanity in young women masturbation is the
cause in ten cases322 it is unnecessary to multiply examples for this
traditional tendency is familiar to all
it appears to have been largely due to griesinger in the middle of the
last century that we owe the first authoritative appearance of a saner
more discriminating view regarding the results of masturbation although
still to some extent fettered by the traditions prevalent in his day
griesinger saw that it was not so much masturbation itself as the feelings
aroused in sensitive minds by the social attitude toward masturbation
which produced evil effects that constant struggle he wrote against
a desire which is even overpowering and to which the individual always in
the end succumbs that hidden strife between shame repentance good
intentions and the irritation which impels to the act this after not a
little acquaintance with onanists we consider to be far more important
than the primary direct physical effect he added that there are no
specific signs of masturbation and concluded that it is oftener a symptom
than a cause the general progress of educated opinions since that date
has in the main confirmed and carried forward the results cautiously
stated by griesinger this distinguished alienist thought that when
practiced in childhood masturbation might lead to insanity berkhan in
his investigation of the psychoses of childhood found that in no single
case was masturbation a cause vogel uffelmann and emminghaus in the
course of similar studies have all come to almost similar
conclusions323 it is only on a congenitally morbid nervous system
emminghaus insists that masturbation can produce any serious results
most of the cases charged to masturbation writes kiernan in a private
letter basing his opinion on wide clinical experience are either
hebephrenia or hysteria in which an effect is taken for the cause
christian during twenty years experience in hospitals asylums and
private practice in town and country has not found any seriously evil
effects from masturbation324 he thinks indeed that it may be a more
serious evil in women than in men but yellowlees considers that in women
it is possibly less exhausting and injurious than in the other sex
which was also the opinion of hammond as well as of guttceit though he
found that women pushed the practice much further than men and ncke who
has given special attention to this point could not find that
masturbation is a definite cause of insanity in women in a single
case325 koch also reaches a similar conclusion as regards both sexes
though he admits that masturbation may cause some degree of psychopathic
deterioration even in this respect however he points out that when
practiced in moderation it is not injurious in the certain and
exceptionless way in which it is believed to be in many circles it is the
people whose nervous systems are already injured who masturbate most
easily and practice it more immoderately than others the chief source of
its evil is selfreproach and the struggle with the impulse326
kahlbaum it is true under the influence of the older tradition when he
erected katatonia into a separate disorder not always accepted in later
times regarded prolonged and excessive masturbation as a chief cause
but i am not aware that he ever asserted that it was a sole and sufficient
cause in a healthy organism kiernan one of the earliest writers on
katatonia was careful to point out that masturbation was probably as much
effect as cause of the morbid nervous condition327 maudsley in body
and mind recognized masturbation as a special exciting cause of a
characteristic form of insanity but he cautiously added nevertheless i
think that selfabuse seldom if ever produces it without the
cooperation of the insane neurosis328 schle also recognized a
specific masturbatory insanity but the general tendency to reject any
such nosological form is becoming marked krafftebing long since rejected
it and ncke decidedly opposes it kraepelin states that excessive
masturbation can only occur in a dangerous degree in predisposed
subjects so also forel and lwenfeld as at an earlier period
trousseau329 it is true that marro in his admirable and detailed study
of the normal and abnormal aspects of puberty accepts a form of
masturbatory insanity but the only illustrative case he brings forward is
a young man possessing various stigmata of degeneracy and the son of an
alcoholic father such a case tells us nothing regarding the results of
simple masturbation330 even spitzka who maintained several years ago
the traditional views as to the terrible results of masturbation and
recognized a special insanity of masturbation stated his conclusions
with a caution that undermined his position selfabuse he concluded
to become a sole cause of insanity must be begun early and carried very
far in persons of sound antecedents it rarely under these circumstances
suffices to produce an actual vesania331 when we remember that there
is no convincing evidence to show that masturbation is begun early and
carried very far by persons of sound antecedents the significance of
spitzkas typical psychosis of masturbation is somewhat annulled it is
evident that these distinguished investigators marro and spitzka have
been induced by tradition to take up a position which their own scientific
consciences have compelled them practically to evacuate
    recent authorities are almost unanimous in rejecting masturbation
    as a cause of insanity thus rohleder in his comprehensive
    monograph die masturbation 1899 pp 18592 although taking
    a very serious view of the evil results of masturbation points
    out the unanimity which is now tending to prevail on this point
    and lays it down that masturbation is never the direct cause of
    insanity sexual excesses of any kind he adds following
    curschmann can at the most merely give an impetus to a latent
    form of insanity on the whole he concludes the best
    authorities are unanimous in agreeing that masturbation may
    certainly injure mental capacity by weakening memory and
    depressing intellectual energy that further in hereditarily
    neurotic subjects it may produce slight psychoses like folie du
    doute hypochondria hysteria that finally under no
    circumstances can it produce severe psychoses like paranoia or
    general paralysis if it caused insanity as often as some
    claim as kellogg remarks the whole race would long since have
    passed into masturbatic degeneracy of mind it is especially
    injurious in the very young and in all who have weak nervous
    systems but the physical traits attributed to the habit are
    common to thousands of neurasthenic and neurotic individuals
    kellogg a textbook of mental diseases 1897 pp 9495
    again at the outset of the article on masturbation in tukes
    dictionary of psychological medicine yellowlees states that
    on account of the mischief formerly done by reckless statements
    it is necessary to state plainly that unless the practice has
    been long and greatly indulged no permanent evil effects may be
    observed to follow ncke again has declared kritisches zum
    kapitel der sexualitt archiv fr psychiatrie 1899 there
    are neither somatic nor psychic symptoms peculiar on onanism nor
    is there any specific onanistic psychosis i am prepared to deny
    that onanism ever produces any psychoses in those who are not
    already predisposed that such a view is now becoming widely
    prevalent is illustrated by the cautious and temperate discussion
    of masturbation in a recent work by a nonmedical writer
    geoffrey mortimer chapters on human love pp 199205
the testimony of expert witnesses with regard to the influence of
masturbation in producing other forms of psychoses and neuroses is
becoming equally decisive and here also the traditions of tissot are
being slowly effaced i have not in the whole of my practice wrote
west forty years ago out of a large experience among children and
women seen convulsions epilepsy or idiocy induced by masturbation in
any child of either sex neither have i seen any instance in which
hysteria epilepsy or insanity in women after puberty was due to
masturbation as its efficient cause332 gowers speaks somewhat less
positively but regards masturbation as not so much a cause of true
epilepsy as of atypical attacks sometimes of a character intermediate
between the hysteroid and the epileptoid form this relationship he has
frequently seen in boys333 leyden among the causes of diseases of the
spinal cord does not include any form of sexual excess in moderation
erb remarks masturbation is not more dangerous to the spinal cord than
natural coitus and has no bad effects334 it makes no difference erb
considers whether the orgasm is effected normally or in solitude this is
also the opinion of toulouse of frbringer and of curschmann as at an
earlier period it was of roubaud
while these authorities are doubtless justified in refusing to ascribe to
masturbation any part in the production of psychic or nervous diseases it
seems to me that they are going somewhat beyond their province when they
assert that masturbation has no more injurious effect than coitus if
sexual coitus were a purely physiological phenomenon this position would
be sound but the sexual orgasm is normally bound up with a mass of
powerful emotions aroused by a person of the opposite sex it is in the
joy caused by the play of these emotions as well as in the discharge of
the sexual orgasm that the satisfaction of coitus resides in the absence
of the desired partner the orgasm whatever relief it may give must be
followed by a sense of dissatisfaction perhaps of depression even of
exhaustion often of shame and remorse the same remark has since been
made by stanley hall335 practically also as john hunter pointed out
there is more probability of excess in masturbation than in coitus
whether as some have asserted masturbation involves a greater nervous
effort than coitus is more doubtful336 it thus seems somewhat
misleading to assert that masturbation has no more injurious effect than
coitus337
reviewing the general question of the supposed grave symptoms and signs
of masturbation and its pernicious results we may reach the conclusion
that in the case of moderate masturbation in healthy wellborn
individuals no seriously pernicious results necessarily follow338 with
regard to the general signs we may accept as concerns both sexes what
the obstetrical and gynecological society of berlin decided in 1861 in a
discussion of it in women that there are none which can be regarded as
reliable339
we may conclude finally with clouston that the opposing views on the
subject may be simply explained by the fact that the writers on both sides
have ignored or insufficiently recognized the influence of heredity and
temperament they have done precisely what so many unscientific writers on
inebriety have continued to do unto the present day when describing the
terrible results of alcohol without pointing out that the chief factor in
such cases has not been the alcohol but the organization on which the
alcohol acted excess may act according to the familiar oldfashioned
adage like the lighted match but we must always remember the obvious
truth that it makes a considerable difference whether you threw your
lighted match into a powder magazine or into the sea
while we may thus dismiss the extravagant views widely held during the
past century concerning the awful results of masturbation as due to
ignorance and false tradition it must be pointed out that even in
healthy or moderately healthy individuals any excess in solitary
selfexcitement may still produce results which though slight are yet
harmful the skin digestion and circulation may all be disordered
headache and neuralgia may occur and as in normal sexual excess or in
undue frequency of sexual excitement during sleep there is a certain
general lowering of nervous tone probably the most important of the
comparatively frequent resultsthough this also arises usually on a
somewhat morbid soilis neurasthenia with its manifold symptoms there
can be little doubt that the ancient belief dating from the time of
hippocrates that sexual excesses produce spinal disease as well as the
belief that masturbation causes insanity are largely due to the failure
to diagnose neurasthenia
    the following case of neurasthenia recorded by eulenburg may be
    given as a classical picture of the nervous disturbances which
    may be associated with masturbation and are frequently regarded
    as solely caused by habits of masturbation miss hh 28 years

    after much persuasion the patient confessed that when a girl of

    16 she had been impelled to frequent masturbation this had
    caused great shame and remorse which however had not sufficed
    to restrain the habit her mother having died she lived alone
    with her invalid father and had no one in whom to confide

    since beard first described neurasthenia many diverse opinions
    have been expressed concerning the relationships of sexual
    irregularities to neurasthenia gilles de la tourette in his
    little monograph on neurasthenia following the traditions of
    charcots school dismisses the question of any sexual causation
    without discussion binswanger die pathologie und therapie der
    neurasthenie while admitting that nearly all neurasthenic
    persons acknowledge masturbation at some period considers it is
    not an important cause of neurasthenia only differing from
    coitus by the fact that the opportunities for it are more
    frequent and that the sexual disturbances of neurasthenia are
    in the majority of cases secondary rohleder on the other hand
    who takes a very grave view of the importance of masturbation
    considers that its most serious results are a question of

    medical record march 25 1899 in an analysis of 333 cases
    of neurasthenia found that 123 cases were apparently due to
    overwork or masturbation freud concludes that neurasthenia
    proper can nearly always be traced to excessive masturbation or
    to spontaneous pollutions eg sammlung kleiner schriften zur
    neurosenlehre first series p 187 this view is confirmed by
    gattels careful study ueber die sexuellen ursachen der
    neurasthenie und angstneurose 1898 gattel investigated 100
    consecutive cases of severe functional nervous disorder in
    krafftebings clinic at vienna and found that in every case of
    neurasthenia in a male 28 in all there was masturbation while
    of the 15 women with neurasthenia only one is recorded as not
    masturbating and she practiced coitus reservatus irrespective
    of the particular form of the nervous disorder gattel found that
    18 women out of 42 and 36 men out of 58 acknowledged
    masturbation this shows a slightly larger proportion among the
    men but the men were mostly young while the women were mostly
    of more mature age it must however always be remembered that
    we have no equally careful statistics of masturbation in
    perfectly healthy persons we must also remember that we have to
    distinguish between the post and the propter and that it is
    quite possible that neurasthenic persons are specially
    predisposed to masturbation bloch is of this opinion and
    remarks that a vicious circle may thus be formed
    on the whole there can be little doubt that neurasthenia is
    liable to be associated with masturbation carried to an excessive
    extent but while neurasthenia is probably the severest
    affection that is liable to result from or accompany
    masturbation we are scarcely yet entitled to accept the
    conclusion of gattel that in such cases there is no hereditary
    neurotic predisposition we must steer clearly between the
    opposite errors of those on the one hand who assert that
    heredity is the sole cause of functional nervous disorders and
    those on the other hand who consider that the incident that may
    call out the disorder is itself a sole sufficient cause
in many cases it has seemed to me that masturbation when practiced in
excess especially if begun before the age of puberty leads to inaptitude
for coitus as well as to indifference to it and sometimes to undue
sexual irritability involving premature emission and practical impotence
this is however the exception especially if the practice has not been
begun until after puberty in women i attach considerable importance as a
result of masturbation to an aversion for normal coitus in later life in
such cases some peripheral irritation or abnormal mental stimulus trains
the physical sexual orgasm to respond to an appeal which has nothing
whatever to do with the fascination normally exerted by the opposite sex
at puberty however the claim of passion and the real charm of sex begin
to make themselves felt but owing to the physical sexual feelings having
been trained into a foreign channel these new and more normal sex
associations remain of a purely ideal and emotional character without the
strong sensual impulses with which under healthy conditions they tend to
be more and more associated as puberty passes on into adolescence or
mature adult life i am fairly certain that in many women often highly
intellectual women the precocious excess in masturbation has been a main
cause not necessarily the sole efficient cause in producing a divorce in
later life between the physical sensuous impulses and the ideal emotions
the sensuous impulse having been evolved and perverted before the
manifestation of the higher emotion the two groups of feelings have
become divorced for the whole of life this is a common source of much
personal misery and family unhappiness though at the same time the clash
of contending impulses may lead to a high development of moral character
when early masturbation is a factor in producing sexual inversion it
usually operates in the manner i have here indicated the repulsion for
normal coitus helping to furnish a soil on which the inverted impulse may
develop unimpeded
    this point has not wholly escaped previous observers though they
    do not seem to have noted its psychological mechanism tissot
    stated that masturbation causes an aversion to marriage more
    recently loiman ueber onanismus beim weibe therapeutische
    monatshefte april 1890 considered that masturbation in women
    leading to a perversion of sexual feeling including inability to
    find satisfaction in coitus affects the associated centres
    smith baker again the neuropsychical element in conjugal
    aversion journal of nervous and mental disease september
    1892 finds that a source of marital aversion seems to lie in
    the fact that substitution of mechanical and iniquitous
    excitations affords more thorough satisfaction than the mutual
    legitimate ones do and gives cases in point savill also who
    believes that masturbation is more common in women than is
    usually supposed regards dyspareunia or pain in coition as one
    of the signs of the habit
    masturbation in women thus becomes as raymond and janet point
    out les obsessions vol ii p 307 a frequent cause of
    sexual frigidity in marriage these authors illustrate the train
    of evils which may thus be set up by the case of a lady 26
    years of age a normal woman of healthy family who at the age
    of 15 was taught by a servant to masturbate at the age of 18
    she married she loved her husband but she had no sexual
    feelings in coitus and she continued to masturbate sometimes
    several times a day without evil consequences at 24 she had to
    go into a hospital for floating kidney and was so obliged to
    stop masturbating she here accidentally learnt of the evil
    results attributed to the habit she resolved not to do it again
    and she kept her resolution but while still in hospital she fell
    wildly in love with a man to escape from the constant thought of
    this man she sought relations with her husband and at times
    masturbated but now it no longer gave her pleasure she wished
    to give up sexual things altogether but that was easier said
    than done she became subject to nervous crises often brought on
    by the sight of a man and accompanied by sexual excitement they
    disappeared under treatment and she thereupon became entirely
    frigid sexually but far from being happy she has lost all
    energy and interest in life and it is her sole desire to attain
    the sexual feelings she has lost adler considers that even when
    masturbation in women becomes an overmastering passion so far as
    organic effects are concerned it is usually harmless its effects
    being primarily psychic and he attaches especial significance to
    it as a cause of sexual ansthesia in normal coitus being
    perhaps the most frequent cause of such ansthesia he devotes
    an important chapter to this matter and brings forward numerous
    cases in illustration adler die mangelhafte
    geschlechtsempfindung des weibes pp 93119 also 2123 adler
    considers that the frequency of masturbation in women is largely
    due to the fact that women experience greater difficulties than
    men in obtaining sexual satisfaction and so are impelled by
    unsatisfying coitus to continue masturbation after marriage he
    adds that partly from natural shyness partly from shame of
    acknowledging what is commonly accounted a sin and partly from
    the fear of seeming disgusting or unworthy of sympathy in the
    doctors eyes women are usually silent on this matter and very
    great tact and patience may be necessary before a confession is
    obtained
on the psychic side no doubt the most frequent and the most
characteristic result of persistent and excessive masturbation is a morbid
heightening of selfconsciousness without any coordinated heightening of
selfesteem340 the man or woman who is kissed by a desirable and
desired person of the opposite sex feels a satisfying sense of pride and
elation which must always be absent from the manifestations of
autoerotic activity341 this must be so even apart from the
masturbators consciousness of the general social attitude toward his
practices and his dread of detection for that may also exist as regards
normal coitus without any corresponding psychic effects the masturbator
if his practice is habitual is thus compelled to cultivate an artificial
consciousness of selfesteem and may show a tendency to mental arrogance
selfrighteousness and religiosity constitute as it were a protection
against the tendency to remorse a morbid mental soil is of course
required for the full development of these characteristics the habitual
male masturbator it must be remembered is often a shy and solitary
person individuals of this temperament are especially predisposed to
excesses in all the manifestations of autoerotism while the yielding to
such tendencies increases the reserve and the horror of society at the
same time producing a certain suspicion of others in some extreme cases
there is no doubt as kraepelin believes some decrease of psychic
capacity an inability to grasp and coordinate external impressions
weakness of memory deadening of emotions or else the general phenomena
of increased irritability leading on to neurasthenia
i find good reason to believe that in many cases the psychic influence of
masturbation on women is different from its effect on men as spitzka
observed although it may sometimes render women selfreproachful and
hesitant it often seems to make them bold boys as we have seen early
assimilate the tradition that selfabuse is unmanly and injurious but
girls have seldom any corresponding tradition that it is unwomanly and
thus whether or not they are reticent on the matter before the forum of
their own conscience they are often less ashamed of it than men are and
less troubled by remorse
    eulenburg considers that the comparative absence of bad effects
    from masturbation in girls is largely due to the fact that
    unlike boys they are not terrorized by exaggerated warnings and
    quack literature concerning the awful results of the practice
    forel who has also remarked that women are often comparatively
    little troubled by qualms of conscience after masturbation
    denies that this is due to a lower moral tone than men possess
    forel die sexuelle frage p 247 in this connection i may
    refer to history iv recorded in the appendix to the fifth volume
    of these studies in which it is stated that of 55 prostitutes
    of various nationalities with whom the subject had had
    relations 18 spontaneously told him that they were habitual
    masturbators while of 26 normal women 13 made the same
    confession unasked guttceit in russia after stating that
    women of good constitution had told him that they masturbated as
    much as six or ten times a day or night until they fell asleep
    tired without bad results adds that according to his
    observations masturbation when not excessive is on the
    whole a quite innocent matter which exerts little or no
    permanent effect and adds that it never in any case leads to
    hypochondria onanica in women because they have not been
    taught to expect bad results dreissig jahre praxis p 306
    there is i think some truththough the exceptions are
    doubtless manyin the distinction drawn by wc krauss
    masturbational neuroses medical news july 13 1901 from
    my experience it masturbation seems to have an opposite effect
    upon the two sexes dulling the mental and making clumsy the
    physical exertions of the male while in the female it quickens
    and excites the physical and psychical movements the man is
    rendered hypoesthetic the woman hyperesthetic
in either sex autoerotic excesses during adolescence in young men and
women of intelligencewhatever absence of gross injury there may
bestill often produce a certain degree of psychic perversion and tend
to foster false and highstrung ideals of life kraepelin refers to the
frequency of exalted enthusiasms in masturbators and i have already
quoted ansties remarks on the connection between masturbation and
premature false work in literature and art it may be added that excess in
masturbation has often occurred in men and women whose work in literature
and art cannot be described as premature and false kp moritz in early
adult life gave himself up to excess in masturbation and up to the age
of thirty had no relations with women lenau is saidthough the statement
is sometimes deniedto have been a masturbator from early life the habit
profoundly effecting his life and work rousseau in his confessions
admirably describes how his own solitary timid and imaginative life
found its chief sexual satisfaction in masturbation342 gogol the
great russian novelist masturbated to excess and it has been suggested
that the dreamy melancholy thus induced was a factor in his success as a
novelist goethe it has been asserted at one time masturbated to excess
i am not certain on what authority the statement is made probably on a
passage in the seventh book of dichtung und wahrheit in which
describing his studentlife at leipzig and his loss of aennchen owing to
his neglect of her he tells how he revenged that neglect on his own
physical nature by foolish practices from which he thinks he suffered for
a considerable period343 the great scandinavian philosopher sren
kierkegaard suffered severely according to rasmussen from excessive
masturbation that at the present day eminence in art literature and
other fields may be combined with the excessive practice of masturbation
is a fact of which i have unquestionable evidence
    i have the detailed history of a man of 30 of high ability in a
    scientific direction who except during periods of mental
    strain has practiced masturbation nightly though seldom more
    than once a night from early childhood without any traceable
    evil results so far as his general health and energy are
    concerned in another case a schoolteacher age 30 a hard
    worker and accomplished musician has masturbated every night
    sometimes more than once a night ever since he was at school
    without so far as he knows any bad results he has never had
    connection with a woman and seldom touches wine or tobacco
    curschmann knew a young and able author who from the age of 11
    had masturbated excessively but who retained physical and mental
    freshness it would be very easy to refer to other examples and
    i may remark that as regards the histories recorded in various
    volumes of these studies a notable proportion of those in
    which excessive masturbation is admitted are of persons of
    eminent and recognized ability
it is often possible to trace the precise mechanism of the relationship
between autoerotic excitement and intellectual activity brownsquard
in old age considered that to induce a certain amount of sexual
excitement not proceeding to emission was an aid to mental work raymond
and janet knew a man considering himself a poet who in order to attain
the excitation necessary to compose his ideal verses would write with one
hand while with the other he caressed his penis though not to the extent
of producing ejaculation344 we must not believe however that this is
by any means the method of workers who deserve to be accepted seriously
it would be felt to say the least as unworthy it is indeed a method
that would only appeal to a person of feeble or failing mental power what
more usually happens is that the autoerotic excitement develops pari
passu and spontaneously with the mental activity and at the climax of
the latter the autoerotic excitement also culminates almost or even
quite spontaneously in an explosion of detumescence which relieves the
mental tension i am acquainted with such cases in both young men and
women of intellectual ability and they probably occur much more
frequently than we usually suspect
    in illustration of the foregoing observations i may quote the
    following narrative written by a man of letters from puberty
    to the age of 30 when i married i lived in virgin continence
    in accord with my principle during these years i worked
    exceedingly hardchiefly at art music and poetry my days
    being spent earning my livelihood these art studies fell into my
    evening time i noticed that productive power came in
    periodsperiods of irregular length and which certainly to a
    partial extent could be controlled by the will such a period of
    vital power began usually with a sensation of melancholy and it
    quickened my normal revolt against the narrowness of conventional
    life into a redhot detestation of the paltriness and pettiness
    with which so many mortals seem to content themselves as the
    mood grew in intensity this scorn of the lower things mixed with
    and gave place to a vivid insight into higher truths the
    oppression began to give place to a realization of the eternity
    of the heroic things the fatuities were seen as mere fashions
    love was seen as the true lord of life the eternal romance was
    evident in its glory the naked strength and beauty of men were
    known despite their clothes in such mood my work was produced
    bitter protest and keensighted passion mingled in its building
    the arising vitality had certainly deep relation to the
    periodicity of the sexforce of manhood at the height of the
    power of the artcreative mood would come those natural emissions
    with which nature calmly disposes of the unused force of the
    male such emissions were natural and healthy and not exhaustive
    or hysterical the process is undoubtedly sane and protective
    unless the subject be unhealthy the period of creative art power
    extended a little beyond the end of the period of natural seed
    emissionthe art work of this last stage being less vibrant and
    of a gentler force then followed a time of calm natural rest
    which gradually led up to the next sequence of melancholy and
    power the periods certainly varied in length of time controlled
    somewhat by the force of the mind and the mental will to create
    that is to say i could somewhat delay the natural emission by
    which i gained an extension of the period of power
how far masturbation in moderately healthy persons living without normal
sexual relationships may be considered normal is a difficult question only
to be decided with reference to individual cases as a general rule when
only practiced at rare intervals and faute de mieux in order to obtain
relief for physical oppression and mental obsession it may be regarded as
the often inevitable result of the unnatural circumstances of our
civilized social life when as often happens in mental degeneracyand
as in shy and imaginative persons perhaps of neurotic temperament may
also sometimes become the caseit is practiced in preference to sexual
relationships it at once becomes abnormal and may possibly lead to a
variety of harmful results mental and physical345
it must always be remembered however that while the practice of
masturbation may be harmful in its consequences it is also in the
absence of normal sexual relationships frequently not without good
results in the medical literature of the last hundred years a number of
cases have been incidentally recorded in which the patients found
masturbation beneficial and such cases might certainly have been
enormously increased if there had been any openeyed desire to discover
them my own observations agree with those of sudduth who asserts that
masturbation is in the main practiced for its sedative effect on the
nervous system the relaxation that follows the act constitutes its real
attraction both masturbation and sexual intercourse should be classed
as typical sedatives346
    gall fonctions du cerveau 1825 vol iii p 235 mentioned a
    woman who was tormented by strong sexual desire which she
    satisfied by masturbation ten or twelve times a day this caused
    no bad results and led to the immediate disappearance of a
    severe pain in the back of the neck from which she often
    suffered clouston mental diseases 1887 p 496 quotes as
    follows from a letter written by a youth of 22 i am sure i
    cannot explain myself nor give account of such conduct
    sometimes i felt so uneasy at my work that i would go to the
    watercloset to do it and it seemed to give me ease and then i
    would work like a hatter for a whole week till the sensation
    overpowered me again i have been the most filthy scoundrel in
    existence etc garnier presents the case of a monk aged 33
    living a chaste life who wrote the following account of his
    experiences for the past three years at least i have felt
    every two or three weeks a kind of fatigue in the penis or
    rather slight shooting pains increasing during several days
    and then i feel a strong desire to expel the semen when no
    nocturnal pollution follows the retention of the semen causes
    general disturbance headache and sleeplessness i must confess
    that occasionally to free myself from the general and local
    oppression i lie on my stomach and obtain ejaculation i am at

    gives the case of a married lady who was deeply sensitive of the
    wrong nature of masturbation but found in it the only means of
    relieving the severe ovarian pain associated with intense sexual
    excitement which attended menstruation during the
    intermenstrual period the temptation was absent turnbull knew a
    youth who found that masturbation gave great relief to feelings
    of heaviness and confusion which came on him periodically and
    wigglesworth has frequently seen masturbation after epileptic
    fits in patients who never masturbated at other times moll
    libido sexualis bd i p 13 refers to a woman of 28 an
    artist of nervous and excitable temperament who could not find
    sexual satisfaction with her lover but only when masturbating
    which she did once or twice a day or oftener without
    masturbation she said she would be in a much more nervous
    state a friend tells me of a married lady of 40 separated from
    her husband on account of incompatibility who suffered from
    irregular menstruation she tried masturbation and in her own
    words became normal again she had never masturbated
    previously i have also been informed of the case of a young
    unmarried woman intellectual athletic and well developed who
    from the age of seven or eight has masturbated nearly every
    night before going to sleep and would be restless and unable to
    sleep if she did not
judging from my own observations among both sexes i should say that in
normal persons well past the age of puberty and otherwise leading a
chaste life masturbation would be little practiced except for the
physical and mental relief it brings many vigorous and healthy unmarried
women or married women apart from their husbands living a life of sexual
abstinence have asserted emphatically that only by sexually exciting
themselves at intervals could they escape from a condition of nervous
oppression and sexual obsession which they felt to be a state of hysteria
in most cases this happens about the menstrual period and whether
accomplished as a purely physical actin the same way as they would
soothe a baby to sleep by rocking it or patting itor by the cooperation
of voluptuous mental imagery the practice is not cultivated for its own
sake during the rest of the month
    in illustration of the foregoing statements i will here record a
    few typical observations of experiences with regard to
    masturbation the cases selected are all women and are all in a
    fairly normal and for the most part excellent state of
    health some of them however belong to somewhat neurotic
    families and these are persons of unusual mental ability and
    intelligence
    observation iunmarried aged 38 she is very vigorous and
    healthy of a strongly passionate nature but never masturbated
    until a few years ago when she was made love to by a man who
    used to kiss her etc although she did not respond to these
    advances she was thrown into a state of restless sexual
    excitement on one occasion when in bed in this restless state
    she accidentally found on passing her hand over her body that
    by playing with a round thing clitoris a pleasurable feeling
    was produced she found herself greatly relieved and quieted by
    these manipulations though there remained a feeling of tiredness
    afterward she has sometimes masturbated six times in a night
    especially before and after the menstrual period until she was
    unable to produce the orgasm or any feeling of pleasure
    observation iiunmarried aged 45 of rather nervous
    temperament she has for many years been accustomed usually
    about a week before the appearance of the menses to obtain
    sexual relief by kicking out her legs when lying down in this
    way she says she obtains complete satisfaction she never
    touches herself on the following day she frequently has pains
    over the lower part of the abdomen such pains being apparently
    muscular and due to the exertion
    observation iiiaged 29 recently married belonging to a
    neurotic and morbid family herself healthy and living usually
    in the country vivacious passionate enthusiastic
    intellectual and taking a prominent part in philanthropic
    schemes and municipal affairs at the same time fond of society
    and very attractive to men for many years she had been
    accustomed to excite herself though she felt it was not good for
    her the habit was merely practiced faute de mieux i used to
    sit on the edge of the bed sometimes she said and it came
    over me so strongly that i simply couldnt resist it i felt that
    i should go mad and i thought it was better to touch myself than
    be insane i used to press my clitoris in it made me very
    tired afterwardnot like being with my husband the confession
    was made from a conviction of the importance of the subject and
    with the hope that some way might be found out of the
    difficulties which so often beset women
    observation ivunmarried aged 27 possesses much force of
    character and high intelligence is actively engaged in a
    professional career as a child of seven or eight she began to
    experience what she describes as lightninglike sensations
    mere vague uneasy feelings or momentary twitches which took
    place alike in the vulva or the vagina or the uterus not
    amounting to an orgasm and nothing like it these sensations
    it should be added have continued into adult life i always
    experience them just before menstruation and afterward for a few
    days and occasionally though it seems to me not so often
    during the period itself i may have the sensation four or five
    times during the day it is not dependent at all upon external
    impressions or my own thoughts and is sometimes absent for days
    together it is just one flash as if you would snap your
    fingers and it is over
    as a child she was of course quite unconscious that there was
    anything sexual in these sensations they were then usually
    associated with various imaginary scenes the one usually
    indulged in was that a black bear was waiting for her up in a
    tree and that she was slowly raised up toward the bear by means
    of ropes and then lowered again and raised feeling afraid of
    being caught by the bear and yet having a morbid desire to be
    caught in after years she realized that there was a physical
    sexual cause underlying these imaginations and that what she
    liked was a feeling of resistance to the bear giving rise to the
    physical sensation
    at a somewhat later age though while still a child she
    cherished an ideal passion for a person very much older than
    herself this passion absorbing her thoughts for a period of two
    years during which however there was no progress made in
    physical sensation it was when she was nearly thirteen years of
    age soon after the appearance of menstruation and under the
    influence of this ideal passion that she first learned to
    experience conscious orgasm which was not associated with the
    thought of any person i did not associate it with anything high
    or beautiful owing to the fact that i had imbibed our current
    ideas in regard to sexual feelings and viewed them in a very
    poor light indeed she considers that her sexual feelings were
    stronger at this period than at any other time in her life she
    could however often deny herself physical satisfaction for
    weeks at a time in order that she might not feel unworthy of the
    object of her ideal passion as for the sexual satisfaction
    she writes it was experimental i had heard older girls speak
    of the pleasure of such feelings but i was not taught anything
    by example or otherwise i merely rubbed myself with the
    washrag while bathing waiting for a result and having the same
    peculiar feeling i had so often experienced i am not aware of
    any ill effects having resulted but i felt degraded and tried
    hard to overcome the habit no one had spoken to me of the habit
    but from the secrecy of grown people and passages i had heard
    from the bible i conceived the idea that it was a reprehensible
    practice and while this did not curb my desire it taught me
    selfcontrol and i vowed that each time should be the last i
    was often able to keep the resolution for two or three weeks
    some four years later she gradually succeeded in breaking herself
    of the practice in so far as it had become a habit she has
    however acquired a fuller knowledge of sexual matters and
    though she has still a great dread of masturbation as a vice she
    does not hesitate to relieve her physical feelings when it seems
    best to her to do so i am usually able to direct my thoughts
    from these sensations she writes but if they seem to make me
    irritable or wakeful i relieve myself it is a physical act
    unassociated with deep feeling of any kind i have always felt
    that it was a rather unpleasant compromise with my physical
    nature but certainly necessary in my case yet i have abstained
    from gratification for very long periods if the feeling is not
    strong at the menstrual period i go on very well without either
    the sensation or the gratification until the next period and
    strange as it may seem the best antidote i have found and the
    best preventive is to think about spiritual things or someone
    whom i love it is simply a matter of training i supposea
    sort of mental gymnasticswhich draws the attention away from
    the physical feelings this lady has never had any sexual
    relationships and since she is ambitious and believes that the
    sexual emotions may be transformed so as to become a source of
    motive power throughout the whole of life she wishes to avoid
    such relationships
    observation vunmarried aged 31 in good health with
    however a somewhat hysterical excess of energy when i was
    about 26 years of age she writes a friend came to me with the
    confession that for several years she had masturbated and had
    become such a slave to the habit that she severely suffered from
    its ill effects at that time i had never heard of selfabuse by
    women i listened to her story with much sympathy and interest
    but some skepticism and determined to try experiments upon
    myself with the idea of getting to understand the matter in
    order to assist my friend after some manipulation i succeeded
    in awakening what had before been unconscious and unknown i
    purposely allowed the habit to grow upon me and one nightfor i
    always operated upon myself before going to sleep never in the
    morningi obtained considerable pleasurable satisfaction but
    the following day my conscience awoke i also felt pain located
    at the back of my head and down the spinal column i ceased my
    operations for a time and then began again somewhat regularly
    once a month a few days after menstruation during those months
    in which i exercised moderation i think i obtained much local
    relief with comparatively little injury but later on finding
    myself in robust health i increased my experiments the habit
    grew upon me and it was only with an almost superhuman effort
    that i broke myself free needless to say that i gave no
    assistance to my suffering friend nor did i ever refer to the
    subject after her confession to me
    some two years later i heard of sexual practices between women
    as a frequent habit in certain quarters i again interested
    myself in masturbation for i had been told something that led me
    to believe that there was much more for me to discover not
    knowing the most elementary physiology i questioned some of my
    friends and then commenced again i restricted myself to relief
    from local congestion and irritation by calling forth the
    emission of mucus rather than by seeking pleasure at the same
    time i sought to discover what manipulation of the clitoris
    would lead to the habit grew upon me with startling rapidity
    and i became more or less its slave but i suffered from no very
    great ill effects until i started in search of more discoveries
    i found that i was a complete ignoramus as to the formation of a
    womans body and by experiments upon myself sought to discover
    the vagina i continued my operations until i obtained an
    entrance i think the rough handling of myself during this final
    stage disturbed my nervous system and caused me considerable
    pain and exhaustion at the back of my head the spinal column
    the back of my eyes and a general feeling of languor etc
    i could not bear to be the slave of a habit and after much
    suffering and efforts which only led to falls to lower depths of
    conscious failure my better self rebelled until by a great
    effort and much prayer i kept myself pure for a whole week this
    partial recovery gave me hope but then i again fell a victim to
    the habit much to my chagrin and became hopeless of ever
    retracing my steps toward my ideal of virtue for some days i
    lost energy spirit and hope my nervous system appeared to be
    ruined but i did not really despair of victory in the end i
    thought of all the drunkards chained by their intemperate habits
    of inveterate smokers who could not exist without tobacco and of
    all the various methods by which men were slaves and the longing
    to be freed of what had in my case proved to be a painful and
    unnecessary habit increased daily until after one night when i
    struggled with myself for hours i believed i had finally
    succeeded
    at times when i reached a high degree of sexual excitement i
    felt that i was at least one step removed from those of morbid
    and repressed sex who had not the slightest suspicion of the
    latent joys of womanhood within them for a little while the
    habit took the shape of an exalted passion but i rapidly tired
    it out by rough thoughtless and too impatient handling
    revulsion set in with the pain of an exhausted and badly used
    nervous system and finding myself the slave of a passion i
    determined to endeavor to be its master
    in conclusion i should say that masturbation has proved itself
    to be to me one of the blind turnings of my lifes history from
    which i have gained much valuable experience
    the practice was however by no means thus dismissed some time
    later the subject writes i have again restarted masturbation
    for the relief of localized feelings one morning i was engaged
    in reading a very heavy volume which for convenience sake i
    held in my lap leaning back on my chair i had become deep in
    my study for an hour or so when i became aware of certain
    feelings roused by the weight of the book being tempted to see
    what would happen by such conduct i shifted so that the edge of
    the volume came in closer contact the pleasurable feelings
    increased so i gave myself up to my emotions for some thirty
    minutes
    notwithstanding the intense pleasure i enjoyed for so long a
    period i maintain that it is wiser to refrain and although i
    admit in the same breath that by gentle treatment such pleasure
    may be harmless to the general health it does lead to a desire
    for solitude which is not conducive to a happy frame of mind
    there is an accompanying reticence of speech concerning the
    pleasure which therefore appears to be unnatural like the
    eating of stolen fruit after such an event one seems to require
    to fly to the woods and to listen to the song of the birds so
    as to shake off aftereffects
    in a letter dated some months later she writes i think i have
    risen above the masturbation habit in the same letter the
    writer remarks if i had consciously abnormal or unsatisfied
    appetites i would satisfy them in the easiest and least harmful
    way
    again eighteen months later she writes it is curious to note
    that for months this habit is forgotten but awakens sometimes to
    selfassertion if a feeling of pressure is felt in the head and
    a slight irritation elsewhere and experience shows that the time
    has come for pacification exquisite pleasure can be enjoyed
    never more than twice a month and sometimes less often
    observation viunmarried actively engaged in the practice of
    her profession welldeveloped feminine in contour but boyish
    in manner and movements strong though muscles small and
    healthy with sound nervous system never had anmia thick brown
    hair pubic hair thick and hair on toes and legs up to
    umbilicus it began to appear at the age of 10 before pubic
    hair and continued until 18 a few stray hairs round nipples
    and much dark down on upper lip as well as light down on arms
    and hands hips normal nates small labia minora large and
    clitoris deeply hooded hymen thick vagina probably small
    considerable pigmentation of parts menstruation began at 15 but
    not regular till 17 is painless and scanty the better the state
    of health the less it is no change of sexual or other feelings
    connected with it it lasts one to three days
    i believe she writes my first experience of physical sex
    sensations was when i was about 16 and in sleep but i did not
    then recognize it and seldom indeed gave the subject of sex a
    thought i was a child far beyond the age of childhood the
    accompanying dreams were disagreeable but i cannot remember what
    they were about it was not until i was nearly 19 that i knew the
    sexual orgasm in my waking state it surprised me completely
    but i knew that i had known it before in my sleep
    the knowledge came one summer when i was leading a rather
    isolated life and my mind was far from sex subjects being deep
    in books carlyle ruskin huxley darwin scott etc i noticed
    that when i got up in the morning i felt very hot and
    uncomfortable the clitoris and the parts around were swollen and
    erect and often tender and painful i had no idea what it was
    but found i was unable to pass my water for an hour or two one
    day when i was straining a little to pass water the full orgasm
    occurred the next time it happened i tried to check it by
    holding myself firmly of course with the opposite result i do
    not know that i found it highly pleasurable but it was a very
    great relief i allowed myself a good many experiments to come
    to a conclusion in the matter and i thought about it i was much
    too shy to speak to any one and thought it was probably a sin i
    tried not to do it and not to think about it saying to myself
    that surely i was lord of my body but i found that the matter
    was not entirely under my control however unwilling or passive i
    might be there were times when the involuntary discomfort was
    not in my keeping my touching myself or not did not save me from
    it because it sometimes gave me pleasure i thought it might be
    a form of selfindulgence and did not do it until it could
    scarcely be helped soon the orgasm began to occur fairly
    frequently in my sleep perhaps once or twice a week i had no
    erotic dreams then or at any other time but i had nights of
    restless sleep and woke as it occurred dreaming that it was
    happening as in fact it was at times i hardly awoke but went
    to sleep again in a moment i continued for two or three years to
    be sorely tried by day at frequent intervals i acquired a
    remarkable degree of control so that though one touch or
    steadily directed thought would have caused the orgasm i could
    keep it off and go to sleep without wrong doing of course
    when i fell asleep my control ended all this gave me a good
    deal of physical worry and kept my attention unwillingly fixed
    upon the matter i do not think my body was readily irritable
    but i had unquestionably very strong sexual impulses
    after a year or two when i was working hard i could not afford
    the attention the control cost me or the prolonged mitigated
    sexual excitement it caused i took drugs for a time but they
    lost effect produced lassitude and agreed with me badly i
    therefore put away my scruples and determined to try the effect
    of giving myself an instant and businesslike relief instead of
    allowing my feelings to gather strength i satisfied them out of
    hand instead of five hours of heat and discomfort i did not
    allow myself five minutes if i could help it
    the effect was marvelous i practically had no more trouble the
    thing rarely came to me at all by day and though it continued at
    times by night it became less frequent and less strong often it
    did not wake me the erotic images and speculations that had
    begun to come to me died down i left off being afraid of my
    feelings or indeed thinking about them i may say that i had
    decided that i should be obliged to lead a single life and that
    the less i thought about matters of sex the more easy i should
    find life later on i had religious ideas which helped me
    considerably in my ideals of a decent orderly selfcontained
    life i do not lay stress on these they were not at all
    emotional and my physical and psychical development do not
    appear to have run much on parallel lines i had a strong moral
    sense before i had a religious one and a commonsense which i
    perhaps trusted more than either
    when i was about 28 i thought i might perhaps leave off the
    habit of regular relief i had got into it was not regular as
    regards time being anything from one day to six weeks the
    change was probably made easier by a severe illness i had had i
    gave this abstinence a fair trial for several years until i was
    about 34 but my nocturnal manifestations certainly gathered
    strength especially when i got much better in health and
    finally as at puberty began to worry my waking life i reasoned
    that by my attempt at abstinence i had only exchanged control for
    uncontrol and reverted to my old habits of relief with the same
    good results as before the whole trouble subsided and i got
    better at once the orgasm during sleep continued and occurs
    about once a fortnight it is increased by change of air
    especially at the seaside when it may occur on two or three
    nights running i decided that for the proper control of my
    single life relief was normal and right it would be very
    difficult for anyone to demonstrate the contrary to me my aim
    has always been to keep myself in the best condition of physical
    and mental balance that a single person is capable of
there is some interest in briefly reviewing the remarkable transformations
in the attitude toward masturbation from greek times down to our own day
the greeks treated masturbation with little opprobrium at the worst they
regarded it as unmanly and aristophanes in various passages connects
the practice with women children slaves and feeble old men schines
seems to have publicly brought it as a charge against demosthenes that he
had practiced masturbation though on the other hand plutarch tells us
that diogenesdescribed by zeller the historian of greek philosophy as
the most typical figure of ancient greecewas praised by chrysippus
the famous philosopher for masturbating in the marketplace the more
strenuous romans at all events as exemplified by juvenal and martial
condemned masturbation more vigorously347 aretus without alluding to
masturbation dwells on the tonic effects of retaining the semen but on
the other hand galen regarded the retention of semen as injurious and
advocated its frequent expulsion a point of view which tended to justify
masturbation in classical days doubtless masturbation and all other
forms of the autoerotic impulse were comparatively rare so much scope
was allowed in early adult age for homosexual and later for heterosexual
relationships that any excessive or morbid development of solitary
selfindulgence could seldom occur the case was altered when christian
ideals became prominent christian morality strongly proscribed sexual
relationships except under certain specified conditions it is true that
christianity discouraged all sexual manifestations and that therefore its
ban fell equally on masturbation but obviously masturbation lay at the
weakest line of defence against the assaults of the flesh it was there
that resistance would most readily yield christianity thus probably led
to a considerable increase of masturbation the attention which the
theologians devoted to its manifestations clearly bears witness to their
magnitude it is noteworthy that mohammedan theologians regarded
masturbation as a christian vice in islam both doctrine and practice
tended to encourage sexual relationships and not much attention was paid
to masturbation nor even any severe reprobation directed against it omer
haleby remarks that certain theologians of islam are inclined to consider
the practice of masturbation in vogue among christians as allowable to
devout mussulmans when alone on a journey he himself regards this as a
practice good neither for soul nor body seminal emissions during sleep
providing all necessary relief should however a mussulman fall into
this error god is merciful348
    in theodores penitential of the seventh century forty days
    penance is prescribed for masturbation aquinas condemned
    masturbation as worse than fornication though less heinous than
    other sexual offences against nature in opposition also to
    those who believed that distillatio usually takes place without
    pleasure he observed that it was often caused by sexual emotion
    and should therefore always be mentioned to the confessor
    liguori also regarded masturbation as a graver sin than
    fornication and even said that distillatio if voluntary and
    with notable physical commotion is without doubt a mortal sin
    for in such a case it is the beginning of a pollution on the
    other hand some theologians have thought that distillatio may
    be permitted even if there is some commotion so long as it has
    not been voluntarily procured and caramuel who has been
    described as a theological enfant terrible declared that
    natural law does not forbid masturbation but that proposition
    was condemned by innocent xi the most enlightened modern
    catholic view is probably represented by debreyne who after
    remarking that he has known pious and intelligent persons who had
    an irresistible impulse to masturbate continues must we
    excuse or condemn these people neither the one nor the other
    if you condemn and repulse absolutely these persons as altogether
    guilty against their own convictions you will perhaps throw
    them into despair if on the contrary you completely excuse
    them you maintain them in a disorder from which they may
    perhaps never emerge adopt a wise middle course and perhaps
    with gods aid you may often cure them
    under certain circumstances some catholic theologians have
    permitted a married woman to masturbate thus the jesuit
    theologian gury asserts that the wife does not sin qu se
    ipsam tactibus excitat ad seminationem statim post copulam in qu
    vir solus seminavit this teaching seems to have been
    misunderstood since ethical and even medical writers have
    expended a certain amount of moral indignation on the church
    whose theologians committed themselves to this statement as a
    matter of fact this qualified permission to masturbate merely
    rests on a false theory of procreation which is clearly
    expressed in the word seminatio it was believed that
    ejaculation in the woman is as necessary to fecundation as
    ejaculation in the man galen avicenna and aquinas recognized
    indeed that such feminine semination was not necessary sanchez
    however was doubtful while suarez and zacchia following
    hippocrates regarded it as necessary as sexual intercourse
    without fecundation is not approved by the catholic church it
    thus became logically necessary to permit women to masturbate
    whenever the ejaculation of mucus had not occurred at or before
    coitus
    the belief that the emission of vaginal mucus under the
    influence of sexual excitement in women corresponded to
    spermatic emission has led to the practice of masturbation on
    hygienic grounds garnier clibat p 255 mentions that
    mesu in the eighteenth century invented a special pessary to
    take the place of the penis and as he stated effect the due
    expulsion of the feminine sperm
protestantism no doubt in the main accepted the general catholic
tradition but the tendency of protestantism in reaction against the
minute inquisition of the earlier theologians has always been to exercise
a certain degree of what it regarded as wholesome indifference toward the
less obvious manifestations of the flesh thus in protestant countries
masturbation seems to have been almost ignored until tissot combining
with his reputation as a physician the fanaticism of a devout believer
raised masturbation to the position of a colossal bogy which during a
hundred years has not only had an unfortunate influence on medical opinion
in these matters but has been productive of incalculable harm to ignorant
youth and tender consciences during the past forty years the efforts of
many distinguished physiciansa few of whose opinions i have already
quotedhave gradually dragged the bogy down from its pedestal and now
as i have ventured to suggest there is a tendency for the reaction to be
excessive there is even a tendency today to regard masturbation with
various qualifications as normal remy de gourmont for instance
considers that masturbation is natural because it is the method by which
fishes procreate all things considered it must be accepted that
masturbation is part of the doings of nature a different conclusion might
be agreeable but in every ocean and under the reeds of every river
myriads of beings would protest349 tillier remarks that since
masturbation appears to be universal among the higher animals we are not
entitled to regard it as a vice it has only been so considered because
studied exclusively by physicians under abnormal conditions350 hirth
while asserting that masturbation must be strongly repressed in the young
regards it as a desirable method of relief for adults and especially
under some circumstances for women351 venturi a wellknown italian
alienist on the other hand regards masturbation as strictly
physiological in youth it is the normal and natural passage toward the
generous and healthy passion of early manhood it only becomes abnormal
and vicious he holds when continued into adult life
    the appearance of masturbation at puberty venturi considers is
    a moment in the course of the development of the function of that
    organ which is the necessary instrument of sexuality it finds
    its motive in the satisfaction of an organic need having much
    analogy with that which arises from the tickling of a very
    sensitive cutaneous surface in this masturbation of early
    adolescence lies according to venturi the germ of what will
    later be love a pleasure of the body and of the spirit
    following the relief of a satisfied need as the youth develops
    onanism becomes a sexual act comparable to coitus as a dream is
    comparable to reality imagery forming in correspondence with the
    desires in its fully developed form in adolescence venturi
    continues masturbation has an almost hallucinatory character
    onanism at this period psychically approximates to the true
    sexual act and passes insensibly into it if however continued
    on into adult age it becomes morbid passing into erotic
    fetichism what in the inexperienced youth is the natural
    auxiliary and stimulus to imagination in the degenerate onanist
    of adult age is a sign of arrested development thus onanism
    the author concludes is not always a vice such as is fiercely
    combated by educators and moralists it is the natural transition
    by which we reach the warm and generous love of youth and in
    natural succession to this the tranquil positive matrimonial
    love of the mature man silvio venturi le degenerazioni
    psicosessuale 1892 pp 69
    it may be questioned whether this view is acceptable even for the
    warm climate of the south of europe where the impulses of
    sexuality are undoubtedly precocious it is certainly not in
    harmony with general experience and opinion in the north this is
    well expressed in the following passage by edward carpenter
    international journal of ethics july 1899 after all
    purity in the sense of continence is of the first importance
    to boyhood to prolong the period of continence in a boys life
    is to prolong the period of growth this is a simple
    physiological law and a very obvious one and whatever other
    things may be said in favor of purity it remains perhaps the
    most weighty to introduce sensual and sexual habitsand one of
    the worst of them is selfabuseat an early age is to arrest
    growth both physical and mental and what is even more it means
    to arrest the capacity for affection all experience shows that
    the early outlet toward sex cheapens and weakens affectional
    capacity
i do not consider that we can decide the precise degree in which
masturbation may fairly be called normal so long as we take masturbation
by itself we are thus in conclusion brought back to the point which i
sought to emphasize at the outset masturbation belongs to a group of
autoerotic phenomena from one point of view it may be said that all
autoerotic phenomena are unnatural since the natural aim of the sexual
impulse is sexual conjunction and all exercise of that impulse outside
such conjunction is away from the end of nature but we do not live in a
state of nature which answers to such demands all our life is
unnatural and as soon as we begin to restrain the free play of sexual
impulse toward sexual ends at once autoerotic phenomena inevitably
spring up on every side there is no end to them it is impossible to say
what finest elements in art in morals in civilization generally may not
really be rooted in an autoerotic impulse without a certain overheating
of the sexual system said nietzsche we could not have a raphael
autoerotic phenomena are inevitable it is our wisest course to recognize
this inevitableness of sexual and transmuted sexual manifestations under
the perpetual restraints of civilized life and while avoiding any
attitude of excessive indulgence or indifference352 to avoid also any
attitude of excessive horror for our horror not only leads to the facts
being effectually veiled from our sight but itself serves to manufacture
artificially a greater evil than that which we seek to combat
the sexual impulse is not as some have imagined the sole root of the
most massive human emotions the most brilliant human aptitudesof
sympathy of art of religion in the complex human organism where all
the parts are so manyfibred and so closely interwoven no great
manifestation can be reduced to one single source but it largely enters
into and molds all of these emotions and aptitudes and that by virtue of
its two most peculiar characteristics it is in the first place the
deepest and most volcanic of human impulses and in the second
placeunlike the only other human impulse with which it can be compared
the nutritive impulseit can to a large extent be transmuted into a
new force capable of the strangest and most various uses so that in the
presence of all these manifestations we may assert that in a real sense
though subtly mingled with very diverse elements autoerotism everywhere
plays its part in the phenomena of autoerotism when we take a broad
view of those phenomena we are concerned not with a form of insanity
not necessarily with a form of depravity but with the inevitable
byproducts of that mighty process on which the animal creation rests

307 this is no doubt the most common opinion and it is frequently
repeated in textbooks it is scarcely necessary however to point out
that only the opinions of those who have given special attention to the
matter can carry any weight rw shufeldt on a case of female
impotency pp 57 quotes the opinions of various cautious observers as
to the difficulty of detecting masturbation in women
308 this latter opinion is confirmed by ncke so far as the insane are
concerned in a careful study of sexual perversity in a large asylum
ncke found that while moderate masturbation could be more easily traced
among men than among women excessive masturbation was more common among
women and while among the men masturbation was most frequent in the
lowest grades of mental development idiocy and imbecility and least
frequent in the highest grades general paralysis in the women it was

311 in many cases of course the physical precocity is associated with
precocity in sexual habits an instructive case is reported alienist and
neurologist october 1895 of a girl of 7 a beautiful child of healthy
family and very intelligent who from the age of three was perpetually
masturbating when not watched the clitoris and mons veneris were those
of a fullygrown woman and the child was as well informed upon most
subjects as an average woman she was cured by care and hygienic
attention and when seen last was in excellent condition a medical friend
tells me of a little girl of two whose external genital organs are
greatly developed and who is always rubbing herself
312 rt morris of new york has also pointed out the influence of
traditions in this respect among boys he remarks there are
traditions to the effect that selfabuse is harmful among girls however
there are no such saving traditions dr kiernan writes in a private
letter it has been by experience that from ignorance or otherwise
there are young women who do not look upon sexual manipulation with the
same fear that men do guttceit similarly remarks that men have been
warned of masturbation and fear its evil results while girls even if
warned attach little importance to the warning he adds that in healthy
women masturbation even in excess has little bad results the attitude
of many women in this matter may be illustrated by the following passage
from a letter written by a medical friend in india the other day one of
my english women patients gave me the following reason for having taught
the 17yearold daughter of a retired colonel to masturbate poor girl
she was troubled with dreams of men and in case she should be tempted
with one and become pregnant i taught her to bring the feeling on
herselfas it is safer and after all nearly as nice as with a man

337 the surgeons it may be remarked have especially stated the
harmlessness of masturbation in too absolute a manner thus john hunter
treatise on the venereal disease 1786 p 200 after pointing out
that the books on this subject have done more harm than good adds i
think i may affirm that this act does less harm to the constitution in
general than the natural and sir james paget in his lecture on sexual
hypochondriasis said masturbation does neither more nor less harm than
sexual intercourse practiced with the same frequency in the same
conditions of general health and age and circumstances
338 it is interesting to note that an analogous result seems to hold
with animals among highlybred horses excessive masturbation is liable to
occur with injurious results it is scarcely necessary to point out that
highlybred horses are apt to be abnormal
339 with regard to the physical signs the same conclusion is reached by
legludic in opposition to martineau on the basis of a large experience
he has repeatedly found in young girls who acknowledged frequent
masturbation that the organs were perfectly healthy and normal and his
convictions are the more noteworthy since he speaks as a pupil of
tardieu who attached very grave significance to the local signs of sexual

american journal of insanity april 1895 p 479 bachterew denies
that masturbation produces enlargement of the penis and hammond considers
there is no evidence to show that it enlarges the clitoris while guttceit
states that it does not enlarge the nymph this however is doubtful it
would not suffice in many cases to show that large sexual organs are
correlated with masturbation it would still be necessary to show whether
the size of the organs stood to masturbation in the relation of effect or
of cause
340 thus bechterew la phobie du regard archives de neurologie
july 1905 considers that masturbation plays a large part in producing
the morbid fear of the eyes of others
341 it is especially an undesirable tendency of masturbation that it
deadens the need for affection and merely eludes instead of satisfying
the sexual impulse masturbation as godfrey well says the science of
sex p 178 though a manifestation of sexual activity is not a sexual
act in the higher or even in the real fundamental sense for sex implies
duality a characteristic to which masturbation can plainly lay no claim
the physical moral and mental reciprocity which gives stability and
beauty to a normal sexual intimacy are as foreign to the masturbator as
to the celibate in a sense therefore masturbation is as complete a
negative of the sexual life as chastity itself it is therefore an
evasion of not an answer to the sexual problem and it will ever remain
so no matter how surely we may be convinced of its physical
harmlessness

somewhat similar he distinguishes onanie par impulsion occurring in
mental degeneration and in persons of inferior intelligence from onanie

conclusion has sought to find its precise mechanism in the
bloodpressure as the sexual act produces lower and falling
bloodpressure he remarks it will of necessity relieve conditions
which are due to high and rising bloodpressure such for instance as
mental depression and bad temper and unless my observation deceives me
we have here a connection between conditions of high bloodpressure with
mental and bodily depression and acts of masturbation for this act will
relieve these conditions and tend to be practiced for this purpose

appendix a
the influence of menstruation on the position of women
a question of historical psychology which so far as i know has never
been fully investigated is the influence of menstruation in constituting
the emotional atmosphere through which men habitually view women353 i
do not purpose to deal fully with this question because it is one which
may be more properly dealt with at length by the student of culture and by
the historian rather than from the standpoint of empirical psychology it
is moreover a question full of complexities in regard to which it is
impossible to speak with certainty but we here strike on a factor of such
importance such neglected importance for the proper understanding of the
sexual relations of men and women that it cannot be wholly ignored
among the negroes of surinam a woman must live in solitude during the time
of her period it is dangerous for any man or woman to approach her and
when she sees a person coming near she cries out anxiously mi kay mi
kayi am unclean i am unclean throughout the world we find traces of
the custom of which this is a typical example but we must not too hastily
assume that this custom is evidence of the inferior position occupied by
semicivilized women it is necessary to take a broad view not only of
the beliefs of semicivilized man regarding menstruation but of his
general beliefs regarding the supernatural forces of the world
there is no fragment of folklore so familiar to the european world as
that which connects woman with the serpent it is indeed one of the
foundation stones of christian theology354 yet there is no fragment of
folklore which remains more obscure how has it happened that in all
parts of the world the snake or his congeners the lizard and the
crocodile have been credited with some design sinister or erotic on
women
of the wide prevalence of the belief there can be no doubt among the port
lincoln tribe of south australia a lizard is said to have divided man from
woman355 among the chiriguanos of bolivia on the appearance of
menstruation old women ran about with sticks to hunt the snake that had
wounded the girl frazer who quotes this example from the lettres
difiantes et curieuses also refers to a modern greek folktale
according to which a princess at puberty must not let the sun shine upon
her or she would be turned into a lizard356 the lizard was a sexual
symbol among the mexicans in some parts of brazil at the onset of puberty
a girl must not go into the woods for fear of the amorous attacks of
snakes and so it is also among the macusi indians of british guiana
according to schomburgk among the basutos of south africa the young girls
must dance around the clay image of a snake in polynesian mythology the
lizard is a very sacred animal and legends represent women as often
giving birth to lizards357 at a widely remote spot in bengal if you
dream of a snake a child will be born to you reports sarat chandra
mitra358 in the berlin museum fr volkerkunde there is a carved wooden
figure from new guinea of a woman into whose vulva a crocodile is
inserting its snout while the same museum contains another figure of a
snakelike crocodile crawling out of a womans vulva and a third figure
shows a small round snake with a small head and closely resembling a
penis at the mouth of the vagina all these figures are reproduced by
ploss and bartels even in modern europe the same ideas prevail in
portugal according to reys it is believed that during menstruation women
are liable to be bitten by lizards and to guard against this risk they
wear drawers during the period in germany again it was believed up to
the eighteenth century at least that the hair of a menstruating woman if
buried would turn into a snake it may be added that in various parts of
the world virgin priestesses are dedicated to a snakegod and are married
to the god359 at rome it is interesting to note the serpent was the
symbol of fecundation and as such often figures at pompeii as the genius
patrisfamilias the generative power of the family360 in rabbinical
tradition also the serpent is the symbol of sexual desire
there can be no doubt thatas ploss and bartels from whom some of these
examples have been taken point outin widely different parts of the
world menstruation is believed to have been originally caused by a snake
and that this conception is frequently associated with an erotic and
mystic idea361 how the connection arose ploss and bartels are unable to
say it can only be suggested that its shape and appearance as well as
its venomous nature may have contributed to the mystery everywhere
associated with the snakea mystery itself fortified by the association
with womento build up this worldwide belief regarding the origin of
menstruation
this primitive theory of the origin of menstruation probably brings before
us in its earliest shape the special and intimate bond which has ever been
held to connect women by virtue of the menstrual process with the
natural or supernatural powers of the world everywhere menstruating women
are supposed to be possessed by spirits and charged with mysterious
forces it is at this point that a serious misconception due to ignorance
of primitive religious ideas has constantly intruded it is stated that
the menstruating woman is unclean and possessed by an evil spirit as a
matter of fact however the savage rarely discriminates between bad and
good spirits every spirit may have either a beneficial or malignant
influence an interesting instance of this is given in colensos maori
lexicon as illustrated by the meaning of the maori word atua
the importance of recognizing the special sense in which the word
unclean is used in this connection was clearly pointed out by robertson
smith in the case of the semites the hebrew word tame unclean he
remarked is not the ordinary word for things physically foul it is a
ritual term and corresponds exactly to the idea of taboo the ideas
unclean and holy seem to us to stand in polar opposition to one
another but it was not so with the semites among the later jews the holy
books defiled the hands of the reader as contact with an impure thing
did among lucians syrians the dove was so holy that he who touched it
was unclean for a day and the taboo attaching to the swine was
explained by some and beyond question correctly explained in the same
way among the heathen semites362 therefore unclean animals which it
was pollution to eat were simply holy animals robertson smith here
made no reference to menstruation but he exactly described the primitive
attitude toward menstruation wellhausen however dealing with the early
arabians expressly mentions that in preislamic days clean and
unclean were used solely with reference to women in and out of the
menstrual state at a later date frazer developed this aspect of the
conception of taboo and showed how it occurs among savage races
generally he pointed out that the conceptions of holiness and pollution
not having yet been differentiated women at childbirth and during
menstruation are on the same level as divine kings chiefs and priests
and must observe the same rules of ceremonial purity to seclude such
persons from the rest of the world so that the dreaded spiritual danger
shall not spread is the object of the taboo which frazer compares to an
electrical insulator to preserve the spiritual force with which these
persons are charged from suffering or inflicting harm by contact with the
outer world after describing the phenomena especially the prohibition
to touch the ground or see the sun found among various races frazer
concludes the object of secluding women at menstruation is to neutralize
the dangerous influences which are supposed to emanate from them at such
times the general effect of these rules is to keep the girl suspended so
to say between heaven and earth whether enveloped in her hammock and
slung up to the roof as in south america or elevated above the ground in
a dark and narrow cage as in new zealand she may be considered to be out
of the way of doing mischief since being shut off both from the earth
and from the sun she can poison neither of these great sources of life by
her deadly contagion the precautions thus taken to isolate or insulate
the girl are dictated by regard for her own safety as well as for the
safety of others in short the girl is viewed as charged with a
powerful force which if not kept within bounds may prove the destruction
both of the girl herself and of all with whom she comes in contact to
repress this force within the limits necessary for the safety of all
concerned is the object of the taboos in question the same explanation
applies to the observance of the same rules by divine kings and priests
the uncleanliness as it is called of girls at puberty and the sanctity
of holy men do not to the primitive mind differ from each other they
are only different manifestations of the same supernatural energy which
like energy in general is in itself neither good nor bad but becomes
beneficent or malignant according to its application363
more recently this view of the matter has been further extended by the
distinguished french sociologist durkheim investigating the origins of
the prohibition of incest and arguing that it proceeds from the custom of
exogamy or marriage outside the clan and that this rests on certain
ideas about blood which again are traceable to totemisma theory
which we need not here discussdurkheim is brought face to face with the
group of conceptions that now concern us he insists on the extreme
ambiguity found in primitive culture concerning the notion of the divine
and the close connection between aversion and veneration and points out
that it is not only at puberty and each recurrence of the menstrual epoch
that women have aroused these emotions but also at childbirth a
sentiment of religious horror he continues which can reach such a
degree of intensity which can be called forth by so many circumstances
and reappears regularly every month to last for a week at least cannot
fail to extend its influence beyond the periods to which it was originally
confined and to affect the whole course of life a being who must be
secluded or avoided for weeks months or years preserves something of the
characteristics to which the isolation was due even outside those special
periods and in fact in these communities the separation of the sexes
is not merely intermittent it has become chronic the two elements of the
population live separately durkheim proceeds to argue that the origin of
the occult powers attributed to the feminine organism is to be found in
primitive ideas concerning blood not only menstrual blood but any kind of
blood is the object of such feelings among savage and barbarous peoples
all sorts of precautions must be observed with regard to blood in it
resides a divine principle or as romans jews and arabs believed life
itself the prohibition to drink wine the blood of the grape found among
some peoples is traced to its resemblance to blood and to its
sacrificial employment as among the ancient arabians and still in the
christian sacrament as a substitute for drinking blood throughout blood
is generally taboo and it taboos everything that comes in contact with
it now woman is chronically the theatre of bloody manifestations and
therefore she tends to become chronically taboo for the other members of
the community a more or less conscious anxiety a certain religious
fear cannot fail to enter into all the relations of her companions with
her and that is why all such relations are reduced to a minimum
relations of a sexual character are specially excluded in the first
place such relations are so intimate that they are incompatible with the
sort of repulsion which the sexes must experience for each other the
barrier between them does not permit of such a close union in the second
place the organs of the body here specially concerned are precisely the
source of the dreaded manifestations thus it is natural that the feelings
of aversion inspired by women attain their greatest intensity at this
point thus it is also that of all parts of the feminine organization it
is this region which is most severely shut out from commerce so that
while the primitive emotion is mainly one of veneration and is allied to
that experienced for kings and priests there is an element of fear in
such veneration and what men fear is to some extent odious to them364
these conceptions necessarily mingled at a very early period with mens
ideas of sexual intercourse with women and especially with menstruating
women contact with women as crawley shows by abundant illustration is
dangerous in any case indeed the same ideas being transferred to women
also coitus produces weakness and it prevents the acquisition of
supernatural powers thus among the western tribes of canada boas
states only a youth who has never touched a woman or a virgin both
being called te e its can become shamans after having had sexual
intercourse men as well as women become t ke el ie weak
incapable of gaining supernatural powers the faculty cannot be regained
by subsequent fasting and abstinence365 the mysterious effects of
sexual intercourse in general are intensified in the case of intercourse
with a menstruating woman thus the ancient indian legislator declares
that the wisdom the energy the strength the sight and the vitality of
a man who approaches a woman covered with menstrual excretions utterly
perish366 it will be seen that these ideas are impartially spread over
the most widely separated parts of the globe they equally affected the
christian church and the penitentials ordained forty or fifty days
penance for sexual intercourse during menstruation
yet the twofold influence of the menstruating woman remains clear when we
review the whole group of influences which in this state she is supposed
to exert she by no means acts only by paralyzing social activities and
destroying the powers of life by causing flowers to fade fruit to fall
from the trees grains to lose their germinative power and grafts to die
she is not accurately summed up in the old lines
    oh menstruating woman thourt a fiend
    from whom all nature should be closely screened
her powers are also beneficial a woman at this time as lian expressed
it is in regular communication with the starry bodies even at other
times a woman when led naked around the orchard protected it from
caterpillars said pliny and this belief is acted upon according to
bastanzi even in the italy of today367 a garment stained with a
virgins menstrual blood it is said in bavaria is a certain safeguard
against cuts and stabs it will also extinguish fire it was valuable as a
lovephilter as a medicine its uses have been endless368 a sect of
valentinians even attributed sacramental virtues to menstrual blood and
partook of it as the blood of christ the church soon however acquired a
horror of menstruating women they were frequently not allowed to take the
sacrament or to enter sacred places and it was sometimes thought best to
prohibit the presence of women altogether369 the anglosaxon
penitentials declared that menstruating women must not enter a church it
appears to have been gregory ii who overturned this doctrine
in our own time the slow disintegration of primitive animistic
conceptions aided certainly by the degraded conception of sexual
phenomena taught by medival monksfor whom woman was templum
dificatum super cloacamhas led to a disbelief in the more salutary
influences of the menstruating woman a fairly widespread faith in her
pernicious influence alone survives it may be traced even in practical
and commercialone might add medicalquarters in the great
sugarrefineries in the north of france the regulations strictly forbid a
woman to enter the factory while the sugar is boiling or cooling the
reason given being that if a woman were to enter during her period the
sugar would blacken for the same reasonto turn to the eastno woman is
employed in the opium manufactory at saigon it being said that the opium
would turn and become bitter while annamite women say that it is very
difficult for them to prepare opiumpipes during the catamenial
period370 in india again when a native in charge of a limekiln which
had gone wrong declared that one of the women workers must be
menstruating all the womenhindus mahometans aboriginal gonds
etcshowed by their energetic denials that they understood this
superstition371
in 1878 a member of the british medical association wrote to the british
medical journal asking whether it was true that if a woman cured hams
while menstruating the hams would be spoiled he had known this to happen
twice another medical man wrote that if so what would happen to the
patients of menstruating lady doctors a third wrote in the journal for
april 27 1878 i thought the fact was so generally known to every
housewife and cook that meat would spoil if salted at the menstrual
period that i am surprised to see so many letters on the subject in the
journal if i am not mistaken the question was mooted many years ago in
the periodicals it is undoubtedly the fact that meat will be tainted if
cured by women at the catamenial period whatever the rationale may be i
can speak positively as to the fact
it is probably the influence of these primitive ideas which has caused
surgeons and gyncologists to dread operations during the catamenial
period such at all events is the opinion of a distinguished authority
dr william goodell who wrote in 1891372 i have learned to unlearn
the teaching that women must not be subjected to a surgical operation
during the monthly flux our forefathers from time immemorial have
thought and taught that the presence of a menstruating woman would pollute
solemn religious rites would sour milk spoil the fermentation in
winevats and much other mischief in a general way influenced by hoary
tradition modern physicians very generally postpone all operative
treatment until the flow has ceased but why this delay if time is
precious and it enters as an important factor in the case i have found
menstruation to be the very best time to curette away fungous vegetations
of the endometrium for being swollen then by the afflux of blood they
are larger than at any other time and can the more readily be removed
there is indeed no surer way of checking or of stopping a metrorrhagia
than by curetting the womb during the very flow while i do not select
this period for the removal of ovarian cysts or for other abdominal work
such as the extirpation of the ovaries or a kidney or breaking up
intestinal adhesions etc yet i have not hesitated to perform these
operations at such a time and have never had reason to regret the course
the only operations that i should dislike to perform during menstruation
would be those involving the womb itself
it must be added to this that we still have to take into consideration not
merely the surviving influence of ancient primitive beliefs but the
possible existence of actual nervous conditions during the menstrual
period producing what may be described as an abnormal nervous tension in
this way we are doubtless concerned with a tissue of phenomena
inextricably woven of folklore autosuggestion false observation and
real mental and nervous abnormality laurent loc cit has brought
forward several cases which may illustrate this point thus he speaks of
two young girls of about 16 and 17 slightly neuropathic but without
definite hysterical symptoms who during the menstrual period feel
themselves in a sort of electrical state with tingling and prickling
sensations and feelings of attraction or repulsion at the contact of
various objects these girls believe their garments stick to their skin
during the periods it was only with difficulty that they could remove
their slippers though fitting easily stockings had to be drawn off
violently by another person and they had given up changing their chemises
during the period because the linen became so glued to the skin an
orchestral performer on the doublebass informed laurent that whenever he
left a tuned doublebass in his lodgings during his wifes period a
string snapped consequently he always removed his instrument at this time
to a friends house he added that the same thing happened two years
earlier with a mistress a cafconcert singer who had indeed warned
him beforehand a harpist also informed laurent that she had been obliged
to give up her profession because during her periods several strings of
her harp always the same strings broke especially when she was playing
a friend of laurents an official in cochin china also told him that the
strings of his violin often snapped during the menstrual periods of his
annamite mistress who informed him that annamite women are familiar with
the phenomenon and are careful not to play on their instruments at this
time two young ladies both good violinists also affirmed that ever
since their first menstruation they had noted a tendency for the strings
to snap at this period one a genuine artist who often performed at
charity concerts systematically refused to play at these times and was
often embarrassed to find a pretext the other who admitted that she was
nervous and irritable at such times had given up playing on account of
the trouble of changing the strings so frequently laurent also refers to
the frequency with which women break things during the menstrual periods
and considers that this is not simply due to the awkwardness caused by
nervous exhaustion or hysterical tremors but that there is spontaneous
breakage most usually it happens that a glass breaks when it is being
dried with a cloth needles also break with unusual facility at this time
clocks are stopped by merely placing the hand upon them
i do not here attempt to estimate critically the validity of these alleged
manifestations some of which may certainly be explained by the
unconscious muscular action which forms the basis of the phenomena of
tableturning and thoughtreading such a task may best be undertaken
through the minute study of isolated cases and in this place i am merely
concerned with the general influence of the menstrual state in affecting
the social position of women without reference to the analysis of the
elements that go to make up that influence
there is only one further point to which attention may be called i
allude to the way in which the more favorable side of the primitive
conception of the menstruating womanas priestess sibyl prophetess an
almost miraculous agent for good an angel the peculiar home of the
divine elementwas slowly and continuously carried on side by side with
the less favorable view through the beginnings of european civilization
until our own times the actual physical phenomena of menstruation with
the ideas of taboo associated with that state sank into the background as
culture evolved but on the other hand the ideas of the angelic position
and spiritual mission of women based on the primitive conception of the
mystery associated with menstruation still in some degree persisted
it is evident however that while in one form or another the more
favorable aspect of the primitive view of womens magic function has never
quite died out the gradual decay and degradation of the primitive view
has on the whole involved a lower estimate of womens nature and
position woman has always been the witch she was so even in ancient
babylonia but she has ceased to be the priestess the early teutons saw
sanctum aliquid et providum in women who for the medival german
preacher were only besti bipedales and schopenhauer and even
nietzsche have been more inclined to side with the preacher than with the
halfnaked philosophers of tacituss day but both views alike are but the
extremes of the same primitive conception and the gradual evolution from
one extreme of the magical doctrine to the other was inevitable
in an advanced civilization as we see these ideas having their ultimate
basis on the old story of the serpent and on a special and mysterious
connection between the menstruating woman and the occult forces of magic
tend to die out the separation of the sexes they involve becomes
unnecessary living in greater community with men women are seen to
possess something it may well be but less than before of the
angeldevil of early theories menstruation is no longer a monstrific
state requiring spiritual taboo but a normal physiological process not
without its psychic influences on the woman herself and on those who live
with her

sexual periodicity in men
by fh perrycoste b sc lond
in a recent brochure on the rhythm of the pulse373 i showed inter
alia that the readings of the pulse in both man and woman if arranged
in lunar monthly periods and averaged over several years displayed a
clear and sometimes very strongly marked and symmetrical rhythm374
after pointing out that in at any rate some cases the male and female
pulsecurves both monthly and annual seemed to be converse to one
another i added it is difficult to ignore the suggestion that in this
tracing of the monthly rhythm of the pulse we have a history of the
monthly function in women and that if so the tracing of the male pulse
may eventually afford us some help in discovering a corresponding monthly
period in men the existence of which has been suggested by mr havelock
ellis and professor stanley hall among other writers certainly the mere
fact that we can trace a clear monthly rhythm in mans pulse seems to
point strongly to the existence of a monthly physiological period in him
also
obviously however it is only indirectly and by inference that we can
argue from a monthly rhythm of the pulse in men to a male sexual
periodicity but i am now able to adduce more direct evidence that will
fairly demonstrate the existence of a sexual periodicity in men
we will start from the fact that celibacy is profoundly unnatural
and is therefore a physicalas well as an emotional and
intellectualabnormality this being so it is entirety in accord with
all that we know of physiology that when relief to the sexual secretory
system by natures means is denied and when in consequence a certain
degree of tension or pressure has been attained the system should relieve
itself by a spontaneous dischargesuch discharge being of course in the
strict sense of the term pathological since it would never occur in any
animal that followed the strict law of its physical being without any
regard to other and higher laws of concern for its fellows
notoriously that which we should have anticipated a priori actually
occurs for any unmarried man who lives in strict chastity periodically
experiences while sleeping a loss of seminal fluidsuch phenomena being
popularly referred to as wet dreams375
during some eight or ten years i have carefully recorded the occurrence of
such discharges as i have experienced myself and i have now accumulated
sufficient data to justify an attempt to formulate some provisional
conclusions376
in order to render these observations as serviceable as may be to students
of periodicity i here repeat at the request of mr havelock ellis the
statement which was subjoined for the same reasons to my rhythm of the
pulse these observations upon myself were made between the ages of 20
and 33 i am about 5 feet 9 inches tall broadshouldered and weigh
about 10 stone 3 lbs netthis weight being i believe about 7 lbs
below the normal for my height also i have greenbrown eyes very
darkbrown hair and a complexion that leads strangers frequently to
mistake me for a foreignerthis complexion being perhaps attributable
to some huguenot blood although on the maternal side i am so far as all
information goes pure english i can stand a good deal of heat enjoy
relaxing climates am at once upset by bracing seaair hate the cold
and sweat profusely after exercise to this it will suffice to add that my
temperament is of a decidedly nervous and emotional type
before proceeding to remark upon the various rhythms that i have
discovered i will tabulate the data on which my conclusions are founded
the numbers of discharges recorded in the years in question are as
follows
    in 1886 30 records commenced in april
    in 1887 40
    in 1888 37
    in 1889 18 pretty certainly not fully recorded
    in 1890  0  no records kept this year377
    in 1891 19 records recommenced in june
    in 1892 35
    in 1893 40
    in 1894 38
    in 1895 36
    in 1896 36
    in 1897 35
    average 37 omitting 1886 1889 and 1891
thus i have complete records for eight years and incomplete records for
three more and the remarkable concord between the respective annual
numbers of observations in these eight years not only affords us intrinsic
evidence of the accuracy of my records but also at once proves that
there is an undeniable regularity in the occurrence of these sexual
discharges and therefore gives us reason for expecting to find this
regularity rhythmical moreover since it seemed reasonable to expect
that there might be more than one rhythm i have examined my data with a
view to discovering 1 an annual 2 a lunarmonthly and 3 a weekly
rhythm and i now proceed to show that all three such rhythms exist
the annual rhythm
it is obvious that in searching for an annual rhythm we must ignore the
records of the three incomplete years but those of the remaining eight
are graphically depicted upon chart 8 the curves speak so plainly for
themselves that any comment were almost superfluous and the concord
between the various curves although of course not perfect is far
greater than the scantiness of the data would have justified us in
expecting the curves all agree in pointing to the existence of three
welldefined maximaviz in march june and septemberthese being
therefore the months in which the sexual instinct is most active and the
later curves show that there is also often a fourth maximum in january in
the earlier years the march and june maxima are more strikingly marked
than the september one but the uppermost curve shows that on the average
of all eight years the september maximum is the highest the june and
january maxima occupying the second place and the march maximum being the
least strongly marked of all
now remembering that in calculating the curves of the annual rhythm of
the pulse i had found it necessary to average two months records
together in order to bring out the full significance of the rhythm i
thought it well to try the effect upon these curves also of similarly
averaging two months together at first my results were fairly
satisfactory but as my data increased year by year i found that these
curves were contradicting one another and therefore concluded that i had
selected unnatural periods for my averaging my first attempted remedy was
to arrange the months in the pairs decemberjanuary februarymarch etc
instead of in januaryfebruary marchapril etc but with these pairs i
fared no better than with the former i then arranged the months in the
triplets januaryfebruarymarch etc and the results are graphically
recorded on chart 7 here again comment would be quite futile but i
need only point out that on the whole the sexual activity rises
steadily during the first nine months in the year to its maximum in
september and then sinks rapidly and abruptly during the next three to
its minimum in december
the study of these curves suggests two interesting questions to neither
of which however do the data afford us an answer
in the first place are the alterations in my case of the maximum of the
discharges from march and june in the earlier years to september in the
later and the interpolation of a new secondary maximum in january
correlated with the increase in age or is the discrepancy due simply to a
temporary irregularity that would have been equally averaged out had i
recorded the discharges of 188189 instead of those from 1887 to 1897
the second question is one of very great importancesocially ethically
and physically how often in this climate should a man have sexual
connection with his wife in order to maintain himself in perfect
physiological equilibrium my results enable us to state definitely the
minimum limits and to reply that 37 embraces annually would be too few
but unfortunately they give us no clue to the maximum limit it is
obvious that the necessary frequency should be greater than 37 times
annuallypossibly very considerably in excess thereofseeing that the
spontaneous discharges with which we are dealing are due to
overpressure and occur only when the system being denied natural
relief can no longer retain its secretions and therefore it seems very
reasonable to suggest that the frequency of natural relief should be some
multiple of 37 i do not perceive however that the data in hand afford
us any clue to this multiple or enable us to suggest either 2 3 4 or 5
as the required multiple of 37 it is true that other observations upon
myself have afforded me what i believe to be a fairly satisfactory and
reliable answer so far as concerns myself but these observations are of
such a nature that they cannot be discussed here and i have no
inclination to offer as a counsel to others an opinion which i am unable
to justify by the citation of facts and statistics moreover i am quite
unable to opine whether given 37 as the annual frequency of spontaneous
discharges in a number of men the multiple required for the frequency of
natural relief should be the same in every case for aught i know to the
contrary the physiological idiosyncrasies of men may be so varied that
given two men with an annual frequency of 37 spontaneous discharges the
desired multiple may be in one case x and in the other 2x378 our data
however do clearly denote that the frequency in the six or eight summer
months should bear to the frequency of the six or four winter months the
proportion of three or four to two379 it should never be forgotten
however that under all conditions both man and wife should exercise
prudence both selfward and otherward and that each should utterly
refuse to gratify self by accepting a sacrifice however willingly
offered that may be gravely prejudicial to the health of the other for
only experience can show whether in any union the receptivity of the
woman be greater or less than or equal to the physical desire of the
man to those of course who regard marriage from the oldfashioned and
grossly immoral standpoint of melancthon and other theologians and who
consider a wife as the divinely ordained vehicle for the chartered
intemperance of her husband it will seem grotesque in the highest degree
that a physiological inquirer should attempt to advise them how often to
seek the embraces of their wives but those who regard woman from the
standpoint of a higher ethics who abhor the notion that she should be
only the vehicle for her husbands passions and who demand that she shall
be mistress of her own body will not be ungrateful for any guidance that
physiology can afford them it will be seen presently moreover that the
study of the weekly rhythm does afford us some less inexact clue to the
desired solution
one curious fact may be mentioned before we quit this interesting
question it is stated that solon required of the husband three
payments per month by the misna a daily debt was imposed upon an idle
vigorous young husband twice a week on a citizen once in thirty days
on a cameldriver once in six months on a seaman380 now it is
certainly striking that solons three payments per month exactly
correspond with my records of 37 discharges annually had solon similarly
recorded a series of observations upon himself
the lunarmonthly rhythm
we now come to that division of the inquiry which is of the greatest
physiological interest although of little social import is there a
monthly period in man as well as in woman my records indicate clearly
that there is
in searching for this monthly rhythm i have utilized not only the data of
the eight completelyrecorded years but also those of the three years of
1886 1889 and 1891 for although it would obviously have been
inaccurate to utilize these incomplete records when calculating the
yearly rhythm there seems no objection to making use of them in the
present section of the inquiry it is hardly necessary to remark that the
terms first day of the month second day third day etc are to be
understood as denoting newmoon day day after new moon third lunar
day and so on but it should be explained that since these discharges
occur at night i have adopted the astronomical instead of the civil
day so that a new moon occurring between noon yesterday and noon today
is reckoned as occurring yesterday and yesterday is regarded as the first
lunar day thus a discharge occurring in the night between december 31st
and january 1st is tabulated as occurring on december 31st and in the
present discussion is assigned to the lunar day comprised between noon of
december 31st and noon of january 1st
since it is obvious that the number of discharges in any one
yearaveraging as they do only 125 per dayare far too few to yield a
curve of any value i have combined my data in two series the dotted
curve on chart 9 is obtained by combining the results of the years
188692 two of these years are incompletely recorded and there are no
records for 1890 the total number of observations was 179 the broken
curve is obtained by combining those of the years 189397 the total
number of observations being 185 even so the data are far too scanty to
yield a really characteristic curve but the continuous curve which
sums up the results of the eleven years is more reliable and obviously
more satisfactory
if the two former curves be compared it will be seen that on the whole
they display a general concordance such differences as exist being
attributable chiefly to two facts 1 that the second curve is more even
throughout neither maximum nor minimum being so strongly marked as in the
first and 2 that the main maximum occurs in the middle of the month
instead of on the second lunar day and the absence of the marked initial
maximum alters the character of the first week or so of this curve it is
however scarcely fair to lay any great stress on the characters of curves
obtained from such scanty data and we will therefore pass to the
continuous curve the study of which will prove more valuable381
now even a cursory examination of this continuous curve will yield the
following results
1 the discharges occur most frequently on the second lunar day
2 the days of the next most frequent discharges are the 22d the 13th
the 7th 20th and 26th the 11th and 16th so that if we regard only the
first six of these we find that the discharges occur most frequently on
the 2d 7th 13th 20th 22d and 26th lunar daysie the discharges
occur most frequently on days separated on the average by fourday
intervals but actually the period between the 20th and 22d days is that
characterized by the most frequent discharges
3 the days of minimum of discharge are the 1st 5th 15th 18th and
21st
4 the curve is characterized by a continual seesawing so that every
notable maximum is immediately followed by a notable minimum thus the
curve is of an entirely different character from that representing the
monthly rhythm of the pulse382 and this is only what one might have
expected for whereas the mean pulsations vary only very slightly from
day to daythus giving rise to a gradually rising or sinking curvea
discharge from the sexual system relieves the tension by exhausting the
storedup secretion and is necessarily followed by some days of rest and
inactivity in the very nature of the case therefore a curve of this
kind could not possibly be otherwise than most irregular if the discharges
tended to occur most frequently upon definite days of the month and thus
the very irregularity of the curve affords us proof that there is a
regular male periodicity such that on certain days of the month there is
greater probability of a spontaneous discharge than on any other days
5 gratifying however though this irregularity of the curve may be yet
it entails a corresponding disadvantage for we are precluded thereby from
readily perceiving the characteristics of the monthly rhythm as a whole i
thought that perhaps this aspect of the rhythm might be rendered plainer
if i calculated the data into twoday averages and the result as shown
in chart 10 is extremely satisfactory here we can at once perceive the
wonderful and almost geometric symmetry of the monthly rhythm indeed if
the third maximum were one unit higher if the first minimum were one unit
lower and if the lines joining the second minimum and third maximum and
the fourth maximum and fourth minimum were straight instead of being
slightly broken then the curve would in its chief features be
geometrically symmetrical and this symmetry appears to me to afford a
convincing proof of the representative accuracy of the curve we see that
the month is divided into five periods that the maxima occur on the
following pairs of days the 19th20th 13th14th 25th26th 1st2d
7th8th and that the minima occur at the beginning end and exact middle
of the month there have been many idle superstitions as to the influence
of the moon upon the earth and its inhabitants and some beliefs
thatonce deemed equally idlehave now been reinstated in the regard of
science but it would certainly seem to be a very fascinating and very
curious fact if the influence of the moon upon men should be such as to
regulate the spontaneous discharges of their sexual system certainly the
lovers of all ages would then have builded better than they knew when
they reared altars of devotional verse to that chaste goddess artemis
the weekly rhythm
we now come to the third branch of our inquiry and have to ask whether
there be any weekly rhythm of the sexual activity a priori it might be
answered that to expect any such weekly rhythm were absurd seeing that
our weekunlike the lunar month of the yearis a purely artificial and
conventional period while on the other hand it might be retorted that
the existence of an induced weekly periodicity is quite conceivable
such periodicity being induced by the habitual difference between our
occupation or mode of life on one or two days of the week and that on
the remaining days in such an inquiry however a priori argument is
futile as the question can be answered only by an induction from
observations and the curves on chart 11 a and b prove conclusively
that there is a notable weekly rhythm the existence of this weekly rhythm
being granted it would naturally be assumed that either the maximum or
the minimum would regularly occur on saturday or sunday but an
examination of the curves discloses the unexpected result that the day of
maximum discharge varies from year to year thus it is383
    sunday in    1888 1892 1896
    tuesday in   1894
    thursday in  1886 1897
    friday in    1887
    saturday in  1893 and 1895
since in chart 11 the curves are drawn from sunday to sunday it is
obvious that the real symmetry of the curve is brought out in those years
only which are characterized by a sunday maximum and accordingly in
chart 12 i have depicted the curves in a more suitable form
chart 12 a is obtained by combining the data of 1888 1892 and 1896
the years of a sunday maximum curve 12 b represents the results of
1894 the year of a tuesday maximummultiplied throughout by three in
order to render the curve strictly comparable with the former curve 12
c represents 1886 and 1897the years of a thursday maximumsimilarly
multiplied by 15 in curve 12 d we have the results of 1887the year
of a friday maximumagain multiplied by three and in curve 12 e those
of 1893 and 1895the years of a saturday maximummultiplied by 15
finally curve 12 f represents the combined results of all nine years
plus the latter half of 1891 and this curve shows that on the whole
period there is a very strongly marked sunday maximum
i hardly think that these curves call for much comment in their general
character they display a notable concord among themselves and it is
significant that the most regular of the five curves are a and e
representing the combinations of three years and of two years
respectively while the least regular is b which is based upon the
records of one year only in every case we find that the maximum which
opens the week is rapidly succeeded by a minimum which is itself
succeeded by a secondary maximumusually very secondary although in
1894 it nearly equals the primary maximumfollowed again by a second
minimumusually nearly identical with the first minimumafter which
there is a rapid rise to the original maximum the study of these curves
fortunately amplifies the conclusion drawn from our study of the annual
rhythm and suggests that in at least part of the year the physiological
condition of man requires sexual union at least twice a week
as to curve 12f its remarkable symmetry speaks for itself the
existence of two secondary maxima however has not the same significance
as had that of our secondary maximum in the preceding curves for one of
these secondary maxima is due to the influence of the 1894 curve with its
primary tuesday maximum and the other to the similar influence of curve
c with its primary thursday maximum similarly the veiled third
secondary maximum is due to the influence of curve e probably any
student of curves will concede that on a still larger average the two
secondary maxima of curve f would be replaced by a single one on
wednesday or thursday
one more question remains for consideration in connection with this weekly
rhythm is it possible to trace any connection between the weekly and
yearly rhythms of such a character that the weekly day of maximum
discharge should vary from month to month in the year in other words
does the greater frequency of a sunday discharge characterize one part of
the year that of a tuesday another and so on in order to answer this
question i have recalculated all my data with results that are
graphically represented in chart 13 these curves prove that the sunday
maxima discharges occur in march and september and the minima in june
that the monday maxima discharges occur in september friday in july and
so on thus there is a regular rhythm according to which the days of
maximum discharge vary from one month of the year to another and the
existence of this final rhythm appears to me very remarkable i would
especially direct attention to the almost geometric symmetry of the sunday
curve and to the only less complete symmetry of the thursday and friday
curves certainly in these rhythms we have an ample field for farther
study and speculation
i have now concluded my study of this fascinating inquiry a study that is
necessarily incomplete since it is based upon records furnished by one
individual only the fact however that even with so few observations
and notwithstanding the consequently exaggerated disturbing influence of
minor irregularities such remarkable and unexpected symmetry is evidenced
by these curves only increases ones desire to have the opportunity of
handling a series of observations sufficiently numerous to render the
generalizations induced from them absolutely conclusive i would again
appeal384 to heads of colleges to assist this inquiry by enlisting in
its aid a band of students if only one hundred students living under
similar conditions could be induced to keep such records with scrupulous
regularity for only twelve months the results induced from such a series
of observations would be more than ten times as valuable as those which
have only been reached after ten years observations on my part and if
other centuries of students in foreign and colonial collegeseg in
italy india australia and americacould be similarly enlisted in this
work we should quickly obtain a series of results exhibiting the sexual
needs and sexual peculiarities of the male human animal in various
climates obviously however the records of any such students would be
worse than useless unless their care and accuracy on the one hand and
their habitual chastity on the other could be implicitly guaranteed

373 first published in the university magazine and free review of
february 1898 and since reprinted as a pamphlet a preliminary
communication appeared in nature may 14 1891
374 later study 1906 has convinced me that my attempt to find a
lunarmonthly period in the female pulse was vitiated by a hopeless error
for any monthly rhythm in a woman must be sought by arranging her records
according to her own menstrual month and this menstrual month may vary in
different women from considerably less than a lunar month to thirty days
or more
375 i may add however that in my own case these discharges areso far
as i can trust my waking consciousnessfrequently if not usually
dreamless and that strictly sexual dreams are extremely rare
notwithstanding the possession of a strongly emotional temperament
376 if i can trust my memory i first experienced this discharge when a
few months under fifteen years of age and if so within a few weeks of
the time when i was in an instant suddenly struck with the thought that
possibly the religion in which i had been educated might be false it is
curiously interesting that the advent of puberty should have been heralded
by this intellectual crisis
377 this unfortunate breach in the records was due to the fact that
failing to discover any regularity in or law of the occurrences of the
discharges i became discouraged and abandoned my records in june 1891
a reexamination of my pulserecords having led to my discovery of a
lunarmonthly rhythm of the pulse my interest in other physiological
periodicities was reawakened and i recommenced my records of these
discharges
378 as a matter of fact i take it that we may safely assert that no man
who is content to be guided by his own instinctive cravings and who
neither suppresses these on the one hand nor endeavors to force himself
on the other hand will be in any danger of erring by either excess or the
contrary
379 it is obvious that the opportunity of continuing such an inquiry as
that described in this appendix ceases with marriage but i may add
1906 that certain notes that i have kept with scrupulous exactness
during eight years of married life lend almost no support to the
suggestion made in the textie that sexual desire is greater at one
season of the year than at another the nature of these notes i cannot
discuss but they clearly indicate that although there is a slight
degree more of sexual desire in the second and third quarters of the year
than in the first and fourth yet this difference is so slight as to be
almost negligible even if the months be rearranged in the
tripletsnovemberdecemberjanuary etcso as to bring the maximum
months of may june and july together the difference between the highest
quarter and the lowest amounts to an increase of only ten per cent upon
the latterafter allowing of course for the abnormal shortness of
february and neglecting february the increase in the maximum months
june and july over the minimum november is equal to an increase of
under 14 per cent upon the latter these differences are so vastly less
than those shown on chart 7 that they possess almost no significance but
lest too much stress be laid upon the apparently equalizing influence of
married life it must be added that the records discussed in the text were
obtained during residence in london whereas since my marriage i have
lived in south cornwall where the climate is both milder and more
equable

381 i may add that the curve yielded by 189697 is remarkably parallel
with that yielded by the preceding nine years but i have not thought it
worth while to chart these two additional curves

recorded years of 1889 and 1891 the apparent explanation of this curious
oscillation will be given directly

appendix c
the autoerotic factor in religion
the intimate association between the emotions of love and religion is well
known to all those who are habitually brought into close contact with the
phenomena of the religious life love and religion are the two most
volcanic emotions to which the human organism is liable and it is not
surprising that when there is a disturbance in one of these spheres the
vibrations should readily extend to the other nor is it surprising that
the two emotions should have a dynamic relation to each other and that
the autoerotic impulse being the more primitive and fundamental of the
two impulses should be able to pass its unexpended energy over to the
religious emotion there to find the expansion hitherto denied it the
love of the human becoming the love of the divine
    i was not good enough for man
    and so am given to god
even when there is absolute physical suppression on the sexual side it
seems probable that thereby a greater intensity of spiritual fervor is
caused many eminent thinkers seem to have been without sexual desire
it is a noteworthy and significant fact that the age of love is also the
age of conversion starbuck for instance in his very elaborate study of
the psychology of conversion shows that the majority of conversions take
place during the period of adolescence that is from the age of puberty
to about 24 or 25385
it would be easy to bring forward a long series of observations from the
most various points of view to show the wide recognition of this close
affinity between the sexual and the religious emotions it is probable as
hahn points out that the connection between sexual suppression and
religious rites which we may trace at the very beginning of culture was
due to an instinctive impulse to heighten rather than abolish the sexual
element early religious rites were largely sexual and orgiastic because
they were largely an appeal to the generative forces of nature to exhibit
a beneficial productiveness among happily married people as hahn
remarks the sexual emotions rapidly give place to the cares and anxieties
involved in supporting children but when the exercise of the sexual
function is prevented by celibacy or even by castration the most
complete form of celibacy the sexual emotions may pass into the psychical
sphere to take on a more pronounced shape386 the early christians
adopted the traditional eastern association between religion and celibacy
and as the writings of the fathers amply show they expended on sexual
matters a concentrated fervor of thought rarely known to the greek and
roman writers of the best period387 as christian theology developed
the minute inquisition into sexual things sometimes became almost an
obsession so far as i am aware however i cannot profess to have made
any special investigation it was not until the late middle ages that
there is any clear recognition of the fact that between the religious
emotions and the sexual emotions there is not only a superficial
antagonism but an underlying relationship at this time so great a
theologian and philosopher as aquinas said that it is especially on the
days when a man is seeking to make himself pleasing to god that the devil
troubles him by polluting him with seminal emissions with somewhat more
psychological insight the wise old knight of the tower landry in the
fourteenth century tells his daughters that no young woman in love
can ever serve her god with that unfeignedness which she did aforetime
for i have heard it argued by many who in their young days had been in
love that when they were in the church the condition and the pleasing
melancholy in which they found themselves would infallibly set them
brooding over all their tender lovesick longings and all their amorous
passages when they should have been attending to the service which was
going on at the time and such is the property of this mystery of love
that it is ever at the moment when the priest is holding our saviour upon
the altar that the most enticing emotions come after narrating the
history of two queens beyond the seas who indulged in amours even on holy
thursday and good friday at midnight in their oratories when the lights
were put out he concludes every woman in love is more liable to fall in
church or at her devotion than at any other time
the connection between religious emotion and sexual emotion was very
clearly set forth by swift about the end of the seventeenth century in a
passage which it may be worth while to quote from his discourse
concerning the mechanical operation of the spirit after mentioning that
he was informed by a very eminent physician that when the quakers first
appeared he was seldom without female quaker patients affected with
nymphomania swift continues persons of a visionary devotion either men
or women are in their complexion of all others the most amorous for
zeal is frequently kindled from the same spark with other fires and from
inflaming brotherly love will proceed to raise that of a gallant if we
inspect into the usual process of modern courtship we shall find it to
consist in a devout turn of the eyes called ogling an artificial form
of canting and whining by rote every interval for want of other matter
made up with a shrug or a hum a sigh or a groan the style compact of
insignificant words incoherences and repetitions these i take to be the
most accomplished rules of address to a mistress and where are these
performed with more dexterity than by the saints nay to bring this
argument yet closer i have been informed by certain sanguine brethren of
the first class that in the height and orgasmus of their spiritual
exercise it has been frequent with them388  immediately after
which they found the spirit to relax and flag of a sudden with the
nerves and they were forced to hasten to a conclusion this may be
farther strengthened by observing with wonder how unaccountably all
females are attracted by visionary or enthusiastic preachers though never
so contemptible in their outward mien which is usually supposed to be
done upon considerations purely spiritual without any carnal regards at
all but i have reason to think the sex hath certain characteristics by
which they form a truer judgment of human abilities and performings than
we ourselves can possibly do of each other let that be as it will thus
much is certain that however spiritual intrigues begin they generally
conclude like all others they may branch upwards toward heaven but the
root is in the earth too intense a contemplation is not the business of
flesh and blood it must by the necessary course of things in a little
time let go its hold and fall into matter lovers for the sake of
celestial converse are but another sort of platonics who pretend to see
stars and heaven in ladies eyes and to look or think no lower but the
same pit is provided for both
to come down to recent times in the last century the headmaster of
clifton college when discussing the sexual vices of boyhood remarked
that the boys whose temperament exposes them to these faults are usually
far from destitute of religious feelings that there is and always has
been an undoubted coexistence of religion and animalism that emotional
appeals and revivals are far from rooting out carnal sin and that in some
places as is well known they seem actually to stimulate even at the
present day to increased licentiousness389
it is not difficult to see how even in technique the method of the
revivalist is a quasisexual method and resembles the attempt of the male
to overcome the sexual shyness of the female in each case as w thomas
remarks the will has to be set aside and strong suggestive means are
used and in both cases the appeal is not of the conflict type but of an
intimate sympathetic and pleading kind in the effort to make a moral
adjustment it consequently turns out that a technique is used which
was derived originally from sexual life and the use so to speak
of the sexual machinery for a moral adjustment involves in some
cases the carrying over into the general process of some sexual
manifestations390
the relationship of the sexual and the religious emotionslike so many
other of the essential characters of human natureis seen in its nakedest
shape by the alienist esquirol referred to this relationship and many
years ago jb friedreich a german alienist of wide outlook and
considerable insight emphasized the connection between the sexual and the
religious emotions and brought forward illustrative cases391 schroeder
van der kolk also remarked i venture to express my conviction that we
should rarely err if in a case of religious melancholy we assumed the
sexual apparatus to be implicated392 rgis in france lays it down
that there exists a close connection between mystic ideas and erotic
ideas and most often these two orders of conception are associated in
insanity393 berthier considered that erotic forms of insanity are
those most frequently found in convents bevanlewis points out how
frequently religious exaltation occurs at puberty in women and religious
depression at the climacteric the period of sexual decline394
religion is very closely allied to love remarks savage and the love
of woman and the worship of god are constantly sources of trouble in
unstable youth it is very interesting to note the frequency with which
these two deep feelings are associated395 closely connected with
salacity particularly in women remarks conolly norman when discussing
mania tukes dictionary of psychological medicine is religious
excitement ecstasy as we see in cases of acute mental disease is
probably always connected with sexual excitement if not with sexual
depravity the same association is constantly seen in less extreme cases
and one of the commonest features in the conversation of an acutely
maniacal woman is the intermingling of erotic and religious ideas
patients who believe remarks clara barrus that they are the virgin
mary the bride of christ the church gods wife and raphaels
consort are sure sooner or later to disclose symptoms which show that
they are some way or other sexually depraved396 forel who devotes a
chapter of his book die sexuelle frage to the subject argues that the
strongest feelings of religious emotion are often unconsciously rooted in
erotic emotion or represent a transformation of such emotion and in an
interesting discussion ch vi of this question in his sexualleben
unserer zeit bloch states that in a certain sense we may describe the
history of religions as the history of a special manifestation of the
human sexual instinct ball brouardel morselli vallon and marie397
ch hughes398 to mention but a few names among many have emphasized
the same point399 krafftebing deals briefly with the connection
between holiness and the sexual emotion and the special liability of the
saints to sexual temptations he thus states his own conclusions
religious and sexual emotional states at the height of their development
exhibit a harmony in quantity and quality of excitement and can thus in
certain circumstances act vicariously both he adds can be converted
into cruelty under pathological conditions400
after quoting these opinions it is perhaps not unnecessary to point out
that while sexual emotion constitutes the main reservoir of energy on
which religion can draw it is far from constituting either the whole
content of religion or its root murisier in an able study of the
psychology of religious ecstasy justly protests against too crude an
explanation of its nature though at the same time he admits that the
passion of the religious ecstatic lacks nothing of what goes to make up
sexual love not even jealousy401
srieux in his little work recherches cliniques sur les anomalies de
linstinct sexuel valuable on account of its instructive cases records
in detail a case which so admirably illustrates this phase of autoerotism
on the borderland between ordinary erotic daydreaming and religious
mysticism the phenomena for a time reaching an insane degree of
intensity that i summarize it thrse m aged 24 shows physical
stigmata of degeneration the heredity is also bad the father is a man of
reckless and irregular conduct the mother was at one time in a lunatic
asylum the patient was brought up in an orphanage and was a troublesome
volatile child she treated household occupations with contempt but was
fond of study even at an early age her lively imagination attracted
attention and the pleasure which she took in building castles in the air
from the age of seven to ten she masturbated at her first communion she
felt that jesus would for ever be the one master of her heart at
thirteen after the death of her mother she seemed to see her and to
hear her say that she was watching over her child shortly afterward she
was overwhelmed by a new grief the death of a teacher for whom she
cherished great affection on account of her pure character on the
following day she seemed to see and hear this teacher and would not leave
the house where the body lay tendencies to melancholy appeared saddened
by the funeral ceremonies exhorted by nuns fed on mystic revery she
passed from the orphanage to a convent she devoted herself solely to the
worship of jesus to be like jesus to be near jesus became her constant
preoccupations the virgins name was rarely seen in her writings gods
name never i wanted she said to love jesus more than any of the nuns
i saw and i even thought that he had a partiality for me she was also
haunted by the idea of preserving her purity she avoided frivolous
conversation and left the room when marriage was discussed such a union
being incompatible with a pure life it was my fixed idea for two years
to make my soul ever more pure in order to be agreeable to him the
beloved is well pleased among the lilies
already however in a rudimentary form appeared contrary tendencies
strictly speaking they were not contrary but related tendencies
beneath the mystic passion which concealed it sexual desire was sometimes
felt at sixteen she experienced emotions which she could not master when
thinking of a priest who she said loved her in spite of all remorse she
would have been willing to have relations with him notwithstanding these
passing weaknesses the idea of purity always possessed her the nuns
however were concerned about her exaltation she was sent away from the
convent became discouraged and took a place as a servant but her fervor
continued her confessor inspired her with great affection she sends him
tender letters she would be willing to have relations with him even
though she considers the desire a temptation of the devil the ground was
now prepared for the manifestation of hallucinations one evening in
may she writes after being absorbed in thoughts of my confessor and
feeling discouraged as i thought that jesus whom i loved so much would
have nothing to do with me mother i cried out what must i do to win
your son my eyes were fixed on the sky and i remained in a state of
mad expectation it was absurd i to become the mother of the world my
heart went on repeating yes he is coming jesus is coming the
psychic erethism reverberating on the sensorial and sensory centres led
to genital auditory and visual hallucinations which produced the
sensation of sexual connection for the first time i went to bed and was
not alone as soon as i felt that touch i heard the words fear not it
is i i was lost in him whom i loved for many days i was cradled in a
world of pleasure i saw him everywhere overwhelming me with his chaste
caresses on the following day at mass she seemed to see calvary before
her jesus was naked and surrounded by a thousand voluptuous
imaginations his arms were loosened from the cross and he said to me
come i longed to fly to him with my body but could not make up my mind
to show myself naked however i was carried away by a force i could not
control i threw myself on my saviours neck and felt that all was over
between the world and me from that day by sheer reasoning she has
understood everything previously she thought that the religious life was
a renunciation of the joys of marriage and enjoyment generally now she
understands its object jesus christ desires that she should have
relations with a priest he is himself incarnated in priests just as st
joseph was the guardian of the virgin so are priests the guardians of
nuns she has been impregnated by jesus and this imaginary pregnancy
preoccupies her in the highest degree from this time she masturbated
daily she cannot even go to communion without experiencing voluptuous
sensations her delusions having thus become systematized nothing shakes
her tenacity in seeking to carry them out she attempts at all costs to
have relations with her confessor embraces him throws herself at his
knees pursues him and so becomes a cause of scandal when brought to the
asylum there is intense sexual excitement and she masturbates a dozen
times a day even when talking to the doctor the sexual organs are
normal the vulva moist and red the vagina is painful to touch the
contact of the finger causes erectile turgescence she has had no rest
she says since she has learned to love her jesus he desires her to have
sexual relations with someone and she cannot succeed all my souls
strength is arrested by this constant endeavor her new surroundings
modify her behavior and now it is the doctor whom she pursues with her
obsessions i expected everything from the charity of the priests i have
known i have not deserved what i wanted from them but is not a doctor
free to do everything for the good of the patients intrusted to him by
providence cannot a doctor thus devote himself since i have tasted the
tree of life i am tormented by the desire to share it with a loving
friend then she falls in love with an employee and makes the crudest
advances to him believing that she is thus executing the will of jesus
necessity makes laws she exclaims to him the moments are pressing i
have been waiting too long she still speaks of her religious vocation
which might be compromised by so long a delay i do not want to get
married gradually a transformation took place the love of god was
effaced and earthly love became more intense than ever quitting the
heights in which i wished to soar i am coming so near to earth that i
shall soon fix my desires there in a last letter thrse recognizes with
terror the insanity to which the exaltation of her imagination had led
her now i only believe in god and in suffering i feel that it is
necessary for me to get married
mariani402 has very fully described a case of eroticoreligious insanity
climacteric paranoia on an hysterical basis in a married woman of 44
during the early stages of her disorder she inflicted all sorts of
penances upon herself fasting constant prayer drinking her own urine
cleaning dirty plates with her tongue etc finally she felt that by her
penances she had obtained forgiveness of her sins and then began a stage
of joy and satisfaction during which she believed that she had entered
into a state of the most intimate personal relationship with jesus she
finally recovered mariani shows how closely this history corresponds with
the histories of the saints and that all the acts and emotions of this
woman can be exactly paralleled in the lives of famous saints403
the justice of these comparisons becomes manifest when we turn to the
records that have been left by holy persons a most instructive record
from this point of view is the autobiography of soeur jeanne des anges
superior of the ursulines of loudun in the seventeenth century404 she
was clever beautiful ambitious fond of pleasure still more of power
with this as sometimes happens she was highly hysterical and in the
early years of her religious life was possessed by various demons of
unchastity and blasphemy with whom for many years she was in constant
struggle she fell in love with a priest of loudun grandier a man whom
she had never even seen only knowing of him as a powerful and fascinating
personality at whose feet all women fell and she imagined that she and
the other nuns of her convent were possessed through his influence she
was thus the cause of the trial and execution of grandier a famous case
in the annals of witchcraft in her autobiography soeur jeanne describes
in detail how the demons assailed her at night appearing in lascivious
attitudes making indecent proposals raising the bedclothes touching
all parts of her body imploring her to yield to them and she tells how
strong her temptation was to yield on one night for instance she
writes i seemed to feel someones breath and i heard a voice saying
the time for resistance has gone by you must no longer rebel by putting
off your consent to what has been proposed you will be injured you cannot
persist in this resistance god has subjected you to the demands of a
nature which you must satisfy on occasions so urgent then i felt impure
impressions in my imagination and disordered movements in my body i
persisted in saying at the bottom of my heart that i would do nothing i
turned to god and asked him for strength in this extraordinary struggle
then there was a loud noise in my room and i felt as if someone had
approached me and put his hand into my bed and touched me and having
perceived this i rose in a state of restlessness which lasted for a long
time afterward some days later at midnight i began to tremble all over
my body as i lay in bed and to experience much mental anxiety without
knowing the cause after this had lasted for some time i heard noises in
various parts of my room the sheet was twice pulled without entirely
uncovering me the oratory close to my bed was upset i heard a voice on
the left side toward which i was lying i was asked if i had thought over
the advantageous offer that had been made to me it was added i have
come to know your reply i will keep my promise if you will give your
consent if on the contrary you refuse you will be the most miserable
girl in the world and all sorts of mischances will happen to you i
replied if there were no god i would fear those threats i am
consecrated to him it was replied to me you will not get much help
from god he will abandon you i replied god is my father he will take
care of me i have resolved to be faithful to him he said i will give
you three days to think over it i rose and went to the holy sacrament
with an anxious mind having returned to my room and being seated on a
chair it was drawn from under me so that i fell on the floor then the
same things happened again i heard a mans voice saying lascivious and
pleasant things to seduce me he pressed me to give him room in my bed he
tried to touch me in an indecent way i resisted and prevented him
calling the nuns who were near my room the window had been open it was
closed i felt strong movements of love for a certain person and improper
desire for dishonorable things
she writes again at a later period these impurities and the fire of
concupiscence which the evil spirit caused me to feel beyond all that i
can say forced me to throw myself on to braziers of hot coal where i
would remain for half an hour at a time in order to extinguish that other
fire so that half my body was quite burnt at other times in the depth
of winter i have sometimes passed part of the night entirely naked in the
snow or in tubs of icy water i have besides often gone among thorns so
that i have been torn by them at other times i have rolled in nettles
and i have passed whole nights defying my enemies to attack me and
assuring them that i was resolved to defend myself with the grace of god
with her confessors permission she also had an iron girdle made with
spikes and wore this day and night for nearly six months until the spikes
so entered her flesh that the girdle could only be removed with
difficulty by means of these austerities she succeeded in almost
exorcising the demons of unchastity and a little later after a severe
illness of which she believed that she was miraculously cured by st
joseph she appeared before the world almost as a saint herself
possessing a miraculous power of healing she traveled through france
bringing healing wherever she went the king the queen and cardinal
richelieu were at her feet and so great became the fame of her holiness
that her tomb was a shrine for pilgrims for more than a century after her
death it was not until late in life and after her autobiography
terminates that sexual desire in soeur jeanne though its sting seems
never to have quite disappeared became transformed into passionate love
of jesus and it is only in her later letters that we catch glimpses of
the complete transmutation thus in one of her later letters we read i
cried with ardor lord join me to thyself transform thyself into me
it seemed to me that that lovable spouse was reposing in my heart as on
his throne what makes me almost swoon with love and admiration is a
certain pleasure which it seems to me that he takes when all my being
flows into his restoring to him with respect and love all that he has
given to me sometimes i have permission to speak to our lord with more
familiarity calling him my love interesting him in all that i ask of
him as well for myself as for others
the lives of all the great saints and mystics bear witness to operations
similar to those so vividly described by soeur jeanne des anges though it
is very rarely that any saint has so frankly presented the dynamic
mechanism of the autoerotic process the indications they give us
however are sufficiently clear it is enough to refer to the special
affection which the mystics have ever borne toward the song of
songs405 and to note how the most earthly expressions of love in that
poem enter as a perpetual refrain into their writings406
the courage of the early christian martyrs it is abundantly evident was
in part supported by an exaltation which they frankly drew from the sexual
impulse felicula we are told in the acts of achilles and nereus407
preferred imprisonment torture and death to marriage or pagan
sacrifices when on the rack she was bidden to deny christianity she
exclaimed ego non nego amatorem meumi will not deny my lover who
for my sake has eaten gall and drunk vinegar crowned with thorns and
fastened to the cross
christian mysticism and its sexual coloring was absorbed by the islamic
world at a very early period and intensified in the thirteenth century it
was reintroduced into christendom in this intensified form by the genius
of raymond lull who had himself been born on the confines of islam and
his book of the lover and the friend is a typical manifestation of
sexual mysticism which inspired the great spanish school of mystics a few
centuries later the delicious agony the sweet martyrdom the strongly
combined pleasure and pain experienced by st theresa were certainly
associated with physical sexual sensations408
the case of margueritemarie alacoque is typical jesus as her
autobiography shows was always her lover her husband her dear master
she is betrothed to him he is the most passionate of lovers nothing can
be sweeter than his caresses they are so excessive she is beside herself
with the delight of them the central imagination of the mystic consists
essentially as ribot remarks in a love romance409
if we turn to the most popular devotional work that was ever written the
imitation of christ we shall find that the love there expressed is
precisely and exactly the love that finds its motive power in the emotions
aroused by a person of the other sex a very intellectual woman once
remarked to me that the book seemed to her a sort of religious
aphrodisiac if we read for instance book iii chapter v of this work
de mirabili affectu divini amoris we shall find in the eloquence of
this solitary monk in the low countries neither more nor less than the
emotions of every human lover at their highest limit of exaltation
nothing is sweeter than love nothing stronger nothing higher nothing
broader nothing pleasanter nothing fuller nor better in heaven or in
earth he who loves flies runs and rejoices he is free and cannot be
held he gives all in exchange for all and possesses all in all he looks
not at gifts but turns to the giver above all good things love knows no
measure but is fervent beyond all measure love feels no burden thinks
nothing of labor strives beyond its force reckons not of impossibility
for it judges that all things are possible therefore it attempts all
things and therefore it effects much when he who is not a lover fails and
falls my love thou all mine and i all thine
there is a certain natural disinclination in many quarters to recognize
any special connection between the sexual emotions and the religious
emotions but this attitude is not reasonable a man who is swayed by
religious emotions cannot be held responsible for the indirect emotional
results of his condition he can be held responsible for their control
nothing is gained by refusing to face the possibility that such control
may be necessary and much is lost there is certainly as i have tried to
indicate good reason to think that the action and interaction between
the spheres of sexual and religious emotion are very intimate the obscure
promptings of the organism at puberty frequently assume on the psychic
side a wholly religious character the activity of the religious emotions
sometimes tends to pass over into the sexual region the suppression of
the sexual emotions often furnishes a powerful reservoir of energy to the
religious emotions occasionally the suppressed sexual emotions break
through all obstacles
