note
for many years a link in the chain of samuel butlers biological works
has been missing  unconscious memory was originally published thirty
years ago but for fully half that period it has been out of print owing
to the destruction of a large number of the unbound sheets in a fire at
the premises of the printers some years ago  the present reprint comes
i think at a peculiarly fortunate moment since the attention of the
general public has of late been drawn to butlers biological theories in
a marked manner by several distinguished men of science notably by dr
francis darwin who in his presidential address to the british
association in 1908 quoted from the translation of herings address on
memory as a universal function of original matter which butler
incorporated into unconscious memory and spoke in the highest terms of
butler himself  it is not necessary for me to do more than refer to the
changed attitude of scientific authorities with regard to butler and his
theories since professor marcus hartog has most kindly consented to
contribute an introduction to the present edition of unconscious
memory summarising butlers views upon biology and defining his
position in the world of science  a word must be said as to the
controversy between butler and darwin with which chapter iv is
concerned  i have been told that in reissuing the book at all i am
committing a grievous error of taste that the world is no longer
interested in these old unhappy faroff things and battles long ago
and that butler himself by refraining from republishing unconscious
memory tacitly admitted that he wished the controversy to be consigned
to oblivion  this last suggestion at any rate has no foundation in
fact  butler desired nothing less than that his vindication of himself
against what he considered unfair treatment should be forgotten  he
would have republished unconscious memory himself had not the latter
years of his life been devoted to allengrossing work in other fields
in issuing the present edition i am fulfilling a wish that he expressed
to me shortly before his death

introduction
by marcus hartog ma dsc fls frhs
in reviewing samuel butlers works unconscious memory gives us an
invaluable lead for it tells us chaps ii iii how the author came to
write the book of the machines in erewhon 1872 with its
foreshadowing of the later theory life and habit 1878 evolution
old and new 1879 as well as unconscious memory 1880 itself  his
fourth book on biological theory was luck or cunning 1887 0a
besides these books his contributions to biology comprise several
essays remarks on romanes mental evolution in animals contained in
selections from previous works 1884 incorporated into luck or
cunning the deadlock in darwinism universal review apriljune
1890 republished in the posthumous volume of essays on life art and
science 1904 and finally some of the extracts from the notebooks
of the late samuel butler edited by mr h festing jones now in course
of publication in the new quarterly review
                                    
of all these life and habit 1878 is the most important the main
building to which the other writings are buttresses or at most annexes
its teaching has been summarised in unconscious memory in four main
principles 1 the oneness of personality between parent and offspring
2 memory on the part of the offspring of certain actions which it did
when in the persons of its forefathers 3 the latency of that memory
until it is rekindled by a recurrence of the associated ideas 4 the
unconsciousness with which habitual actions come to be performed  to
these we must add a fifth the purposiveness of the actions of living
beings as of the machines which they make or select
butler tells life and habit p 33 that he sometimes hoped that this
book would be regarded as a valuable adjunct to darwinism  he was
bitterly disappointed in the event for the book as a whole was
received by professional biologists as a gigantic jokea joke moreover
not in the best possible taste  true its central ideas largely those
of lamarck had been presented by hering in 1870 as butler found shortly
after his publication they had been favourably received developed by
haeckel expounded and praised by ray lankester  coming from butler
they met with contumely even from such men as romanes who as butler
had no difficulty in proving were unconsciously inspired by the same
ideasnur mit ein bischen andern wrter
it is easy looking back to see why life and habit so missed its mark
charles darwins presentation of the evolution theory had for the first
time rendered it possible for a sound naturalist to accept the
doctrine of common descent with divergence and so given a real meaning
to the term natural relationship which had forced itself upon the
older naturalists despite their belief in special and independent
creations  the immediate aim of the naturalists of the day was now to
fill up the gaps in their knowledge so as to strengthen the fabric of a
unified biology  for this purpose they found their actual scientific
equipment so inadequate that they were fully occupied in inventing fresh
technique and working therewith at factssave a few critics such as st
george mivart who was regarded as negligible since he evidently held a
brief for a party standing outside the scientific world
butler introduced himself as what we now call the man in the street
far too bare of scientific clothing to satisfy the mrs grundy of the
domain lacking all recognised tools of science and all sense of the
difficulties in his way he proceeded to tackle the problems of science
with little save the deft pen of the literary expert in his hand  his
very failure to appreciate the difficulties gave greater power to his
workmuch as tartarin of tarascon ascended the jungfrau and faced
successfully all dangers of alpine travel so long as he believed them to
be the mere blagues de rclame of the wily swiss host  his brilliant
qualities of style and irony themselves told heavily against him  was he
not already known for having written the most trenchant satire that had
appeared since gullivers travels  had he not sneered therein at the
very foundations of society and followed up its success by a
pseudobiography that had taken in the record and the rock  in life
and habit at the very start he goes out of his way to heap scorn at
the respected names of marcus aurelius lord bacon goethe arnold of
rugby and dr w b carpenter  he expressed the lowest opinion of the
fellows of the royal society  to him the professional man of science
with selfconscious knowledge for his ideal and aim was a medicineman
priest auguruseful perhaps in his way but to be carefully watched by
all who value freedom of thought and person lest with opportunity he
develop into a persecutor of the worst type  not content with
blackguarding the audience to whom his work should most appeal he went
on to depreciate that work itself and its author in his finest vein of
irony  having argued that our best and highest knowledge is that of
whose possession we are most ignorant he proceeds above all let no
unwary reader do me the injustice of believing in me  in that i write at
all i am among the damned
                                    
his writing of evolution old and new 1879 was due to his conviction
that scant justice had been done by charles darwin and alfred wallace and
their admirers to the pioneering work of buffon erasmus darwin and
lamarck  to repair this he gives a brilliant exposition of what seemed
to him the most valuable portion of their teachings on evolution  his
analysis of buffons true meaning veiled by the reticences due to the
conditions under which he wrote is as masterly as the english in which
he develops it  his sense of wounded justice explains the vigorous
polemic which here as in all his later writings he carries to the
extreme
as a matter of fact he never realised charles darwins utter lack of
sympathetic understanding of the work of his french precursors let alone
his own grandfather erasmus  yet this practical ignorance which to
butler was so strange as to transcend belief was altogether genuine and
easy to realise when we recall the position of natural science in the
early thirties in darwins student days at cambridge and for a decade or
two later  catastropharianism was the tenet of the day to the last it
commended itself to his professors of botany and geologyfor whom darwin
held the fervent allegiance of the indian scholar or chela to his
guru  as geikie has recently pointed out it was only later when
lyell had shown that the breaks in the succession of the rocks were only
partial and local without involving the universal catastrophes that
destroyed all life and rendered fresh creations thereof necessary that
any general acceptance of a descent theory could be expected  we may be
very sure that darwin must have received many solemn warnings against the
dangerous speculations of the french revolutionary school  he himself
was far too busy at the time with the reception and assimilation of new
facts to be awake to the deeper interest of farreaching theories
it is the more unfortunate that butlers lack of appreciation on these
points should have led to the enormous proportion of bitter personal
controversy that we find in the remainder of his biological writings
possibly as suggested by george bernard shaw his acquaintance and
admirer he was also swayed by philosophical resentment at that
banishment of mind from the organic universe which was generally thought
to have been achieved by charles darwins theory  still we must
remember that this mindless view is not implicit in charles darwins
presentment of his own theory nor was it accepted by him as it has been
by so many of his professed disciples
                                    
unconscious memory 1880we have already alluded to an anticipation
of butlers main theses  in 1870 dr ewald hering one of the most
eminent physiologists of the day professor at vienna gave an inaugural
address to the imperial royal academy of sciences das gedchtniss als
allgemeine funktion der organisirter substanz memory as a universal
function of organised matter  when life and habit was well advanced
francis darwin at the time a frequent visitor called butlers attention
to this essay which he himself only knew from an article in nature
herein professor e ray lankester had referred to it with admiring
sympathy in connection with its further development by haeckel in a
pamphlet entitled die perigenese der plastidule  we may note however
that in his collected essays the advancement of science 1890 sir
ray lankester while including this essay inserts on the blank page
0bwe had almost written the white sheetat the back of it an apology
for having ever advocated the possibility of the transmission of acquired
characters
unconscious memory was largely written to show the relation of butlers
views to herings and contains an exquisitely written translation of the
address  hering does indeed anticipate butler and that in language
far more suitable to the persuasion of the scientific public  it
contains a subsidiary hypothesis that memory has for its mechanism
special vibrations of the protoplasm and the acquired capacity to
respond to such vibrations once felt upon their repetition  i do not
think that the theory gains anything by the introduction of this even as
a mere formal hypothesis and there is no evidence for its being anything
more  butler however gives it a warm nay enthusiastic reception in
chapter v introduction to professor herings lecture and in his notes
to the translation of the address which bulks so large in this book but
points out that he was not committed to this hypothesis though inclined
to accept it on a prima facie view  later on as we shall see he
attached more importance to it
the hering address is followed in unconscious memory by translations of
selected passages from von hartmanns philosophy of the unconscious
and annotations to explain the difference from this personification of
the unconscious as a mighty allruling allcreating personality and
his own scientific recognition of the great part played by unconscious
processes in the region of mind and memory
these are the essentials of the book as a contribution to biological
philosophy  the closing chapters contain a lucid statement of objections
to his theory as they might be put by a rigid necessitarian and a
refutation of that interpretation as applied to human action
but in the second chapter butler states his recession from the strong
logical position he had hitherto developed in his writings from erewhon
onwards so far he had not only distinguished the living from the
nonliving but distinguished among the latter machines or tools from
things at large 0c  machines or tools are the external organs of
living beings as organs are their internal machines they are fashioned
assembled or selected by the beings for a purposes so they have a
future purpose as well as a past history  things at large have a
past history but no purpose so long as some being does not convert them
into tools and give them a purpose machines have a why as well as a
how things at large have a how only
in unconscious memory the allurements of unitary or monistic views have
gained the upper hand and butler writes p 23
    the only thing of which i am sure is that the distinction between
    the organic and inorganic is arbitrary that it is more coherent with
    our other ideas and therefore more acceptable to start with every
    molecule as a living thing and then deduce death as the breaking up
    of an association or corporation than to start with inanimate
    molecules and smuggle life into them and that therefore what we
    call the inorganic world must be regarded as up to a certain point
    living and instinct within certain limits with consciousness
    volition and power of concerted action  it is only of late
    however that i have come to this opinion
i have italicised the last sentence to show that butler was more or less
conscious of its irreconcilability with much of his most characteristic
doctrine  again in the closing chapter butler writes p 275
    we should endeavour to see the socalled inorganic as living in
    respect of the qualities it has in common with the organic rather
    than the organic as nonliving in respect of the qualities it has in
    common with the inorganic
we conclude our survey of this book by mentioning the literary
controversial part chiefly to be found in chapter iv but cropping up
elsewhere  it refers to interpolations made in the authorised
translation of krauses life of erasmus darwin  only one side is
presented and we are not called upon here or elsewhere to discuss the
merits of the question
                                    
luck or cunning as the main means of organic modification an attempt
to throw additional light upon the late mr charles darwins theory of
natural selection 1887 completes the series of biological books
this is mainly a book of strenuous polemic  it brings out still more
forcibly the heringbutler doctrine of continued personality from
generation to generation and of the working of unconscious memory
throughout and points out that while this is implicit in much of the
teaching of herbert spencer romanes and others it was nowhereeven
after the appearance of life and habitexplicitly recognised by them
but on the contrary masked by inconsistent statements and teaching
not luck but cunning not the uninspired weeding out by natural selection
but the intelligent striving of the organism is at the bottom of the
useful variety of organic life  and the parallel is drawn that not the
happy accident of time and place but the machiavellian cunning of
charles darwin succeeded in imposing as entirely his own on the
civilised world an uninspired and inadequate theory of evolution wherein
luck played the leading part while the more inspired and inspiring views
of the older evolutionists had failed by the inferiority of their luck
on this controversy i am bound to say that i do not in the very least
share butlers opinions and i must ascribe them to his lack of personal
familiarity with the biologists of the day and their modes of thought and
of work  butler everywhere undervalues the important work of elimination
played by natural selection in its widest sense
the conclusion of luck or cunning shows a strong advance in
monistic views and a yet more marked development in the vibration
hypothesis of memory given by hering and only adopted with the greatest
reserve in unconscious memory
    our conception then concerning the nature of any matter depends
    solely upon its kind and degree of unrest that is to say on the
    characteristics of the vibrations that are going on within it  the
    exterior object vibrating in a certain way imparts some of its
    vibrations to our brain but if the state of the thing itself depends
    upon its vibrations it the thing must be considered as to all
    intents and purposes the vibrations themselvesplus of course the
    underlying substance that is vibrating     the same vibrations
    therefore form the substance remembered introduce an infinitesimal
    dose of it within the brain modify the substance remembering and
    in the course of time create and further modify the mechanism of
    both the sensory and the motor nerves  thought and thing are one
    i commend these two last speculations to the readers charitable
    consideration as feeling that i am here travelling beyond the ground
    on which i can safely venture     i believe they are both
    substantially true
in 1885 he had written an abstract of these ideas in his notebooks see
new quarterly review 1910 p 116 and as in luck or cunning
associated them vaguely with the unitary conceptions introduced into
chemistry by newlands and mendelejeff  judging himself as an outsider
the author of life and habit would certainly have considered the mild
expression of faith i believe they are both substantially true
equivalent to one of extreme doubt  thus the fact of the archbishops
recognising this as among the number of his beliefs is conclusive
evidence with those who have devoted attention to the laws of thought
that his mind is not yet clear on the matter of the belief avowed see
life and habit pp 24 25
to sum up butlers fundamental attitude to the vibration hypothesis was
all through that taken in unconscious memory he played with it as a
pretty pet and fancied it more and more as time went on but instead of
backing it for all he was worth like the main theses of life and
habit he put a big stake on itand then hedged
                                    
the last of butlers biological writings is the essay the deadlock in
darwinism containing much valuable criticism on wallace and weismann
it is in allusion to the misnomer of wallaces book darwinism that he
introduces the term wallaceism 0d for a theory of descent that
excludes the transmission of acquired characters  this was indeed the
chief factor that led charles darwin to invent his hypothesis of
pangenesis which unacceptable as it has proved had far more to
recommend it as a formal hypothesis than the equally formal germplasm
hypothesis of weismann
                                    
the chief difficulty in accepting the main theses of butler and hering is
one familiar to every biologist and not at all difficult to understand
by the layman  everyone knows that the complicated beings that we term
animals and plants consist of a number of more or less
individualised units the cells each analogous to a simpler being a
protistsave in so far as the character of the cell unit of the higher
being is modified in accordance with the part it plays in that complex
being as a whole  most people too are familiar with the fact that the
complex being starts as a single cell separated from its parent or
where bisexual reproduction occurs from a cell due to the fusion of two
cells each detached from its parent  such cells are called
germcells  the germcell whether of single or of dual origin starts
by dividing repeatedly so as to form the primary embryonic cells a
complex mass of cells at first essentially similar which however as
they go on multiplying undergo differentiations and migrations losing
their simplicity as they do so  those cells that are modified to take
part in the proper work of the whole are called tissuecells  in virtue
of their activities their growth and reproductive power are limitedmuch
more in animals than in plants in higher than in lower beings  it is
these tissues or some of them that receive the impressions from the
outside which leave the imprint of memory  other cells which may be
closely associated into a continuous organ or more or less surrounded by
tissuecells whose part it is to nourish them are called secondary
embryonic cells or germcells  the germcells may be differentiated
in the young organism at a very early stage but in plants they are
separated at a much later date from the less isolated embryonic regions
that provide for the plants branching in all cases we find embryonic
and germcells screened from the life processes of the complex organism
or taking no very obvious part in it save to form new tissues or new
organs notably in plants
again in ourselves and to a greater or less extent in all animals we
find a system of special tissues set apart for the reception and storage
of impressions from the outer world and for guiding the other organs in
their appropriate responsesthe nervous system and when this system is
illdeveloped or out of gear the remaining organs work badly from lack of
proper skilled guidance and coordination  how can we then speak of
memory in a germcell which has been screened from the experiences of
the organism which is too simple in structure to realise them if it were
exposed to them  my own answer is that we cannot form any theory on the
subject the only question is whether we have any right to infer this
memory from the behaviour of living beings and butler like hering
haeckel and some more modern authors has shown that the inference is a
very strong presumption  again it is easy to overvalue such complex
instruments as we possess  the possessor of an uptodate camera well
instructed in the function and manipulation of every part but ignorant
of all optics save a handtomouth knowledge of the properties of his own
lens might say that a priori no picture could be taken with a
cigarbox perforated by a pinhole and our ignorance of the mechanism of
the psychology of any organism is greater by many times than that of my
supposed photographer  we know that plants are able to do many things
that can only be accounted for by ascribing to them a psyche and these
coordinated enough to satisfy their needs and yet they possess no
central organ comparable to the brain no highly specialised system for
intercommunication like our nerve trunks and fibres  as oscar hertwig
says we are as ignorant of the mechanism of the development of the
individual as we are of that of hereditary transmission of acquired
characters and the absence of such mechanism in either case is no reason
for rejecting the proven fact
however the relations of germ and body just described led jger
nussbaum galton lankester and above all weismann to the view that
the germcells or stirp galton were in the body but not of it
indeed in the body and out of it whether as reproductive cells set
free or in the developing embryo they are regarded as forming one
continuous homogeneity in contrast to the differentiation of the body
and it is to these cells regarded as a continuum that the terms stirp
germplasm are especially applied  yet on this view so eagerly
advocated by its supporters we have to substitute for the hypothesis of
memory which they declare to have no real meaning here the far more
fantastic hypotheses of weismann by these they explain the process of
differentiation in the young embryo into new germ and body and in the
young body the differentiation of its cells each in due time and place
into the varied tissue cells and organs  such views might perhaps be
acceptable if it could be shown that over each celldivision there
presided a wise allguiding genie of transcending intellect to which
clerkmaxwells sorting demons were mere infants  yet these views have
so enchanted many distinguished biologists that in dealing with the
subject they have actually ignored the existence of equally able workers
who hesitate to share the extremest of their views  the phenomenon is
one well known in hypnotic practice  so long as the nonweismannians
deal with matters outside this discussion their existence and their work
is rated at its just value but any work of theirs on this point so
affects the orthodox weismannite whether he accept this label or reject
it does not matter that for the time being their existence and the good
work they have done are alike nonexistent 0e
butler founded no school and wished to found none  he desired that what
was true in his work should prevail and he looked forward calmly to the
time when the recognition of that truth and of his share in advancing it
should give him in the lives of others that immortality for which alone
he craved
lamarckian views have never lacked defenders here and in america  of the
english herbert spencer who however was averse to the vitalistic
attitude vines and henslow among botanists cunningham among zoologists
have always resisted weismannism but i think none of these was
distinctly influenced by hering and butler  in america the majority of
the great school of palontologists have been strong lamarckians notably
cope who has pointed out moreover that the transformations of energy
in living beings are peculiar to them
we have already adverted to haeckels acceptance and development of
herings ideas in his perigenese der plastidule  oscar hertwig has
been a consistent lamarckian like yves delage of the sorbonne and these
occupy preeminent positions not only as observers but as discriminating
theorists and historians of the recent progress of biology  we may also
cite as a lamarckianof a sortfelix le dantec the leader of the
chemicophysical school of the present day
but we must seek elsewhere for special attention to the points which
butler regarded as the essentials of life and habit  in 1893 henry p
orr professor of biology in the university of louisiana published a
little book entitled a theory of heredity  herein he insists on the
nervous control of the whole body and on the transmission to the
reproductive cells of such stimuli received by the body as will guide
them on their path until they shall have acquired adequate experience of
their own in the new body they have formed  i have found the name of
neither butler nor hering but the treatment is essentially on their
lines and is both clear and interesting
in 1896 i wrote an essay on the fundamental principles of heredity
primarily directed to the man in the street  this after being held over
for more than a year by one leading review was declined with regret
and again after some weeks met the same fate from another editor  it
appeared in the pages of natural science for october 1897 and in the
biologisches centralblatt for the same year  i reproduce its closing
paragraph
    this theory heringbutlers has indeed a tentative character
    and lacks symmetrical completeness but is the more welcome as not
    aiming at the impossible  a whole series of phenomena in organic
    beings are correlated under the term of memory conscious and
    unconscious patent and latent     of the order of unconscious
    memory latent till the arrival of the appropriate stimulus is all
    the cooperative growth and work of the organism including its
    development from the reproductive cells  concerning the modus
    operandi we know nothing the phenomena may be due as hering
    suggests to molecular vibrations which must be at least as distinct
    from ordinary physical disturbances as rntgens rays are from
    ordinary light or it may be correlated as we ourselves are inclined
    to think with complex chemical changes in an intricate but orderly
    succession  for the present at least the problem of heredity can
    only be elucidated by the light of mental and not material
    processes
it will be seen that i express doubts as to the validity of herings
invocation of molecular vibrations as the mechanism of memory and
suggest as an alternative rhythmic chemical changes  this view has
recently been put forth in detail by j j cunningham in his essay on the
hormone 0f theory of heredity in the archiv fr
entwicklungsmechanik 1909 but i have failed to note any direct effect
of my essay on the trend of biological thought
among postdarwinian controversies the one that has latterly assumed the
greatest prominence is that of the relative importance of small
variations in the way of more or less fluctuations and of
discontinuous variations or mutations as de vries has called them
darwin in the first four editions of the origin of species attached
more importance to the latter than in subsequent editions he was swayed
in his attitude as is well known by an article of the physicist
fleeming jenkin which appeared in the north british review  the
mathematics of this article were unimpeachable but they were founded on
the assumption that exceptional variations would only occur in single
individuals which is indeed often the case among those domesticated
races on which darwin especially studied the phenomena of variation
darwin was no mathematician or physicist and we are told in his
biography that he regarded every toolshop rule or opticians thermometer
as an instrument of precision so he appears to have regarded fleeming
jenkins demonstration as a mathematical deduction which he was bound to
accept without criticism
mr william bateson late professor of biology in the university of
cambridge as early as 1894 laid great stress on the importance of
discontinuous variations collecting and collating the known facts in his
materials for the study of variations but this important work now
become rare and valuable at the time excited so little interest as to be
remaindered within a very few years after publication
in 1901 hugo de vries professor of botany in the university of
amsterdam published die mutationstheorie wherein he showed that
mutations or discontinuous variations in various directions may appear
simultaneously in many individuals and in various directions  in the
gardeners phrase the species may take to sporting in various directions
at the same time and each sport may be represented by numerous
specimens
de vries shows the probability that species go on for long periods
showing only fluctuations and then suddenly take to sporting in the way
described short periods of mutation alternating with long intervals of
relative constancy  it is to mutations that de vries and his school as
well as luther burbank the great former of new fruit and flowerplants
look for those variations which form the material of natural selection
in god the known and god the unknown which appeared in the examiner
may june and july 1879 but though then revised was only published
posthumously in 1909 butler anticipates this distinction
    under these circumstances organism must act in one or other of these
    two ways it must either change slowly and continuously with the
    surroundings paying cash for everything meeting the smallest change
    with a corresponding modification so far as is found convenient or
    it must put off change as long as possible and then make larger and
    more sweeping changes
    both these courses are the same in principle the difference being
    one of scale and the one being a miniature of the other as a ripple
    is an atlantic wave in little both have their advantages and
    disadvantages so that most organisms will take the one course for
    one set of things and the other for another  they will deal promptly
    with things which they can get at easily and which lie more upon the
    surface those however which are more troublesome to reach
    and lie deeper will be handled upon more cataclysmic principles
    being allowed longer periods of repose followed by short periods of
    greater activity    it may be questioned whether what is called a
    sport is not the organic expression of discontent which has been long
    felt but which has not been attended to nor been met step by step
    by as much small remedial modification as was found practicable so
    that when a change does come it comes by way of revolution  or
    again only that it comes to much the same thing it may be compared
    to one of those happy thoughts which sometimes come to us unbidden
    after we have been thinking for a long time what to do or how to
    arrange our ideas and have yet been unable to come to any
    conclusion pp 14 15 0g
we come to another order of mind in hans driesch  at the time he began
his work biologists were largely busy in a region indicated by darwin
and roughly mapped out by haeckelthat of phylogeny  from the facts of
development of the individual from the comparison of fossils in
successive strata they set to work at the construction of pedigrees and
strove to bring into line the principles of classification with the more
or less hypothetical stemtrees  driesch considered this futile since
we never could reconstruct from such evidence anything certain in the
history of the past  he therefore asserted that a more complete
knowledge of the physics and chemistry of the organic world might give a
scientific explanation of the phenomena and maintained that the proper
work of the biologist was to deepen our knowledge in these respects  he
embodied his views seeking the explanation on this track filling up
gaps and tracing projected roads along lines of probable truth in his
analytische theorie der organische entwicklung  but his own work
convinced him of the hopelessness of the task he had undertaken and he
has become as strenuous a vitalist as butler  the most complete
statement of his present views is to be found in the philosophy of life
19089 being the giffold lectures for 19078  herein he postulates a
quality psychoid in all living beings directing energy and matter
for the purpose of the organism and to this he applies the aristotelian
designation entelechy  the question of the transmission of acquired
characters is regarded as doubtful and he does not emphasiseif he
acceptsthe doctrine of continuous personality  his early youthful
impatience with descent theories and hypotheses has however
disappeared
                                    
in the next work the influence of hering and butler is definitely present
and recognised  in 1906 signor eugenio rignano an engineer keenly
interested in all branches of science and a little later the founder of
the international review rivist di scienza now simply called
scientia published in french a volume entitled sur la
transmissibilit des caractres acquishypothse dun centropigense
into the details of the authors work we will not enter fully  suffice
it to know that he accepts the heringbutler theory and makes a distinct
advance on herings rather crude hypothesis of persistent vibrations by
suggesting that the remembering centres store slightly different forms of
energy to give out energy of the same kind as they have received like
electrical accumulators  the last chapter le phnomne mnmonique et
le phnomne vital is frankly based on hering
in the lesson of evolution 1907 posthumous and only published for
private circulation frederick wollaston hutton frs late professor
of biology and geology first at dunedin and after at christchurch new
zealand puts forward a strongly vitalistic view and adopts herings
teaching  after stating this he adds the same idea of heredity being
due to unconscious memory was advocated by mr samuel butler in his life
and habit
dr james mark baldwin stuart professor of psychology in princeton
university usa called attention early in the 90s to a reaction
characteristic of all living beings which he terms the circular
reaction  we take his most recent account of this from his development
and evolution 19020h
    the general fact is that the organism reacts by concentration upon
    the locality stimulated for the continuance of the conditions
    movements stimulations which are vitally beneficial and for the
    cessation of the conditions movements stimulations which are
    vitally depressing
this amounts to saying in the terminology of jenning see below that the
living organism alters its physiological states either for its direct
benefit or for its indirect benefit in the reduction of harmful
conditions
again
    this form of concentration of energy on stimulated localities with
    the resulting renewal through movement of conditions that are
    pleasuregiving and beneficial and the consequent repetition of the
    movements is called circular reaction
of course the inhibition of such movements as would be painful on
repetition is merely the negative case of the circular reaction  we must
not put too much of our own ideas into the authors mind he nowhere says
explicitly that the animal or plant shows its sense and does this because
it likes the one thing and wants it repeated or dislikes the other and
stops its repetition as butler would have said  baldwin is very strong
in insisting that no full explanation can be given of living processes
any more than of history on purely chemicophysical grounds
the same view is put differently and independently by h s jennings
0i who started his investigations of living protista the simplest of
living beings with the idea that only accurate and ample observation was
needed to enable us to explain all their activities on a mechanical
basis and devised ingenious models of protoplastic movements  he was
led like driesch to renounce such efforts as illusory and has come to
the conviction that in the behaviour of these lowly beings there is a
purposive and a tentative charactera method of trial and errorthat
can only be interpreted by the invocation of psychology  he points out
that after stimulation the state of the organism may be altered so
that the response to the same stimulus on repetition is other  or as he
puts it the first stimulus has caused the organism to pass into a new
physiological state  as the change of state from what we may call the
primary indifferent state is advantageous to the organism we may
regard this as equivalent to the doctrine of the circular reaction and
also as containing the essence of semons doctrine of engrams or
imprints which we are about to consider  we cite one passage which for
audacity of thought underlying it is true most guarded expression may
well compare with many of the boldest flights in life and habit
    it may be noted that regulation in the manner we have set forth is
    what in the behaviour of higher organisms at least is called
    intelligence the examples have been taken from protista corals and
    the lowest worms  if the same method of regulation is found in
    other fields there is no reason for refusing to compare the action
    to intelligence  comparison of the regulatory processes that are
    shown in internal physiological changes and in regeneration to
    intelligence seems to be looked upon sometimes as heretical and
    unscientific  yet intelligence is a name applied to processes that
    actually exist in the regulation of movements and there is a
    priori no reason why similar processes should not occur in
    regulation in other fields  when we analyse regulation objectively
    there seems indeed reason to think that the processes are of the same
    character in behaviour as elsewhere  if the term intelligence be
    reserved for the subjective accompaniments of such regulation then
    of course we have no direct knowledge of its existence in any of the
    fields of regulation outside of the self and in the self perhaps
    only in behaviour  but in a purely objective consideration there
    seems no reason to suppose that regulation in behaviour
    intelligence is of a fundamentally different character from
    regulation elsewhere  method of regulation p 492
jennings makes no mention of questions of the theory of heredity  he has
made some experiments on the transmission of an acquired character in
protozoa but it was a mutilationcharacter which is as has been often
shown 0j not to the point
                                    
one of the most obvious criticisms of herings exposition is based upon
the extended use he makes of the word memory this he had foreseen and
deprecated
    we have a perfect right he says to extend our conception of
    memory so as to make it embrace involuntary and also unconscious
    reproductions of sensations ideas perceptions and efforts but we
    find on having done so that we have so far enlarged her boundaries
    that she proves to be an ultimate and original power the source and
    at the same time the unifying bond of our whole conscious life
    unconscious memory p 68
this sentence coupled with herings omission to give to the concept of
memory so enlarged a new name clear alike of the limitations and of the
stains of habitual use may well have been the inspiration of the next
work on our list  richard semon is a professional zoologist and
anthropologist of such high status for his original observations and
researches in the mere technical sense that in these countries he would
assuredly have been acclaimed as one of the fellows of the royal society
who were samuel butlers special aversion  the full title of his book is
die mneme als erhaltende prinzip im wechsel des organischen geschehens
munich ed  1 1904 ed 2 1908  we may translate it mneme a
principle of conservation in the transformations of organic existence
from this i quote in free translation the opening passage of chapter ii
    we have shown that in very many cases whether in protist plant or
    animal when an organism has passed into an indifferent state after
    the reaction to a stimulus has ceased its irritable substance has
    suffered a lasting change i call this afteraction of the stimulus
    its imprint or engraphic action since it penetrates and imprints
    itself in the organic substance and i term the change so effected an
    imprint or engram of the stimulus and the sum of all the
    imprints possessed by the organism may be called its store of
    imprints wherein we must distinguish between those which it has
    inherited from its forbears and those which it has acquired itself
    any phenomenon displayed by an organism as the result either of a
    single imprint or of a sum of them i term a mnemic phenomenon and
    the mnemic possibilities of an organism may be termed collectively
    its mneme
    i have selected my own terms for the concepts that i have just
    defined  on many grounds i refrain from making any use of the good
    german terms gedchtniss erinnerungsbild  the first and chiefest
    ground is that for my purpose i should have to employ the german
    words in a much wider sense than what they usually convey and thus
    leave the door open to countless misunderstandings and idle
    controversies  it would indeed even amount to an error of fact to
    give to the wider concept the name already current in the narrower
    sensenay actually limited like erinnerungsbild to phenomena of
    consciousness     in animals during the course of history one
    set of organs has so to speak specialised itself for the reception
    and transmission of stimulithe nervous system  but from this
    specialisation we are not justified in ascribing to the nervous
    system any monopoly of the function even when it is as highly
    developed as in man     just as the direct excitability of the
    nervous system has progressed in the history of the race so has its
    capacity for receiving imprints but neither susceptibility nor
    retentiveness is its monopoly and indeed retentiveness seems
    inseparable from susceptibility in living matter
semen here takes the instance of stimulus and imprint actions affecting
the nervous system of a dog
    who has up till now never experienced aught but kindness from the
    lord of creation and then one day that he is out alone is pelted
    with stones by a boy     here he is affected at once by two sets
    of stimuli 1 the optic stimulus of seeing the boy stoop for stones
    and throw them and 2 the skin stimulus of the pain felt when they
    hit him  here both stimuli leave their imprints and the organism is
    permanently changed in relation to the recurrence of the stimuli
    hitherto the sight of a human figure quickly stooping had produced no
    constant special reaction  now the reaction is constant and may
    remain so till death     the dog tucks in its tail between its
    legs and takes flight often with a howl as of pain
    here we gain on one side a deeper insight into the imprint action of
    stimuli  it reposes on the lasting change in the conditions of the
    living matter so that the repetition of the immediate or synchronous
    reaction to its first stimulus in this case the stooping of the boy
    the flying stones and the pain on the ribs no longer demands as
    in the original state of indifference the full stimulus a but may
    be called forth by a partial or different stimulus b in this case
    the mere stooping to the ground  i term the influences by which
    such changed reaction are rendered possible outcomereactions and
    when such influences assume the form of stimuli outcomestimuli
they are termed outcome ecphoria stimuli because the author
regards them and would have us regard them as the outcome manifestation
or efference of an imprint of a previous stimulus  we have noted that
the imprint is equivalent to the changed physiological state of
jennings  again the capacity for gaining imprints and revealing them by
outcomes favourable to the individual is the circular reaction of
baldwin but semon gives no reference to either author 0k
in the preface to his first edition reprinted in the second semon
writes after discussing the work of hering and haeckel
    the problem received a more detailed treatment in samuel butlers
    book life and habit published in 1878  though he only made
    acquaintance with herings essay after this publication butler gave
    what was in many respects a more detailed view of the coincidences of
    these different phenomena of organic reproduction than did hering
    with much that is untenable butlers writings present many a
    brilliant idea yet on the whole they are rather a retrogression
    than an advance upon hering  evidently they failed to exercise any
    marked influence upon the literature of the day
this judgment needs a little examination  butler claimed justly that
his life and habit was an advance on hering in its dealing with
questions of hybridity and of longevity puberty and sterility  since
semons extended treatment of the phenomena of crosses might almost be
regarded as the rewriting of the corresponding section of life and
habit in the mneme terminology we may infer that this view of the
question was one of butlers brilliant ideas  that butler shrank from
accepting such a formal explanation of memory as hering did with his
hypothesis should certainly be counted as a distinct advance upon
hering for semon also avoids any attempt at an explanation of mneme
i think however we may gather the real meaning of semons strictures
from the following passages
    i refrain here from a discussion of the development of this theory
    of lamarcks by those neolamarckians who would ascribe to the
    individual elementary organism an equipment of complex psychical
    powersso to say anthropomorphic perception and volitions  this
    treatment is no longer directed by the scientific principle of
    referring complex phenomena to simpler laws of deducing even human
    intellect and will from simpler elements  on the contrary they
    follow that most abhorrent method of taking the most complex and
    unresolved as a datum and employing it as an explanation  the
    adoption of such a method as formerly by samuel butler and recently
    by pauly i regard as a big and dangerous step backward ed 2 pp
    3801 note
thus butlers alleged retrogressions belong to the same order of thinking
that we have seen shared by driesch baldwin and jennings and most
explicitly avowed as we shall see by francis darwin  semon makes one
rather candid admission the impossibility of interpreting the phenomena
of physiological stimulation by those of direct reaction and the
undeception of those who had put faith in this being possible have led
many on the backward path of vitalism  semon assuredly will never be
able to complete his theory of mneme until guided by the experience of
jennings and driesch he forsakes the blind alley of mechanisticism and
retraces his steps to reasonable vitalism
                                    
but the most notable publications bearing on our matter are incidental to
the darwin celebrations of 19089  dr francis darwin son
collaborator and biographer of charles darwin was selected to preside
over the meeting of the british association held in dublin in 1908 the
jubilee of the first publications on natural selection by his father and
alfred russel wallace  in this address we find the theory of hering
butler rignano and semon taking its proper place as a vera causa of
that variation which natural selection must find before it can act and
recognised as the basis of a rational theory of the development of the
individual and of the race  the organism is essentially purposive the
impossibility of devising any adequate accounts of organic form and
function without taking account of the psychical side is most strenuously
asserted  and with our regret that past misunderstandings should be so
prominent in butlers works it was very pleasant to hear francis
darwins quotation from butlers translation of hering 0l followed by a
personal tribute to butler himself
                                    
in commemoration of the centenary of the birth of charles darwin and of
the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the origin of species
at the suggestion of the cambridge philosophical society the university
press published during the current year a volume entitled darwin and
modern science edited by mr a c seward professor of botany in the
university  of the twentynine essays by men of science of the highest
distinction one is of peculiar interest to the readers of samuel butler
heredity and variation in modern lights by professor w bateson
frs to whose work on discontinuous variations we have already
referred  here once more butler receives from an official biologist of
the first rank full recognition for his wonderful insight and keen
critical power  this is the more noteworthy because bateson has
apparently no faith in the transmission of acquired characters but such
a passage as this would have commended itself to butlers admiration
    all this indicates a definiteness and specific order in heredity
    and therefore in variation  this order cannot by the nature of the
    case be dependent on natural selection for its existence but must be
    a consequence of the fundamental chemical and physical nature of
    living things  the study of variation had from the first shown that
    an orderliness of this kind was present  the bodies and properties
    of living things are cosmic not chaotic  no matter how low in the
    scale we go never do we find the slightest hint of a diminution in
    that allpervading orderliness nor can we conceive an organism
    existing for one moment in any other state
we have now before us the materials to determine the problem of butlers
relation to biology and to biologists  he was we have seen anticipated
by hering but his attitude was his own fresh and original  he did not
hamper his exposition like hering by a subsidiary hypothesis of
vibrations which may or may not be true which burdens the theory without
giving it greater carrying power or persuasiveness which is based on no
objective facts and which as semon has practically demonstrated is
needless for the detailed working out of the theory  butler failed to
impress the biologists of his day even those on whom like romanes he
might have reasonably counted for understanding and for support  but he
kept alive herings work when it bade fair to sink into the limbo of
obsolete hypotheses  to use oliver wendell holmess phrase he
depolarised evolutionary thought  we quote the words of a young
biologist who when an ardent and dogmatic weismannist of the most
pronounced type was induced to read life and habit the book was to
me a transformation and an inspiration  such learned writings as
semons or herings could never produce such an effect they do not
penetrate to the heart of man they cannot carry conviction to the
intellect already filled full with rival theories and with the
unreasoned faith that tomorrow or next day a new discovery will
obliterate all distinction between man and his makings  the mind must
needs be open for the reception of truth for the rejection of prejudice
and the violence of a samuel butler may in the future as in the past be
needed to shatter the coat of mail forged by too exclusively professional
a training

authors preface
not finding the wellknown german scientific journal kosmos 0m
entered in the british museum catalogue i have presented the museum with
a copy of the number for february 1879 which contains the article by dr
krause of which mr charles darwin has given a translation the accuracy
of which is guaranteedso he informs usby the translators scientific
reputation together with his knowledge of german 0n
i have marked the copy so that the reader can see at a glance what
passages has been suppressed and where matter has been interpolated
i have also present a copy of erasmus darwin  i have marked this too
so that the genuine and spurious passages can be easily distinguished
i understand that both the erasmus darwin and the number of kosmos
have been sent to the keeper of printed books with instructions that
they shall be at once catalogued and made accessible to readers and do
not doubt that this will have been done before the present volume is
published  the reader therefore who may be sufficiently interested in
the matter to care to see exactly what has been done will now have an
opportunity of doing so

chapter i
introductiongeneral ignorance on the subject of evolution at the time
the origin of species was published in 1859
there are few things which strike us with more surprise when we review
the course taken by opinion in the last century than the suddenness with
which belief in witchcraft and demoniacal possession came to an end
this has been often remarked upon but i am not acquainted with any
record of the fact as it appeared to those under whose eyes the change
was taking place nor have i seen any contemporary explanation of the
reasons which led to the apparently sudden overthrow of a belief which
had seemed hitherto to be deeply rooted in the minds of almost all men
as a parallel to this though in respect of the rapid spread of an
opinion and not its decadence it is probable that those of our
descendants who take an interest in ourselves will note the suddenness
with which the theory of evolution from having been generally ridiculed
during a period of over a hundred years came into popularity and almost
universal acceptance among educated people
it is indisputable that this has been the case nor is it less
indisputable that the works of mr darwin and mr wallace have been the
main agents in the change that has been brought about in our opinions
the names of cobden and bright do not stand more prominently forward in
connection with the repeal of the corn laws than do those of mr darwin
and mr wallace in connection with the general acceptance of the theory
of evolution  there is no living philosopher who has anything like mr
darwins popularity with englishmen generally and not only this but his
power of fascination extends all over europe and indeed in every country
in which civilisation has obtained footing not among the illiterate
masses though these are rapidly following the suit of the educated
classes but among experts and those who are most capable of judging
france indeedthe country of buffon and lamarckmust be counted an
exception to the general rule but in england and germany there are few
men of scientific reputation who do not accept mr darwin as the founder
of what is commonly called darwinism and regard him as perhaps the
most penetrative and profound philosopher of modern times
to quote an example from the last few weeks only 2 i have observed
that professor huxley has celebrated the twentyfirst year since the
origin of species was published by a lecture at the royal institution
and am told that he described mr darwins candour as something actually
terrible i give professor huxleys own word as reported by one who
heard it and on opening a small book entitled degeneration by
professor ray lankester published a few days before these lines were
written i find the following passage amid more that is to the same
purport
    suddenly one of those great guesses which occasionally appear in the
    history of science was given to the science of biology by the
    imaginative insight of that greatest of living naturalistsi would
    say that greatest of living mencharles darwindegeneration p
    10
this is very strong language but it is hardly stronger than that
habitually employed by the leading men of science when they speak of mr
darwin  to go farther afield in february 1879 the germans devoted an
entire number of one of their scientific periodicals 3 to the
celebration of mr darwins seventieth birthday  there is no other
englishman now living who has been able to win such a compliment as this
from foreigners who should be disinterested judges
under these circumstances it must seem the height of presumption to
differ from so great an authority and to join the small band of
malcontents who hold that mr darwins reputation as a philosopher
though it has grown up with the rapidity of jonahs gourd will yet not
be permanent  i believe however that though we must always gladly and
gratefully owe it to mr darwin and mr wallace that the public mind has
been brought to accept evolution the admiration now generally felt for
the origin of species will appear as unaccountable to our descendants
some fifty or eighty years hence as the enthusiasm of our grandfathers
for the poetry of dr erasmus darwin does to ourselves and as one who
has yielded to none in respect of the fascination mr darwin has
exercised over him i would fain say a few words of explanation which may
make the matter clearer to our future historians  i do this the more
readily because i can at the same time explain thus better than in any
other way the steps which led me to the theory which i afterwards
advanced in life and habit
this last indeed is perhaps the main purpose of the earlier chapters of
this book  i shall presently give a translation of a lecture by
professor ewald hering of prague which appeared ten years ago and which
contains so exactly the theory i subsequently advocated myself that i am
half uneasy lest it should be supposed that i knew of professor herings
work and made no reference to it  a friend to whom i submitted my
translation in ms asking him how closely he thought it resembled life
and habit wrote back that it gave my own ideas almost in my own words
as far as the ideas are concerned this is certainly the case and
considering that professor hering wrote between seven and eight years
before i did i think it due to him and to my readers as well as to
myself to explain the steps which led me to my conclusions and while
putting professor herings lecture before them to show cause for
thinking that i arrived at an almost identical conclusion as it would
appear by an almost identical road yet nevertheless quite
independently i must ask the reader therefore to regard these earlier
chapters as in some measure a personal explanation as well as a
contribution to the history of an important feature in the developments
of the last twenty years  i hope also by showing the steps by which i
was led to my conclusions to make the conclusions themselves more
acceptable and easy of comprehension
being on my way to new zealand when the origin of species appeared i
did not get it till 1860 or 1861  when i read it i found the theory of
natural selection repeatedly spoken of as though it were a synonym for
the theory of descent with modification this is especially the case in
the recapitulation chapter of the work  i failed to see how important it
was that these two theoriesif indeed natural selection can be called a
theoryshould not be confounded together and that a theory of descent
with modification might be true while a theory of descent with
modification through natural selection 4 might not stand being looked
into
if any one had asked me to state in brief what mr darwins theory was i
am afraid i might have answered natural selection or descent with
modification whichever came first as though the one meant much the
same as the other  i observe that most of the leading writers on the
subject are still unable to catch sight of the distinction here alluded
to and console myself for my want of acumen by reflecting that if i was
misled i was misled in good company
iand i may add the public generallyfailed also to see what the unaided
reader who was new to the subject would be almost certain to overlook  i
mean that according to mr darwin the variations whose accumulation
resulted in diversity of species and genus were indefinite fortuitous
attributable but in small degree to any known causes and without a
general principle underlying them which would cause them to appear
steadily in a given direction for many successive generations and in a
considerable number of individuals at the same time  we did not know
that the theory of evolution was one that had been quietly but steadily
gaining ground during the last hundred years  buffon we knew by name
but he sounded too like buffoon for any good to come from him  we had
heard also of lamarck and held him to be a kind of french lord monboddo
but we knew nothing of his doctrine save through the caricatures
promulgated by his opponents or the misrepresentations of those who had
another kind of interest in disparaging him  dr erasmus darwin we
believed to be a forgotten minor poet but ninetynine out of every
hundred of us had never so much as heard of the zoonomia  we were
little likely therefore to know that lamarck drew very largely from
buffon and probably also from dr erasmus darwin and that this
lastnamed writer though essentially original was founded upon buffon
who was greatly more in advance of any predecessor than any successor has
been in advance of him
we did not know then that according to the earlier writers the
variations whose accumulation results in species were not fortuitous and
definite but were due to a known principle of universal
applicationnamely sense of needor apprehend the difference between a
theory of evolution which has a backbone as it were in the tolerably
constant or slowly varying needs of large numbers of individuals for long
periods together and one which has no such backbone but according to
which the progress of one generation is always liable to be cancelled and
obliterated by that of the next  we did not know that the new theory in
a quiet way professed to tell us less than the old had done and declared
that it could throw little if any light upon the matter which the earlier
writers had endeavoured to illuminate as the central point in their
system  we took it for granted that more light must be being thrown
instead of less and reading in perfect good faith we rose from our
perusal with the impression that mr darwin was advocating the descent of
all existing forms of life from a single or from at any rate a very
few primordial types that no one else had done this hitherto or that
if they had they had got the whole subject into a mess which mess
whatever it wasfor we were never told thiswas now being removed once
for all by mr darwin
the evolution part of the story that is to say the fact of evolution
remained in our minds as by far the most prominent feature in mr
darwins book and being grateful for it we were very ready to take mr
darwins work at the estimate tacitly claimed for it by himself and
vehemently insisted upon by reviewers in influential journals who took
much the same line towards the earlier writers on evolution as mr darwin
himself had taken  but perhaps nothing more prepossessed us in mr
darwins favour than the air of candour that was omnipresent throughout
his work  the prominence given to the arguments of opponents completely
carried us away it was this which threw us off our guard  it never
occurred to us that there might be other and more dangerous opponents who
were not brought forward  mr darwin did not tell us what his
grandfather and lamarck would have had to say to this or that  moreover
there was an unobtrusive parade of hidden learning and of difficulties at
last overcome which was particularly grateful to us  whatever opinion
might be ultimately come to concerning the value of his theory there
could be but one about the value of the example he had set to men of
science generally by the perfect frankness and unselfishness of his work
friends and foes alike combined to do homage to mr darwin in this
respect
for brilliant as the reception of the origin of species was it met in
the first instance with hardly less hostile than friendly criticism  but
the attacks were illdirected they came from a suspected quarter and
those who led them did not detect more than the general public had done
what were the really weak places in mr darwins armour  they attacked
him where he was strongest and above all they were as a general rule
stamped with a disingenuousness which at that time we believed to be
peculiar to theological writers and alien to the spirit of science
seeing therefore that the men of science ranged themselves more and
more decidedly on mr darwins side while his opponents had
manifestlyso far as i can remember all the more prominent among thema
bias to which their hostility was attributable we left off looking at
the arguments against darwinism as we now began to call it and
pigeonholed the matter to the effect that there was one evolution and
that mr darwin was its prophet
the blame of our errors and oversights rests primarily with mr darwin
himself  the first and far the most important edition of the origin
of species came out as a kind of literary melchisedec without father
and without mother in the works of other people  here is its opening
paragraph
    when on board hms beagle as naturalist i was much struck with
    certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of south
    america and in the geological relations of the present to the past
    inhabitants of that continent  these facts seemed to me to throw
    some light on the origin of speciesthat mystery of mysteries as it
    has been called by one of our greatest philosophers  on my return
    home it occurred to me in 1837 that something might be made out on
    this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting upon all sorts
    of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it  after five
    years work i allowed myself to speculate on the subject and drew up
    some short notes these i enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the
    conclusions which then seemed to me probable from that period to the
    present day i have steadily pursued the same object  i hope that i
    may be excused for entering on these personal details as i give them
    to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision 8a
in the latest edition this passage remains unaltered except in one
unimportant respect  what could more completely throw us off the scent
of the earlier writers  if they had written anything worthy of our
attention or indeed if there had been any earlier writers at all mr
darwin would have been the first to tell us about them and to award them
their due meed of recognition  but no the whole thing was an original
growth in mr darwins mind and he had never so much as heard of his
grandfather dr erasmus darwin
dr krause indeed thought otherwise  in the number of kosmos for
february 1879 he represented mr darwin as in his youth approaching the
works of his grandfather with all the devotion which people usually feel
for the writings of a renowned poet 8b  this should perhaps be a
delicately ironical way of hinting that mr darwin did not read his
grandfathers books closely but i hardly think that dr krause looked at
the matter in this light for he goes on to say that almost every single
work of the younger darwin may be paralleled by at least a chapter in the
works of his ancestor the mystery of heredity adaptation the
protective arrangements of animals and plants sexual selection
insectivorous plants and the analysis of the emotions and sociological
impulses nay even the studies on infants are to be found already
discussed in the pages of the elder darwin 8c
nevertheless innocent as mr darwins opening sentence appeared it
contained enough to have put us upon our guard  when he informed us
that on his return from a long voyage it occurred to him that the way
to make anything out about his subject was to collect and reflect upon
the facts that bore upon it it should have occurred to us in our turn
that when people betray a return of consciousness upon such matters as
this they are on the confines of that state in which other and not less
elementary matters will not occur to them  the introduction of the
word patiently should have been conclusive  i will not analyse more of
the sentence but will repeat the next two linesafter five years of
work i allowed myself to speculate upon the subject and drew up some
short notes  we read this thousands of us and were blind
if dr erasmus darwins name was not mentioned in the first edition of
the origin of species we should not be surprised at there being no
notice taken of buffon or at lamarcks being referred to only twiceon
the first occasion to be serenely waved aside he and all his works 9a
on the second 9b to be commended on a point of detail  the author of
the vestiges of creation was more widely known to english readers
having written more recently and nearer home  he was dealt with
summarily on an early and prominent page by a misrepresentation which
was silently expunged in later editions of the origin of species  in
his later editions i believe first in his third when 6000 copies had
been already sold mr darwin did indeed introduce a few pages in which
he gave what he designated as a brief but imperfect sketch of the
progress of opinion on the origin of species prior to the appearance of
his own work but the general impression which a book conveys to and
leaves upon the public is conveyed by the first editionthe one which is
alone with rare exceptions reviewed and in the first edition of the
origin of species mr darwins great precursors were all either ignored
or misrepresented  moreover the brief but imperfect sketch when it
did come was so very brief but in spite of this for this is what i
suppose mr darwin must mean so very imperfect that it might as well
have been left unwritten for all the help it gave the reader to see the
true question at issue between the original propounders of the theory of
evolution and mr charles darwin himself
that question is this whether variation is in the main attributable to a
known general principle or whether it is notwhether the minute
variations whose accumulation results in specific and generic differences
are referable to something which will ensure their appearing in a certain
definite direction or in certain definite directions for long periods
together and in many individuals or whether they are notwhether in a
word these variations are in the main definite or indefinite
it is observable that the leading men of science seem rarely to
understand this even now  i am told that professor huxley in his recent
lecture on the coming of age of the origin of species never so much as
alluded to the existence of any such division of opinion as this  he did
not even i am assured mention natural selection but appeared to
believe with professor tyndall 10a that evolution is mr darwins
theory  in his article on evolution in the latest edition of the
encyclopdia britannica i find only a veiled perception of the point
wherein mr darwin is at variance with his precursors  professor huxley
evidently knows little of these writers beyond their names if he had
known more it is impossible he should have written that buffon
contributed nothing to the general doctrine of evolution 10b and that
erasmus darwin though a zealous evolutionist can hardly be said to
have made any real advance on his predecessors 11  the article is in
a high degree unsatisfactory and betrays at once an amount of ignorance
and of perception which leaves an uncomfortable impression
if this is the state of things that prevails even now it is not
surprising that in 1860 the general public should with few exceptions
have known of only one evolution namely that propounded by mr darwin
as a member of the general public at that time residing eighteen miles
from the nearest human habitation and three days journey on horseback
from a booksellers shop i became one of mr darwins many enthusiastic
admirers and wrote a philosophical dialogue the most offensive form
except poetry and books of travel into supposed unknown countries that
even literature can assume upon the origin of species  this
production appeared in the press canterbury new zealand in 1861 or
1862 but i have long lost the only copy i had
chapter ii
how i came to write life and habit and the circumstances of its
completion
it was impossible however for mr darwins readers to leave the matter
as mr darwin had left it  we wanted to know whence came that germ or
those germs of life which if mr darwin was right were once the worlds
only inhabitants  they could hardly have come hither from some other
world they could not in their wet cold slimy state have travelled
through the dry ethereal medium which we call space and yet remained
alive  if they travelled slowly they would die if fast they would
catch fire as meteors do on entering the earths atmosphere  the idea
again of their having been created by a quasianthropomorphic being out
of the matter upon the earth was at variance with the whole spirit of
evolution which indicated that no such being could exist except as
himself the result and not the cause of evolution  having got back
from ourselves to the monad we were suddenly to begin again with
something which was either unthinkable or was only ourselves again upon
a larger scaleto return to the same point as that from which we had
started only made harder for us to stand upon
there was only one other conception possible namely that the germs had
been developed in the course of time from some thing or things that were
not what we called living at all that they had grown up in fact out of
the material substances and forces of the world in some manner more or
less analogous to that in which man had been developed from themselves
i first asked myself whether life might not after all resolve itself
into the complexity of arrangement of an inconceivably intricate
mechanism  kittens think our shoestrings are alive when they see us
lacing them because they see the tag at the end jump about without
understanding all the ins and outs of how it comes to do so  of
course they argue if we cannot understand how a thing comes to move
it must move of itself for there can be no motion beyond our
comprehension but what is spontaneous if the motion is spontaneous the
thing moving must he alive for nothing can move of itself or without our
understanding why unless it is alive  everything that is alive and not
too large can be tortured and perhaps eaten let us therefore spring
upon the tag and they spring upon it  cats are above this yet give the
cat something which presents a few more of those appearances which she is
accustomed to see whenever she sees life and she will fall as easy a
prey to the power which association exercises over all that lives as the
kitten itself  show her a toymouse that can run a few yards after being
wound up the form colour and action of a mouse being here there is no
good cat which will not conclude that so many of the appearances of
mousehood could not be present at the same time without the presence also
of the remainder  she will therefore spring upon the toy as eagerly as
the kitten upon the tag
suppose the toy more complex still so that it might run a few yards
stop and run on again without an additional winding up and suppose it
so constructed that it could imitate eating and drinking and could make
as though the mouse were cleaning its face with its paws  should we not
at first be taken in ourselves and assume the presence of the remaining
facts of life though in reality they were not there  query therefore
whether a machine so complex as to be prepared with a corresponding
manner of action for each one of the successive emergencies of life as it
arose would not take us in for good and all and look so much as if it
were alive that whether we liked it or not we should be compelled to
think it and call it so and whether the being alive was not simply the
being an exceedingly complicated machine whose parts were set in motion
by the action upon them of exterior circumstances whether in fact man
was not a kind of toymouse in the shape of a man only capable of going
for seventy or eighty years instead of half as many seconds and as much
more versatile as he is more durable  of course i had an uneasy feeling
that if i thus made all plants and men into machines these machines must
have what all other machines have if they are machines at alla designer
and some one to wind them up and work them but i thought this might wait
for the present and was perfectly ready then as now to accept a
designer from without if the facts upon examination rendered such a
belief reasonable
if then men were not really alive after all but were only machines of
so complicated a make that it was less trouble to us to cut the
difficulty and say that that kind of mechanism was being alive why
should not machines ultimately become as complicated as we are or at any
rate complicated enough to be called living and to be indeed as living
as it was in the nature of anything at all to be  if it was only a case
of their becoming more complicated we were certainly doing our best to
make them so
i do not suppose i at that time saw that this view comes to much the same
as denying that there are such qualities as life and consciousness at
all and that this again works round to the assertion of their
omnipresence in every molecule of matter inasmuch as it destroys the
separation between the organic and inorganic and maintains that whatever
the organic is the inorganic is also  deny it in theory as much as we
please we shall still always feel that an organic body unless dead is
living and conscious to a greater or less degree  therefore if we once
break down the wall of partition between the organic and inorganic the
inorganic must be living and conscious also up to a certain point
i have been at work on this subject now for nearly twenty years what i
have published being only a small part of what i have written and
destroyed  i cannot therefore remember exactly how i stood in 1863
nor can i pretend to see far into the matter even now for when i think
of life i find it so difficult that i take refuge in death or
mechanism and when i think of death or mechanism i find it so
inconceivable that it is easier to call it life again  the only thing
of which i am sure is that the distinction between the organic and
inorganic is arbitrary that it is more coherent with our other ideas
and therefore more acceptable to start with every molecule as a living
thing and then deduce death as the breaking up of an association or
corporation than to start with inanimate molecules and smuggle life into
them and that therefore what we call the inorganic world must be
regarded as up to a certain point living and instinct within certain
limits with consciousness volition and power of concerted action  it
is only of late however that i have come to this opinion
one must start with a hypothesis no matter how much one distrusts it so
i started with man as a mechanism this being the strand of the knot that
i could then pick at most easily  having worked upon it a certain time
i drew the inference about machines becoming animate and in 1862 or 1863
wrote the sketch of the chapter on machines which i afterwards rewrote in
erewhon  this sketch appeared in the press canterbury nz june
13 1863 a copy of it is in the british museum
i soon felt that though there was plenty of amusement to be got out of
this line it was one that i should have to leave sooner or later i
therefore left it at once for the view that machines were limbs which we
had made and carried outside our bodies instead of incorporating them
with ourselves  a few days or weeks later than june 13 1863 i
published a second letter in the press putting this view forward  of
this letter i have lost the only copy i had i have not seen it for
years  the first was certainly not good the second if i remember
rightly was a good deal worse though i believed more in the views it
put forward than in those of the first letter  i had lost my copy before
i wrote erewhon and therefore only gave a couple of pages to it in
that book besides there was more amusement in the other view  i should
perhaps say there was an intermediate extension of the first letter which
appeared in the reasoner july 1 1865
in 1870 and 1871 when i was writing erewhon i thought the best way of
looking at machines was to see them as limbs which we had made and
carried about with us or left at home at pleasure  i was not however
satisfied and should have gone on with the subject at once if i had not
been anxious to write the fair haven a book which is a development of
a pamphlet i wrote in new zealand and published in london in 1865
as soon as i had finished this i returned to the old subject on which i
had already been engaged for nearly a dozen years as continuously as
other business would allow and proposed to myself to see not only
machines as limbs but also limbs as machines  i felt immediately that i
was upon firmer ground  the use of the word organ for a limb told its
own story the word could not have become so current under this meaning
unless the idea of a limb as a tool or machine had been agreeable to
common sense  what would follow then if we regarded our limbs and
organs as things that we had ourselves manufactured for our convenience
the first question that suggested itself was how did we come to make
them without knowing anything about it  and this raised another namely
how comes anybody to do anything unconsciously  the answer habit was
not far to seek  but can a person be said to do a thing by force of
habit or routine when it is his ancestors and not he that has done it
hitherto  not unless he and his ancestors are one and the same person
perhaps then they are the same person after all  what is sameness
i remembered bishop butlers sermon on personal identity read it
again and saw very plainly that if a man of eighty may consider himself
identical with the baby from whom he has developed so that he may say
i am the person who at six months old did this or that then the baby
may just as fairly claim identity with its father and mother and say to
its parents on being born i was you only a few months ago  by parity
of reasoning each living form now on the earth must be able to claim
identity with each generation of its ancestors up to the primordial cell
inclusive
again if the octogenarian may claim personal identity with the infant
the infant may certainly do so with the impregnate ovum from which it has
developed  if so the octogenarian will prove to have been a fish once
in this his present life  this is as certain as that he was living
yesterday and stands on exactly the same foundation
i am aware that professor huxley maintains otherwise  he writes it is
not true for example    that a reptile was ever a fish but it is
true that the reptile embryo and what is said here of the reptile holds
good also for the human embryo at one stage of its development is an
organism which if it had an independent existence must be classified
among fishes 17
this is like saying it is not true that such and such a picture was
rejected for the academy but it is true that it was submitted to the
president and council of the royal academy with a view to acceptance at
their next forthcoming annual exhibition and that the president and
council regretted they were unable through want of space c cand
as much more as the reader chooses  i shall venture therefore to stick
to it that the octogenarian was once a fish or if professor huxley
prefers it an organism which must be classified among fishes
but if a man was a fish once he may have been a fish a million times
over for aught he knows for he must admit that his conscious
recollection is at fault and has nothing whatever to do with the matter
which must be decided not as it were upon his own evidence as to what
deeds he may or may not recollect having executed but by the production
of his signatures in court with satisfactory proof that he has delivered
each document as his act and deed
this made things very much simpler  the processes of embryonic
development and instinctive actions might be now seen as repetitions of
the same kind of action by the same individual in successive generations
it was natural therefore that they should come in the course of time to
be done unconsciously and a consideration of the most obvious facts of
memory removed all further doubt that habitwhich is based on memorywas
at the bottom of all the phenomena of heredity
i had got to this point about the spring of 1874 and had begun to write
when i was compelled to go to canada and for the next year and a half
did hardly any writing  the first passage in life and habit which i
can date with certainty is the one on page 52 which runs as follows
    it is one against legion when a man tries to differ from his own
    past selves  he must yield or die if he wants to differ widely so
    as to lack natural instincts such as hunger or thirst and not to
    gratify them  it is more righteous in a man that he should eat
    strange food and that his cheek should so much as lank not than
    that he should starve if the strange food be at his command  his
    past selves are living in him at this moment with the accumulated
    life of centuries  do this this this which we too have done and
    found out profit in it cry the souls of his forefathers within him
    faint are the far ones coming and going as the sound of bells wafted
    on to a high mountain loud and clear are the near ones urgent as an
    alarm of fire
this was written a few days after my arrival in canada june 1874  i was
on montreal mountain for the first time and was struck with its extreme
beauty  it was a magnificent summers evening the noble st lawrence
flowed almost immediately beneath and the vast expanse of country beyond
it was suffused with a colour which even italy cannot surpass  sitting
down for a while i began making notes for life and habit of which i
was then continually thinking and had written the first few lines of the
above when the bells of notre dame in montreal began to ring and their
sound was carried to and fro in a remarkably beautiful manner  i took
advantage of the incident to insert then and there the last lines of the
piece just quoted  i kept the whole passage with hardly any alteration
and am thus able to date it accurately
though so occupied in canada that writing a book was impossible i
nevertheless got many notes together for future use  i left canada at
the end of 1875 and early in 1876 began putting these notes into more
coherent form  i did this in thirty pages of closely written matter of
which a pressed copy remains in my commonplacebook  i find two dates
among themthe first sunday feb 6 1876 and the second at the end
of the notes feb 12 1876
from these notes i find that by this time i had the theory contained in
life and habit completely before me with the four main principles
which it involves namely the oneness of personality between parents and
offspring memory on the part of offspring of certain actions which it
did when in the persons of its forefathers the latency of that memory
until it is rekindled by a recurrence of the associated ideas and the
unconsciousness with which habitual actions come to be performed
the first halfpage of these notes may serve as a sample and runs thus
    those habits and functions which we have in common with the lower
    animals come mainly within the womb or are done involuntarily as
    our growth of limbs eyes c and our power of digesting food
    c   
    we say of the chicken that it knows how to run about as soon as it
    is hatched    but had it no knowledge before it was hatched
    it knew how to make a great many things before it was hatched
    it grew eyes and feathers and bones
    yet we say it knew nothing about all this
    after it is born it grows more feathers and makes its bones larger
    and develops a reproductive system
    again we say it knows nothing about all this
    what then does it know
    whatever it does not know so well as to be unconscious of knowing
    it
    knowledge dwells upon the confines of uncertainty
    when we are very certain we do not know that we know  when we will
    very strongly we do not know that we will
i then began my book but considering myself still a painter by
profession i gave comparatively little time to writing and got on but
slowly  i left england for north italy in the middle of may 1876 and
returned early in august  it was perhaps thus that i failed to hear of
the account of professor herings lecture given by professor ray
lankester in nature july 13 1876 though never at that time seeing
nature i should probably have missed it under any circumstances  on
my return i continued slowly writing  by august 1877 i considered that i
had to all intents and purposes completed my book  my first proof bears
date october 13 1877
at this time i had not been able to find that anything like what i was
advancing had been said already  i asked many friends but not one of
them knew of anything more than i did to them as to me it seemed an
idea so new as to be almost preposterous but knowing how things turn up
after one has written of the existence of which one had not known
before i was particularly careful to guard against being supposed to
claim originality  i neither claimed it nor wished for it for if a
theory has any truth in it it is almost sure to occur to several people
much about the same time and a reasonable person will look upon his work
with great suspicion unless he can confirm it with the support of others
who have gone before him  still i knew of nothing in the least
resembling it and was so afraid of what i was doing that though i could
see no flaw in the argument nor any loophole for escape from the
conclusion it led to yet i did not dare to put it forward with the
seriousness and sobriety with which i should have treated the subject if
i had not been in continual fear of a mine being sprung upon me from some
unexpected quarter  i am exceedingly glad now that i knew nothing of
professor herings lecture for it is much better that two people should
think a thing out as far as they can independently before they become
aware of each others works but if i had seen it i should either as is
most likely not have written at all or i should have pitched my book in
another key
among the additions i intended making while the book was in the press
was a chapter on mr darwins provisional theory of pangenesis which i
felt convinced must be right if it was mr darwins and which i was
sure if i could once understand it must have an important bearing on
life and habit  i had not as yet seen that the principle i was
contending for was darwinian not neodarwinian  my pages still teemed
with allusions to natural selection and i sometimes allowed myself to
hope that life and habit was going to be an adjunct to darwinism which
no one would welcome more gladly than mr darwin himself  at this time i
had a visit from a friend who kindly called to answer a question of
mine relative if i remember rightly to pangenesis  he came
september 26 1877  one of the first things he said was that the theory
which had pleased him more than anything he had heard of for some time
was one referring all life to memory  i said that was exactly what i was
doing myself and inquired where he had met with his theory  he replied
that professor ray lankester had written a letter about it in nature
some time ago but he could not remember exactly when and had given
extracts from a lecture by professor ewald hering who had originated the
theory  i said i should not look at it as i had completed that part of
my work and was on the point of going to press  i could not recast my
work if as was most likely i should find something when i saw what
professor hering had said which would make me wish to rewrite my own
book it was too late in the day and i did not feel equal to making any
radical alteration and so the matter ended with very little said upon
either side  i wrote however afterwards to my friend asking him to
tell me the number of nature which contained the lecture if he could
find it but he was unable to do so and i was well enough content
a few days before this i had met another friend and had explained to him
what i was doing  he told me i ought to read professor mivarts genesis
of species and that if i did so i should find there were two sides to
natural selection  thinking as so many people doand no wonderthat
natural selection and evolution were much the same thing and having
found so many attacks upon evolution produce no effect upon me i
declined to read it  i had as yet no idea that a writer could attack
neodarwinism without attacking evolution  but my friend kindly sent me
a copy and when i read it i found myself in the presence of arguments
different from those i had met with hitherto and did not see my way to
answering them  i had however read only a small part of professor
mivarts work and was not fully awake to the position when the friend
referred to in the preceding paragraph called on me
when i had finished the genesis of species i felt that something was
certainly wanted which should give a definite aim to the variations whose
accumulation was to amount ultimately to specific and generic
differences and that without this there could have been no progress in
organic development  i got the latest edition of the origin of species
in order to see how mr darwin met professor mivart and found his
answers in many respects unsatisfactory  i had lost my original copy of
the origin of species and had not read the book for some years  i now
set about reading it again and came to the chapter on instinct where i
was horrified to find the following passage
    but it would be a serious error to suppose that the greater number
    of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation and then
    transmitted by inheritance to the succeeding generations  it can be
    clearly shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are
    acquainted namely those of the hivebee and of many ants could not
    possibly have been acquired by habit 23a
this showed that according to mr darwin i had fallen into serious
error and my faith in him though somewhat shaken was far too great to
be destroyed by a few days course of professor mivart the full
importance of whose work i had not yet apprehended  i continued to read
and when i had finished the chapter felt sure that i must indeed have
been blundering  the concluding words i am surprised that no one has
hitherto advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects against the
wellknown doctrine of inherited habit as advanced by lamarck 23b
were positively awful  there was a quiet consciousness of strength about
them which was more convincing than any amount of more detailed
explanation  this was the first i had heard of any doctrine of inherited
habit as having been propounded by lamarck the passage stands in the
first edition the wellknown doctrine of lamarck p 242 and now to
find that i had been only busying myself with a stale theory of this
longsince exploded charlatanwith my book three parts written and
already in the pressit was a serious scare
on reflection however i was again met with the overwhelming weight of
the evidence in favour of structure and habit being mainly due to memory
i accordingly gathered as much as i could secondhand of what lamarck had
said reserving a study of his philosophie zoologique for another
occasion and read as much about ants and bees as i could find in readily
accessible works  in a few days i saw my way again and now reading the
origin of species more closely and i may say more sceptically the
antagonism between mr darwin and lamarck became fully apparent to me
and i saw how incoherent and unworkable in practice the later view was in
comparison with the earlier  then i read mr darwins answers to
miscellaneous objections and was met and this time brought up by the
passage beginning in the earlier editions of this work 24a c on
which i wrote very severely in life and habit 24b for i felt by this
time that the difference of opinion between us was radical and that the
matter must be fought out according to the rules of the game  after this
i went through the earlier part of my book and cut out the expressions
which i had used inadvertently and which were inconsistent with a
teleological view  this necessitated only verbal alterations for
though i had not known it the spirit of the book was throughout
teleological
i now saw that i had got my hands full and abandoned my intention of
touching upon pangenesis  i took up the words of mr darwin quoted
above to the effect that it would be a serious error to ascribe the
greater number of instincts to transmitted habit  i wrote chapter xi of
life and habit which is headed instincts as inherited memory i also
wrote the four subsequent chapters instincts of neuter insects
lamarck and mr darwin mr mivart and mr darwin and the concluding
chapter all of them in the month of october and the early part of
november 1877 the complete book leaving the binders hands december 4
1877 but according to trade custom being dated 1878  it will be seen
that these five concluding chapters were rapidly written and this may
account in part for the directness with which i said anything i had to
say about mr darwin partly this and partly i felt i was in for a penny
and might as well be in for a pound  i therefore wrote about mr
darwins work exactly as i should about any one elses bearing in mind
the inestimable services he had undoubtedlyand must always be counted to
haverendered to evolution
chapter iii
how i came to write evolution old and newmr darwins brief but
imperfect sketch of the opinions of the writers on evolution who had
preceded himthe reception which evolution old and new met with
though my book was out in 1877 it was not till january 1878 that i took
an opportunity of looking up professor ray lankesters account of
professor herings lecture  i can hardly say how relieved i was to find
that it sprung no mine upon me but that so far as i could gather
professor hering and i had come to pretty much the same conclusion  i
had already found the passage in dr erasmus darwin which i quoted in
evolution old and new but may perhaps as well repeat it here  it
runs
    owing to the imperfection of language the offspring is termed a new
    animal but is in truth a branch or elongation of the parent since
    a part of the embryon animal is or was a part of the parent and
    therefore in strict language cannot be said to be entirely new at
    the time of its production and therefore it may retain some of the
    habits of the parent system 26
when then the athenum reviewed life and habit january 26 1878
i took the opportunity to write to that paper calling attention to
professor herings lecture and also to the passage just quoted from dr
erasmus darwin  the editor kindly inserted my letter in his issue of
february 9 1878  i felt that i had now done all in the way of
acknowledgment to professor hering which it was for the time in my
power to do
i again took up mr darwins origin of species this time i admit in
a spirit of scepticism  i read his brief but imperfect sketch of the
progress of opinion on the origin of species and turned to each one of
the writers he had mentioned  first i read all the parts of the
zoonomia that were not purely medical and was astonished to find that
as dr krause has since said in his essay on erasmus darwin he was the
first who proposed and persistently carried out a wellrounded theory
with regard to the development of the living world 27 italics in
original
this is undoubtedly the case and i was surprised at finding professor
huxley say concerning this very eminent man that he could hardly be said
to have made any real advance upon his predecessors  still more was i
surprised at remembering that in the first edition of the origin of
species dr erasmus darwin had never been so much as named while in
the brief but imperfect sketch he was dismissed with a line of
halfcontemptuous patronage as though the mingled tribute of admiration
and curiosity which attaches to scientific prophecies as distinguished
from discoveries was the utmost he was entitled to  it is curious
says mr darwin innocently in the middle of a note in the smallest
possible type how largely my grandfather dr erasmus darwin
anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of lamarck in his
zoonomia vol i pp 500510 published in 1794 this was all he had
to say about the founder of darwinism until i myself unearthed dr
erasmus darwin and put his work fairly before the present generation in
evolution old and new  six months after i had done this i had the
satisfaction of seeing that mr darwin had woke up to the propriety of
doing much the same thing and that he had published an interesting and
charmingly written memoir of his grandfather of which more anon
not that dr darwin was the first to catch sight of a complete theory of
evolution  buffon was the first to point out that in view of the known
modifications which had been effected among our domesticated animals and
cultivated plants the ass and the horse should be considered as in all
probability descended from a common ancestor yet if this is so he
writesif the point were once gained that among animals and vegetables
there had been i do not say several species but even a single one
which had been produced in the course of direct descent from another
species if for example it could be once shown that the ass was but a
degeneration from the horse then there is no further limit to be set to
the power of nature and we should not be wrong in supposing that with
sufficient time she has evolved all other organised forms from one
primordial type 28a et lon nauroit pas tort de supposer que
dun seul tre elle a su tirer avec le temps tous les autres tres
organiss
this i imagine in spite of professor huxleys dictum is contributing a
good deal to the general doctrine of evolution for though descartes and
leibnitz may have thrown out hints pointing more or less broadly in the
direction of evolution some of which professor huxley has quoted he has
adduced nothing approaching to the passage from buffon given above
either in respect of the clearness with which the conclusion intended to
be arrived at is pointed out or the breadth of view with which the whole
ground of animal and vegetable nature is covered  the passage referred
to is only one of many to the same effect and must be connected with one
quoted in evolution old and new 28b from p 13 of buffons first
volume which appeared in 1749 and than which nothing can well point
more plainly in the direction of evolution  it is not easy therefore
to understand why professor huxley should give 175378 as the date of
buffons work nor yet why he should say that buffon was at first a
partisan of the absolute immutability of species 29a unless indeed
we suppose he has been content to follow that very unsatisfactory writer
isidore geoffroy st hilaire who falls into this error and says that
buffons first volume on animals appeared 1753 without verifying him
and without making any reference to him
professor huxley quotes a passage from the palingnsie philosophique
of bonnet of which he says that making allowance for his peculiar views
on the subject of generation they bear no small resemblance to what is
understood by evolution at the present day  the most important parts
of the passage quoted are as follows
    should i be going too far if i were to conjecture that the plants
    and animals of the present day have arisen by a sort of natural
    evolution from the organised beings which peopled the world in its
    original state as it left the hands of the creator     in the
    outset organised beings were probably very different from what they
    are nowas different as the original world is from our present one
    we have no means of estimating the amount of these differences but
    it is possible that even our ablest naturalist if transplanted to
    the original world would entirely fail to recognise our plants and
    animals therein 29b
but this is feeble in comparison with buffon and did not appear till
1769 when buffon had been writing on evolution for fully twenty years
with the eyes of scientific europe upon him  whatever concession to the
opinion of buffon bonnet may have been inclined to make in 1769 in 1764
when he published his contemplation de la nature and in 1762 when his
considrations sur les corps organes appeared he cannot be considered
to have been a supporter of evolution  i went through these works in
1878 when i was writing evolution old and new to see whether i could
claim him as on my side but though frequently delighted with his work i
found it impossible to press him into my service
the preeminent claim of buffon to be considered as the father of the
modern doctrine of evolution cannot be reasonably disputed though he was
doubtless led to his conclusions by the works of descartes and leibnitz
of both of whom he was an avowed and very warm admirer  his claim does
not rest upon a passage here or there but upon the spirit of forty
quartos written over a period of about as many years  nevertheless he
wrote as i have shown in evolution old and new of set purpose
enigmatically whereas there was no beating about the bush with dr
darwin  he speaks straight out and dr krause is justified in saying of
him that he was the first who proposed and persistently carried out a
wellrounded theory of evolution
i now turned to lamarck  i read the first volume of the philosophie
zoologique analysed it and translated the most important parts  the
second volume was beside my purpose dealing as it does rather with the
origin of life than of species and travelling too fast and too far for
me to be able to keep up with him  again i was astonished at the little
mention mr darwin had made of this illustrious writer at the manner in
which he had motioned him away as it were with his hand in the first
edition of the origin of species and at the brevity and imperfection
of the remarks made upon him in the subsequent historical sketch
i got isidore geoffroys histoire naturelle gnrale which mr darwin
commends in the note on the second page of the historical sketch as
giving an excellent history of opinion upon the subject of evolution
and a full account of buffons conclusions upon the same subject  this
at least is what i supposed mr darwin to mean  what he said was that
isidore geoffroy gives an excellent history of opinion on the subject of
the date of the first publication of lamarck and that in his work there
is a full account of buffons fluctuating conclusions upon the same
subject 31  but mr darwin is a more than commonly puzzling writer
i read what m geoffroy had to say upon buffon and was surprised to find
that after all according to m geoffroy buffon and not lamarck was
the founder of the theory of evolution  his name as i have already
said was never mentioned in the first edition of the origin of
species
m geoffroy goes into the accusations of having fluctuated in his
opinions which he tells us have been brought against buffon and comes
to the conclusion that they are unjust as any one else will do who turns
to buffon himself  mr darwin however in the brief but imperfect
sketch catches at the accusation and repeats it while saying nothing
whatever about the defence  the following is still all he says the
first author who in modern times has treated evolution in a scientific
spirit was buffon  but as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different
periods and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the
transformation of species i need not here enter on details  on the
next page in the note last quoted mr darwin originally repeated the
accusation of buffons having been fluctuating in his opinions and
appeared to give it the imprimatur of isidore geoffroys approval the
fact being that isidore geoffroy only quoted the accusation in order to
refute it and though i suppose meaning well did not make half the
case he might have done and abounds with misstatements  my readers will
find this matter particularly dealt with in evolution old and new
chapter x
i gather that some one must have complained to mr darwin of his saying
that isidore geoffroy gave an account of buffons fluctuating
conclusions concerning evolution when he was doing all he knew to
maintain that buffons conclusions did not fluctuate for i see that in
the edition of 1876 the word fluctuating has dropped out of the note in
question and we now learn that isidore geoffroy gives a full account of
buffons conclusions without the fluctuating  but buffon has not
taken much by this for his opinions are still left fluctuating greatly
at different periods on the preceding page and though he still was the
first to treat evolution in a scientific spirit he still does not enter
upon the causes or means of the transformation of species  no one can
understand mr darwin who does not collate the different editions of the
origin of species with some attention  when he has done this he will
know what newton meant by saying he felt like a child playing with
pebbles upon the seashore
one word more upon this note before i leave it  mr darwin speaks of
isidore geoffroys history of opinion as excellent and his account of
buffons opinions as full  i wonder how well qualified he is to be a
judge of these matters  if he knows much about the earlier writers he
is the more inexcusable for having said so little about them  if little
what is his opinion worth
to return to the brief but imperfect sketch  i do not think i can ever
again be surprised at anything mr darwin may say or do but if i could
i should wonder how a writer who did not enter upon the causes or means
of the transformation of species and whose opinions fluctuated greatly
at different periods can be held to have treated evolution in a
scientific spirit  nevertheless when i reflect upon the scientific
reputation mr darwin has attained and the means by which he has won it
i suppose the scientific spirit must be much what he here implies  i see
mr darwin says of his own father dr robert darwin of shrewsbury that
he does not consider him to have had a scientific mind  mr darwin
cannot tell why he does not think his fathers mind to have been fitted
for advancing science for he was fond of theorising and was
incomparably the best observer mr darwin ever knew 33a  from the
hint given in the brief but imperfect sketch i fancy i can help mr
darwin to see why he does not think his fathers mind to have been a
scientific one  it is possible that dr robert darwins opinions did not
fluctuate sufficiently at different periods and that mr darwin
considered him as having in some way entered upon the causes or means of
the transformation of species  certainly those who read mr darwins own
works attentively will find no lack of fluctuation in his case and
reflection will show them that a theory of evolution which relies mainly
on the accumulation of accidental variations comes very close to not
entering upon the causes or means of the transformation of species 33b
i have shown however in evolution old and new that the assertion
that buffon does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation
of species is absolutely without foundation and that on the contrary
he is continually dealing with this very matter and devotes to it one of
his longest and most important chapters 33c but i admit that he is
less satisfactory on this head than either dr erasmus darwin or lamarck
as a matter of fact buffon is much more of a neodarwinian than either
dr erasmus darwin or lamarck for with him the variations are sometimes
fortuitous  in the case of the dog he speaks of them as making their
appearance by some chance common enough with nature 33d and being
perpetuated by mans selection  this is exactly the if any slight
favourable variation happen to arise of mr charles darwin  buffon
also speaks of the variations among pigeons arising par hasard  but
these expressions are only ships his main cause of variation is the
direct action of changed conditions of existence while with dr erasmus
darwin and lamarck the action of the conditions of existence is indirect
the direct action being that of the animals or plants themselves in
consequence of changed sense of need under changed conditions
i should say that the sketch so often referred to is at first sight now
no longer imperfect in mr darwins opinion  it was brief but
imperfect in 1861 and in 1866 but in 1876 i see that it is brief only
of course discovering that it was no longer imperfect i expected to
find it briefer  what then was my surprise at finding that it had
become rather longer  i have found no perfectly satisfactory explanation
of this inconsistency but on the whole incline to think that the
greatest of living men felt himself unequal to prolonging his struggle
with the word but and resolved to lay that conjunction at all hazards
even though the doing so might cost him the balance of his adjectives
for i think he must know that his sketch is still imperfect
from isidore geoffroy i turned to buffon himself and had not long to
wait before i felt that i was now brought into communication with the
mastermind of all those who have up to the present time busied
themselves with evolution  for a brief and imperfect sketch of him i
must refer my readers to evolution old and new
i have no great respect for the author of the vestiges of creation who
behaved hardly better to the writers upon whom his own work was founded
than mr darwin himself has done  nevertheless i could not forget the
gravity of the misrepresentation with which he was assailed on page 3 of
the first edition of the origin of species nor impugn the justice of
his rejoinder in the following year 34 when he replied that it was to
be regretted mr darwin had read his work almost as much amiss as if
like its declared opponents he had an interest in misrepresenting it
35a  i could not again forget that though mr darwin did not venture
to stand by the passage in question it was expunged without a word of
apology or explanation of how it was that he had come to write it  a
writer with any claim to our consideration will never fall into serious
error about another writer without hastening to make a public apology as
soon as he becomes aware of what he has done
reflecting upon the substance of what i have written in the last few
pages i thought it right that people should have a chance of knowing
more about the earlier writers on evolution than they were likely to hear
from any of our leading scientists no matter how many lectures they may
give on the coming of age of the origin of species except professor
mivart  a book pointing the difference between teleological and
nonteleological views of evolution seemed likely to be useful and would
afford me the opportunity i wanted for giving a rsum of the views of
each one of the three chief founders of the theory and of contrasting
them with those of mr charles darwin as well as for calling attention
to professor herings lecture  i accordingly wrote evolution old and
new which was prominently announced in the leading literary periodicals
at the end of february or on the very first days of march 1879 35b as
a comparison of the theories of buffon dr erasmus darwin and lamarck
with that of mr charles darwin with copious extracts from the works of
the three firstnamed writers  in this book i was hardly able to
conceal the fact that in spite of the obligations under which we must
always remain to mr darwin i had lost my respect for him and for his
work
i should point out that this announcement coupled with what i had
written in life and habit would enable mr darwin and his friends to
form a pretty shrewd guess as to what i was likely to say and to quote
from dr erasmus darwin in my forthcoming book  the announcement
indeed would tell almost as much as the book itself to those who knew
the works of erasmus darwin
as may be supposed evolution old and new met with a very
unfavourable reception at the hands of many of its reviewers  the
saturday review was furious  when a writer it exclaimed who has
not given as many weeks to the subject as mr darwin has given years is
not content to air his own crude though clever fallacies but assumes to
criticise mr darwin with the superciliousness of a young schoolmaster
looking over a boys theme it is difficult not to take him more
seriously than he deserves or perhaps desires  one would think that mr
butler was the travelled and laborious observer of nature and mr darwin
the pert speculator who takes all his facts at secondhand 36
the lady or gentleman who writes in such a strain as this should not be
too hard upon others whom she or he may consider to write like
schoolmasters  it is true i have travellednot much but still as much
as many others and have endeavoured to keep my eyes open to the facts
before me but i cannot think that i made any reference to my travels in
evolution old and new  i did not quite see what that had to do with
the matter  a man may get to know a good deal without ever going beyond
the fourmile radius from charing cross  much less did i imply that mr
darwin was pert pert is one of the last words that can be applied to mr
darwin  nor again had i blamed him for taking his facts at secondhand
no one is to be blamed for this provided he takes wellestablished facts
and acknowledges his sources  mr darwin has generally gone to good
sources  the ground of complaint against him is that he muddied the
water after he had drawn it and tacitly claimed to be the rightful owner
of the spring on the score of the damage he had effected
notwithstanding however the generally hostile or more or less
contemptuous reception which evolution old and new met with there
were some reviewsas for example those in the field 37a the daily
chronicle 37b the athenum 37c the journal of science 37d
the british journal of homopathy 37e the daily news 37f the
popular science review 37gwhich were all i could expect or wish
chapter iv
the manner in which mr darwin met evolution old and new
by far the most important notice of evolution old and new was that
taken by mr darwin himself for i can hardly be mistaken in believing
that dr krauses article would have been allowed to repose unaltered in
the pages of the wellknown german scientific journal kosmos unless
something had happened to make mr darwin feel that his reticence
concerning his grandfather must now be ended
mr darwin indeed gives me the impression of wishing me to understand
that this is not the case  at the beginning of this year he wrote to me
in a letter which i will presently give in full that he had obtained dr
krauses consent for a translation and had arranged with mr dallas
before my book was announced  i remember this he continues
because mr dallas wrote to tell me of the advertisement  but mr
darwin is not a clear writer and it is impossible to say whether he is
referring to the announcement of evolution old and newin which case
he means that the arrangements for the translation of dr krauses
article were made before the end of february 1879 and before any public
intimation could have reached him as to the substance of the book on
which i was then engagedor to the advertisements of its being now
published which appeared at the beginning of may in which case as i
have said above mr darwin and his friends had for some time had full
opportunity of knowing what i was about  i believe however mr darwin
to intend that he remembered the arrangements having been made before the
beginning of mayhis use of the word announced instead of
advertised being an accident but let this pass
some time after mr darwins work appeared in november 1879 i got it
and looking at the last page of the book i read as follows
    they the elder darwin and lamarck explain the adaptation to
    purpose of organisms by an obscure impulse or sense of what is
    purposelike yet even with regard to man we are in the habit of
    saying that one can never know what soandso is good for  the
    purposelike is that which approves itself and not always that which
    is struggled for by obscure impulses and desires  just in the same
    way the beautiful is what pleases
i had a sort of feeling as though the writer of the above might have had
evolution old and new in his mind but went on to the next sentence
which ran
    erasmus darwins system was in itself a most significant first step
    in the path of knowledge which his grandson has opened up for us but
    to wish to revive it at the present day as has actually been
    seriously attempted shows a weakness of thought and a mental
    anachronism which no one can envy
thats me said i to myself promptly  i noticed also the position in
which the sentence stood which made it both one of the first that would
be likely to catch a readers eye and the last he would carry away with
him  i therefore expected to find an open reply to some parts of
evolution old and new and turned to mr darwins preface
to my surprise i there found that what i had been reading could not by
any possibility refer to me for the preface ran as follows
    in the february number of a wellknown german scientific journal
    kosmos 39 dr ernest krause published a sketch of the life of
    erasmus darwin the author of the zoonomia botanic garden and
    other works  this article bears the title of a contribution to the
    history of the descent theory and dr krause has kindly allowed my
    brother erasmus and myself to have a translation made of it for
    publication in this country
then came a note as follows
    mr dallas has undertaken the translation and his scientific
    reputation together with his knowledge of german is a guarantee for
    its accuracy
i ought to have suspected inaccuracy where i found so much consciousness
of accuracy but i did not  however this may be mr darwin pins himself
down with every circumstance of preciseness to giving dr krauses
article as it appeared in kosmosthe whole article and nothing but
the article  no one could know this better than mr darwin
on the second page of mr darwins preface there is a smalltype note
saying that my work evolution old and new had appeared since the
publication of dr krauses article  mr darwin thus distinctly
precludes his readers from supposing that any passage they might meet
with could have been written in reference to or by the light of my
book  if anything appeared condemnatory of that book it was an
undesigned coincidence and would show how little worthy of consideration
i must be when my opinions were refuted in advance by one who could have
no bias in regard to them
knowing that if the article i was about to read appeared in february it
must have been published before my book which was not out till three
months later i saw nothing in mr darwins preface to complain of and
felt that this was only another instance of my absurd vanity having led
me to rush to conclusions without sufficient groundsas if it was
likely indeed that mr darwin should think what i had said of
sufficient importance to be affected by it  it was plain that some one
besides myself of whom i as yet knew nothing had been writing about the
elder darwin and had taken much the same line concerning him that i had
done  it was for the benefit of this person then that dr krauses
paragraph was intended  i returned to a becoming sense of my own
insignificance and began to read what i supposed to be an accurate
translation of dr krauses article as it originally appeared before
evolution old and new was published
on pp 3 and 4 of dr krauses part of mr darwins book pp 133 and 134
of the book itself i detected a subapologetic tone which a little
surprised me and a notice of the fact that coleridge when writing on
stillingfleet had used the word darwinising  mr r garnett had called
my attention to this and i had mentioned it in evolution old and new
but the paragraph only struck me as being a little odd
when i got a few pages farther on p 147 of mr darwins book i found
a long quotation from buffon about rudimentary organs which i had quoted
in evolution old and new  i observed that dr krause used the same
edition of buffon that i did and began his quotation two lines from the
beginning of buffons paragraph exactly as i had done also that he had
taken his nominative from the omitted part of the sentence across a full
stop as i had myself taken it  a little lower i found a line of
buffons omitted which i had given but i found that at that place i had
inadvertently left two pair of inverted commas which ought to have come
out 41 having intended to end my quotation but changed my mind and
continued it without erasing the commas  it seemed to me that these
commas had bothered dr krause and made him think it safer to leave
something out for the line he omits is a very good one  i noticed that
he translated mais comme nous voulons toujours tout rapporter  un
certain but but we always wishing to refer c while i had it
but we ever on the lookout to refer c and nous ne faisons pas
attention que nous altrons la philosophie we fail to see that thus we
deprive philosophy of her true character whereas i had we fail to see
that we thus rob philosophy of her true character  this last was too
much and though it might turn out that dr krause had quoted this
passage before i had done so had used the same edition as i had had
begun two lines from the beginning of a paragraph as i had done and that
the later resemblances were merely due to mr dallas having compared dr
krauses german translation of buffon with my english and very properly
made use of it when he thought fit it looked prim facie more as
though my quotation had been copied in english as it stood and then
altered but not quite altered enough  this in the face of the preface
was incredible but so many points had such an unpleasant aspect that i
thought it better to send for kosmos and see what i could make out
at this time i knew not one word of german  on the same day therefore
that i sent for kosmos i began acquire that language and in the
fortnight before kosmos came had got far enough forward for all
practical purposesthat is to say with the help of a translation and a
dictionary i could see whether or no a german passage was the same as
what purported to be its translation
when kosmos came i turned to the end of the article to see how the
sentence about mental anachronism and weakness of thought looked in
german  i found nothing of the kind the original article ended with
some innocent rhyming doggerel about somebody going on and exploring
something with eagle eye but ten lines from the end i found a sentence
which corresponded with one six pages from the end of the english
translation  after this there could be little doubt that the whole of
these last six english pages were spurious matter  what little doubt
remained was afterwards removed by my finding that they had no place in
any part of the genuine article  i looked for the passage about
coleridges using the word darwinising it was not to be found in the
german  i looked for the piece i had quoted from buffon about
rudimentary organs but there was nothing of it nor indeed any reference
to buffon  it was plain therefore that the article which mr darwin
had given was not the one he professed to be giving  i read mr darwins
preface over again to see whether he left himself any loophole  there
was not a chink or cranny through which escape was possible  the only
inference that could be drawn was either that some one had imposed upon
mr darwin or that mr darwin although it was not possible to suppose
him ignorant of the interpolations that had been made nor of the obvious
purpose of the concluding sentence had nevertheless palmed off an
article which had been added to and made to attack evolution old and
new as though it were the original article which appeared before that
book was written  i could not and would not believe that mr darwin had
condescended to this  nevertheless i saw it was necessary to sift the
whole matter and began to compare the german and the english articles
paragraph by paragraph
on the first page i found a passage omitted from the english which with
great labour i managed to get through and can now translate as follows
    alexander von humboldt used to take pleasure in recounting how
    powerfully forsters pictures of the south sea islands and st
    pierres illustrations of nature had provoked his ardour for travel
    and influenced his career as a scientific investigator  how much
    more impressively must the works of dr erasmus darwin with their
    reiterated foreshadowing of a more lofty interpretation of nature
    have affected his grandson who in his youth assuredly approached
    them with the devotion due to the works of a renowned poet 43
i then came upon a passage common to both german and english which in
its turn was followed in the english by the subapologetic paragraph
which i had been struck with on first reading and which was not in the
german its place being taken by a much longer passage which had no place
in the english  a little farther on i was amused at coming upon the
following and at finding it wholly transformed in the supposed accurate
translation
    how must this early and penetrating explanation of rudimentary
    organs have affected the grandson when he read the poem of his
    ancestor  but indeed the biological remarks of this accurate
    observer in regard to certain definite natural objects must have
    produced a still deeper impression upon him pointing as they do to
    questions which hay attained so great a prominence at the present
    day such as why is any creature anywhere such as we actually see it
    and nothing else  why has such and such a plant poisonous juices
    why has such and such another thorns  why have birds and fishes
    lightcoloured breasts and dark backs and why does every creature
    resemble the one from which it sprung 44a
i will not weary the reader with further details as to the omissions from
and additions to the german text  let it suffice that the socalled
translation begins on p 131 and ends on p 216 of mr darwins book
there is new matter on each one of the pp 132139 while almost the
whole of pp 147152 inclusive and the whole of pp 211216 inclusive
are spuriousthat is to say not what the purport to be not translations
from an article that was published in february 1879 and before
evolution old and new but interpolations not published till six
months after that book
bearing in mind the contents of two of the added passages and the tenor
of the concluding sentence quoted above 44b i could no longer doubt
that the article had been altered by the light of and with a view to
evolution old and new
the steps are perfectly clear  first dr krause published his article in
kosmos and my book was announced its purport being thus made obvious
both in the month of february 1879  soon afterwards arrangements were
made for a translation of dr krauses essay and were completed by the
end of april  then my book came out and in some way or other dr krause
happened to get hold of it  he helped himselfnot to much but to
enough made what other additions to and omissions from his article he
thought would best meet evolution old and new and then fell to
condemning that book in a finale that was meant to be crushing  nothing
was said about the revision which dr krauses work had undergone but it
was expressly and particularly declared in the preface that the english
translation was an accurate version of what appeared in the february
number of kosmos and no less expressly and particularly stated that my
book was published subsequently to this  both these statements are
untrue they are in mr darwins favour and prejudicial to myself
all this was done with that wellknown happy simplicity of which the
pall mall gazette december 12 1879 declared that mr darwin was a
master  the final sentence about the weakness of thought and mental
anachronism which no one can envy was especially successful  the
reviewer in the pall mall gazette just quoted from gave it in full and
said that it was thoroughly justified  he then mused forth a general
gnome that the confidence of writers who deal in semiscientific
paradoxes is commonly in inverse proportion to their grasp of the
subject  again my vanity suggested to me that i was the person for
whose benefit this gnome was intended  my vanity indeed was well fed
by the whole transaction for i saw that not only did mr darwin who
should be the best judge think my work worth notice but that he did not
venture to meet it openly  as for dr krauses concluding sentence i
thought that when a sentence had been antedated the less it contained
about anachronism the better
only one of the reviews that i saw of mr darwins life of erasmus
darwin showed any knowledge of the facts  the popular science review
for january 1880 in flat contradiction to mr darwins preface said
that only part of dr krauses article was being given by mr darwin
this reviewer had plainly seen both kosmos and mr darwins book
in the same number of the popular science review and immediately
following the review of mr darwins book there is a review of
evolution old and new  the writer of this review quotes the passage
about mental anachronism as quoted by the reviewer in the pall mall
gazette and adds immediately this anachronism has been committed by
mr samuel butler in a    little volume now before us and it is
doubtless to this which appeared while his own work was in progress
italics mine that dr krause alludes in the foregoing passage
considering that the editor of the popular science review and the
translator of dr krauses article for mr darwin are one and the same
person it is likely the popular science review is well informed in
saying that my book appeared before dr krauses article had been
transformed into its present shape and that my book was intended by the
passage in question
unable to see any way of escaping from a conclusion which i could not
willingly adopt i thought it best to write to mr darwin stating the
facts as they appeared to myself and asking an explanation which i
would have gladly strained a good many points to have accepted  it is
better perhaps that i should give my letter and darwins answer in
full  my letter ran thus
                                                        january 2 1880
    charles darwin esq frs c
    dear sirwill you kindly refer me to the edition of kosmos which
    contains the text of dr krauses article on dr erasmus darwin as
    translated by mr w s dallas
    i have before me the last february number of kosmos which appears
    by your preface to be the one from which mr dallas has translated
    but his translation contains long and important passages which are
    not in the february number of kosmos while many passages in the
    original article are omitted in the translation
    among the passages introduced are the last six pages of the english
    article which seem to condemn by anticipation the position i have
    taken as regards dr erasmus darwin in my book evolution old and
    new and which i believe i was the first to take  the concluding
    and therefore perhaps most prominent sentence of the translation
    you have given to the public stands thus
    erasmus darwins system was in itself a most significant first step
    in the path of knowledge which his grandson has opened up for us but
    to wish to revive it at the present day as has actually been
    seriously attempted shows a weakness of thought and a mental
    anachronism which no man can envy
    the kosmos which has been sent me from germany contains no such
    passage
    as you have stated in your preface that my book evolution old and
    new appeared subsequently to dr krauses article and as no
    intimation is given that the article has been altered and added to
    since its original appearance while the accuracy of the translation
    as though from the february number of kosmos is as you expressly
    say guaranteed by mr dallass scientific reputation together with
    his knowledge of german your readers will naturally suppose that
    all they read in the translation appeared in february last and
    therefore before evolution old and new was written and therefore
    independently of and necessarily without reference to that book
    i do not doubt that this was actually the case but have failed to
    obtain the edition which contains the passage above referred to and
    several others which appear in the translation
    i have a personal interest in this matter and venture therefore to
    ask for the explanation which i do not doubt you will readily give
    meyours faithfully s butler
the following is mr darwins answer
                                                        january 3 1880
    my dear sirdr krause soon after the appearance of his article in
    kosmos told me that he intended to publish it separately and to
    alter it considerably and the altered ms was sent to mr dallas for
    translation  this is so common a practice that it never occurred to
    me to state that the article had been modified but now i much regret
    that i did not do so  the original will soon appear in german and i
    believe will be a much larger book than the english one for with
    dr krauses consent many long extracts from miss seward were
    omitted as well as much other matter from being in my opinion
    superfluous for the english reader  i believe that the omitted parts
    will appear as notes in the german edition  should there be a
    reprint of the english life i will state that the original as it
    appeared in kosmos was modified by dr krause before it was
    translated  i may add that i had obtained dr krauses consent for a
    translation and had arranged with mr dallas before your book was
    announced  i remember this because mr dallas wrote to tell me of
    the advertisementi remain yours faithfully c darwin
this was not a letter i could accept  if mr darwin had said that by
some inadvertence which he was unable to excuse or account for a
blunder had been made which he would at once correct so far as was in his
power by a letter to the times or the athenum and that a notice of
the erratum should be printed on a flyleaf and pasted into all unsold
copies of the life of erasmus darwin there would have been no more
heard about the matter from me but when mr darwin maintained that it
was a common practice to take advantage of an opportunity of revising a
work to interpolate a covert attack upon an opponent and at the same
time to misdate the interpolated matter by expressly stating that it
appeared months sooner than it actually did and prior to the work which
it attacked when he maintained that what was being done was so common a
practice that it never occurred to himthe writer of some twenty
volumesto do what all literary men must know to be inexorably requisite
i thought this was going far beyond what was permissible in honourable
warfare and that it was time in the interests of literary and
scientific morality even more than in my own to appeal to public
opinion  i was particularly struck with the use of the words it never
occurred to me and felt how completely of a piece it was with the
opening paragraph of the origin of species  it was not merely that it
did not occur to mr darwin to state that the article had been modified
since it was writtenthis would have been bad enough under the
circumstances but that it did occur to him to go out of his way to say
what was not true  there was no necessity for him to have said anything
about my book  it appeared moreover inadequate to tell me that if a
reprint of the english life was wanted which might or might not be the
case and if it was not the case why a shrug of the shoulders and i
must make the best of it mr darwin might perhaps silently omit his
note about my book as he omitted his misrepresentation of the author of
the vestiges of creation and put the words revised and corrected by
the author on his titlepage
no matter how high a writer may stand nor what services he may have
unquestionably rendered it cannot be for the general wellbeing that he
should be allowed to set aside the fundamental principles of
straightforwardness and fair play  when i thought of buffon of dr
erasmus darwin of lamarck and even of the author of the vestiges of
creation to all of whom mr darwin had dealt the same measure which he
was now dealing to myself when i thought of these great men now dumb
who had borne the burden and heat of the day and whose laurels had been
filched from them of the manner too in which mr darwin had been
abetted by those who should have been the first to detect the fallacy
which had misled him of the hotbed of intrigue which science has now
become of the disrepute into which we english must fall as a nation if
such practices as mr darwin had attempted in this case were to be
toleratedwhen i thought of all this i felt that though prayers for the
repose of dead mens souls might be unavailing yet a defence of their
work and memory no matter against what odds might avail the living and
resolved that i would do my utmost to make my countrymen aware of the
spirit now ruling among those whom they delight to honour
at first i thought i ought to continue the correspondence privately with
mr darwin and explain to him that his letter was insufficient but on
reflection i felt that little good was likely to come of a second letter
if what i had already written was not enough  i therefore wrote to the
athenum and gave a condensed account of the facts contained in the
last ten or a dozen pages  my letter appeared january 31 1880 50
the accusation was a very grave one it was made in a very public place
i gave my name i adduced the strongest prim facie grounds for the
acceptance of my statements but there was no rejoinder and for the best
of all reasonsthat no rejoinder was possible  besides what is the good
of having a reputation for candour if one may not stand upon it at a
pinch  i never yet knew a person with an especial reputation for candour
without finding sooner or later that he had developed it as animals
develop their organs through sense of need  not only did mr darwin
remain perfectly quiet but all reviewers and littrateurs remained
perfectly quiet also  it seemedthough i do not for a moment believe
that this is soas if public opinion rather approved of what mr darwin
had done and of his silence than otherwise  i saw the life of erasmus
darwin more frequently and more prominently advertised now than i had
seen it hithertoperhaps in the hope of selling off the adulterated
copies and being able to reprint the work with a corrected title page
presently i saw professor huxley hastening to the rescue with his lecture
on the coming of age of the origin of species and by may it was easy
for professor ray lankester to imply that mr darwin was the greatest of
living men  i have since noticed two or three other controversies raging
in the athenum and times in each of these cases i saw it assumed
that the defeated party when proved to have publicly misrepresented his
adversary should do his best to correct in public the injury which he
had publicly inflicted but i noticed that in none of them had the beaten
side any especial reputation for candour  this probably made all the
difference  but however this may be mr darwin left me in possession of
the field in the hope doubtless that the matter would blow overwhich
it apparently soon did  whether it has done so in reality or no is a
matter which remains to be seen  my own belief is that people paid no
attention to what i said as believing it simply incredible and that
when they come to know that it is true they will think as i do
concerning it
from ladies and gentlemen of science i admit that i have no expectations
there is no conduct so dishonourable that people will not deny it or
explain it away if it has been committed by one whom they recognise as
of their own persuasion  it must be remembered that facts cannot be
respected by the scientist in the same way as by other people  it is his
business to familiarise himself with facts and as we all know the path
from familiarity to contempt is an easy one
here then i take leave of this matter for the present  if it appears
that i have used language such as is rarely seen in controversy let the
reader remember that the occasion is so far as i know unparalleled for
the cynicism and audacity with which the wrong complained of was
committed and persisted in  i trust however that though not
indifferent to this my indignation has been mainly roused as when i
wrote evolution old and new before mr darwin had given me personal
ground of complaint against him by the wrongs he has inflicted on dead
men on whose behalf i now fight as i trust that some onewhom i thank
by anticipationmay one day fight on mine
chapter v
introduction to professor herings lecture
after i had finished evolution old and new i wrote some articles for
the examiner 52 in which i carried out the idea put forward in life
and habit that we are one person with our ancestors  it follows from
this that all living animals and vegetables beingas appears likely if
the theory of evolution is accepteddescended from a common ancestor are
in reality one person and unite to form a body corporate of whose
existence however they are unconscious  there is an obvious analogy
between this and the manner in which the component cells of our bodies
unite to form our single individuality of which it is not likely they
have a conception and with which they have probably only the same
partial and imperfect sympathy as we the body corporate have with them
in the articles above alluded to i separated the organic from the
inorganic and when i came to rewrite them i found that this could not
be done and that i must reconstruct what i had written  i was at work
on thisto which i hope to return shortlywhen dr krauses erasmus
darwin with its preliminary notice by mr charles darwin came out and
having been compelled as i have shown above by dr krauses work to
look a little into the german language the opportunity seemed favourable
for going on with it and becoming acquainted with professor herings
lecture  i therefore began to translate his lecture at once with the
kind assistance of friends whose patience seemed inexhaustible and found
myself well rewarded for my trouble
professor hering and i to use a metaphor of his own are as men who have
observed the action of living beings upon the stage of the world he from
the point of view at once of a spectator and of one who has free access
to much of what goes on behind the scenes i from that of a spectator
only with none but the vaguest notion of the actual manner in which the
stage machinery is worked  if two men so placed after years of
reflection arrive independently of one another at an identical
conclusion as regards the manner in which this machinery must have been
invented and perfected it is natural that each should take a deep
interest in the arguments of the other and be anxious to put them
forward with the utmost possible prominence  it seems to me that the
theory which professor hering and i are supporting in common is one the
importance of which is hardly inferior to that of the theory of evolution
itselffor it puts the backbone as it were into the theory of
evolution  i shall therefore make no apology for laying my translation
of professor herings work before my reader
concerning the identity of the main idea put forward in life and habit
with that of professor herings lecture there can hardly i think be
two opinions  we both of us maintain that we grow our limbs as we do
and possess the instincts we possess because we remember having grown
our limbs in this way and having had these instincts in past generations
when we were in the persons of our forefatherseach individual life
adding a small but so small in any one lifetime as to be hardly
appreciable amount of new experience to the general store of memory
that we have thus got into certain habits which we can now rarely break
and that we do much of what we do unconsciously on the same principle as
that whatever it is on which we do all other habitual actions with the
greater ease and unconsciousness the more often we repeat them  not only
is the main idea the same but i was surprised to find how often
professor hering and i had taken the same illustrations with which to
point our meaning
nevertheless we have each of us left undealt with some points which the
other has treated of  professor hering for example goes into the
question of what memory is and this i did not venture to do  i confined
myself to saying that whatever memory was heredity was also  professor
hering adds that memory is due to vibrations of the molecules of the
nerve fibres which under certain circumstances recur and bring about a
corresponding recurrence of visible action
this approaches closely to the theory concerning the physics of memory
which has been most generally adopted since the time of bonnet who wrote
as follows
    the soul never has a new sensation but by the inter position of the
    senses  this sensation has been originally attached to the motion of
    certain fibres  its reproduction or recollection by the senses will
    then be likewise connected with these same fibres    54a
and again
    it appeared to me that since this memory is connected with the body
    it must depend upon some change which must happen to the primitive
    state of the sensible fibres by the action of objects  i have
    therefore admitted as probable that the state of the fibres on which
    an object has acted is not precisely the same after this action as it
    was before i have conjectured that the sensible fibres experience
    more or less durable modifications which constitute the physics of
    memory and recollection 54b
professor hering comes near to endorsing this view and uses it for the
purpose of explaining personal identity  this at least is what he does
in fact though perhaps hardly in words  i did not say more upon the
essence of personality than that it was inseparable from the idea that
the various phases of our existence should have flowed one out of the
other in what we see as a continuous though it may be at times a very
troubled stream 55 but i maintained that the identity between two
successive generations was of essentially the same kind as that existing
between an infant and an octogenarian  i thus left personal identity
unexplained though insisting that it was the key to two apparently
distinct sets of phenomena the one of which had been hitherto considered
incompatible with our ideas concerning it  professor hering insists on
this too but he gives us farther insight into what personal identity is
and explains how it is that the phenomena of heredity are phenomena also
of personal identity
he implies though in the short space at his command he has hardly said
so in express terms that personal identity as we commonly think of
itthat is to say as confined to the single life of the
individualconsists in the uninterruptedness of a sufficient number of
vibrations which have been communicated from molecule to molecule of the
nerve fibres and which go on communicating each one of them its own
peculiar characteristic elements to the new matter which we introduce
into the body by way of nutrition  these vibrations may be so gentle as
to be imperceptible for years together but they are there and may
become perceived if they receive accession through the running into them
of a wave going the same way as themselves which wave has been set up in
the ether by exterior objects and has been communicated to the organs of
sense
as these pages are on the point of leaving my hands i see the following
remarkable passage in mind for the current month and introduce it
parenthetically here
    i followed the sluggish current of hyaline material issuing from
    globules of most primitive living substance  persistently it
    followed its way into space conquering at first the manifold
    resistances opposed to it by its watery medium  gradually however
    its energies became exhausted till at last completely overwhelmed
    it stopped an immovable projection stagnated to deathlike rigidity
    thus for hours perhaps it remained stationary one of many such
    rays of some of the many kinds of protoplasmic stars  by degrees
    then or perhaps quite suddenly help would come to it from foreign
    but congruous sources  it would seem to combine with outside
    complemental matter drifted to it at random  slowly it would regain
    thereby its vital mobility  shrinking at first but gradually
    completely restored and reincorporated into the onward tide of life
    it was ready to take part again in the progressive flow of a new
    ray 56
to return to the end of the last paragraph but one  if this is sobut i
should warn the reader that professor hering is not responsible for this
suggestion though it seems to follow so naturally from what he has said
that i imagine he intended the inference to be drawnif this is so
assimilation is nothing else than the communication of its own rhythms
from the assimilating to the assimilated substance to the effacement of
the vibrations or rhythms heretofore existing in this last and
suitability for food will depend upon whether the rhythms of the
substance eaten are such as to flow harmoniously into and chime in with
those of the body which has eaten it or whether they will refuse to act
in concert with the new rhythms with which they have become associated
and will persist obstinately in pursuing their own course  in this case
they will either be turned out of the body at once or will disconcert
its arrangements with perhaps fatal consequences  this comes round to
the conclusion i arrived at in life and habit that assimilation was
nothing but the imbuing of one thing with the memories of another  see
life and habit pp 136 137 140 c
it will be noted that as i resolved the phenomena of heredity into
phenomena of personal identity and left the matter there so professor
hering resolves the phenomena of personal identity into the phenomena of
a living mechanism whose equilibrium is disturbed by vibrations of a
certain characterand leaves it there  we now want to understand more
about the vibrations
but if according to professor hering the personal identity of the
single life consists in the uninterruptedness of vibrations so also do
the phenomena of heredity  for not only may vibrations of a certain
violence or character be persistent unperceived for many years in a
living body and communicate themselves to the matter it has assimilated
but they may and will under certain circumstances extend to the
particle which is about to leave the parent body as the germ of its
future offspring  in this minute piece of matter there must if
professor hering is right be an infinity of rhythmic undulations
incessantly vibrating with more or less activity and ready to be set in
more active agitation at a moments warning under due accession of
vibration from exterior objects  on the occurrence of such stimulus
that is to say when a vibration of a suitable rhythm from without
concurs with one within the body so as to augment it the agitation may
gather such strength that the touch as it were is given to a house of
cards and the whole comes toppling over  this toppling over is what we
call action and when it is the result of the disturbance of certain
usual arrangements in certain usual ways we call it the habitual
development and instinctive characteristics of the race  in either case
then whether we consider the continued identity of the individual in
what we call his single life or those features in his offspring which we
refer to heredity the same explanation of the phenomena is applicable
it follows from this as a matter of course that the continuation of life
or personal identity in the individual and the race are fundamentally of
the same kind or in other words that there is a veritable prolongation
of identity or oneness of personality between parents and offspring
professor hering reaches his conclusion by physical methods while i
reached mine as i am told by metaphysical  i never yet could
understand what metaphysics and metaphysical mean but i should have
said i reached it by the exercise of a little common sense while
regarding certain facts which are open to every one  there is however
so far as i can see no difference in the conclusion come to
the view which connects memory with vibrations may tend to throw light
upon that difficult question the manner in which neuter bees acquire
structures and instincts not one of which was possessed by any of their
direct ancestors  those who have read life and habit may remember i
suggested that the food prepared in the stomachs of the nursebees with
which the neuter working bees are fed might thus acquire a quasiseminal
character and be made a means of communicating the instincts and
structures in question 58  if assimilation be regarded as the
receiving by one substance of the rhythms or undulations from another
the explanation just referred to receives an accession of probability
if it is objected that professor herings theory as to continuity of
vibrations being the key to memory and heredity involves the action of
more wheels within wheels than our imagination can come near to
comprehending and also that it supposes this complexity of action as
going on within a compass which no unaided eye can detect by reason of
its littleness so that we are carried into a fairy land with which sober
people should have nothing to do it may be answered that the case of
light affords us an example of our being truly aware of a multitude of
minute actions the hundred million millionth part of which we should
have declared to be beyond our ken could we not incontestably prove that
we notice and count them all with a very sufficient and creditable
accuracy
who would not 59a says sir john herschel ask for demonstration
when told that a gnats wing in its ordinary flight beats many hundred
times in a second or that there exist animated and regularly organised
beings many thousands of whose bodies laid close together would not
extend to an inch  but what are these to the astonishing truths which
modern optical inquiries have disclosed which teach us that every point
of a medium through which a ray of light passes is affected with a
succession of periodical movements recurring regularly at equal
intervals no less than five hundred millions of millions of times in a
second that it is by such movements communicated to the nerves of our
eyes that we see nay more that it is the difference in the frequency
of their recurrence which affects us with the sense of the diversity of
colour that for instance in acquiring the sensation of redness our
eyes are affected four hundred and eightytwo millions of millions of
times of yellowness five hundred and fortytwo millions of millions of
times and of violet seven hundred and seven millions of millions of
times per second 59b  do not such things sound more like the ravings
of madmen than the sober conclusions of people in their waking senses
they are nevertheless conclusions to which any one may most certainly
arrive who will only be at the pains of examining the chain of reasoning
by which they have been obtained
a man counting as hard as he can repeat numbers one after another and
never counting more than a hundred so that he shall have no long words
to repeat may perhaps count ten thousand or a hundred a hundred times
over in an hour  at this rate counting night and day and allowing no
time for rest or refreshment he would count one million in four days and
four hours or say four days only  to count a million a million times
over he would require four million days or roughly ten thousand years
for five hundred millions of millions he must have the utterly
unrealisable period of five million years  yet he actually goes through
this stupendous piece of reckoning unconsciously hour after hour day
after day it may be for eighty years often in each second of
daylight and how much more by artificial or subdued light i do not know
he knows whether his eye is being struck five hundred millions of
millions of times or only four hundred and eightytwo millions of
millions of times  he thus shows that he estimates or counts each set of
vibrations and registers them according to his results  if a man writes
upon the back of a british museum blottingpad of the common nonpareil
pattern on which there are some thousands of small spaces each differing
in colour from that which is immediately next to it his eye will
nevertheless without an effort assign its true colour to each one of
these spaces  this implies that he is all the time counting and taking
tally of the difference in the numbers of the vibrations from each one of
the small spaces in question  yet the mind that is capable of such
stupendous computations as these so long as it knows nothing about them
makes no little fuss about the conscious adding together of such almost
inconceivably minute numbers as we will say 2730169 and 5790135or if
these be considered too large as 27 and 19  let the reader remember
that he cannot by any effort bring before his mind the units not in
ones but in millions of millions of the processes which his visual
organs are undergoing second after second from dawn till dark and then
let him demur if he will to the possibility of the existence in a germ
of currents and undercurrents and rhythms and counter rhythms also by
the million of millionseach one of which on being overtaken by the
rhythm from without that chimes in with and stimulates it may be the
beginning of that unsettlement of equilibrium which results in the crash
of action unless it is timely counteracted
if another objector maintains that the vibrations within the germ as
above supposed must be continually crossing and interfering with one
another in such a manner as to destroy the continuity of any one series
it may be replied that the vibrations of the light proceeding from the
objects that surround us traverse one another by the millions of millions
every second yet in no way interfere with one another  nevertheless it
must be admitted that the difficulties of the theory towards which i
suppose professor hering to incline are like those of all other theories
on the same subjectalmost inconceivably great
in life and habit i did not touch upon these vibrations knowing
nothing about them  here then is one important point of difference
not between the conclusions arrived at but between the aim and scope of
the work that professor hering and i severally attempted  another
difference consists in the points at which we have left off  professor
hering having established his main thesis is content  i on the other
hand went on to maintain that if vigour was due to memory want of
vigour was due to want of memory  thus i was led to connect memory with
the phenomena of hybridism and of old age to show that the sterility of
certain animals under domestication is only a phase of and of a piece
with the very common sterility of hybridsphenomena which at first sight
have no connection either with each other or with memory but the
connection between which will never be lost sight of by those who have
once laid hold of it  i also pointed out how exactly the phenomena of
development agreed with those of the abeyance and recurrence of memory
and the rationale of the fact that puberty in so many animals and plants
comes about the end of development  the principle underlying longevity
follows as a matter of course  i have no idea how far professor hering
would agree with me in the position i have taken in respect of these
phenomena but there is nothing in the above at variance with his
lecture
another matter on which professor hering has not touched is the bearing
of his theory on that view of evolution which is now commonly accepted
it is plain he accepts evolution but it does not appear that he sees how
fatal his theory is to any view of evolution except a teleological
onethe purpose residing within the animal and not without it  there is
however nothing in his lecture to indicate that he does not see this
it should be remembered that the question whether memory is due to the
persistence within the body of certain vibrations which have been
already set up within the bodies of its ancestors is true or no will
not affect the position i took up in life and habit  in that book i
have maintained nothing more than that whatever memory is heredity is
also  i am not committed to the vibration theory of memory though
inclined to accept it on a prim facie view  all i am committed to is
that if memory is due to persistence of vibrations so is heredity and
if memory is not so due then no more is heredity
finally i may say that professor herings lecture the passage quoted
from dr erasmus darwin on p 26 of this volume and a few hints in the
extracts from mr patrick mathew which i have quoted in evolution old
and new are all that i yet know of in other writers as pointing to the
conclusion that the phenomena of heredity are phenomena also of memory
chapter vi
professor ewald hering on memory
i will now lay before the reader a translation of professor herings own
words  i have had it carefully revised throughout by a gentleman whose
native language is german but who has resided in england for many years
past  the original lecture is entitled on memory as a universal
function of organised matter and was delivered at the anniversary
meeting of the imperial academy of sciences at vienna may 30 1870 63
it is as follows
when the student of nature quits the narrow workshop of his own
particular inquiry and sets out upon an excursion into the vast kingdom
of philosophical investigation he does so doubtless in the hope of
finding the answer to that great riddle to the solution of a small part
of which he devotes his life  those however whom he leaves behind him
still working at their own special branch of inquiry regard his
departure with secret misgivings on his behalf while the born citizens
of the kingdom of speculation among whom he would naturalise himself
receive him with wellauthorised distrust  he is likely therefore to
lose ground with the first while not gaining it with the second
the subject to the consideration of which i would now solicit your
attention does certainly appear likely to lure us on towards the
flattering land of speculation but bearing in mind what i have just
said i will beware of quitting the department of natural science to
which i have devoted myself hitherto  i shall however endeavour to
attain its highest point so as to take a freer view of the surrounding
territory
it will soon appear that i should fail in this purpose if my remarks were
to confine themselves solely to physiology  i hope to show how far
psychological investigations also afford not only permissible but
indispensable aid to physiological inquiries
consciousness is an accompaniment of that animal and human organisation
and of that material mechanism which it is the province of physiology to
explore and as long as the atoms of the brain follow their due course
according to certain definite laws there arises an inner life which
springs from sensation and idea from feeling and will
we feel this in our own cases it strikes us in our converse with other
people we can see it plainly in the more highly organised animals even
the lowest forms of life bear traces of it and who can draw a line in
the kingdom of organic life and say that it is here the soul ceases
with what eyes then is physiology to regard this twofold life of the
organised world  shall she close them entirely to one whole side of it
that she may fix them more intently on the other
so long as the physiologist is content to be a physicist and nothing
moreusing the word physicist in its widest significationhis position
in regard to the organic world is one of extreme but legitimate
onesidedness  as the crystal to the mineralogist or the vibrating
string to the acoustician so from this point of view both man and the
lower animals are to the physiologist neither more nor less than the
matter of which they consist  that animals feel desire and repugnance
that the material mechanism of the human frame is in chose connection
with emotions of pleasure or pain and with the active idealife of
consciousnessthis cannot in the eyes of the physicist make the animal
or human body into anything more than what it actually is  to him it is
a combination of matter subjected to the same inflexible laws as stones
and plantsa material combination the outward and inward movements of
which interact as cause and effect and are in as close connection with
each other and with their surroundings as the working of a machine with
the revolutions of the wheels that compose it
neither sensation nor idea nor yet conscious will can form a link in
this chain of material occurrences which make up the physical life of an
organism  if i am asked a question and reply to it the material process
which the nerve fibre conveys from the organ of hearing to the brain must
travel through my brain as an actual and material process before it can
reach the nerves which will act upon my organs of speech  it cannot on
reaching a given place in the brain change then and there into an
immaterial something and turn up again some time afterwards in another
part of the brain as a material process  the traveller in the desert
might as well hope before he again goes forth into the wilderness of
reality to take rest and refreshment in the oasis with which the fata
morgana illudes him or as well might a prisoner hope to escape from his
prison through a door reflected in a mirror
so much for the physiologist in his capacity of pure physicist  as long
as he remains behind the scenes in painful exploration of the details of
the machineryas long as he only observes the action of the players from
behind the stageso long will he miss the spirit of the performance
which is nevertheless caught easily by one who sees it from the front
may he not then for once in a way be allowed to change his standpoint
true he came not to see the representation of an imaginary world he is
in search of the actual but surely it must help him to a comprehension
of the dramatic apparatus itself and of the manner in which it is
worked if he were to view its action from in front as well as from
behind or at least allow himself to hear what soberminded spectators
can tell him upon the subject
there can be no question as to the answer and hence it comes that
psychology is such an indispensable help to physiology whose fault it
only in small part is that she has hitherto made such little use of this
assistance for psychology has been late in beginning to till her fertile
field with the plough of the inductive method and it is only from ground
so tilled that fruits can spring which can be of service to physiology
if then the student of nervous physiology takes his stand between the
physicist and the psychologist and if the first of these rightly makes
the unbroken causative continuity of all material processes an axiom of
his system of investigation the prudent psychologist on the other hand
will investigate the laws of conscious life according to the inductive
method and will hence as much as the physicist make the existence of
fixed laws his initial assumption  if again the most superficial
introspection teaches the physiologist that his conscious life is
dependent upon the mechanical adjustments of his body and that inversely
his body is subjected with certain limitations to his will then it only
remains for him to make one assumption more namely that this mutual
interdependence between the spiritual and the material is itself also
dependent on law and he has discovered the bond by which the science of
matter and the science of consciousness are united into a single whole
thus regarded the phenomena of consciousness become functions of the
material changes of organised substance and inverselythough this is
involved in the use of the word functionthe material processes of
brain substance become functions of the phenomena of consciousness  for
when two variables are so dependent upon one another in the changes they
undergo in accordance with fixed laws that a change in either involves
simultaneous and corresponding change in the other the one is called a
function of the other
this then by no means implies that the two variables abovenamedmatter
and consciousnessstand in the relation of cause and effect antecedent
and consequence to one another  for on this subject we know nothing
the materialist regards consciousness as a product or result of matter
while the idealist holds matter to be a result of consciousness and a
third maintains that matter and spirit are identical with all this the
physiologist as such has nothing whatever to do his sole concern is
with the fact that matter and consciousness are functions one of the
other
by the help of this hypothesis of the functional interdependence of
matter and spirit modern physiology is enabled to bring the phenomena of
consciousness within the domain of her investigations without leaving the
terra firma of scientific methods  the physiologist as physicist can
follow the ray of light and the wave of sound or heat till they reach the
organ of sense  he can watch them entering upon the ends of the nerves
and finding their way to the cells of the brain by means of the series of
undulations or vibrations which they establish in the nerve filaments
here however he loses all trace of them  on the other hand still
looking with the eyes of a pure physicist he sees sound waves of speech
issue from the mouth of a speaker he observes the motion of his own
limbs and finds how this is conditional upon muscular contractions
occasioned by the motor nerves and how these nerves are in their turn
excited by the cells of the central organ  but here again his knowledge
comes to an end  true he sees indications of the bridge which is to
carry him from excitation of the sensory to that of the motor nerves in
the labyrinth of intricately interwoven nerve cells but he knows nothing
of the inconceivably complex process which is introduced at this stage
here the physiologist will change his standpoint what matter will not
reveal to his inquiry he will find in the mirror as it were of
consciousness by way of a reflection indeed only but a reflection
nevertheless which stands in intimate relation to the object of his
inquiry  when at this point he observes how one idea gives rise to
another how closely idea is connected with sensation and sensation with
will and how thought again and feeling are inseparable from one
another he will be compelled to suppose corresponding successions of
material processes which generate and are closely connected with one
another and which attend the whole machinery of conscious life
according to the law of the functional interdependence of matter and
consciousness
                                    
after this explanation i shall venture to regard under a single aspect a
great series of phenomena which apparently have nothing to do with one
another and which belong partly to the conscious and partly to the
unconscious life of organised beings  i shall regard them as the outcome
of one and the same primary force of organised matternamely its memory
or power of reproduction
the word memory is often understood as though it meant nothing more
than our faculty of intentionally reproducing ideas or series of ideas
but when the figures and events of bygone days rise up again unbidden in
our minds is not this also an act of recollection or memory  we have a
perfect right to extend our conception of memory so as to make it embrace
involuntary reproductions of sensations ideas perceptions and
efforts but we find on having done so that we have so far enlarged her
boundaries that she proves to be an ultimate and original power the
source and at the same time the unifying bond of our whole conscious
life
we know that when an impression or a series of impressions has been
made upon our senses for a long time and always in the same way it may
come to impress itself in such a manner upon the socalled sensememory
that hours afterwards and though a hundred other things have occupied
our attention meanwhile it will yet return suddenly to our consciousness
with all the force and freshness of the original sensation  a whole
group of sensations is sometimes reproduced in its due sequence as
regards time and space with so much reality that it illudes us as
though things were actually present which have long ceased to be so  we
have here a striking proof of the fact that after both conscious
sensation and perception have been extinguished their material vestiges
yet remain in our nervous system by way of a change in its molecular or
atomic disposition 69 that enables the nerve substance to reproduce
all the physical processes of the original sensation and with these the
corresponding psychical processes of sensation and perception
every hour the phenomena of sensememory are present with each one of us
but in a less degree than this  we are all at times aware of a host of
more or less faded recollections of earlier impressions which we either
summon intentionally or which come upon us involuntarily  visions of
absent people come and go before us as faint and fleeting shadows and
the notes of longforgotten melodies float around us not actually heard
but yet perceptible
some things and occurrences especially if they have happened to us only
once and hurriedly will be reproducible by the memory in respect only of
a few conspicuous qualities in other cases those details alone will
recur to us which we have met with elsewhere and for the reception of
which the brain is so to speak attuned  these last recollections find
themselves in fuller accord with our consciousness and enter upon it
more easily and energetically hence also their aptitude for reproduction
is enhanced so that what is common to many things and is therefore felt
and perceived with exceptional frequency becomes reproduced so easily
that eventually the actual presence of the corresponding external
stimuli is no longer necessary and it will recur on the vibrations set
up by faint stimuli from within 70  sensations arising in this way
from within as for example an idea of whiteness are not indeed
perceived with the full freshness of those raised by the actual presence
of white light without us but they are of the same kind they are feeble
repetitions of one and the same material brain processof one and the
same conscious sensation  thus the idea of whiteness arises in our mind
as a faint almost extinct sensation
in this way those qualities which are common to many things become
separated as it were in our memory from the objects with which they
were originally associated and attain an independent existence in our
consciousness as ideas and conceptions and thus the whole rich
superstructure of our ideas and conceptions is built up from materials
supplied by memory
on examining more closely we see plainly that memory is a faculty not
only of our conscious states but also and much more so of our
unconscious ones  i was conscious of this or that yesterday and am
again conscious of it today  where has it been meanwhile  it does not
remain continuously within my consciousness nevertheless it returns
after having quitted it  our ideas tread but for a moment upon the stage
of consciousness and then go back again behind the scenes to make way
for others in their place  as the player is only a king when he is on
the stage so they too exist as ideas so long only as they are
recognised  how do they live when they are off the stage  for we know
that they are living somewhere give them their cue and they reappear
immediately  they do not exist continuously as ideas what is continuous
is the special disposition of nerve substance in virtue of which this
substance gives out today the same sound which it gave yesterday if it
is rightly struck 71  countless reproductions of organic processes of
our brain connect themselves orderly together so that one acts as a
stimulus to the next but a phenomenon of consciousness is not
necessarily attached to every link in the chain  from this it arises
that a series of ideas may appear to disregard the order that would be
observed in purely material processes of brain substance unaccompanied by
consciousness but on the other hand it becomes possible for a long chain
of recollections to have its due development without each link in the
chain being necessarily perceived by ourselves  one may emerge from the
bosom of our unconscious thoughts without fully entering upon the stage
of conscious perception another dies away in unconsciousness leaving no
successor to take its place  between the me of today and the me of
yesterday lie night and sleep abysses of unconsciousness nor is there
any bridge but memory with which to span them  who can hope after this
to disentangle the infinite intricacy of our inner life  for we can only
follow its threads so far as they have strayed over within the bounds of
consciousness  we might as well hope to familiarise ourselves with the
world of forms that teem within the bosom of the sea by observing the few
that now and again come to the surface and soon return into the deep
the bond of union therefore which connects the individual phenomena of
our consciousness lies in our unconscious world and as we know nothing
of this but what investigation into the laws of matter teach usas in
fact for purely experimental purposes matter and the unconscious
must be one and the same thingso the physiologist has a full right to
denote memory as in the wider sense of the word a function of brain
substance whose results it is true fall as regards one part of them
into the domain of consciousness while another and not less essential
part escapes unperceived as purely material processes
the perception of a body in space is a very complicated process  i see
suddenly before me for example a white ball  this has the effect of
conveying to me more than a mere sensation of whiteness  i deduce the
spherical character of the ball from the gradations of light and shade
upon its surface  i form a correct appreciation of its distance from my
eye and hence again i deduce an inference as to the size of the ball
what an expenditure of sensations ideas and inferences is found to be
necessary before all this can be brought about yet the production of a
correct perception of the ball was the work only of a few seconds and i
was unconscious of the individual processes by means of which it was
effected the result as a whole being alone present in my consciousness
the nerve substance preserves faithfully the memory of habitual actions
72  perceptions which were once long and difficult requiring constant
and conscious attention come to reproduce themselves in transient and
abridged guise without such duration and intensity that each link has to
pass over the threshold of our consciousness
we have chains of material nerve processes to which eventually a link
becomes attached that is attended with conscious perception  this is
sufficiently established from the standpoint of the physiologist and is
also proved by our unconsciousness of many whole series of ideas and of
the inferences we draw from them  if the soul is not to ship through the
fingers of physiology she must hold fast to the considerations suggested
by our unconscious states  as far however as the investigations of the
pure physicist are concerned the unconscious and matter are one and the
same thing and the physiology of the unconscious is no philosophy of
the unconscious
by far the greater number of our movements are the result of long and
arduous practice  the harmonious cooperation of the separate muscles
the finely adjusted measure of participation which each contributes to
the working of the whole must as a rule have been laboriously
acquired in respect of most of the movements that are necessary in order
to effect it  how long does it not take each note to find its way from
the eyes to the fingers of one who is beginning to learn the pianoforte
and on the other hand what an astonishing performance is the playing of
the professional pianist  the sight of each note occasions the
corresponding movement of the fingers with the speed of thoughta hurried
glance at the page of music before him suffices to give rise to a whole
series of harmonies nay when a melody has been long practised it can
be played even while the players attention is being given to something
of a perfectly different character over and above his music
the will need now no longer wend its way to each individual finger before
the desired movements can be extorted from it no longer now does a
sustained attention keep watch over the movements of each limb the will
need exercise a supervising control only  at the word of command the
muscles become active with a due regard to time and proportion and go
on working so long as they are bidden to keep in their accustomed
groove while a slight hint on the part of the will will indicate to
them their further journey  how could all this be if every part of the
central nerve system by means of which movement is effected were not
able 74a to reproduce whole series of vibrations which at an earlier
date required the constant and continuous participation of consciousness
but which are now set in motion automatically on a mere touch as it
were from consciousnessif it were not able to reproduce them the more
quickly and easily in proportion to the frequency of the repetitionsif
in fact there was no power of recollecting earlier performances  our
perceptive faculties must have remained always at their lowest stage if
we had been compelled to build up consciously every process from the
details of the sensationcausing materials tendered to us by our senses
nor could our voluntary movements have got beyond the helplessness of the
child if the necessary impulses could only be imparted to every movement
through effort of the will and conscious reproduction of all the
corresponding ideasif in a word the motor nerve system had not also
its memory 74b though that memory is unperceived by ourselves  the
power of this memory is what is called the force of habit
it seems then that we owe to memory almost all that we either have or
are that our ideas and conceptions are its work and that our every
perception thought and movement is derived from this source  memory
collects the countless phenomena of our existence into a single whole
and as our bodies would be scattered into the dust of their component
atoms if they were not held together by the attraction of matter so our
consciousness would be broken up into as many fragments as we had lived
seconds but for the binding and unifying force of memory
we have already repeatedly seen that the reproductions of organic
processes brought about by means of the memory of the nervous system
enter but partly within the domain of consciousness remaining
unperceived in other and not less important respects  this is also
confirmed by numerous facts in the life of that part of the nervous
system which ministers almost exclusively to our unconscious life
processes  for the memory of the socalled sympathetic ganglionic system
is no less rich than that of the brain and spinal marrow and a great
part of the medical art consists in making wise use of the assistance
thus afforded us
to bring however this part of my observations to a close i will take
leave of the nervous system and glance hurriedly at other phases of
organised matter where we meet with the same powers of reproduction but
in simpler guise
daily experience teaches us that a muscle becomes the stronger the more
we use it  the muscular fibre which in the first instance may have
answered but feebly to the stimulus conducted to it by the motor nerve
does so with the greater energy the more often it is stimulated
provided of course that reasonable times are allowed for repose  after
each individual action it becomes more capable more disposed towards the
same kind of work and has a greater aptitude for repetition of the same
organic processes  it gains also in weight for it assimilates more
matter than when constantly at rest  we have here in its simplest form
and in a phase which comes home most closely to the comprehension of the
physicist the same power of reproduction which we encountered when we
were dealing with nerve substance but under such far more complicated
conditions  and what is known thus certainly from muscle substance holds
good with greater or less plainness for all our organs  more especially
may we note the fact that after increased use alternated with times of
repose there accrues to the organ in all animal economy an increased
power of execution with an increased power of assimilation and a gain in
size
this gain in size consists not only in the enlargement of the individual
cells or fibres of which the organ is composed but in the multiplication
of their number for when cells have grown to a certain size they give
rise to others which inherit more or less completely the qualities of
those from which they came and therefore appear to be repetitions of the
same cell  this growth and multiplication of cells is only a special
phase of those manifold functions which characterise organised matter
and which consist not only in what goes on within the cell substance as
alterations or undulatory movement of the molecular disposition but also
in that which becomes visible outside the cells as change of shape
enlargement or subdivision  reproduction of performance therefore
manifests itself to us as reproduction of the cells themselves as may be
seen most plainly in the case of plants whose chief work consists in
growth whereas with animal organism other faculties greatly
preponderate
let us now take a brief survey of a class of facts in the case of which
we may most abundantly observe the power of memory in organised matter
we have ample evidence of the fact that characteristics of an organism
may descend to offspring which the organism did not inherit but which it
acquired owing to the special circumstances under which it lived and
that in consequence every organism imparts to the germ that issues from
it a small heritage of acquisitions which it has added during its own
lifetime to the gross inheritance of its race
when we reflect that we are dealing with the heredity of acquired
qualities which came to development in the most diverse parts of the
parent organism it must seem in a high degree mysterious how those parts
can have any kind of influence upon a germ which develops itself in an
entirely different place  many mystical theories have been propounded
for the elucidation of this question but the following reflections may
serve to bring the cause nearer to the comprehension of the physiologist
the nerve substance in spite of its thousandfold subdivision as cells
and fibres forms nevertheless a united whole which is present
directly in all organsnay as more recent histology conjectures in each
cell of the more important organsor is at least in ready communication
with them by means of the living irritable and therefore highly
conductive substance of other cells  through the connection thus
established all organs find themselves in such a condition of more or
less mutual interdependence upon one another that events which happen to
one are repeated in others and a notification however slight of a
vibration set up 77 in one quarter is at once conveyed even to the
farthest parts of the body  with this easy and rapid intercourse between
all parts is associated the more difficult communication that goes on by
way of the circulation of sap or blood
we see further that the process of the development of all germs that
are marked out for independent existence causes a powerful reaction even
from the very beginning of that existence on both the conscious and
unconscious life of the whole organism  we may see this from the fact
that the organ of reproduction stands in closer and more important
relation to the remaining parts and especially to the nervous system
than do the other organs and inversely that both the perceived and
unperceived events affecting the whole organism find a more marked
response in the reproductive system than elsewhere
we can now see with sufficient plainness in what the material connection
is established between the acquired peculiarities of an organism and the
proclivity on the part of the germ in virtue of which it develops the
special characteristics of its parent
the microscope teaches us that no difference can be perceived between one
germ and another it cannot however be objected on this account that
the determining cause of its ulterior development must be something
immaterial rather than the specific kind of its material constitution
the curves and surfaces which the mathematician conceives or finds
conceivable are more varied and infinite than the forms of animal life
let us suppose an infinitely small segment to be taken from every
possible curve each one of these will appear as like every other as one
germ is to another yet the whole of every curve lies dormant as it
were in each of them and if the mathematician chooses to develop it it
will take the path indicated by the elements of each segment
it is an error therefore to suppose that such fine distinctions as
physiology must assume lie beyond the limits of what is conceivable by
the human mind  an infinitely small change of position on the part of a
point or in the relations of the parts of a segment of a curve to one
another suffices to alter the law of its whole path and so in like
manner an infinitely small influence exercised by the parent organism on
the molecular disposition of the germ 78 may suffice to produce a
determining effect upon its whole farther development
what is the descent of special peculiarities but a reproduction on the
part of organised matter of processes in which it once took part as a
germ in the germcontaining organs of its parent and of which it seems
still to retain a recollection that reappears when time and the occasion
serve inasmuch as it responds to the same or like stimuli in a like way
to that in which the parent organism responded of which it was once
part and in the events of whose history it was itself also an
accomplice 79  when an action through long habit or continual practice
has become so much a second nature to any organisation that its effects
will penetrate though ever so faintly into the germ that lies within
it and when this last comes to find itself in a new sphere to extend
itself and develop into a new creaturethe individual parts of which
are still always the creature itself and flesh of its flesh so that what
is reproduced is the same being as that in company with which the germ
once lived and of which it was once actually a partall this is as
wonderful as when a greyhaired man remembers the events of his own
childhood but it is not more so  whether we say that the same organised
substance is again reproducing its past experience or whether we prefer
to hold that an offshoot or part of the original substance has waxed and
developed itself since separation from the parent stock it is plain that
this will constitute a difference of degree not kind
when we reflect upon the fact that unimportant acquired characteristics
can be reproduced in offspring we are apt to forget that offspring is
only a fullsized reproduction of the parenta reproduction moreover
that goes as far as possible into detail  we are so accustomed to
consider family resemblance a matter of course that we are sometimes
surprised when a child is in some respect unlike its parent surely
however the infinite number of points in respect of which parents and
children resemble one another is a more reasonable ground for our
surprise
but if the substance of the germ can reproduce characteristics acquired
by the parent during its single life how much more will it not be able
to reproduce those that were congenital to the parent and which have
happened through countless generations to the organised matter of which
the germ of today is a fragment  we cannot wonder that action already
taken on innumerable past occasions by organised matter is more deeply
impressed upon the recollection of the germ to which it gives rise than
action taken once only during a single lifetime 80a
we must bear in mind that every organised being now in existence
represents the last link of an inconceivably long series of organisms
which come down in a direct line of descent and of which each has
inherited a part of the acquired characteristics of its predecessor
everything furthermore points in the direction of our believing that at
the beginning of this chain there existed an organism of the very
simplest kind something in fact like those which we call organised
germs  the chain of living beings thus appears to be the magnificent
achievement of the reproductive power of the original organic structure
from which they have all descended  as this subdivided itself and
transmitted its characteristics 80b to its descendants these acquired
new ones and in their turn transmitted themall new germs transmitting
the chief part of what had happened to their predecessors while the
remaining part lapsed out of their memory circumstances not stimulating
it to reproduce itself
an organised being therefore stands before us a product of the
unconscious memory of organised matter which ever increasing and ever
dividing itself ever assimilating new matter and returning it in changed
shape to the inorganic world ever receiving some new thing into its
memory and transmitting its acquisitions by the way of reproduction
grows continually richer and richer the longer it lives
thus regarded the development of one of the more highly organised
animals represents a continuous series of organised recollections
concerning the past development of the great chain of living forms the
last link of which stands before us in the particular animal we may be
considering  as a complicated perception may arise by means of a rapid
and superficial reproduction of long and laboriously practised brain
processes so a germ in the course of its development hurries through a
series of phases hinting at them only  often and long foreshadowed in
theories of varied characters this conception has only now found correct
exposition from a naturalist of our own time 81  for truth hides
herself under many disguises from those who seek her but in the end
stands unveiled before the eyes of him whom she has chosen
not only is there a reproduction of form outward and inner conformation
of body organs and cells but the habitual actions of the parent are
also reproduced  the chicken on emerging from the eggshell runs off as
its mother ran off before it yet what an extraordinary complication of
emotions and sensations is necessary in order to preserve equilibrium in
running  surely the supposition of an inborn capacity for the
reproduction of these intricate actions can alone explain the facts  as
habitual practice becomes a second nature to the individual during his
single lifetime so the oftenrepeated action of each generation becomes
a second nature to the race
the chicken not only displays great dexterity in the performance of
movements for the effecting of which it has an innate capacity but it
exhibits also a tolerably high perceptive power  it immediately picks up
any grain that may be thrown to it  yet in order to do this more is
wanted than a mere visual perception of the grains there must be an
accurate apprehension of the direction and distance of the precise spot
in which each grain is lying and there must be no less accuracy in the
adjustment of the movements of the head and of the whole body  the
chicken cannot have gained experience in these respects while it was
still in the egg  it gained it rather from the thousands of thousands of
beings that have lived before it and from which it is directly
descended
the memory of organised substance displays itself here in the most
surprising fashion  the gentle stimulus of the light proceeding from the
grain that affects the retina of the chicken 82 gives occasion for the
reproduction of a manylinked chain of sensations perceptions and
emotions which were never yet brought together in the case of the
individual before us  we are accustomed to regard these surprising
performances of animals as manifestations of what we call instinct and
the mysticism of natural philosophy has ever shown a predilection for
this theme but if we regard instinct as the outcome of the memory or
reproductive power of organised substance and if we ascribe a memory to
the race as we already ascribe it to the individual then instinct
becomes at once intelligible and the physiologist at the same time finds
a point of contact which will bring it into connection with the great
series of facts indicated above as phenomena of the reproductive faculty
here then we have a physical explanation which has not indeed been
given yet but the time for which appears to be rapidly approaching
when in accordance with its instinct the caterpillar becomes a
chrysalis or the bird builds its nest or the bee its cell these
creatures act consciously and not as blind machines  they know how to
vary their proceedings within certain limits in conformity with altered
circumstances and they are thus liable to make mistakes  they feel
pleasure when their work advances and pain if it is hindered they learn
by the experience thus acquired and build on a second occasion better
than on the first but that even in the outset they hit so readily upon
the most judicious way of achieving their purpose and that their
movements adapt themselves so admirably and automatically to the end they
have in viewsurely this is owing to the inherited acquisitions of the
memory of their nerve substance which requires but a touch and it will
fall at once to the most appropriate kind of activity thinking always
and directly of whatever it is that may be wanted
man can readily acquire surprising kinds of dexterity if he confines his
attention to their acquisition  specialisation is the mother of
proficiency  he who marvels at the skill with which the spider weaves
her web should bear in mind that she did not learn her art all on a
sudden but that innumerable generations of spiders acquired it
toilsomely and step by stepthis being about all that as a general rule
they did acquire  man took to bows and arrows if his nets failed himthe
spider starved  thus we see the body andwhat most concerns usthe whole
nervous system of the newborn animal constructed beforehand and as it
were ready attuned for intercourse with the outside world in which it is
about to play its part by means of its tendency to respond to external
stimuli in the same manner as it has often heretofore responded in the
persons of its ancestors
we naturally ask whether the brain and nervous system of the human infant
are subjected to the principles we have laid down above  man certainly
finds it difficult to acquire arts of which the lower animals are born
masters but the brain of man at birth is much farther from its highest
development than is the brain of an animal  it not only grows for a
longer time but it becomes stronger than that of other living beings
the brain of man may be said to be exceptionally young at birth  the
lower animal is born precocious and acts precociously it resembles
those infant prodigies whose brain as it were is born old into the
world but who in spite of or rather in addition to their rich
endowment at birth in after life develop as much mental power as others
who were less splendidly furnished to start with but born with greater
freshness of youth  mans brain and indeed his whole body affords
greater scope for individuality inasmuch as a relatively greater part of
it is of postnatal growth  it develops under the influence of
impressions made by the environment upon its senses and thus makes its
acquisitions in a more special and individual manner whereas the animal
receives them ready made and of a more final stereotyped character
nevertheless it is plain we must ascribe both to the brain and body of
the newborn infant a farreaching power of remembering or reproducing
things which have already come to their development thousands of times
over in the persons of its ancestors  it is in virtue of this that it
acquires proficiency in the actions necessary for its existenceso far as
it was not already at birth proficient in themmuch more quickly and
easily than would be otherwise possible but what we call instinct in the
case of animals takes in man the looser form of aptitude talent and
genius 84  granted that certain ideas are not innate yet the fact of
their taking form so easily and certainly from out of the chaos of his
sensations is due not to his own labour but to that of the brain
substance of the thousands of thousands of generations from whom he is
descended  theories concerning the development of individual
consciousness which deny heredity or the power of transmission and
insist upon an entirely fresh start for every human soul as though the
infinite number of generations that have gone before us might as well
have never lived for all the effect they have had upon ourselvessuch
theories will contradict the facts of our daily experience at every touch
and turn
the brain processes and phenomena of consciousness which ennoble man in
the eyes of his fellows have had a less ancient history than those
connected with his physical needs  hunger and the reproductive instinct
affected the oldest and simplest forms of the organic world  it is in
respect of these instincts therefore and of the means to gratify them
that the memory of organised substance is strongestthe impulses and
instincts that arise hence having still paramount power over the minds of
men  the spiritual life has been superadded slowly its most splendid
outcome belongs to the latest epoch in the history of organised matter
nor has any very great length of time elapsed since the nervous system
was first crowned with the glory of a large and welldeveloped brain
oral tradition and written history have been called the memory of man
and this is not without its truth  but there is another and a living
memory in the innate reproductive power of brain substance and without
this both writings and oral tradition would be without significance to
posterity  the most sublime ideas though never so immortalised in
speech or letters are yet nothing for heads that are out of harmony with
them they must be not only heard but reproduced and both speech and
writing would be in vain were there not an inheritance of inward and
outward brain development growing in correspondence with the inheritance
of ideas that are handed down from age to age and did not an enhanced
capacity for their reproduction on the part of each succeeding generation
accompany the thoughts that have been preserved in writing  mans
conscious memory comes to an end at death but the unconscious memory of
nature is true and ineradicable whoever succeeds in stamping upon her
the impress of his work she will remember him to the end of time
chapter vii
introduction to a translation of the chapter upon instinct in von
hartmanns philosophy of the unconscious
i am afraid my readers will find the chapter on instinct from von
hartmanns philosophy of the unconscious which will now follow as
distasteful to read as i did to translate and would gladly have spared
it them if i could  at present the works of mr sully who has treated
of the philosophy of the unconscious both in the westminster review
vol xlix ns and in his work pessimism are the best source to
which english readers can have recourse for information concerning von
hartmann  giving him all credit for the pains he has taken with an
ungrateful if not impossible subject i think that a sufficient sample
of von hartmanns own words will be a useful adjunct to mr sullys work
and may perhaps save some readers trouble by resolving them to look no
farther into the philosophy of the unconscious  over and above this i
have been so often told that the views concerning unconscious action
contained in the foregoing lecture and in life and habit are only the
very fallacy of von hartmann over again that i should like to give the
public an opportunity of seeing whether this is so or no by placing the
two contending theories of unconscious action side by side  i hope that
it will thus be seen that neither professor hering nor i have fallen into
the fallacy of von hartmann but that rather von hartmann has fallen into
his fallacy through failure to grasp the principle which professor hering
has insisted upon and to connect heredity with memory
professor herings philosophy of the unconscious is of extreme
simplicity  he rests upon a fact of daily and hourly experience namely
that practice makes things easy that were once difficult and often
results in their being done without any consciousness of effort  but if
the repetition of an act tends ultimately under certain circumstances
to its being done unconsciously so also is the fact of an intricate and
difficult action being done unconsciously an argument that it must have
been done repeatedly already  as i said in life and habit it is more
easy to suppose that occasions on which such an action has been performed
have not been wanting even though we do not see when and where they
were than that the facility which we observe should have been attained
without practice and memory p 56
there can be nothing better established or more easy whether to
understand or verify than the unconsciousness with which habitual
actions come to be performed  if however it is once conceded that it
is the manner of habitual action generally then all  priori objection
to professor herings philosophy of the unconscious is at an end  the
question becomes one of fact in individual cases and of degree
how far then does the principle of the convertibility as it were of
practice and unconsciousness extend  can any line be drawn beyond which
it shall cease to operate  if not may it not have operated and be
operating to a vast and hitherto unsuspected extent  this is all and
certainly it is sufficiently simple  i sometimes think it has found its
greatest stumblingblock in its total want of mystery as though we must
be like those conjurers whose stock in trade is a small deal table and a
kitchenchair with bare legs and who with their parade of no
deception and examine everything for yourselves deceive worse than
others who make use of all manner of elaborate paraphernalia  it is true
we require no paraphernalia and we produce unexpected results but we
are not conjuring
to turn now to von hartmann  when i read mr sullys article in the
westminster review i did not know whether the sense of mystification
which it produced in me was wholly due to von hartmann or no but on
making acquaintance with von hartmann himself i found that mr sully has
erred if at all in making him more intelligible than he actually is
von hartmann has not got a meaning  give him professor herings key and
he might get one but it would be at the expense of seeing what approach
he had made to a system fallen to pieces  granted that in his details
and subordinate passages he often both has and conveys a meaning there
is nevertheless no coherence between these details and the nearest
approach to a broad conception covering the work which the reader can
carry away with him is at once so incomprehensible and repulsive that it
is difficult to write about it without saying more perhaps than those who
have not seen the original will accept as likely to be true  the idea to
which i refer is that of an unconscious clairvoyance which from the
language continually used concerning it must be of the nature of a
person and which is supposed to take possession of living beings so
fully as to be the very essence of their nature the promoter of their
embryonic development and the instigator of their instinctive actions
this approaches closely to the personal god of mosaic and christian
theology with the exception that the word clairvoyance 89 is
substituted for god and that the god is supposed to be unconscious
mr sully says
    when we grasp it the philosophy of von hartmann as a whole it
    amounts to nothing more than this that all or nearly all the
    phenomena of the material and spiritual world rest upon and result
    from a mysterious unconscious being though to call it being is
    really to add on an idea not immediately contained within the
    allsufficient principle  but what difference is there between this
    and saying that the phenomena of the world at large come we know not
    whence    the unconscious therefore tends to be simple phrase
    and nothing more    no doubt there are a number of mental
    processes    of which we are unconscious    but to infer from
    this that they are due to an unconscious power and to proceed to
    demonstrate them in the presence of the unconscious through all
    nature is to make an unwarrantable saltus in reasoning  what in
    fact is this unconscious but a highsounding name to veil our
    ignorance  is the unconscious any better explanation of phenomena we
    do not understand than the devildevil by which australian tribes
    explain the leyden jar and its phenomena  does it increase our
    knowledge to know that we do not know the origin of language or the
    cause of instinct    alike in organic creation and the evolution
    of history performances and actionsthe words are those of
    straussare ascribed to an unconscious which can only belong to a
    conscious being 90a
                                      
    the difficulties of the system advance as we proceed 90b
    subtract this questionable factorthe unconscious from hartmanns
    biology and psychology and the chapters remain pleasant and
    instructive reading  but with the third part of his workthe
    metaphysic of the unconsciousour feet are clogged at every step  we
    are encircled by the merest play of words the most unsatisfactory
    demonstrations and most inconsistent inferences  the theory of
    final causes has been hitherto employed to show the wisdom of the
    world with our pessimist philosopher it shows nothing but its
    irrationality and misery  consciousness has been generally supposed
    to be the condition of all happiness and interest in life here it
    simply awakens us to misery and the lower an animal lies in the
    scale of conscious life the better and the pleasanter its lot
                                      
    thus then the universe as an emanation of the unconscious has
    been constructed 90c  throughout it has been marked by design by
    purpose by finality throughout a wonderful adaptation of means to
    ends a wonderful adjustment and relativity in different portions has
    been noticedand all this for what conclusion  not as in the hands
    of the natural theologians of the eighteenth century to show that
    the world is the result of design of an intelligent beneficent
    creator but the manifestation of a being whose only predicates are
    negatives whose very essence is to be unconscious  it is not only
    like ancient athens to an unknown but to an unknowing god that
    modern pessimism rears its altar  yet surely the fact that the
    motive principle of existence moves in a mysterious way outside our
    consciousness no way requires that the allone being should be
    himself unconscious
i believe the foregoing to convey as correct an idea of von hartmanns
system as it is possible to convey and will leave it to the reader to
say how much in common there is between this and the lecture given in the
preceding chapter beyond the fact that both touch upon unconscious
actions  the extract which will form my next chapter is only about a
thirtieth part of the entire philosophy of the unconscious but it
will i believe suffice to substantiate the justice of what mr sully
has said in the passages above quoted
as regards the accuracy of the translation i have submitted all passages
about which i was in the least doubtful to the same gentleman who revised
my translation of professor herings lecture i have also given the
german wherever i thought the reader might be glad to see it
chapter viii
translation of the chapter on the unconscious in instinct from von
hartmanns philosophy of the unconscious
von hartmanns chapter on instinct is as follows
instinct is action taken in pursuance of a purpose but without conscious
perception of what the purpose is 92a
a purposive action with consciousness of the purpose and where the
course taken is the result of deliberation is not said to be instinctive
nor yet again is blind aimless action such as outbreaks of fury on the
part of offended or otherwise enraged animals  i see no occasion for
disturbing the commonly received definition of instinct as given above
for those who think they can refer all the socalled ordinary instincts
of animals to conscious deliberation ipso facto deny that there is such
a thing as instinct at all and should strike the word out of their
vocabulary  but of this more hereafter
assuming then the existence of instinctive action as above defined it
can be explained as
i  a mere necessary consequence of bodily organisation 92b
ii  a mechanism of brain or mind contrived by nature
iii  the outcome of an unconscious activity of mind
in neither of the two first cases is there any scope for the idea of
purpose in the third purpose must be present immediately before the
action  in the two first cases action is supposed to be brought about
by means of an initial arrangement either of bodily or mental mechanism
purpose being conceived of as existing on a single occasion onlythat is
to say in the determination of the initial arrangement  in the third
purpose is conceived as present in every individual instance  let us
proceed to the consideration of these three cases
instinct is not a mere consequence of bodily organisation for
a  bodies may be alike yet they may be endowed with different
instincts
all spiders have the same spinning apparatus but one kind weaves
radiating webs another irregular ones while a third makes none at all
but lives in holes whose walls it overspins and whose entrance it
closes with a door  almost all birds have a like organisation for the
construction of their nests a beak and feet but how infinitely do
their nests vary in appearance mode of construction attachment to
surrounding objects they stand are glued on hang c selection of
site caves holes corners forks of trees shrubs the ground and
excellence of workmanship how often too are they not varied in the
species of a single genus as of parus  many birds moreover build no
nest at all  the difference in the songs of birds are in like manner
independent of the special construction of their voice apparatus nor do
the modes of nest construction that obtain among ants and bees depend
upon their bodily organisation  organisation as a general rule only
renders the bird capable of singing as giving it an apparatus with which
to sing at all but it has nothing to do with the specific character of
the execution    the nursing defence and education of offspring
cannot be considered as in any way more dependent upon bodily
organisation nor yet the sites which insects choose for the laying of
their eggs nor again the selection of deposits of spawn of their own
species by male fish for impregnation  the rabbit burrows the hare
does not though both have the same burrowing apparatus  the hare
however has less need of a subterranean place of refuge by reason of its
greater swiftness  some birds with excellent powers of flight are
nevertheless stationary in their habits as the secretary falcon and
certain other birds of prey while even such moderate fliers as quails
are sometimes known to make very distant migrations
b  like instincts may be found associated with unlike organs
birds with and without feet adapted for climbing live in trees so also
do monkeys with and without flexible tails squirrels sloths pumas c
molecrickets dig with a wellpronounced spade upon their forefeet
while the buryingbeetle does the same thing though it has no special
apparatus whatever  the mole conveys its winter provender in pockets an
inch wide long and half an inch wide within its cheeks the fieldmouse
does so without the help of any such contrivance  the migratory instinct
displays itself with equal strength in animals of widely different form
by whatever means they may pursue their journey whether by water land
or air
it is clear therefore that instinct is in great measure independent of
bodily organisation  granted indeed that a certain amount of bodily
apparatus is a sine qu non for any power of execution at allas for
example that there would be no ingenious nest without organs more or
less adapted for its construction no spinning of a web without spinning
glandsnevertheless it is impossible to maintain that instinct is a
consequence of organisation  the mere existence of the organ does not
constitute even the smallest incentive to any corresponding habitual
activity  a sensation of pleasure must at least accompany the use of the
organ before its existence can incite to its employment  and even so
when a sensation of pleasure has given the impulse which is to render it
active it is only the fact of there being activity at all and not the
special characteristics of the activity that can be due to organisation
the reason for the special mode of the activity is the very problem that
we have to solve  no one will call the action of the spider instinctive
in voiding the fluid from her spinning gland when it is too full and
therefore painful to her nor that of the male fish when it does what
amounts to much the same thing as this  the instinct and the marvel lie
in the fact that the spider spins threads and proceeds to weave her web
with them and that the male fish will only impregnate ova of his own
species
another proof that the pleasure felt in the employment of an organ is
wholly inadequate to account for this employment is to be found in the
fact that the moral greatness of instinct the point in respect of which
it most commands our admiration consists in the obedience paid to its
behests to the postponement of all personal wellbeing and at the cost
it may be of life itself  if the mere pleasure of relieving certain
glands from overfulness were the reason why caterpillars generally spin
webs they would go on spinning until they had relieved these glands but
they would not repair their work as often as any one destroyed it and do
this again and again until they die of exhaustion  the same holds good
with the other instincts that at first sight appear to be inspired only
by a sensation of pleasure for if we change the circumstances so as to
put selfsacrifice in the place of selfinterest it becomes at once
apparent that they have a higher source than this  we think for
example that birds pair for the sake of mere sexual gratification why
then do they leave off pairing as soon as they have laid the requisite
number of eggs  that there is a reproductive instinct over and above the
desire for sexual gratification appears from the fact that if a man takes
an egg out of the nest the birds will come together again and the hen
will lay another egg or if they belong to some of the more wary
species they will desert their nest and make preparation for an
entirely new brood  a female wryneck whose nest was daily robbed of the
egg she laid in it continued to lay a new one which grew smaller and
smaller till when she had laid her twentyninth egg she was found dead
upon her nest  if an instinct cannot stand the test of selfsacrificeif
it is the simple outcome of a desire for bodily gratificationthen it is
no true instinct and is only so called erroneously
instinct is not a mechanism of brain or mind implanted in living beings
by nature for if it were then instinctive action without any even
unconscious activity of mind and with no conception concerning the
purpose of the action would be executed mechanically the purpose having
been once for all thought out by nature or providence which has so
organised the individual that it acts henceforth as a purely mechanical
medium  we are now dealing with a psychical organisation as the cause
instinct as we were above dealing with a physical  a psychical
organisation would be a conceivable explanation and we need look no
farther if every instinct once belonging to an animal discharged its
functions in an unvarying manner  but this is never found to be the
case for instincts vary when there arises a sufficient motive for
varying them  this proves that special exterior circumstances enter into
the matter and that these circumstances are the very things that render
the attainment of the purpose possible through means selected by the
instinct  here first do we find instinct acting as though it were
actually design with action following at its heels for until the arrival
of the motive the instinct remains late and discharges no function
whatever  the motive enters by way of an idea received into the mind
through the instrumentality of the senses and there is a constant
connection between instinct in action and all sensual images which give
information that an opportunity has arisen for attaining the ends
proposed to itself by the instinct
the psychical mechanism of this constant connection must also be looked
for  it may help us here to turn to the piano for an illustration  the
struck keys are the motives the notes that sound in consequence are the
instincts in action  this illustration might perhaps be allowed to pass
if we also suppose that entirely different keys can give out the same
sound if instincts could only be compared with distinctly tuned notes
so that one and the same instinct acted always in the same manner on the
rising of the motive which should set it in action  this however is
not so for it is the blind unconscious purpose of the instinct that is
alone constant the instinct itselfthat is to say the will to make use
of certain meansvarying as the means that can be most suitably employed
vary under varying circumstances
in this we condemn the theory which refuses to recognise unconscious
purpose as present in each individual case of instinctive action  for he
who maintains instinct to be the result of a mechanism of mind must
suppose a special and constant mechanism for each variation and
modification of the instinct in accordance with exterior circumstances
97 that is to say a new string giving a note with a new tone must be
inserted and this would involve the mechanism in endless complication
but the fact that the purpose is constant notwithstanding all manner of
variation in the means chosen by the instinct proves that there is no
necessity for the supposition of such an elaborate mental mechanismthe
presence of an unconscious purpose being sufficient to explain the facts
the purpose of the bird for example that has laid her eggs is constant
and consists in the desire to bring her young to maturity  when the
temperature of the air is insufficient to effect this she sits upon her
eggs and only intermits her sittings in the warmest countries the
mammal on the other hand attains the fulfilment of its instinctive
purpose without any cooperation on its own part  in warm climates many
birds only sit by night and small exotic birds that have built in
aviaries kept at a high temperature sit little upon their eggs or not at
all  how inconceivable is the supposition of a mechanism that impels the
bird to sit as soon as the temperature falls below a certain height  how
clear and simple on the other hand is the view that there is an
unconscious purpose constraining the volition of the bird to the use of
the fitting means of which process however only the last link that is
to say the will immediately preceding the action falls within the
consciousness of the bird
in south africa the sparrow surrounds her nest with thorns as a defence
against apes and serpents  the eggs of the cuckoo as regards size
colour and marking invariably resemble those of the birds in whose
nests she lays  sylvia ruja for example lays a white egg with violet
spots sylvia hippolais a red one with black spots regulus
ignicapellus a cloudy red but the cuckoos egg is in each case so
deceptive an imitation of its model that it can hardly be distinguished
except by the structure of its shell
huber contrived that his bees should be unable to build in their usual
instinctive manner beginning from above and working downwards on this
they began building from below and again horizontally  the outermost
cells that spring from the top of the hive or abut against its sides are
not hexagonal but pentagonal so as to gain in strength being attached
with one base instead of two sides  in autumn bees lengthen their
existing honey cells if these are insufficient but in the ensuing spring
they again shorten them in order to get greater roadway between the
combs  when the full combs have become too heavy they strengthen the
walls of the uppermost or bearing cells by thickening them with wax and
propolis  if larv of working bees are introduced into the cells set
apart for drones the working bees will cover these cells with the flat
lids usual for this kind of larv and not with the round ones that are
proper for drones  in autumn as a general rule bees kill their drones
but they refrain from doing this when they have lost their queen and
keep them to fertilise the young queen who will be developed from larv
that would otherwise have become working bees  huber observed that they
defend the entrance of their hive against the inroads of the sphinx moth
by means of skilful constructions made of wax and propolis  they only
introduce propolis when they want it for the execution of repairs or for
some other special purpose  spiders and caterpillars also display
marvellous dexterity in the repair of their webs if they have been
damaged and this requires powers perfectly distinct from those requisite
for the construction of a new one
the above examples might be multiplied indefinitely but they are
sufficient to establish the fact that instincts are not capacities
rolled as it were off a reel mechanically according to an invariable
system but that they adapt themselves most closely to the circumstances
of each case and are capable of such great modification and variation
that at times they almost appear to cease to be instinctive
many will indeed ascribe these modifications to conscious deliberation
on the part of the animals themselves and it is impossible to deny that
in the case of the more intellectually gifted animals there may be such a
thing as a combination of instinctive faculty and conscious reflection
i think however the examples already cited are enough to show that
often where the normal and the abnormal action springs from the same
source without any complication with conscious deliberation they are
either both instinctive or both deliberative 99  or is that which
prompts the bee to build hexagonal prisms in the middle of her comb
something of an actually distinct character from that which impels her to
build pentagonal ones at the sides  are there two separate kinds of
thing one of which induces birds under certain circumstances to sit upon
their eggs while another leads them under certain other circumstances to
refrain from doing so  and does this hold good also with bees when they
at one time kill their brethren without mercy and at another grant them
their lives  or with birds when they construct the kind of nest peculiar
to their race and again any special provision which they may think fit
under certain circumstances to take  if it is once granted that the
normal and the abnormal manifestations of instinctand they are often
incapable of being distinguishedspring from a single source then the
objection that the modification is due to conscious knowledge will be
found to be a suicidal one later on so far as it is directed against
instinct generally  it may be sufficient here to point out in
anticipation of remarks that will be found in later chapters that
instinct and the power of organic development involve the same essential
principle though operating under different circumstancesthe two melting
into one another without any definite boundary between them  here then
we have conclusive proof that instinct does not depend upon organisation
of body or brain but that more truly the organisation is due to the
nature and manner of the instinct
on the other hand we must now return to a closer consideration of the
conception of a psychical mechanism 100  and here we find that this
mechanism in spite of its explaining so much is itself so obscure that
we can hardly form any idea concerning it  the motive enters the mind by
way of a conscious sensual impression this is the first link of the
process the last link 101 appears as the conscious motive of an
action  both however are entirely unlike and neither has anything to
do with ordinary motivation which consists exclusively in the desire
that springs from a conception either of pleasure or dislikethe former
prompting to the attainment of any object the latter to its avoidance
in the case of instinct pleasure is for the most part a concomitant
phenomenon but it is not so always as we have already seen inasmuch as
the consummation and highest moral development of instinct displays
itself in selfsacrifice
the true problem however lies far deeper than this  for every
conception of a pleasure proves that we have experienced this pleasure
already  but it follows from this that when the pleasure was first felt
there must have been will present in the gratification of which will the
pleasure consisted the question therefore arises whence did the will
come before the pleasure that would follow on its gratification was
known and before bodily pain as for example of hunger rendered
relief imperative  yet we may see that even though an animal has grown
up apart from any others of its kind it will yet none the less manifest
the instinctive impulses of its race though experience can have taught
it nothing whatever concerning the pleasure that will ensue upon their
gratification  as regards instinct therefore there must be a causal
connection between the motivating sensual conception and the will to
perform the instinctive action and the pleasure of the subsequent
gratification has nothing to do with the matter  we know by the
experience of our own instincts that this causal connection does not lie
within our consciousness 102a therefore if it is to be a mechanism of
any kind it can only be either an unconscious mechanical induction and
metamorphosis of the vibrations of the conceived motive into the
vibrations of the conscious action in the brain or an unconscious
spiritual mechanism
in the first case it is surely strange that this process should go on
unconsciously though it is so powerful in its effects that the will
resulting from it overpowers every other consideration every other kind
of will and that vibrations of this kind when set up in the brain
become always consciously perceived nor is it easy to conceive in what
way this metamorphosis can take place so that the constant purpose can be
attained under varying circumstances by the resulting will in modes that
vary with variation of the special features of each individual case
but if we take the other alternative and suppose an unconscious mental
mechanism we cannot legitimately conceive of the process going on in
this as other than what prevails in all mental mechanism namely than as
by way of idea and will  we are therefore compelled to imagine a
causal connection between the consciously recognised motive and the will
to do the instinctive action through unconscious idea and will nor do i
know how this connection can be conceived as being brought about more
simply than through a conceived and willed purpose 102b  arrived at
this point however we have attained the logical mechanism peculiar to
and inseparable from all mind and find unconscious purpose to be an
indispensable link in every instinctive action  with this therefore
the conception of a mental mechanism dead and predestined from without
has disappeared and has become transformed into the spiritual life
inseparable from logic so that we have reached the sole remaining
requirement for the conception of an actual instinct which proves to be
a conscious willing of the means towards an unconsciously willed purpose
this conception explains clearly and without violence all the problems
which instinct presents to us or more truly all that was problematical
about instinct disappears when its true nature has been thus declared
if this work were confined to the consideration of instinct alone the
conception of an unconscious activity of mind might excite opposition
inasmuch as it is one with which our educated public is not yet familiar
but in a work like the present every chapter of which adduces fresh
facts in support of the existence of such an activity and of its
remarkable consequences the novelty of the theory should be taken no
farther into consideration
though i so confidently deny that instinct is the simple action of a
mechanism which has been contrived once for all i by no means exclude
the supposition that in the constitution of the brain the ganglia and
the whole body in respect of morphological as well as
molecularphysiological condition certain predispositions can be
established which direct the unconscious intermediaries more readily into
one channel than into another  this predisposition is either the result
of a habit which keeps continually cutting for itself a deeper and deeper
channel until in the end it leaves indelible traces whether in the
individual or in the race or it is expressly called into being by the
unconscious formative principle in generation so as to facilitate action
in a given direction  this last will be the case more frequently in
respect of exterior organisationas for example with the weapons or
working organs of animalswhile to the former must be referred the
molecular condition of brain and ganglia which bring about the
perpetually recurring elements of an instinct such as the hexagonal shape
of the cells of bees  we shall presently see that by individual
character we mean the sum of the individual methods of reaction against
all possible motives and that this character depends essentially upon a
constitution of mind and body acquired in some measure through habit by
the individual but for the most part inherited  but an instinct is also
a mode of reaction against certain motives here too then we are
dealing with character though perhaps not so much with that of the
individual as of the race for by character in regard to instinct we do
not intend the differences that distinguish individuals but races from
one another  if any one chooses to maintain that such a predisposition
for certain kinds of activity on the part of brain and body constitutes a
mechanism this may in one sense be admitted but as against this view it
must be remarked
1  that such deviations from the normal scheme of an instinct as cannot
be referred to conscious deliberation are not provided for by any
predisposition in this mechanism
2  that heredity is only possible under the circumstances of a constant
superintendence of the embryonic development by a purposive unconscious
activity of growth  it must be admitted however that this is
influenced in return by the predisposition existing in the germ
3  that the impressing of the predisposition upon the individual from
whom it is inherited can only be effected by long practice consequently
the instinct without auxiliary mechanism 105a is the originating cause
of the auxiliary mechanism
4  that none of those instinctive actions that are performed rarely or
perhaps once only in the lifetime of any individualas for example
those connected with the propagation and metamorphoses of the lower forms
of life and none of those instinctive omissions of action neglect of
which necessarily entails deathcan be conceived as having become
engrained into the character through habit the ganglionic constitution
therefore that predisposes the animal towards them must have been
fashioned purposively
5  that even the presence of an auxiliary mechanism 105b does not
compel the unconscious to a particular corresponding mode of instinctive
action but only predisposes it  this is shown by the possibility of
departure from the normal type of action so that the unconscious purpose
is always stronger than the ganglionic constitution and takes any
opportunity of choosing from several similar possible courses the one
that is handiest and most convenient to the constitution of the
individual
we now approach the question that i have reserved for our final oneis
there namely actually such a thing as instinct 105c or are all
socalled instinctive actions only the results of conscious deliberation
in support of the second of these two views it may be alleged that the
more limited is the range of the conscious mental activity of any living
being the more fully developed in proportion to its entire mental power
is its performance commonly found to be in respect of its own limited and
special instinctive department  this holds as good with the lower
animals as with men and is explained by the fact that perfection of
proficiency is only partly dependent upon natural capacity but is in
great measure due to practice and cultivation of the original faculty  a
philologist for example is unskilled in questions of jurisprudence a
natural philosopher or mathematician in philology an abstract
philosopher in poetical criticism  nor has this anything to do with the
natural talents of the several persons but follows as a consequence of
their special training  the more special therefore is the direction in
which the mental activity of any living being is exercised the more will
the whole developing and practising power of the mind be brought to bear
upon this one branch so that it is not surprising if the special power
comes ultimately to bear an increased proportion to the total power of
the individual through the contraction of the range within which it is
exercised
those however who apply this to the elucidation of instinct should not
forget the words in proportion to the entire mental power of the animal
in question and should bear in mind that the entire mental power
becomes less and less continually as we descend the scale of animal life
whereas proficiency in the performance of an instinctive action seems to
be much of a muchness in all grades of the animal world  as therefore
those performances which indisputably proceed from conscious deliberation
decrease proportionately with decrease of mental power while nothing of
the kind is observable in the case of instinctit follows that instinct
must involve some other principle than that of conscious intelligence
we see moreover that actions which have their source in conscious
intelligence are of one and the same kind whether among the lower
animals or with mankindthat is to say that they are acquired by
apprenticeship or instruction and perfected by practice so that the
saying age brings wisdom holds good with the brutes as much as with
ourselves  instinctive actions on the contrary have a special and
distinct character in that they are performed with no less proficiency
by animals that have been reared in solitude than by those that have been
instructed by their parents the first essays of a hitherto unpractised
animal being as successful as its later ones  there is a difference in
principle here which cannot be mistaken  again we know by experience
that the feebler and more limited an intelligence is the more slowly do
ideas act upon it that is to say the slower and more laborious is its
conscious thought  so long as instinct does not come into play this
holds good both in the case of men of different powers of comprehension
and with animals but with instinct all is changed for it is the
speciality of instinct never to hesitate or loiter but to take action
instantly upon perceiving that the stimulating motive has made its
appearance  this rapidity in arriving at a resolution is common to the
instinctive actions both of the highest and the lowest animals and
indicates an essential difference between instinct and conscious
deliberation
finally as regards perfection of the power of execution a glance will
suffice to show the disproportion that exists between this and the grade
of intellectual activity on which an animal may be standing  take for
instance the caterpillar of the emperor moth saturnia pavonia minor
it eats the leaves of the bush upon which it was born at the utmost has
just enough sense to get on to the lower sides of the leaves if it begins
to rain and from time to time changes its skin  this is its whole
existence which certainly does not lead us to expect a display of any
even the most limited intellectual power  when however the time comes
for the larva of this moth to become a chrysalis it spins for itself a
double cocoon fortified with bristles that point outwards so that it
can be opened easily from within though it is sufficiently impenetrable
from without  if this contrivance were the result of conscious
reflection we should have to suppose some such reasoning process as the
following to take place in the mind of the caterpillari am about to
become a chrysalis and motionless as i must be shall be exposed to
many different kinds of attack  i must therefore weave myself a web
but when i am a moth i shall not be able as some moths are to find my
way out of it by chemical or mechanical means therefore i must leave a
way open for myself  in order however that my enemies may not take
advantage of this i will close it with elastic bristles which i can
easily push asunder from within but which upon the principle of the
arch will resist all pressure from without  surely this is asking
rather too much from a poor caterpillar yet the whole of the foregoing
must be thought out if a correct result is to be arrived at
this theoretical separation of instinct from conscious intelligence can
be easily misrepresented by opponents of my theory as though a
separation in practice also would be necessitated in consequence  this
is by no means my intention  on the contrary i have already insisted at
some length that both the two kinds of mental activity may coexist in
all manner of different proportions so that there may be every degree of
combination from pure instinct to pure deliberation  we shall see
however in a later chapter that even in the highest and most abstract
activity of human consciousness there are forces at work that are of the
highest importance and are essentially of the same kind as instinct
on the other hand the most marvellous displays of instinct are to be
found not only in plants but also in those lowest organisms of the
simplest bodily form which are partly unicellular and in respect of
conscious intelligence stand far below the higher plantsto which
indeed any kind of deliberative faculty is commonly denied  even in the
case of those minute microscopic organisms that baffle our attempts to
classify them either as animals or vegetables we are still compelled to
admire an instinctive purposive behaviour which goes far beyond a mere
reflex responsive to a stimulus from without all doubt therefore
concerning the actual existence of an instinct must be at an end and the
attempt to deduce it as a consequence of conscious deliberation be given
up as hopeless  i will here adduce an instance as extraordinary as any
we yet know of showing as it does that many different purposes which
in the case of the higher animals require a complicated system of organs
of motion can be attained with incredibly simple means
arcella vulgaris is a minute morsel of protoplasm which lives in a
concaveconvex brown finely reticulated shell through a circular
opening in the concave side of which it can project itself by throwing
out pseudopodia  if we look through the microscope at a drop of water
containing living arcell we may happen to see one of them lying on
its back at the bottom of the drop and making fruitless efforts for two
or three minutes to lay hold of some fixed point by means of a
pseudopodium  after this there will appear suddenly from two to five
but sometimes more dark points in the protoplasm at a small distance
from the circumference and as a rule at regular distances from one
another  these rapidly develop themselves into welldefined spherical
air vesicles and come presently to fill a considerable part of the
hollow of the shell thereby driving part of the protoplasm outside it
after from five to twenty minutes the specific gravity of the arcella
is so much lessened that it is lifted by the water with its
pseudopodia and brought up against the upper surface of the
waterdrop on which it is able to travel  in from five to ten minutes
the vesicles will now disappear the last small point vanishing with a
jerk  if however the creature has been accidentally turned over during
its journey and reaches the top of the waterdrop with its back
uppermost the vesicles will continue growing only on one side while
they diminish on the other by this means the shell is brought first into
an oblique and then into a vertical position until one of the
pseudopodia obtains a footing and the whole turns over  from the
moment the animal has obtained foothold the bladders become immediately
smaller and after they have disappeared the experiment may be repeated
at pleasure
the positions of the protoplasm which the vesicles fashion change
continually only the grainless protoplasm of the pseudopodia develops
no air  after long and fruitless efforts a manifest fatigue sets in the
animal gives up the attempt for a time and resumes it after an interval
of repose
engelmann the discoverer of these phenomena says pflgers archiv fr
physologie bd ii the changes in volume in all the vesicles of the
same animal are for the most part synchronous effected in the same
manner and of like size  there are however not a few exceptions it
often happens that some of them increase or diminish in volume much
faster than others sometimes one may increase while another diminishes
all the changes however are throughout unquestionably intentional  the
object of the airvesicles is to bring the animal into such a position
that it can take fast hold of something with its pseudopodia  when
this has been obtained the air disappears without our being able to
discover any other reason for its disappearance than the fact that it is
no longer needed     if we bear these circumstances in mind we can
almost always tell whether an arcella will develop airvesicles or no
and if it has already developed them we can tell whether they will
increase or diminish    the arcell in fact in this power of
altering their specific gravity possess a mechanism for raising
themselves to the top of the water or lowering themselves to the bottom
at will  they use this not only in the abnormal circumstances of their
being under microscopical observation but at all times as may be known
by our being always able to find some specimens with airbladders at the
top of the water in which they live
if what has been already advanced has failed to convince the reader of
the hopelessness of attempting to explain instinct as a mode of conscious
deliberation he must admit that the following considerations are
conclusive  it is most certain that deliberation and conscious
reflection can only take account of such data as are consciously
perceived if then it can be shown that data absolutely indispensable
for the arrival at a just conclusion cannot by any possibility have been
known consciously the result can no longer be held as having had its
source in conscious deliberation  it is admitted that the only way in
which consciousness can arrive at a knowledge of exterior facts is by way
of an impression made upon the senses  we must therefore prove that a
knowledge of the facts indispensable for arrival at a just conclusion
could not have been thus acquired  this may be done as follows 111
for firstly the facts in question lie in the future and the present
gives no ground for conjecturing the time and manner of their subsequent
development
secondly they are manifestly debarred from the category of perceptions
perceived through the senses inasmuch as no information can be derived
concerning them except through experience of similar occurrences in time
past and such experience is plainly out of the question
it would not affect the argument if as i think likely it were to turn
out with the advance of our physiological knowledge that all the
examples of the first case that i am about to adduce reduce themselves to
examples of the second as must be admitted to have already happened in
respect of many that i have adduced hitherto  for it is hardly more
difficult to conceive of  priori knowledge disconnected from any
impression made upon the senses than of knowledge which it is true
does at the present day manifest itself upon the occasion of certain
general perceptions but which can only be supposed to be connected with
these by means of such a chain of inferences and judiciously applied
knowledge as cannot be believed to exist when we have regard to the
capacity and organisation of the animal we may be considering
an example of the first case is supplied by the larva of the stagbeetle
in its endeavour to make itself a convenient hole in which to become a
chrysalis  the female larva digs a hole exactly her own size but the
male makes one as long again as himself so as to allow for the growth of
his horns which will be about the same length as his body  a knowledge
of this circumstance is indispensable if the result achieved is to be
considered as due to reflection yet the actual present of the larva
affords it no ground for conjecturing beforehand the condition in which
it will presently find itself
as regards the second case ferrets and buzzards fall forthwith upon
blind worms or other nonpoisonous snakes and devour them then and
there  but they exhibit the greatest caution in laying hold of adders
even though they have never before seen one and will endeavour first to
bruise their heads so as to avoid being bitten  as there is nothing in
any other respect alarming in the adder a conscious knowledge of the
danger of its bite is indispensable if the conduct above described is to
be referred to conscious deliberation  but this could only have been
acquired through experience and the possibility of such experience may
be controlled in the case of animals that have been kept in captivity
from their youth up so that the knowledge displayed can be ascertained
to be independent of experience  on the other hand both the above
illustrations afford evidence of an unconscious perception of the facts
and prove the existence of a direct knowledge underivable from any
sensual impression or from consciousness
this has always been recognised 113 and has been described under the
words presentiment or foreboding  these words however refer on
the one hand only to an unknowable in the future separated from us by
space and not to one that is actually present on the other hand they
denote only the faint dull indefinite echo returned by consciousness to
an invariably distinct state of unconscious knowledge  hence the word
presentiment which carries with it an idea of faintness and
indistinctness while however it may be easily seen that sentiment
destitute of all even unconscious ideas can have no influence upon the
result for knowledge can only follow upon an idea  a presentiment that
sounds in consonance with our consciousness can indeed under certain
circumstances become tolerably definite so that in the case of man it
can be expressed in thought and language but experience teaches us that
even among ourselves this is not so when instincts special to the human
race come into play we see rather that the echo of our unconscious
knowledge which finds its way into our consciousness is so weak that it
manifests itself only in the accompanying feelings or frame of mind and
represents but an infinitely small fraction of the sum of our sensations
it is obvious that such a faintly sympathetic consciousness cannot form a
sufficient foundation for a superstructure of conscious deliberation on
the other hand conscious deliberation would be unnecessary inasmuch as
the process of thinking must have been already gone through
unconsciously for every faint presentiment that obtrudes itself upon our
consciousness is in fact only the consequence of a distinct unconscious
knowledge and the knowledge with which it is concerned is almost always
an idea of the purpose of some instinctive action or of one most
intimately connected therewith  thus in the case of the stagbeetle
the purpose consists in the leaving space for the growth of the horns
the means in the digging the hole of a sufficient size and the
unconscious knowledge in prescience concerning the future development of
the horns
lastly all instinctive actions give us an impression of absolute
security and infallibility  with instinct the will is never hesitating
or weak as it is when inferences are being drawn consciously  we never
find instinct making mistakes we cannot therefore ascribe a result
which is so invariably precise to such an obscure condition of mind as is
implied when the word presentiment is used on the contrary this
absolute certainty is so characteristic a feature of instinctive actions
that it constitutes almost the only wellmarked point of distinction
between these and actions that are done upon reflection  but from this
it must again follow that some principle lies at the root of instinct
other than that which underlies reflective action and this can only be
looked for in a determination of the will through a process that lies in
the unconscious 115a to which this character of unhesitating
infallibility will attach itself in all our future investigations
many will be surprised at my ascribing to instinct an unconscious
knowledge arising out of no sensual impression and yet invariably
accurate  this however is not a consequence of my theory concerning
instinct it is the foundation on which that theory is based and is
forced upon us by facts  i must therefore adduce examples  and to give
a name to the unconscious knowledge which is not acquired through
impression made upon the senses but which will be found to be in our
possession though attained without the instrumentality of means 115b
i prefer the word clairvoyance 115c to presentiment which for
reasons already given will not serve me  this word therefore will be
here employed throughout as above defined
let us now consider examples of the instincts of selfpreservation
subsistence migration and the continuation of the species  most
animals know their natural enemies prior to experience of any hostile
designs upon themselves  a flight of young pigeons even though they
have no old birds with them will become shy and will separate from one
another on the approach of a bird of prey  horses and cattle that come
from countries where there are no lions become unquiet and display alarm
as soon as they are aware that a lion is approaching them in the night
horses going along a bridlepath that used to leave the town at the back
of the old dens of the carnivora in the berlin zoological gardens were
often terrified by the propinquity of enemies who were entirely unknown
to them  sticklebacks will swim composedly among a number of voracious
pike knowing as they do that the pike will not touch them  for if a
pike once by mistake swallows a stickleback the stickleback will stick
in its throat by reason of the spine it carries upon its back and the
pike must starve to death without being able to transmit his painful
experience to his descendants  in some countries there are people who by
choice eat dogs flesh dogs are invariably savage in the presence of
these persons as recognising in them enemies at whose hands they may one
day come to harm  this is the more wonderful inasmuch as dogs fat
applied externally as when rubbed upon boots attracts dogs by its
smell  grant saw a young chimpanzee throw itself into convulsions of
terror at the sight of a large snake and even among ourselves a gretchen
can often detect a mephistopheles  an insect of the genius bombyx will
seize another of the genus parnopa and kill it wherever it finds it
without making any subsequent use of the body but we know that the
lastnamed insect lies in wait for the eggs of the first and is
therefore the natural enemy of its race  the phenomenon known to
stockdrivers and shepherds as das biesen des viehes affords another
example  for when a dassel or bies fly draws near the herd the
cattle become unmanageable and run about among one another as though they
were mad knowing as they do that the larv from the eggs which the fly
will lay upon them will presently pierce their hides and occasion them
painful sores  these dassel flieswhich have no stingclosely resemble
another kind of gadfly which has a sting  nevertheless this last kind
is little feared by cattle while the first is so to an inordinate
extent  the laying of the eggs upon the skin is at the time quite
painless and no ill consequences follow until long afterwards so that
we cannot suppose the cattle to draw a conscious inference concerning the
connection that exists between the two  i have already spoken of the
foresight shown by ferrets and buzzards in respect of adders in like
manner a young honeybuzzard on being shown a wasp for the first time
immediately devoured it after having squeezed the sting from its body
no animal whose instinct has not been vitiated by unnatural habits will
eat poisonous plants  even when apes have contracted bad habits through
their having been brought into contact with mankind they can still be
trusted to show us whether certain fruits found in their native forests
are poisonous or no for if poisonous fruits are offered them they will
refuse them with loud cries  every animal will choose for its sustenance
exactly those animal or vegetable substances which agree best with its
digestive organs without having received any instruction on the matter
and without testing them beforehand  even indeed though we assume that
the power of distinguishing the different kinds of food is due to sight
and not to smell it remains none the less mysterious how the animal can
know what it is that will agree with it  thus the kid which galen took
prematurely from its mother smelt at all the different kinds of food that
were set before it but drank only the milk without touching anything
else  the cherryfinch opens a cherrystone by turning it so that her
beak can hit the part where the two sides join and does this as much
with the first stone she cracks as with the last  fitchets martens and
weasels make small holes on the opposite sides of an egg which they are
about to suck so that the air may come in while they are sucking  not
only do animals know the food that will suit them best but they find out
the most suitable remedies when they are ill and constantly form a
correct diagnosis of their malady with a therapeutical knowledge which
they cannot possibly have acquired  dogs will often eat a great quantity
of grassparticularly couchgrasswhen they are unwell especially after
spring if they have worms which thus pass from them entangled in the
grass or if they want to get fragments of bone from out of their
stomachs  as a purgative they make use of plants that sting  hens and
pigeons pick lime from walls and pavements if their food does not afford
them lime enough to make their eggshells with  little children eat chalk
when suffering from acidity of the stomach and pieces of charcoal if
they are troubled with flatulence  we may observe these same instincts
for certain kinds of food or drugs even among grownup people under
circumstances in which their unconscious nature has unusual power as
for example among women when they are pregnant whose capricious
appetites are probably due to some special condition of the ftus which
renders a certain state of the blood desirable  fieldmice bite off the
germs of the corn which they collect together in order to prevent its
growing during the winter  some days before the beginning of cold
weather the squirrel is most assiduous in augmenting its store and then
closes its dwelling  birds of passage betake themselves to warmer
countries at times when there is still no scarcity of food for them here
and when the temperature is considerably warmer than it will be when they
return to us  the same holds good of the time when animals begin to
prepare their winter quarters which beetles constantly do during the
very hottest days of autumn  when swallows and storks find their way
back to their native places over distances of hundreds of miles and
though the aspect of the country is reversed we say that this is due to
the acuteness of their perception of locality but the same cannot be
said of dogs which though they have been carried in a bag from one
place to another that they do not know and have been turned round and
round twenty times over have still been known to find their way home
here we can say no more than that their instinct has conducted themthat
the clairvoyance of the unconscious has allowed them to conjecture their
way 119a
before an early winter birds of passage collect themselves in
preparation for their flight sooner than usual but when the winter is
going to be mild they will either not migrate at all or travel only a
small distance southward  when a hard winter is coming tortoises will
make their burrows deeper  if wild geese cranes etc soon return from
the countries to which they had betaken themselves at the beginning of
spring it is a sign that a hot and dry summer is about to ensue in those
countries and that the drought will prevent their being able to rear
their young  in years of flood beavers construct their dwellings at a
higher level than usual and shortly before an inundation the fieldmice
in kamtschatka come out of their holes in large bands  if the summer is
going to be dry spiders may be seen in may and april hanging from the
ends of threads several feet in length  if in winter spiders are seen
running about much fighting with one another and preparing new webs
there will be cold weather within the next nine days or from that to
twelve when they again hide themselves there will be a thaw  i have no
doubt that much of this power of prophesying the weather is due to a
perception of certain atmospheric conditions which escape ourselves but
this perception can only have relation to a certain actual and now
present condition of the weather and what can the impression made by
this have to do with their idea of the weather that will ensue  no one
will ascribe to animals a power of prognosticating the weather months
beforehand by means of inferences drawn logically from a series of
observations 119b to the extent of being able to foretell floods  it
is far more probable that the power of perceiving subtle differences of
actual atmospheric condition is nothing more than the sensual perception
which acts as motivefor a motive must assuredly be always presentwhen
an instinct comes into operation  it continues to hold good therefore
that the power of foreseeing the weather is a case of unconscious
clairvoyance of which the stork which takes its departure for the south
four weeks earlier than usual knows no more than does the stag when
before a cold winter he grows himself a thicker pelt than is his wont
on the one hand animals have present in their consciousness a perception
of the actual state of the weather on the other their ensuing action is
precisely such as it would be if the idea present with them was that of
the weather that is about to come  this they cannot consciously have
the only natural intermediate link therefore between their conscious
knowledge and their action is supplied by unconscious idea which
however is always accurately prescient inasmuch as it contains
something which is neither given directly to the animal through sensual
perception nor can be deduced inferentially through the understanding
most wonderful of all are the instincts connected with the continuation
of the species  the males always find out the females of their own kind
but certainly not solely through their resemblance to themselves  with
many animals as for example parasitic crabs the sexes so little
resemble one another that the male would be more likely to seek a mate
from the females of a thousand other species than from his own  certain
butterflies are polymorphic and not only do the males and females of the
same species differ but the females present two distinct forms one of
which as a general rule mimics the outward appearance of a distant but
highly valued species yet the males will pair only with the females of
their own kind and not with the strangers though these may be very
likely much more like the males themselves  among the insect species of
the strepsiptera the female is a shapeless worm which lives its whole
life long in the hind body of a wasp its head which is of the shape of
a lentil protrudes between two of the belly rings of the wasp the rest
of the body being inside  the male which only lives for a few hours
and resembles a moth nevertheless recognises his mate in spite of these
adverse circumstances and fecundates her
before any experience of parturition the knowledge that it is
approaching drives all mammals into solitude and bids them prepare a
nest for their young in a hole or in some other place of shelter  the
bird builds her nest as soon as she feels the eggs coming to maturity
within her  snails landcrabs treefrogs and toads all of them
ordinarily dwellers upon land now betake themselves to the water
seatortoises go on shore and many saltwater fishes come up into the
rivers in order to lay their eggs where they can alone find the
requisites for their development  insects lay their eggs in the most
varied kinds of situationsin sand on leaves under the hides and horny
substances of other animals they often select the spot where the larva
will be able most readily to find its future sustenance as in autumn
upon the trees that will open first in the coming spring or in spring
upon the blossoms that will first bear fruit in autumn or in the insides
of those caterpillars which will soonest as chrysalides provide the
parasitic larva at once with food and with protection  other insects
select the sites from which they will first get forwarded to the
destination best adapted for their development  thus some horseflies lay
their eggs upon the lips of horses or upon parts where they are
accustomed to lick themselves  the eggs get conveyed hence into the
entrails the proper place for their developmentand are excreted upon
their arrival at maturity  the flies that infest cattle know so well how
to select the most vigorous and healthiest beasts that cattledealers
and tanners place entire dependence upon them and prefer those beasts
and hides that are most scarred by maggots  this selection of the best
cattle by the help of these flies is no evidence in support of the
conclusion that the flies possess the power of making experiments
consciously and of reflecting thereupon even though the men whose trade
it is to do this recognise them as their masters  the solitary wasp
makes a hole several inches deep in the sand lays her egg and packs
along with it a number of green maggots that have no legs and which
being on the point of becoming chrysalides are well nourished and able
to go a long time without food she packs these maggots so closely
together that they cannot move nor turn into chrysalides and just enough
of them to support the larva until it becomes a chrysalis  a kind of bug
cerceris bupresticida which itself lives only upon pollen lays her
eggs in an underground cell and with each one of them she deposits three
beetles which she has lain in wait for and captured when they were still
weak through having only just left off being chrysalides  she kills
these beetles and appears to smear them with a fluid whereby she
preserves them fresh and suitable for food  many kinds of wasps open the
cells in which their larv are confined when these must have consumed the
provision that was left with them  they supply them with more food and
again close the cell  ants again hit always upon exactly the right
moment for opening the cocoons in which their larv are confined and for
setting them free the larva being unable to do this for itself  yet the
life of only a few kinds of insects lasts longer than a single breeding
season  what then can they know about the contents of their eggs and the
fittest place for their development  what can they know about the kind
of food the larva will want when it leaves the egga food so different
from their own  what again can they know about the quantity of food
that will be necessary  how much of all this at least can they know
consciously  yet their actions the pains they take and the importance
they evidently attach to these matters prove that they have a
foreknowledge of the future this knowledge therefore can only be an
unconscious clairvoyance  for clairvoyance it must certainly be that
inspires the will of an animal to open cells and cocoons at the very
moment that the larva is either ready for more food or fit for leaving
the cocoon  the eggs of the cuckoo do not take only from two to three
days to mature in her ovaries as those of most birds do but require
from eleven to twelve the cuckoo therefore cannot sit upon her own
eggs for her first egg would be spoiled before the last was laid  she
therefore lays in other birds nestsof course laying each egg in a
different nest  but in order that the birds may not perceive her egg to
be a stranger and turn it out of the nest not only does she lay an egg
much smaller than might be expected from a bird of her size for she only
finds her opportunity among small birds but as already said she
imitates the other eggs in the nest she has selected with surprising
accuracy in respect both of colour and marking  as the cuckoo chooses
the nest some days beforehand it may be thought if the nest is an open
one that the cuckoo looks upon the colour of the eggs within it while
her own is in process of maturing inside her and that it is thus her egg
comes to assume the colour of the others but this explanation will not
hold good for nests that are made in the holes of trees as that of
sylvia phnicurus or which are ovenshaped with a narrow entrance as
with sylvia rufa  in these cases the cuckoo can neither slip in nor
look in and must therefore lay her egg outside the nest and push it
inside with her beak she can therefore have no means of perceiving
through her senses what the eggs already in the nest are like  if then
in spite of all this her egg closely resembles the others this can only
have come about through an unconscious clairvoyance which directs the
process that goes on within the ovary in respect of colour and marking
an important argument in support of the existence of a clairvoyance in
the instincts of animals is to be found in the series of facts which
testify to the existence of a like clairvoyance under certain
circumstances even among human beings while the selfcurative instincts
of children and of pregnant women have been already mentioned  here
however 124 in correspondence with the higher stage of development
which human consciousness has attained a stronger echo of the
unconscious clairvoyance commonly resounds within consciousness itself
and this is represented by a more or less definite presentiment of the
consequences that will ensue  it is also in accord with the greater
independence of the human intellect that this kind of presentiment is not
felt exclusively immediately before the carrying out of an action but is
occasionally disconnected from the condition that an action has to be
performed immediately and displays itself simply as an idea
independently of conscious will provided only that the matter concerning
which the presentiment is felt is one which in a high degree concerns the
will of the person who feels it  in the intervals of an intermittent
fever or of other illness it not unfrequently happens that sick persons
can accurately foretell the day of an approaching attack and how long it
will last  the same thing occurs almost invariably in the case of
spontaneous and generally in that of artificial somnambulism certainly
the pythia as is well known used to announce the date of her next
ecstatic state  in like manner the curative instinct displays itself in
somnambulists and they have been known to select remedies that have been
no less remarkable for the success attending their employment than for
the completeness with which they have run counter to received
professional opinion  the indication of medicinal remedies is the only
use which respectable electrobiologists will make of the halfsleeping
halfwaking condition of those whom they are influencing  people in
perfectly sound health have been known before childbirth or at the
commencement of an illness to predict accurately their own approaching
death  the accomplishment of their predictions can hardly be explained
as the result of mere chance for if this were all the prophecy should
fail at least as often as not whereas the reverse is actually the case
many of these persons neither desire death nor fear it so that the
result cannot be ascribed to imagination  so writes the celebrated
physiologist burdach from whose chapter on presentiment in his work
bhicke ins leben a great part of my most striking examples is taken
this presentiment of deaths which is the exception among men is quite
common with animals even though they do not know nor understand what
death is  when they become aware that their end is approaching they
steal away to outlying and solitary places  this is why in cities we so
rarely see the dead body or skeleton of a cat  we can only suppose that
the unconscious clairvoyance which is of essentially the same kind
whether in man or beast calls forth presentiments of different degrees
of definiteness so that the cat is driven to withdraw herself through a
mere instinct without knowing why she does so while in man a definite
perception is awakened of the fact that he is about to die  not only do
people have presentiments concerning their own death but there are many
instances on record in which they have become aware of that of those near
and dear to them the dying person having appeared in a dream to friend
or wife or husband  stories to this effect prevail among all nations
and unquestionably contain much truth  closely connected with this is
the power of second sight which existed formerly in scotland and still
does so in the danish islands  this power enables certain people without
any ecstasy but simply through their keener perception to foresee
coming events or to tell what is going on in foreign countries on
matters in which they are deeply interested such as deaths battles
conflagrations swedenborg foretold the burning of stockholm the
arrival or the doings of friends who are at a distance  with many
persons this clairvoyance is confined to a knowledge of the death of
their acquaintances or fellowtownspeople  there have been a great many
instances of such deathprophetesses and what is most important some
cases have been verified in courts of law  i may say in passing that
this power of second sight is found in persons who are in ecstatic
states in the spontaneous or artificially induced somnambulism of the
higher kinds of waking dreams as well as in lucid moments before death
these prophetic glimpses by which the clairvoyance of the unconscious
reveals itself to consciousness 126 are commonly obscure because in
the brain they must assume a form perceptible by the senses whereas the
unconscious idea can have nothing to do with any form of sensual
impression it is for this reason that humours dreams and the
hallucinations of sick persons can so easily have a false signification
attached to them  the chances of error and selfdeception that arise
from this source the ease with which people may be deceived
intentionally and the mischief which as a general rule attends a
knowledge of the future these considerations place beyond all doubt the
practical unwisdom of attempts to arrive at certainty concerning the
future  this however cannot affect the weight which in theory should
be attached to phenomena of this kind and must not prevent us from
recognising the positive existence of the clairvoyance whose existence i
am maintaining though it is often hidden under a chaos of madness and
imposture
the materialistic and rationalistic tendencies of the present day lead
most people either to deny facts of this kind in toto or to ignore
them inasmuch as they are inexplicable from a materialistic standpoint
and cannot be established by the inductive or experimental methodas
though this last were not equally impossible in the case of morals
social science and politics  a mind of any candour will only be able to
deny the truths of this entire class of phenomena so long as it remains
in ignorance of the facts that have been related concerning them but
again a continuance in this ignorance can only arise from unwillingness
to be convinced  i am satisfied that many of those who deny all human
power of divination would come to another and to say the least more
cautious conclusion if they would be at the pains of further
investigation and i hold that no one even at the present day need be
ashamed of joining in with an opinion which was maintained by all the
great spirits of antiquity except epicurusan opinion whose possible
truth hardly one of our best modern philosophers has ventured to
contravene and which the champions of german enlightenment were so
little disposed to relegate to the domain of old wives tales that
goethe furnishes us with an example of second sight that fell within his
own experience and confirms it down to its minutest details
although i am far from believing that the kind of phenomena above
referred to form in themselves a proper foundation for a superstructure
of scientific demonstration i nevertheless find them valuable as a
completion and further confirmation of the series of phenomena presented
to us by the clairvoyance which we observe in human and animal instinct
even though they only continue this series 128 through the echo that is
awakened within our consciousness they as powerfully support the account
which instinctive actions give concerning their own nature as they are
themselves supported by the analogy they present to the clairvoyance
observable in instinct  this then as well as my desire not to lose an
opportunity of protesting against a modern prejudice must stand as my
reason for having allowed myself to refer in a scientific work to a
class of phenomena which has fallen at present into so much discredit
i will conclude with a few words upon a special kind of instinct which
has a very instructive bearing upon the subject generally and shows how
impossible it is to evade the supposition of an unconscious clairvoyance
on the part of instinct  in the examples adduced hitherto the action of
each individual has been done on the individuals own behalf except in
the case of instincts connected with the continuation of the species
where the action benefits othersthat is to say the offspring of the
creature performing it
we must now examine the cases in which a solidarity of instinct is found
to exist between several individuals so that on the one hand the
action of each redounds to the common welfare and on the other it
becomes possible for a useful purpose to be achieved through the
harmonious association of individual workers  this community of instinct
exists also among the higher animals but here it is harder to
distinguish from associations originating through conscious will
inasmuch as speech supplies the means of a more perfect
intercommunication of aim and plan  we shall however definitely
recognise 129 this general effect of a universal instinct in the origin
of speech and in the great political and social movements in the history
of the world  here we are concerned only with the simplest and most
definite examples that can be found anywhere and therefore we will deal
in preference with the lower animals among which in the absence of
voice the means of communicating thought mimicry and physiognomy are
so imperfect that the harmony and interconnection of the individual
actions cannot in its main points be ascribed to an understanding arrived
at through speech  huber observed that when a new comb was being
constructed a number of the largest workingbees that were full of
honey took no part in the ordinary business of the others but remained
perfectly aloof  twentyfour hours afterwards small plates of wax had
formed under their bellies  the bee drew these off with her hindfeet
masticated them and made them into a band  the small plates of wax thus
prepared were then glued to the roof of the hive one on the top of the
other  when one of the bees of this kind had used up her plates of wax
another followed her and carried the same work forward in the same way
a thin rough vertical wall half a line in thickness and fastened to the
sides of the hive was thus constructed  on this one of the smaller
workingbees whose belly was empty came and after surveying the wall
made a flat halfoval excavation in the middle of one of its sides she
piled up the wax thus excavated round the edge of the excavation  after
a short time she was relieved by another like herself till more than
twenty followed one another in this way  meanwhile another bee began to
make a similar hollow on the other side of the wall but corresponding
only with the rim of the excavation on this side  presently another bee
began a second hollow upon the same side each bee being continually
relieved by others  other bees kept coming up and bringing under their
bellies plates of wax with which they heightened the edge of the small
wall of wax  in this new bees were constantly excavating the ground for
more cells while others proceeded by degrees to bring those already
begun into a perfectly symmetrical shape and at the same time continued
building up the prismatic walls between them  thus the bees worked on
opposite sides of the wall of wax always on the same plan and in the
closest correspondence with those upon the other side until eventually
the cells on both sides were completed in all their wonderful regularity
and harmony of arrangement not merely as regards those standing side by
side but also as regards those which were upon the other side of their
pyramidal base
let the reader consider how animals that are accustomed to confer
together by speech or otherwise concerning designs which they may be
pursuing in common will wrangle with thousandfold diversity of opinion
let him reflect how often something has to be undone destroyed and done
over again how at one time too many hands come forward and at another
too few what running to and fro there is before each has found his right
place how often too many and again too few present themselves for a
relief gang and how we find all this in the concerted works of men who
stand so far higher than bees in the scale of organisation  we see
nothing of the kind among bees  a survey of their operations leaves
rather the impression upon us as though an invisible masterbuilder had
prearranged a scheme of action for the entire community and had
impressed it upon each individual member as though each class of workers
had learnt their appointed work by heart knew their places and the
numbers in which they should relieve each other and were informed
instantaneously by a secret signal of the moment when their action was
wanted  this however is exactly the manner in which an instinct works
and as the intention of the entire community is instinctively present in
the unconscious clairvoyance 131a of each individual bee so the
possession of this common instinct impels each one of them to the
discharge of her special duties when the right moment has arrived  it is
only thus that the wonderful tranquillity and order which we observe
could be attained  what we are to think concerning this common instinct
must be reserved for explanation later on but the possibility of its
existence is already evident inasmuch 131b as each individual has an
unconscious insight concerning the plan proposed to itself by the
community and also concerning the means immediately to be adopted
through concerted actionof which however only the part requiring his
own cooperation is present in the consciousness of each  thus for
example the larva of the bee itself spins the silky chamber in which it
is to become a chrysalis but other bees must close it with its lid of
wax  the purpose of there being a chamber in which the larva can become
a chrysalis must be present in the minds of each of these two parties to
the transaction but neither of them acts under the influence of
conscious will except in regard to his own particular department  i
have already mentioned the fact that the larva after its metamorphosis
must be freed from its cell by other bees and have told how the
workingbees in autumn kill the drones so that they may not have to feed
a number of useless mouths throughout the winter and how they only spare
them when they are wanted in order to fecundate a new queen
furthermore the workingbees build cells in which the eggs laid by the
queen may come to maturity and as a general rule make just as many
chambers as the queen lays eggs they make these moreover in the same
order as that in which the queen lays her eggs namely first for the
workingbees then for the drones and lastly for the queens  in the
polity of the bees the working and the sexual capacities which were
once united are now personified in three distinct kinds of individual
and these combine with an inner unconscious spiritual union so as to
form a single body politic as the organs of a living body combine to
form the body itself
in this chapter therefore we have arrived at the following
conclusions
instinct is not the result of conscious deliberation 132 it is not a
consequence of bodily organisation it is not a mere result of a
mechanism which lies in the organisation of the brain it is not the
operation of dead mechanism glued on as it were to the soul and
foreign to its inmost essence but it is the spontaneous action of the
individual springing from his most essential nature and character  the
purpose to which any particular kind of instinctive action is subservient
is not the purpose of a soul standing outside the individual and near
akin to providencea purpose once for all thought out and now become a
matter of necessity to the individual so that he can act in no other
way though it is engrafted into his nature from without and not natural
to it  the purpose of the instinct is in each individual case thought
out and willed unconsciously by the individual and afterwards the choice
of means adapted to each particular case is arrived at unconsciously  a
knowledge of the purpose is often absolutely unattainable 133 by
conscious knowledge through sensual perception  then does the
peculiarity of the unconscious display itself in the clairvoyance of
which consciousness perceives partly only a faint and dull and partly
as in the case of man a more or less definite echo by way of sentiment
whereas the instinctive action itselfthe carrying out of the means
necessary for the achievement of the unconscious purposefalls always
more clearly within consciousness inasmuch as due performance of what is
necessary would be otherwise impossible  finally the clairvoyance makes
itself perceived in the concerted action of several individuals combining
to carry out a common but unconscious purpose
up to this point we have encountered clairvoyance as a fact which we
observe but cannot explain and the reader may say that he prefers to
take his stand here and be content with regarding instinct simply as a
matter of fact the explanation of which is at present beyond our reach
against this it must be urged firstly that clairvoyance is not confined
to instinct but is found also in man secondly that clairvoyance is by
no means present in all instincts and that therefore our experience
shows us clairvoyance and instinct as two distinct thingsclairvoyance
being of great use in explaining instinct but instinct serving nothing
to explain clairvoyance thirdly and lastly that the clairvoyance of the
individual will not continue to be so incomprehensible to us but will be
perfectly well explained in the further course of our investigation
while we must give up all hope of explaining instinct in any other way
the conception we have thus arrived at enables us to regard instinct as
the innermost kernel so to speak of every living being  that this is
actually the case is shown by the instincts of selfpreservation and of
the continuation of the species which we observe throughout creation and
by the heroic selfabandonment with which the individual will sacrifice
welfare and even life at the bidding of instinct  we see this when we
think of the caterpillar and how she repairs her cocoon until she yields
to exhaustion of the bird and how she will lay herself to death of the
disquiet and grief displayed by all migratory animals if they are
prevented from migrating  a captive cuckoo will always die at the
approach of winter through despair at being unable to fly away so will
the vineyard snail if it is hindered of its winter sleep  the weakest
mother will encounter an enemy far surpassing her in strength and suffer
death cheerfully for her offsprings sake  every year we see fresh cases
of people who have been unfortunate going mad or committing suicide
women who have survived the csarian operation allow themselves so little
to be deterred from further childbearing through fear of this frightful
and generally fatal operation that they will undergo it no less than
three times  can we suppose that what so closely resembles demoniacal
possession can have come about through something engrafted on to the soul
as a mechanism foreign to its inner nature 135 or through conscious
deliberation which adheres always to a bare egoism and is utterly
incapable of such selfsacrifice for the sake of offspring as is
displayed by the procreative and maternal instincts
we have now finally to consider how it arises that the instincts of any
animal species are so similar within the limits of that speciesa
circumstance which has not a little contributed to the
engraftedmechanism theory  but it is plain that like causes will be
followed by like effects and this should afford sufficient explanation
the bodily mechanism for example of all the individuals of a species is
alike so again are their capabilities and the outcomes of their
conscious intelligencethough this indeed is not the case with man nor
in some measure even with the highest animals and it is through this
want of uniformity that there is such a thing as individuality  the
external conditions of all the individuals of a species are also
tolerably similar and when they differ essentially the instincts are
likewise differenta fact in support of which no examples are necessary
from like conditions of mind and body and this includes like
predispositions of brain and ganglia and like exterior circumstances
like desires will follow as a necessary logical consequence  again from
like desires and like inward and outward circumstances a like choice of
meansthat is to say like instinctsmust ensue  these last two steps
would not be conceded without restriction if the question were one
involving conscious deliberation but as these logical consequences are
supposed to follow from the unconscious which takes the right step
unfailingly without vacillation or delay so long as the premises are
similar the ensuing desires and the instincts to adopt the means for
their gratification will be similar also
thus the view which we have taken concerning instinct explains the very
last point which it may be thought worth while to bring forward in
support of the opinions of our opponents
i will conclude this chapter with the words of schelling thoughtful
minds will hold the phenomena of animal instinct to belong to the most
important of all phenomena and to be the true touchstone of a durable
philosophy
chapter ix
remarks upon von hartmanns position in regard to instinct
uncertain how far the foregoing chapter is not better left without
comment of any kind i nevertheless think that some of my readers may be
helped by the following extracts from the notes i took while translating
i will give them as they come without throwing them into connected form
                                    
von hartmann defines instinct as action done with a purpose but without
consciousness of purpose
the building of her nest by a bird is an instinctive action it is done
with a purpose but it is arbitrary to say that the bird has no knowledge
of that purpose  some hold that birds when they are building their nest
know as well that they mean to bring up a family in it as a young married
couple do when they build themselves a house  this is the conclusion
which would be come to by a plain person on a prim facie view of the
facts and von hartmann shows no reason for modifying it
a better definition of instinct would be that it is inherited knowledge
in respect of certain facts and of the most suitable manner in which to
deal with them
                                    
von hartmann speaks of a mechanism of brain or mind contrived by
nature and again of a psychical organisation as though it were
something distinct from a physical organisation
we can conceive of such a thing as mechanism of brain for we have seen
brain and handled it but until we have seen a mind and handled it or at
any rate been enabled to draw inferences which will warrant us in
conceiving of it as a material substance apart from bodily substance we
cannot infer that it has an organisation apart from bodily organisation
does von hartmann mean that we have two bodiesa bodybody and a
soulbody
                                    
he says that no one will call the action of the spider instinctive in
voiding the fluids from its glands when they are too full  why not
                                    
he is continually personifying instinct thus he speaks of the ends
proposed to itself by the instinct of the blind unconscious purpose of
the instinct of an unconscious purpose constraining the volition of
the bird of each variation and modification of the instinct as
though instinct purpose and later on clairvoyance were persons and
not words characterising a certain class of actions  the ends are
proposed to itself by the animal not by the instinct  nothing but
mischief can come of a mode of expression which does not keep this
clearly in view
                                    
it must not be supposed that the same cuckoo is in the habit of laying in
the nests of several different species and of changing the colour of her
eggs according to that of the eggs of the bird in whose nest she lays  i
have inquired from mr r bowdler sharpe of the ornithological department
at the british museum who kindly gives it me as his opinion that though
cuckoos do imitate the eggs of the species on whom they foist their young
ones yet one cuckoo will probably lay in the nests of one species also
and will stick to that species for life  if so the same race of cuckoos
may impose upon the same species for generations together  the instinct
will even thus remain a very wonderful one but it is not at all
inconsistent with the theory put forward by professor hering and myself
                                    
returning to the idea of psychical mechanism he admits that it is
itself so obscure that we can hardly form any idea concerning it 139a
and then goes on to claim for it that it explains a great many other
things  this must have been the passage which mr sully had in view when
he very justly wrote that von hartmann dogmatically closes the field of
physical inquiry and takes refuge in a phantom which explains
everything simply because it is itself incapable of explanation
                                    
according to von hartmann 139b the unpractised animal manifests its
instinct as perfectly as the practised  this is not the case  the young
animal exhibits marvellous proficiency but it gains by experience  i
have watched sparrows which i can hardly doubt to be young ones spend a
whole month in trying to build their nest and give it up in the end as
hopeless  i have watched three such cases this spring in a tree not
twenty feet from my own window and on a level with my eye so that i have
been able to see what was going on at all hours of the day  in each case
the nest was made well and rapidly up to a certain point and then got
topheavy and tumbled over so that little was left on the tree it was
reconstructed and reconstructed over and over again always with the same
result till at last in all three cases the birds gave up in despair  i
believe the older and stronger birds secure the fixed and best sites
driving the younger birds to the trees and that the art of building
nests in trees is dying out among housesparrows
                                    
he declares that instinct is not due to organisation so much as
organisation to instinct 140  the fact is that neither can claim
precedence of or preeminence over the other  instinct and organisation
are only mind and body or mind and matter and these are not two
separable things but one and inseparable with as it were two sides
the one of which is a function of the other  there was never yet either
matter without mind however low nor mind however high without a
material body of some sort there can be no change in one without a
corresponding change in the other neither came before the other neither
can either cease to change or cease to be for to be is to continue
changing so that to be and to change are one
                                    
whence he asks comes the desire to gratify an instinct before
experience of the pleasure that will ensue on gratification  this is a
pertinent question but it is met by professor hering with the answer
that this is due to memoryto the continuation in the germ of vibrations
that were vibrating in the body of the parent and which when stimulated
by vibrations of a suitable rhythm become more and more powerful till
they suffice to set the body in visible action  for my own part i only
venture to maintain that it is due to memory that is to say to an
enduring sense on the part of the germ of the action it took when in the
persons of its ancestors and of the gratification which ensued thereon
this meets von hartmanns whole difficulty
                                    
the glacier is not snow  it is snow packed tight into a small compass
and has thus lost all trace of its original form  how incomplete
however would be any theory of glacial action which left out of sight
the origin of the glacier in snow  von hartmann loses sight of the
origin of instinctive in deliberative actions because the two classes of
action are now in many respects different  his philosophy of the
unconscious fails to consider what is the normal process by means of
which such common actions as we can watch and whose history we can
follow have come to be done unconsciously
                                    
he says 141 how inconceivable is the supposition of a mechanism c
c how clear and simple on the other hand is the view that there is
an unconscious purpose constraining the volition of the bird to the use
of the fitting means  does he mean that there is an actual thingan
unconscious purposesomething outside the bird as it were a man which
lays hold of the bird and makes it do this or that as a master makes a
servant do his bidding  if so he again personifies the purpose itself
and must therefore embody it or be talking in a manner which plain
people cannot understand  if on the other hand he means how simple is
the view that the bird acts unconsciously this is not more simple than
supposing it to act consciously and what ground has he for supposing
that the bird is unconscious  it is as simple and as much in accordance
with the facts to suppose that the bird feels the air to be colder and
knows that she must warm her eggs if she is to hatch them as consciously
as a mother knows that she must not expose her newborn infant to the
cold
                                    
on page 99 of this book we find von hartmann saying that if it is once
granted that the normal and abnormal manifestations of instinct spring
from a single source then the objection that the modification is due to
conscious knowledge will be found to be a suicidal one later on in so
far as it is directed against instinct generally  i understand him to
mean that if we admit instinctive action and the modifications of that
action which more nearly resemble results of reason to be actions of the
same ultimate kind differing in degree only and if we thus attempt to
reduce instinctive action to the prophetic strain arising from old
experience we shall be obliged to admit that the formation of the embryo
is ultimately due to reflectionwhich he seems to think is a reductio ad
absurdum of the argument
therefore he concludes if there is to be only one source the source
must be unconscious and not conscious  we reply that we do not see the
absurdity of the position which we grant we have been driven to  we hold
that the formation of the embryo is ultimately due to reflection and
design
                                    
the writer of an article in the times april 1 1880 says that
servants must be taught their calling before they can practise it but
in fact they can only be taught their calling by practising it  so von
hartmann says animals must feel the pleasure consequent on gratification
of an instinct before they can be stimulated to act upon the instinct by
a knowledge of the pleasure that will ensue  this sounds logical but in
practice a little performance and a little teachinga little sense of
pleasure and a little connection of that pleasure with this or that
practicecome up simultaneously from something that we cannot see the
two being so small and so much abreast that we do not know which is
first performance or teaching and again action or pleasure supposed
as coming from the action
                                    
geistesmechanismus comes as near to disposition of mind or more
shortly disposition as so unsatisfactory a word can come to anything
yet if we translate it throughout by disposition we shall see how
little we are being told
we find on page 114 that all instinctive actions give us an impression
of absolute security and infallibility that the will is never weak or
hesitating as it is when inferences are being drawn consciously  we
never von hartmann continues find instinct making mistakes  passing
over the fact that instinct is again personified the statement is still
incorrect  instinctive actions are certainly as a general rule
performed with less uncertainty than deliberative ones this is
explicable by the fact that they have been more often practised and thus
reduced more completely to a matter of routine but nothing is more
certain than that animals acting under the guidance of inherited
experience or instinct frequently make mistakes which with further
practice they correct  von hartmann has abundantly admitted that the
manner of an instinctive action is often varied in correspondence with
variation in external circumstances  it is impossible to see how this
does not involve both possibility of error and the connection of instinct
with deliberation at one and the same time  the fact is simply thiswhen
an animal finds itself in a like position with that in which it has
already often done a certain thing in the persons of its forefathers it
will do this thing well and easily when it finds the position somewhat
but not unrecognisably altered through change either in its own person
or in the circumstances exterior to it it will vary its action with
greater or less ease according to the nature of the change in the
position when the position is gravely altered the animal either bungles
or is completely thwarted
                                    
not only does von hartmann suppose that instinct may and does involve
knowledge antecedent to and independent of experiencean idea as
contrary to the tendency of modern thought as that of spontaneous
generation with which indeed it is identical though presented in another
shapebut he implies by his frequent use of the word unmittelbar that a
result can come about without any cause whatever  so he says um fr
die unbewusster erkenntniss welche nicht durch sinnliche wahrnehmung
erworben sondern als unmittelbar besitz c 144a  because he does
not see where the experience can have been gained he cuts the knot and
denies that there has been experience  we say look more attentively and
you will discover the time and manner in which the experience was gained
                                    
again he continually assumes that animals low down in the scale of life
cannot know their own business because they show no sign of knowing ours
see his remarks on saturnia pavonia minor page 107 and elsewhere on
cattle and gadflies  the question is not what can they know but what
does their action prove to us that they do know  with each species of
animal or plant there is one profession only and it is hereditary  with
us there are many professions and they are not hereditary so that they
cannot become instinctive as they would otherwise tend to do
                                    
he attempts 144b to draw a distinction between the causes that have
produced the weapons and working instruments of animals on the one hand
and those that lead to the formation of hexagonal cells by bees c on
the other  no such distinction can be justly drawn
                                    
the ghoststories which von hartmann accepts will hardly be accepted by
people of sound judgment  there is one wellmarked distinctive feature
between the knowledge manifested by animals when acting instinctively and
the supposed knowledge of seers and clairvoyants  in the first case the
animal never exhibits knowledge except upon matters concerning which its
race has been conversant for generations in the second the seer is
supposed to do so  in the first case a new feature is invariably
attended with disturbance of the performance and the awakening of
consciousness and deliberation unless the new matter is too small in
proportion to the remaining features of the case to attract attention or
unless though really new it appears so similar to an old feature as to
be at first mistaken for it with the second it is not even professed
that the seers ancestors have had long experience upon the matter
concerning which the seer is supposed to have special insight and i can
imagine no more powerful  priori argument against a belief in such

close upon the end of his chapter von hartmann touches upon the one
matter which requires consideration  he refers the similarity of
instinct that is observable among all species to the fact that like
causes produce like effects and i gather though he does not expressly
say so that he considers similarity of instinct in successive
generations to be referable to the same cause as similarity of instinct
between all the contemporary members of a species  he thus raises the
one objection against referring the phenomena of heredity to memory which
i think need be gone into with any fulness  i will however reserve
this matter for my concluding chapters
von hartmann concludes his chapter with a quotation from schelling to
the effect that the phenomena of animal instinct are the true touchstone
of a durable philosophy by which i suppose it is intended to say that if
a system or theory deals satisfactorily with animal instinct it will
stand but not otherwise  i can wish nothing better than that the
philosophy of the unconscious advanced by von hartmann be tested by this
standard
chapter x
recapitulation and statement of an objection
the true theory of unconscious action then is that of professor hering
from whose lecture it is no strained conclusion to gather that he holds
the action of all living beings from the moment of their conception to
that of their fullest development to be founded in volition and design
though these have been so long lost sight of that the work is now carried
on as it were departmentally and in due course according to an official
routine which can hardly now be departed from
this involves the older darwinism and the theory of lamarck according
to which the modification of living forms has been effected mainly
through the needs of the living forms themselves which vary with varying
conditions the survival of the fittest which as i see mr h b
baildon has just said sometimes comes to mean merely the survival of
the survivors 146 being taken almost as a matter of course
according to this view of evolution there is a remarkable analogy
between the development of living organs or tools and that of those
organs or tools external to the body which has been so rapid during the
last few thousand years
animals and plants according to professor hering are guided throughout
their development and preserve the due order in each step which they
take through memory of the course they took on past occasions when in
the persons of their ancestors  i am afraid i have already too often
said that if this memory remains for long periods together latent and
without effect it is because the undulations of the molecular substance
of the body which are its supposed explanation are during these periods
too feeble to generate action until they are augmented in force through
an accession of suitable undulations issuing from exterior objects or
in other words until recollection is stimulated by a return of the
associated ideas  on this the eternal agitation becomes so much
enhanced that equilibrium is visibly disturbed and the action ensues
which is proper to the vibration of the particular substance under the
particular conditions  this at least is what i suppose professor
hering to intend
leaving the explanation of memory on one side and confining ourselves to
the fact of memory only a caterpillar on being just hatched is supposed
according to this theory to lose its memory of the time it was in the
egg and to be stimulated by an intense but unconscious recollection of
the action taken by its ancestors when they were first hatched  it is
guided in the course it takes by the experience it can thus command
each step it takes recalls a new recollection and thus it goes through
its development as a performer performs a piece of music each bar
leading his recollection to the bar that should next follow
in life and habit will be found examples of the manner in which this
view solves a number of difficulties for the explanation of which the
leading men of science express themselves at a loss  the following from
professor huxleys recent work upon the crayfish may serve for an
example  professor huxley writes
    it is a widely received notion that the energies of living matter
    have a tendency to decline and finally disappear and that the death
    of the body as a whole is a necessary correlate of its life  that
    all living beings sooner or later perish needs no demonstration but
    it would be difficult to find satisfactory grounds for the belief
    that they needs must do so  the analogy of a machine that sooner or
    later must be brought to a standstill by the wear and tear of its
    parts does not hold inasmuch as the animal mechanism is continually
    renewed and repaired and though it is true that individual
    components of the body are constantly dying yet their places are
    taken by vigorous successors  a city remains notwithstanding the
    constant deathrate of its inhabitants and such an organism as a
    crayfish is only a corporate unity made up of innumerable partially
    independent individualitiesthe crayfish p 127
surely the theory which i have indicated above makes the reason plain why
no organism can permanently outlive its experience of past lives  the
death of such a body corporate as the crayfish is due to the social
condition becoming more complex than there is memory of past experience
to deal with  hence social disruption insubordination and decay  the
crayfish dies as a state dies and all states that we have heard of die
sooner or later  there are some savages who have not yet arrived at the
conception that death is the necessary end of all living beings and who
consider even the gentlest death from old age as violent and abnormal so
professor huxley seems to find a difficulty in seeing that though a city
commonly outlives many generations of its citizens yet cities and states
are in the end no less mortal than individuals  the city he says
remains  yes but not for ever  when professor huxley can find a city
that will last for ever he may wonder that a crayfish does not last for
ever
i have already here and elsewhere said all that i can yet bring forward
in support of professor herings theory it now remains for me to meet
the most troublesome objection to it that i have been able to think ofan
objection which i had before me when i wrote life and habit but which
then as now i believe to be unsound  seeing however as i have pointed
out at the end of the preceding chapter that von hartmann has touched
upon it and being aware that a plausible case can be made out for it i
will state it and refute it here  when i say refute it i do not mean
that i shall have done with itfor it is plain that it opens up a vaster
question in the relations between the socalled organic and inorganic
worldsbut that i will refute the supposition that it any way militates
against professor herings theory
why it may be asked should we go out of our way to invent unconscious
memorythe existence of which must at the best remain an inference
149when the observed fact that like antecedents are invariably
followed by like consequents should be sufficient for our purpose  why
should the fact that a given kind of chrysalis in a given condition will
always become a butterfly within a certain time be connected with memory
when it is not pretended that memory has anything to do with the
invariableness with which oxygen and hydrogen when mixed in certain
proportions make water
we assume confidently that if a drop of water were decomposed into its
component parts and if these were brought together again and again
decomposed and again brought together any number of times over the
results would be invariably the same whether decomposition or
combination yet no one will refer the invariableness of the action
during each repetition to recollection by the gaseous molecules of the
course taken when the process was last repeated  on the contrary we are
assured that molecules in some distant part of the world which had never
entered into such and such a known combination themselves nor held
concert with other molecules that had been so combined and which
therefore could have had no experience and no memory would none the
less act upon one another in that one way in which other like
combinations of atoms have acted under like circumstances as readily as
though they had been combined and separated and recombined again a
hundred or a hundred thousand times  it is this assumption tacitly made
by every man beast and plant in the universe throughout all time and
in every action of their lives that has made any action possible lying
as it does at the root of all experience
as we admit of no doubt concerning the main result so we do not suppose
an alternative to lie before any atom of any molecule at any moment
during the process of their combination  this process is in all
probability an exceedingly complicated one involving a multitude of
actions and subordinate processes which follow one upon the other and
each one of which has a beginning a middle and an end though they all
come to pass in what appears to be an instant of time  yet at no point
do we conceive of any atom as swerving ever such a little to right or
left of a determined course but invest each one of them with so much of
the divine attributes as that with it there shall be no variableness
neither shadow of turning
we attribute this regularity of action to what we call the necessity of
things as determined by the nature of the atoms and the circumstances in
which they are placed  we say that only one proximate result can ever
arise from any given combination  if then so great uniformity of
action as nothing can exceed is manifested by atoms to which no one will
impute memory why this desire for memory as though it were the only way
of accounting for regularity of action in living beings  sameness of
action may be seen abundantly where there is no room for anything that we
can consistently call memory  in these cases we say that it is due to
sameness of substance in same circumstances
the most cursory reflection upon our actions will show us that it is no
more possible for living action to have more than one set of proximate
consequents at any given time than for oxygen and hydrogen when mixed in
the proportions proper for the formation of water  why then not
recognise this fact and ascribe repeated similarity of living action to
the reproduction of the necessary antecedents with no more sense of
connection between the steps in the action or memory of similar action
taken before than we suppose on the part of oxygen and hydrogen
molecules between the several occasions on which they may have been
disunited and reunited
a boy catches the measles not because he remembers having caught them in
the persons of his father and mother but because he is a fit soil for a
certain kind of seed to grow upon  in like manner he should be said to
grow his nose because he is a fit combination for a nose to spring from
dr xs father died of angina pectoris at the age of fortynine so
did dr x  can it be pretended that dr x remembered having died of
angina pectoris at the age of fortynine when in the person of his
father and accordingly when he came to be fortynine years old himself
died also  for this to hold dr xs father must have begotten him
after he was dead for the son could not remember the fathers death
before it happened
as for the diseases of old age so very commonly inherited they are
developed for the most part not only long after the average age of
reproduction but at a time when no appreciable amount of memory of any
previous existence can remain for a man will not have many male
ancestors who become parents at over sixty years old nor female
ancestors who did so at over forty  by our own showing therefore
recollection can have nothing to do with the matter  yet who can doubt
that gout is due to inheritance as much as eyes and noses  in what
respects do the two things differ so that we should refer the inheritance
of eyes and noses to memory while denying any connection between memory
and gout  we may have a ghost of a pretence for saying that a man grew a
nose by rote or even that he catches the measles or whoopingcough by
rote during his boyhood but do we mean to say that he develops the gout
by rote in his old age if he comes of a gouty family  if then rote and
redtape have nothing to do with the one why should they with the other
remember also the cases in which aged females develop male
characteristics  here are growths often of not inconsiderable extent
which make their appearance during the decay of the body and grow with
greater and greater vigour in the extreme of old age and even for days
after death itself  it can hardly be doubted that an especial tendency
to develop these characteristics runs as an inheritance in certain
families here then is perhaps the best case that can be found of a
development strictly inherited but having clearly nothing whatever to do
with memory  why should not all development stand upon the same footing
a friend who had been arguing with me for some time as above concluded
with the following words
    if you cannot be content with the similar action of similar
    substances living or nonliving under similar circumstancesif you
    cannot accept this as an ultimate fact but consider it necessary to
    connect repetition of similar action with memory before you can rest
    in it and be thankfulbe consistent and introduce this memory which
    you find so necessary into the inorganic world also  either say that
    a chrysalis becomes a butterfly because it is the thing that it is
    and being that kind of thing must act in such and such a manner and
    in such a manner only so that the act of one generation has no more
    to do with the act of the next than the fact of cream being churned
    into butter in a dairy one day has to do with other cream being
    churnable into butter in the following weekeither say this or else
    develop some mental conditionwhich i have no doubt you will be very
    well able to do if you feel the want of itin which you can make out
    a case for saying that oxygen and hydrogen on being brought together
    and cream on being churned are in some way acquainted with and
    mindful of action taken by other cream and other oxygen and hydrogen
    on past occasions
i felt inclined to reply that my friend need not twit me with being able
to develop a mental organism if i felt the need of it for his own
ingenious attack on my position and indeed every action of his life was
but an example of this omnipresent principle
when he was gone however i thought over what he had been saying  i
endeavoured to see how far i could get on without volition and memory
and reasoned as followsa repetition of like antecedents will be
certainly followed by a repetition of like consequents whether the
agents be men and women or chemical substances  if there be two cowards
perfectly similar in every respect and if they be subjected in a
perfectly similar way to two terrifying agents which are themselves
perfectly similar there are few who will not expect a perfect similarity
in the running away even though ten thousand years intervene between the
original combination and its repetition 153  here certainly there is
no coming into play of memory more than in the pan of cream on two
successive churning days yet the action is similar
a clerk in an office has an hour in the middle of the day for dinner
about halfpast twelve he begins to feel hungry at once he takes down
his hat and leaves the office  he does not yet know the neighbourhood
and on getting down into the street asks a policeman at the corner which
is the best eatinghouse within easy distance  the policeman tells him
of three houses one of which is a little farther off than the other two
but is cheaper  money being a greater object to him than time the clerk
decides on going to the cheaper house  he goes is satisfied and
returns
next day he wants his dinner at the same hour andit will be
saidremembering his satisfaction of yesterday will go to the same place
as before  but what has his memory to do with it  suppose him to have
entirely forgotten all the circumstances of the preceding day from the
moment of his beginning to feel hungry onward though in other respects
sound in mind and body and unchanged generally  at halfpast twelve he
would begin to be hungry but his beginning to be hungry cannot be
connected with his remembering having begun to be hungry yesterday  he
would begin to be hungry just as much whether he remembered or no  at
one oclock he again takes down his hat and leaves the office not
because he remembers having done so yesterday but because he wants his
hat to go out with  being again in the street and again ignorant of the
neighbourhood for he remembers nothing of yesterday he sees the same
policeman at the corner of the street and asks him the same question as
before the policeman gives him the same answer and money being still an
object to him the cheapest eatinghouse is again selected he goes
there finds the same menu makes the same choice for the same reasons
eats is satisfied and returns
what similarity of action can be greater than this and at the same time
more incontrovertible  but it has nothing to do with memory on the
contrary it is just because the clerk has no memory that his action of
the second day so exactly resembles that of the first  as long as he has
no power of recollecting he will day after day repeat the same actions
in exactly the same way until some external circumstances such as his
being sent away modify the situation  till this or some other
modification occurs he will day after day go down into the street
without knowing where to go day after day he will see the same policeman
at the corner of the same street and for we may as well suppose that
the policeman has no memory too he will ask and be answered and ask and
be answered till he and the policeman die of old age  this similarity
of action is plainly due to thatwhatever it iswhich ensures that like
persons or things when placed in like circumstances shall behave in like
manner
allow the clerk ever such a little memory and the similarity of action
will disappear for the fact of remembering what happened to him on the
first day he went out in search of dinner will be a modification in him
in regard to his then condition when he next goes out to get his dinner
he had no such memory on the first day and he has upon the second  some
modification of action must ensue upon this modification of the actor
and this is immediately observable  he wants his dinner indeed goes
down into the street and sees the policeman as yesterday but he does
not ask the policeman he remembers what the policeman told him and what
he did and therefore goes straight to the eatinghouse without wasting
time nor does he dine off the same dish two days running for he
remembers what he had yesterday and likes variety  if then similarity
of action is rather hindered than promoted by memory why introduce it
into such cases as the repetition of the embryonic processes by
successive generations  the embryos of a wellfixed breed such as the
goose are almost as much alike as water is to water and by consequence
one goose comes to be almost as like another as water to water  why
should it not be supposed to become so upon the same groundsnamely that
it is made of the same stuffs and put together in like proportions in
the same manner
chapter xi
on cycles
the one faith on which all normal living beings consciously or
unconsciously act is that like antecedents will be followed by like
consequents  this is the one true and catholic faith undemonstrable
but except a living being believe which without doubt it shall perish
everlastingly  in the assurance of this all action is taken
but if this fundamental article is admitted and it cannot be gainsaid
it follows that if ever a complete cycle were formed so that the whole
universe of one instant were to repeat itself absolutely in a subsequent
one no matter after what interval of time then the course of the events
between these two moments would go on repeating itself for ever and ever
afterwards in due order down to the minutest detail in an endless
series of cycles like a circulating decimal  for the universe comprises
everything there could therefore be no disturbance from without  once a
cycle always a cycle
let us suppose the earth of given weight moving with given momentum in
a given path and under given conditions in every respect to find itself
at any one time conditioned in all these respects as it was conditioned
at some past moment then it must move exactly in the same path as the
one it took when at the beginning of the cycle it has just completed and
must therefore in the course of time fulfil a second cycle and therefore
a third and so on for ever and ever with no more chance of escape than
a circulating decimal has if the circumstances have been reproduced with
perfect accuracy
we see something very like this actually happen in the yearly revolutions
of the planets round the sun  but the relations between we will say
the earth and the sun are not reproduced absolutely  these relations
deal only with a small part of the universe and even in this small part
the relation of the parts inter se has never yet been reproduced with
the perfection of accuracy necessary for our argument  they are liable
moreover to disturbance from events which may or may not actually occur
as for example our being struck by a comet or the suns coming within
a certain distance of another sun but of which if they do occur no
one can foresee the effects  nevertheless the conditions have been so
nearly repeated that there is no appreciable difference in the relations
between the earth and sun on one new years day and on another nor is
there reason for expecting such change within any reasonable time
if there is to be an eternal series of cycles involving the whole
universe it is plain that not one single atom must be excluded  exclude
a single molecule of hydrogen from the ring or vary the relative
positions of two molecules only and the charm is broken an element of
disturbance has been introduced of which the utmost that can be said is
that it may not prevent the ensuing of a long series of very nearly
perfect cycles before similarity in recurrence is destroyed but which
must inevitably prevent absolute identity of repetition  the movement of
the series becomes no longer a cycle but spiral and convergent or
divergent at a greater or less rate according to circumstances  we
cannot conceive of all the atoms in the universe standing twice over in
absolutely the same relation each one of them to every other  there are
too many of them and they are too much mixed but as has been just said
in the planets and their satellites we do see large groups of atoms whose
movements recur with some approach to precision  the same holds good
also with certain comets and with the sun himself  the result is that
our days and nights and seasons follow one another with nearly perfect
regularity from year to year and have done so for as long time as we
know anything for certain  a vast preponderance of all the action that
takes place around us is cycular action
within the great cycle of the planetary revolution of our own earth and
as a consequence thereof we have the minor cycle of the phenomena of the
seasons these generate atmospheric cycles  water is evaporated from the
ocean and conveyed to mountain ranges where it is cooled and whence it
returns again to the sea  this cycle of events is being repeated again
and again with little appreciable variation  the tides and winds in
certain latitudes go round and round the world with what amounts to
continuous regularitythere are storms of wind and rain called cyclones
in the case of these the cycle is not very complete the movement
therefore is spiral and the tendency to recur is comparatively soon
lost  it is a common saying that history repeats itself so that anarchy
will lead to despotism and despotism to anarchy every nation can point
to instances of mens minds having gone round and round so nearly in a
perfect cycle that many revolutions have occurred before the cessation of
a tendency to recur  lastly in the generation of plants and animals we
have perhaps the most striking and common example of the inevitable
tendency of all action to repeat itself when it has once proximately done
so  let only one living being have once succeeded in producing a being
like itself and thus have returned so to speak upon itself and a
series of generations must follow of necessity unless some matter
interfere which had no part in the original combination and as it may
happen kill the first reproductive creature or all its descendants
within a few generations  if no such mishap occurs as this and if the
recurrence of the conditions is sufficiently perfect a series of
generations follows with as much certainty as a series of seasons follows
upon the cycle of the relations between the earth and sun  let the first
periodically recurring substancewe will say abe able to recur or
reproduce itself not once only but many times over as a1 a2 c let
a also have consciousness and a sense of selfinterest which qualities
must ex hypothesi be reproduced in each one of its offspring let
these get placed in circumstances which differ sufficiently to destroy
the cycle in theory without doing so practicallythat is to say to
reduce the rotation to a spiral but to a spiral with so little deviation
from perfect cycularity as for each revolution to appear practically a
cycle though after many revolutions the deviation becomes perceptible
then some such differentiations of animal and vegetable life as we
actually see follow as matters of course  a1 and a2 have a sense of
selfinterest as a had but they are not precisely in circumstances
similar to as nor it may be to each others they will therefore act
somewhat differently and every living being is modified by a change of
action  having become modified they follow the spirit of as action
more essentially in begetting a creature like themselves than in
begetting one like a for the essence of as act was not the reproduction
of a but the reproduction of a creature like the one from which it
sprungthat is to say a creature bearing traces in its body of the main
influences that have worked upon its parent
within the cycle of reproduction there are cycles upon cycles in the life
of each individual whether animal or plant  observe the action of our
lungs and heart how regular it is and how a cycle having been once
established it is repeated many millions of times in an individual of
average health and longevity  remember also that it is this
periodicitythis inevitable tendency of all atoms in combination to
repeat any combination which they have once repeated unless forcibly
prevented from doing sowhich alone renders ninetenths of our mechanical
inventions of practical use to us  there is no internal periodicity
about a hammer or a saw but there is in the steamengine or watermill
when once set in motion  the actions of these machines recur in a
regular series at regular intervals with the unerringness of
circulating decimals
when we bear in mind then the omnipresence of this tendency in the
world around us the absolute freedom from exception which attends its
action the manner in which it holds equally good upon the vastest and
the smallest scale and the completeness of its accord with our ideas of
what must inevitably happen when a like combination is placed in
circumstances like those in which it was placed beforewhen we bear in
mind all this is it possible not to connect the facts together and to
refer cycles of living generations to the same unalterableness in the
action of like matter under like circumstances which makes jupiter and
saturn revolve round the sun or the piston of a steamengine move up and
down as long as the steam acts upon it
but who will attribute memory to the hands of a clock to a pistonrod
to air or water in a storm or in course of evaporation to the earth and
planets in their circuits round the sun or to the atoms of the universe
if they too be moving in a cycle vaster than we can take account of
160  and if not why introduce it into the embryonic development of
living beings when there is not a particle of evidence in support of its
actual presence when regularity of action can be ensured just as well
without it as with it and when at the best it is considered as existing
under circumstances which it baffles us to conceive inasmuch as it is
supposed to be exercised without any conscious recollection  surely a
memory which is exercised without any consciousness of recollecting is
only a periphrasis for the absence of any memory at all
chapter xii
refutationmemory at once a promoter and a disturber of uniformity of
action and structure
to meet the objections in the two foregoing chapters i need do little
more than show that the fact of certain often inherited diseases and
developments whether of youth or old age being obviously not due to a
memory on the part of offspring of like diseases and developments in the
parents does not militate against supposing that embryonic and youthful
development generally is due to memory
this is the main part of the objection the rest resolves itself into an
assertion that there is no evidence in support of instinct and embryonic
development being due to memory and a contention that the necessity of
each particular moment in each particular case is sufficient to account
for the facts without the introduction of memory
i will deal with these two last points briefly first  as regards the
evidence in support of the theory that instinct and growth are due to a
rapid unconscious memory of past experiences and developments in the
persons of the ancestors of the living form in which they appear i must
refer my readers to life and habit and to the translation of professor
herings lecture given in this volume  i will only repeat here that a
chrysalis we will say is as much one and the same person with the
chrysalis of its preceding generation as this last is one and the same
person with the egg or caterpillar from which it sprang  you cannot deny
personal identity between two successive generations without sooner or
later denying it during the successive stages in the single life of what
we call one individual nor can you admit personal identity through the
stages of a long and varied life embryonic and postnatal without
admitting it to endure through an endless series of generations
the personal identity of successive generations being admitted the
possibility of the second of two generations remembering what happened to
it in the first is obvious  the  priori objection therefore is
removed and the question becomes one of factdoes the offspring act as
if it remembered
the answer to this question is not only that it does so act but that it
is not possible to account for either its development or its early
instinctive actions upon any other hypothesis than that of its
remembering and remembering exceedingly well
the only alternative is to declare with von hartmann that a living being
may display a vast and varied information concerning all manner of
details and be able to perform most intricate operations independently
of experience and practice  once admit knowledge independent of
experience and farewell to sober sense and reason from that moment
firstly then we show that offspring has had every facility for
remembering secondly that it shows every appearance of having
remembered thirdly that no other hypothesis except memory can be
brought forward so as to account for the phenomena of instinct and
heredity generally which is not easily reducible to an absurdity
beyond this we do not care to go and must allow those to differ from us
who require further evidence
as regards the argument that the necessity of each moment will account
for likeness of result without there being any need for introducing
memory i admit that likeness of consequents is due to likeness of
antecedents and i grant this will hold as good with embryos as with
oxygen and hydrogen gas what will cover the one will cover the other
for time writs of the laws common to all matter run within the womb as
freely as elsewhere but admitting that there are combinations into which
living beings enter with a faculty called memory which has its effect
upon their conduct and admitting that such combinations are from time to
time repeated as we observe in the case of a practised performer playing
a piece of music which he has committed to memory then i maintain that
though indeed the likeness of one performance to its immediate
predecessor is due to likeness of the combinations immediately preceding
the two performances yet memory plays so important a part in both these
combinations as to make it a distinguishing feature in them and
therefore proper to be insisted upon  we do not for example say that
herr joachim played such and such a sonata without the music because he
was such and such an arrangement of matter in such and such
circumstances resembling those under which he played without music on
some past occasion  this goes without saying we say only that he played
the music by heart or by memory as he had often played it before
to the objector that a caterpillar becomes a chrysalis not because it
remembers and takes the action taken by its fathers and mothers in due
course before it but because when matter is in such a physical and
mental state as to be called caterpillar it must perforce assume
presently such another physical and mental state as to be called
chrysalis and that therefore there is no memory in the caseto this
objector i rejoin that the offspring caterpillar would not have become so
like the parent as to make the next or chrysalis stage a matter of
necessity unless both parent and offspring had been influenced by
something that we usually call memory  for it is this very possession of
a common memory which has guided the offspring into the path taken by
and hence to a virtually same condition with the parent and which
guided the parent in its turn to a state virtually identical with a
corresponding state in the existence of its own parent  to memory
therefore the most prominent place in the transaction is assigned
rightly
to deny that will guided by memory has anything to do with the
development of embryos seems like denying that a desire to obstruct has
anything to do with the recent conduct of certain members in the house of
commons  what should we think of one who said that the action of these
gentlemen had nothing to do with a desire to embarrass the government
but was simply the necessary outcome of the chemical and mechanical
forces at work which being such and such the action which we see is
inevitable and has therefore nothing to do with wilful obstruction  we
should answer that there was doubtless a great deal of chemical and
mechanical action in the matter perhaps for aught we knew or cared it
was all chemical and mechanical but if so then a desire to obstruct
parliamentary business is involved in certain kinds of chemical and
mechanical action and that the kinds involving this had preceded the
recent proceedings of the members in question  if asked to prove this
we can get no further than that such action as has been taken has never
yet been seen except as following after and in consequence of a desire to
obstruct that this is our nomenclature and that we can no more be
expected to change it than to change our mother tongue at the bidding of
a foreigner
a little reflection will convince the reader that he will be unable to
deny will and memory to the embryo without at the same time denying their
existence everywhere and maintaining that they have no place in the
acquisition of a habit nor indeed in any human action  he will feel
that the actions and the relation of one action to another which he
observes in embryos is such as is never seen except in association with
and as a consequence of will and memory  he will therefore say that it
is due to will and memory  to say that these are the necessary outcome
of certain antecedents is not to destroy them granted that they area
man does not cease to be a man when we reflect that he has had a father
and mother nor do will and memory cease to be will and memory on the
ground that they cannot come causeless  they are manifest minute by
minute to the perception of all sane people and this tribunal though
not infallible is nevertheless our ultimate court of appealthe final
arbitrator in all disputed cases
we must remember that there is no action however original or peculiar
which is not in respect of far the greater number of its details founded
upon memory  if a desperate man blows his brains outan action which he
can do once in a lifetime only and which none of his ancestors can have
done before leaving offspringstill nine hundred and ninetynine
thousandths of the movements necessary to achieve his end consist of
habitual movementsmovements that is to say which were once difficult
but which have been practised and practised by the help of memory until
they are now performed automatically  we can no more have an action than
a creative effort of the imagination cut off from memory  ideas and
actions seem almost to resemble matter and force in respect of the
impossibility of originating or destroying them nearly all that are are
memories of other ideas and actions transmitted but not created
disappearing but not perishing
it appears then that when in chapter x we supposed the clerk who
wanted his dinner to forget on a second day the action he had taken the
day before we still without perhaps perceiving it supposed him to be
guided by memory in all the details of his action such as his taking
down his hat and going out into the street  we could not indeed
deprive him of all memory without absolutely paralysing his action
nevertheless new ideas new faiths and new actions do in the course of
time come about the living expressions of which we may see in the new
forms of life which from time to time have arisen and are still arising
and in the increase of our own knowledge and mechanical inventions  but
it is only a very little new that is added at a time and that little is
generally due to the desire to attain an end which cannot be attained by
any of the means for which there exists a perceived precedent in the
memory  when this is the case either the memory is further ransacked
for any forgotten shreds of details a combination of which may serve the
desired purpose or action is taken in the dark which sometimes succeeds
and becomes a fertile source of further combinations or we are brought
to a dead stop  all action is random in respect of any of the minute
actions which compose it that are not done in consequence of memory real
or supposed  so that random or action taken in the dark or illusion
lies at the very root of progress
i will now consider the objection that the phenomena of instinct and
embryonic development ought not to be ascribed to memory inasmuch as
certain other phenomena of heredity such as gout cannot be ascribed to
it
those who object in this way forget that our actions fall into two main
classes those which we have often repeated before by means of a regular
series of subordinate actions beginning and ending at a certain tolerably
welldefined pointas when herr joachim plays a sonata in public or when
we dress or undress ourselves and actions the details of which are
indeed guided by memory but which in their general scope and purpose are
newas when we are being married or presented at court
at each point in any action of the first of the two kinds above referred
to there is a memory conscious or unconscious according to the less or
greater number of times the action has been repeated not only of the
steps in the present and previous performances which have led up to the
particular point that may be selected but also of the particular point
itself there is therefore at each point in a habitual performance a
memory at once of like antecedents and of a like present
if the memory whether of the antecedent or the present were absolutely
perfect if the vibration according to professor hering on each
repetition existed in its full original strength and without having been
interfered with by any other vibration and if again the new wave
running into it from exterior objects on each repetition of the action
were absolutely identical in character with the wave that ran in upon the
last occasion then there would be no change in the action and no
modification or improvement could take place  for though indeed the
latest performance would always have one memory more than the latest but
one to guide it yet the memories being identical it would not matter
how many or how few they were
on any repetition however the circumstances external or internal or
both never are absolutely identical there is some slight variation in
each individual case and some part of this variation is remembered with
approbation or disapprobation as the case may be
the fact therefore that on each repetition of the action there is one
memory more than on the last but one and that this memory is slightly
different from its predecessor is seen to be an inherent and ex
hypothesi necessarily disturbing factor in all habitual actionand the
life of an organism should be regarded as the habitual action of a single
individual namely of the organism itself and of its ancestors  this
is the key to accumulation of improvement whether in the arts which we
assiduously practise during our single life or in the structures and
instincts of successive generations  the memory does not complete a true
circle but is as it were a spiral slightly divergent therefrom  it is
no longer a perfectly circulating decimal  where on the other hand
there is no memory of a like present where in fact the memory is not
so to speak spiral there is no accumulation of improvement  the effect
of any variation is not transmitted and is not thus pregnant of still
further change
as regards the second of the two classes of actions above referred
tothose namely which are not recurrent or habitual and at no point
of which is there a memory of a past present like the one which is
present nowthere will have been no accumulation of strong and wellknit
memory as regards the action as a whole but action if taken at all
will be taken upon disjointed fragments of individual actions our own
and those of other people pieced together with a result more or less
satisfactory according to circumstances
but it does not follow that the action of two people who have had
tolerably similar antecedents and are placed in tolerably similar
circumstances should be more unlike each other in this second case than
in the first  on the contrary nothing is more common than to observe
the same kind of people making the same kind of mistake when placed for
the first time in the same kind of new circumstances  i did not say that
there would be no sameness of action without memory of a like present
there may be sameness of action proceeding from a memory conscious or
unconscious of like antecedents and a presence only of like presents
without recollection of the same
the sameness of action of like persons placed under like circumstances
for the first time resembles the sameness of action of inorganic matter
under the same combinations  let us for the moment suppose what we call
nonliving substances to be capable of remembering their antecedents and
that the changes they undergo are the expressions of their recollections
then i admit of course that there is not memory in any cream we will
say that is about to be churned of the cream of the preceding week but
the common absence of such memory from each weeks cream is an element of
sameness between the two  and though no cream can remember having been
churned before yet all cream in all time has had nearly identical
antecedents and has therefore nearly the same memories and nearly the
same proclivities  thus in fact the cream of one week is as truly the
same as the cream of another week from the same cow pasture c as
anything is ever the same with anything for the having been subjected to
like antecedents engenders the closest similarity that we can conceive
of if the substances were like to start with
the manifest absence of any connecting memory or memory of like
presents from certain of the phenomena of heredity such as for
example the diseases of old age is now seen to be no valid reason for
saying that such other and far more numerous and important phenomena as
those of embryonic development are not phenomena of memory  growth and
the diseases of old age do indeed at first sight appear to stand on the
same footing but reflection shows us that the question whether a certain
result is due to memory or no must be settled not by showing that
combinations into which memory does not certainly enter may yet generate
like results and therefore considering the memory theory disposed of
but by the evidence we may be able to adduce in support of the fact that
the second agent has actually remembered the conduct of the first
inasmuch as he cannot be supposed able to do what it is plain he can do
except under the guidance of memory or experience and can also be shown
to have had every opportunity of remembering  when either of these tests
fails similarity of action on the part of two agents need not be
connected with memory of a like present as well as of like antecedents
but must or at any rate may be referred to memory of like antecedents
only
returning to a parenthesis a few pages back in which i said that
consciousness of memory would be less or greater according to the greater
or fewer number of times that the act had been repeated it may be
observed as a corollary to this that the less consciousness of memory
the greater the uniformity of action and vice versa  for the less
consciousness involves the memorys being more perfect through a larger
number generally of repetitions of the act that is remembered there is
therefore a less proportionate difference in respect of the number of
recollections of this particular act between the most recent actor and
the most recent but one  this is why very old civilisations as those of
many insects and the greater number of now living organisms appear to
the eye not to change at all
for example if an action has been performed only ten times we will say
by a b c c who are similar in all respects except that a acts
without recollection b with recollection of as action c with
recollection of both bs and as while j remembers the course taken by
a b c d e f g h and ithe possession of a memory by b will indeed
so change his action as compared with as that it may well be hardly
recognisable  we saw this in our example of the clerk who asked the
policeman the way to the eatinghouse on one day but did not ask him the
next because he remembered but cs action will not be so different from
bs as bs from as for though c will act with a memory of two occasions
on which the action has been performed while b recollects only the
original performance by a yet b and c both act with the guidance of a
memory and experience of some kind while a acted without any  thus the
clerk referred to in chapter x will act on the third day much as he
acted on the secondthat is to say he will see the policeman at the
corner of the street but will not question him
when the action is repeated by j for the tenth time the difference
between js repetition of it and is will be due solely to the difference
between a recollection of nine past performances by j against only eight
by i and this is so much proportionately less than the difference
between a recollection of two performances and of only one that a less
modification of action should be expected  at the same time
consciousness concerning an action repeated for the tenth time should be
less acute than on the first repetition  memory therefore though
tending to disturb similarity of action less and less continually must
always cause some disturbance  at the same time the possession of a
memory on the successive repetitions of an action after the first and
perhaps the first two or three during which the recollection may be
supposed still imperfect will tend to ensure uniformity for it will be
one of the elements of sameness in the agentsthey both acting by the
light of experience and memory
during the embryonic stages and in childhood we are almost entirely under
the guidance of a practised and powerful memory of circumstances which
have been often repeated not only in detail and piecemeal but as a
whole and under many slightly varying conditions thus the performance
has become well averaged and matured in its arrangements so as to meet
all ordinary emergencies  we therefore act with great unconsciousness
and vary our performances little  babies are much more alike than
persons of middle age
up to the average age at which our ancestors have had children during
many generations we are still guided in great measure by memory but the
variations in external circumstances begin to make themselves perceptible
in our characters  in middle life we live more and more continually upon
the piecing together of details of memory drawn from our personal
experience that is to say upon the memory of our own antecedents and
this resembles the kind of memory we hypothetically attached to cream a
little time ago  it is not surprising then that a son who has
inherited his fathers tastes and constitution and who lives much as his
father had done should make the same mistakes as his father did when he
reaches his fathers agewe will say of seventythough he cannot possibly
remember his fathers having made the mistakes  it were to be wished we
could for then we might know better how to avoid gout cancer or what
not  and it is to be noticed that the developments of old age are
generally things we should be glad enough to avoid if we knew how to do
so
chapter xiii
conclusion
if we observed the resemblance between successive generations to be as
close as that between distilled water and distilled water through all
time and if we observed that perfect unchangeableness in the action of
living beings which we see in what we call chemical and mechanical
combinations we might indeed suspect that memory had as little place
among the causes of their action as it can have in anything and that
each repetition whether of a habit or the practice of art or of an
embryonic process in successive generations was an original performance
for all that memory had to do with it  i submit however that in the
case of the reproductive forms of life we see just so much variety in
spite of uniformity as is consistent with a repetition involving not
only a nearly perfect similarity in the agents and their circumstances
but also the little departure therefrom that is inevitably involved in
the supposition that a memory of like presents as well as of like
antecedents as distinguished from a memory of like antecedents only has
played a part in their developmenta cyclonic memory if the expression
may be pardoned
there is life infinitely lower and more minute than any which our most
powerful microscopes reveal to us but let us leave this upon one side
and begin with the amba  let us suppose that this structureless morsel
of protoplasm is for all its structurelessness composed of an infinite
number of living molecules each one of them with hopes and fears of its
own and all dwelling together like tekke turcomans of whom we read that
they live for plunder only and that each man of them is entirely
independent acknowledging no constituted authority but that some among
them exercise a tacit and undefined influence over the others  let us
suppose these molecules capable of memory both in their capacity as
individuals and as societies and able to transmit their memories to
their descendants from the traditions of the dimmest past to the
experiences of their own lifetime  some of these societies will remain
simple as having had no history but to the greater number unfamiliar
and therefore striking incidents will from time to time occur which
when they do not disturb memory so greatly as to kill will leave their
impression upon it  the body or society will remember these incidents
and be modified by them in its conduct and therefore more or less in its
internal arrangements which will tend inevitably to specialisation
this memory of the most striking events of varied lifetimes i maintain
with professor hering to be the differentiating cause which
accumulated in countless generations has led up from the amba to man
if there had been no such memory the amba of one generation would have
exactly resembled time amba of the preceding and a perfect cycle would
have been established the modifying effects of an additional memory in
each generation have made the cycle into a spiral and into a spiral
whose eccentricity in the outset hardly perceptible is becoming greater
and greater with increasing longevity and more complex social and
mechanical inventions
we say that the chicken grows the horny tip to its beak with which it
ultimately pecks its way out of its shell because it remembers having
grown it before and the use it made of it  we say that it made it on
the same principles as a man makes a spade or a hammer that is to say
as the joint result both of desire and experience  when i say
experience i mean experience not only of what will be wanted but also
of the details of all the means that must be taken in order to effect
this  memory therefore is supposed to guide the chicken not only in
respect of the main design but in respect also of every atomic action
so to speak which goes to make up the execution of this design  it is
not only the suggestion of a plan which is due to memory but as
professor hering has so well said it is the binding power of memory
which alone renders any consolidation or coherence of action possible
inasmuch as without this no action could have parts subordinate one to
another yet bearing upon a common end no part of an action great or
small could have reference to any other part much less to a combination
of all the parts nothing in fact but ultimate atoms of actions could
ever happenthese bearing the same relation to such an action we will
say as a railway journey from london to edinburgh as a single molecule
of hydrogen to a gallon of water  if asked how it is that the chicken
shows no sign of consciousness concerning this design nor yet of the
steps it is taking to carry it out we reply that such unconsciousness is
usual in all cases where an action and the design which prompts it have
been repeated exceedingly often  if again we are asked how we account
for the regularity with which each step is taken in its due order we
answer that this too is characteristic of actions that are done
habituallythey being very rarely misplaced in respect of any part
when i wrote life and habit i had arrived at the conclusion that
memory was the most essential characteristic of life and went so far as
to say life is that property of matter whereby it can remembermatter
which can remember is living  i should perhaps have written life is
the being possessed of a memorythe life of a thing at any moment is the
memories which at that moment it retains and i would modify the words
that immediately follow namely matter which cannot remember is dead
for they imply that there is such a thing as matter which cannot remember
anything at all and this on fuller consideration i do not believe to be
the case i can conceive of no matter which is not able to remember a
little and which is not living in respect of what it can remember  i do
not see how action of any kind is conceivable without the supposition
that every atom retains a memory of certain antecedents  i cannot
however at this point enter upon the reasons which have compelled me to
this conclusion  whether these would be deemed sufficient or no at any
rate we cannot believe that a system of selfreproducing associations
should develop from the simplicity of the amba to the complexity of the
human body without the presence of that memory which can alone account at
once for the resemblances and the differences between successive
generations for the arising and the accumulation of divergencesfor the
tendency to differ and the tendency not to differ
at parting therefore i would recommend the reader to see every atom in
the universe as living and able to feel and to remember but in a humble
way  he must have life eternal as well as matter eternal and the life
and the matter must be joined together inseparably as body and soul to
one another  thus he will see god everywhere not as those who repeat
phrases conventionally but as people who would have their words taken
according to their most natural and legitimate meaning and he will feel
that the main difference between him and many of those who oppose him
lies in the fact that whereas both he and they use the same language his
opponents only half mean what they say while he means it entirely
the attempt to get a higher form of a life from a lower one is in
accordance with our observation and experience  it is therefore proper
to be believed  the attempt to get it from that which has absolutely no
life is like trying to get something out of nothing  the millionth part
of a farthing put out to interest at ten per cent will in five hundred
years become over a million pounds and so long as we have any millionth
of a millionth of the farthing to start with our getting as many million
pounds as we have a fancy for is only a question of time but without the
initial millionth of a millionth of a millionth part we shall get no
increment whatever  a little leaven will leaven the whole lump but
there must be some leaven
i will here quote two passages from an article already quoted from on
page 55 of this book  they run
    we are growing conscious that our earnest and most determined
    efforts to make motion produce sensation and volition have proved a
    failure and now we want to rest a little in the opposite much less
    laborious conjecture and allow any kind of motion to start into
    existence or at least to receive its specific direction from
    psychical sources sensation and volition being for the purpose
    quietly insinuated into the constitution of the ultimately moving
    particles 177a
and
    in this light it can remain no longer surprising that we actually
    find motility and sensibility so intimately interblended in nature
    177b
we should endeavour to see the socalled inorganic as living in respect
of the qualities it has in common with the organic rather than the
organic as nonliving in respect of the qualities it has in common with
the inorganic  true it would be hard to place ones self on the same
moral platform as a stone but this is not necessary it is enough that
we should feel the stone to have a moral platform of its own though that
platform embraces little more than a profound respect for the laws of
gravitation chemical affinity c  as for the difficulty of conceiving
a body as living that has not got a reproductive systemwe should
remember that neuter insects are living but are believed to have no
reproductive system  again we should bear in mind that mere
assimilation involves all the essentials of reproduction and that both
air and water possess this power in a very high degree  the essence of a
reproductive system then is found low down in the scheme of nature
at present our leading men of science are in this difficulty on the one
hand their experiments and their theories alike teach them that
spontaneous generation ought not to be accepted on the other they must
have an origin for the life of the living forms which by their own
theory have been evolved and they can at present get this origin in no
other way than by the deus ex machin method which they reject as
unproved or a spontaneous generation of living from nonliving matter
which is no less foreign to their experience  as a general rule they
prefer the latter alternative  so professor tyndall in his celebrated
article nineteenth century november 1878 wrote
    it is generally conceded and seems to be a necessary inference from
    the lessons of science that spontaneous generation must at one time
    have taken place italics mine
no inference can well be more unnecessary or unscientific  i suppose
spontaneous generation ceases to be objectionable if it was only a very
little one and came off a long time ago in a foreign country  the
proper inference is that there is a low kind of livingness in every atom
of matter  life eternal is as inevitable a conclusion as matter eternal
it should not be doubted that wherever there is vibration or motion there
is life and memory and that there is vibration and motion at all times
in all things
the reader who takes the above position will find that he can explain the
entry of what he calls death among what he calls the living whereas he
could by no means introduce life into his system if he started without
it  death is deducible life is not deducible  death is a change of
memories it is not the destruction of all memory  it is as the
liquidation of one company each member of which will presently join a
new one and retain a trifle even of the old cancelled memory by way of
greater aptitude for working in concert with other molecules  this is
why animals feed on grass and on each other and cannot proselytise or
convert the rude ground before it has been tutored in the first
principles of the higher kinds of association
again i would recommend the reader to beware of believing anything in
this book unless he either likes it or feels angry at being told it  if
required belief in this or that makes a man angry i suppose he should
as a general rule swallow it whole then and there upon the spot
otherwise he may take it or leave it as he likes  i have not gone far
for my facts nor yet far from them all on which i rest are as open to
the reader as to me  if i have sometimes used hard terms the
probability is that i have not understood them but have done so by a
slip as one who has caught a bad habit from the company he has been
lately keeping  they should be skipped
do not let him be too much cast down by the bad language with which
professional scientists obscure the issue nor by their seeming to make
it their business to fog us under the pretext of removing our
difficulties  it is not the ratcatchers interest to catch all the rats
and as handel observed so sensibly every professional gentleman must
do his best for to live  the art of some of our philosophers however
is sufficiently transparent and consists too often in saying organism
which must be classified among fishes instead of fish 179a and
then proclaiming that they have an ineradicable tendency to try to make
things clear 179b
if another example is required here is the following from an article
than which i have seen few with which i more completely agree or which
have given me greater pleasure  if our men of science would take to
writing in this way we should be glad enough to follow them  the
passage i refer to runs thus
    professor huxley speaks of a verbal fog by which the question at
    issue may be hidden is there no verbal fog in the statement that
    the tiology of crayfishes resolves itself into a gradual evolution
    in the course of the mesosoic and subsequent epochs of the worlds
    history of these animals from a primitive astacomorphous form
    would it be fog or light that would envelop the history of man if we
    said that the existence of man was explained by the hypothesis of his
    gradual evolution from a primitive anthropomorphous form  i should
    call this fog not light 180
especially let him mistrust those who are holding forth about protoplasm
and maintaining that this is the only living substance  protoplasm may
be and perhaps is the most living part of an organism as the most
capable of retaining vibrations but this is the utmost that can be
claimed for it
having mentioned protoplasm i may ask the reader to note the breakdown
of that school of philosophy which divided the ego from the non ego
the protoplasmists on the one hand are whittling away at the ego
till they have reduced it to a little jelly in certain parts of the body
and they will whittle away this too presently if they go on as they are
doing now
others again are so unifying the ego and the non ego that with
them there will soon be as little of the non ego left as there is of
the ego with their opponents  both however are so far agreed as that
we know not where to draw the line between the two and this renders
nugatory any system which is founded upon a distinction between them
the truth is that all classification whatever when we examine its
raison dtre closely is found to be arbitraryto depend on our sense
of our own convenience and not on any inherent distinction in the nature
of the things themselves  strictly speaking there is only one thing and
one action  the universe or god and the action of the universe as a
whole
lastly i may predict with some certainty that before long we shall find
the original darwinism of dr erasmus darwin with an infusion of
professor hering into the bargain generally accepted instead of the
neodarwinism of today and that the variations whose accumulation
results in species will be recognised as due to the wants and endeavours
of the living forms in which they appear instead of being ascribed to
chance or in other words to unknown causes as by mr charles darwins
system  we shall have some idyllic young naturalist bringing up dr
erasmus darwins note on trapa natans 181a and lamarcks kindred
passage on the descent of ranunculus hederaceus from ranunculus
aquatilis 181b as fresh discoveries and be told with much happy
simplicity that those animals and plants which have felt the need of
such or such a structure have developed it while those which have not
wanted it have gone without it  thus it will be declared every leaf we
see around us every structure of the minutest insect will bear witness
to the truth of the great guess of the greatest of naturalists
concerning the memory of living matter
i dare say the public will not object to this and am very sure that none
of the admirers of mr charles darwin or mr wallace will protest against
it but it may be as well to point out that this was not the view of the
matter taken by mr wallace in 1858 when he and mr darwin first came
forward as preachers of natural selection  at that time mr wallace saw
clearly enough the difference between the theory of natural selection
and that of lamarck  he wrote
    the hypothesis of lamarckthat progressive changes in species have
    been produced by the attempts of animals to increase the development
    of their own organs and thus modify their structure and habitshas
    been repeatedly and easily refuted by all writers on the subject of
    varieties and species    but the view here developed tenders such
    an hypothesis quite unnecessary     the powerful retractile
    talons of the falcon and the cat tribes have not been produced or
    increased by the volition of those animals neither did the giraffe
    acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the foliage of the more
    lofty shrubs and constantly stretching its neck for this purpose
    but because any varieties which occurred among its antitypes with a
    longer neck than usual at once secured a fresh range of pasture over
    the same ground as their shorternecked companions and on the
    first scarcity of food were thereby enabled to outlive them
    italics in original 182a
this is absolutely the neodarwinian doctrine and a denial of the mainly
fortuitous character of the variations in animal and vegetable forms cuts
at its root  that mr wallace after years of reflection still adhered
to this view is proved by his heading a reprint of the paragraph just
quoted from 182b with the words lamarcks hypothesis very different
from that now advanced nor do any of his more recent works show that he
has modified his opinion  it should be noted that mr wallace does not
call his work contributions to the theory of evolution but to that of
natural selection
mr darwin with characteristic caution only commits himself to saying
that mr wallace has arrived at almost italics mine the same general
conclusions as he mr darwin has done 182c but he still as in 1859
declares that it would be a serious error to suppose that the greater
number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation and
then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations 183a and he
still comprehensively condemns the wellknown doctrine of inherited
habit as advanced by lamarck 183b
as for the statement in the passage quoted from mr wallace to the
effect that lamarcks hypothesis has been repeatedly and easily refuted
by all writers on the subject of varieties and species it is a very
surprising one  i have searched evolution literature in vain for any
refutation of the erasmus darwinian system for this is what lamarcks
hypothesis really is which need make the defenders of that system at all
uneasy  the best attempt at an answer to erasmus darwin that has yet
been made is paleys natural theology which was throughout obviously
written to meet buffon and the zoonomia  it is the manner of
theologians to say that such and such an objection has been refuted over
and over again without at the same time telling us when and where it
is to be regretted that mr wallace has here taken a leaf out of the
theologians book  his statement is one which will not pass muster with
those whom public opinion is sure in the end to follow
did mr herbert spencer for example repeatedly and easily refute
lamarcks hypothesis in his brilliant article in the leader march 20
1852  on the contrary that article is expressly directed against those
who cavalierly reject the hypothesis of lamarck and his followers
this article was written six years before the words last quoted from mr
wallace how absolutely however does the word cavalierly apply to
them
does isidore geoffroy again bear mr wallaces assertion out better
in 1859that is to say but a short time after mr wallace had writtenhe
wrote as follows
    such was the language which lamarck heard during his protracted old
    age saddened alike by the weight of years and blindness this was
    what people did not hesitate to utter over his grave yet barely
    closed and what indeed they are still sayingcommonly too without
    any knowledge of what lamarck maintained but merely repeating at
    secondhand bad caricatures of his teaching
    when will the time come when we may see lamarcks theory
    discussedand i may as well at once say refuted in some important
    points 184awith at any rate the respect due to one of the most
    illustrious masters of our science  and when will this theory the
    hardihood of which has been greatly exaggerated become freed from
    the interpretations and commentaries by the false light of which so
    many naturalists have formed their opinion concerning it  if its
    author is to be condemned let it be at any rate not before he has
    been heard 184b
in 1873 m martin published his edition of lamarcks philosophie
zoologique  he was still able to say with i believe perfect truth
that lamarcks theory has never yet had the honour of being discussed
seriously 184c
professor huxley in his article on evolution is no less cavalier than mr
wallace  he writes184d
    lamarck introduced the conception of the action of an animal on
    itself as a factor in producing modification
lamarck did nothing of the kind  it was buffon and dr darwin who
introduced this but more especially dr darwin
    but a little consideration showed italics mine that though
    lamarck had seized what as far as it goes is a true cause of
    modification it is a cause the actual effects of which are wholly
    inadequate to account for any considerable modification in animals
    and which can have no influence whatever in the vegetable world c
i should be very glad to come across some of the little consideration
which will show this  i have searched for it far and wide and have
never been able to find it
i think professor huxley has been exercising some of his ineradicable
tendency to try to make things clear in the article on evolution already
so often quoted from  we find him p 750 poohpoohing lamarck yet on
the next page he says how far natural selection suffices for the
production of species remains to be seen  and this when natural
selection was already so nearly of age  why to those who know how to
read between a philosophers lines the sentence comes to very nearly the
same as a declaration that the writer has no great opinion of natural
selection  professor huxley continues few can doubt that if not the
whole cause it is a very important factor in that operation  a
philosophers words should be weighed carefully and when professor
huxley says few can doubt we must remember that he may be including
himself among the few whom he considers to have the power of doubting on
this matter  he does not say few will but few can doubt as though
it were only the enlightened who would have the power of doing so
certainly naturefor this is what natural selection comes tois
rather an important factor in the operation but we do not gain much by
being told so  if however professor huxley neither believes in the
origin of species through sense of need on the part of animals
themselves nor yet in natural selection we should be glad to know
what he does believe in
the battle is one of greater importance than appears at first sight  it
is a battle between teleology and nonteleology between the
purposiveness and the nonpurposiveness of the organs in animal and
vegetable bodies  according to erasmus darwin lamarck and paley
organs are purposive according to mr darwin and his followers they are
not purposive  but the main arguments against the system of dr erasmus
darwin are arguments which so far as they have any weight tell against
evolution generally  now that these have been disposed of and the
prejudice against evolution has been overcome it will be seen that there
is nothing to be said against the system of dr darwin and lamarck which
does not tell with far greater force against that of mr charles darwin
and mr wallace

70  professor hering is not clear here  vibrations if i understand
his theory rightly should not be set up by faint stimuli from within
whence and what are these stimuli  the vibrations within are already
existing and it is they which are the stimuli to action  on having
been once set up they either continue in sufficient force to maintain
action or they die down and become too weak to cause further action
and perhaps even to be perceived within the mind until they receive an
accession of vibration from without  the only stimulus from within
that should be able to generate action is that which may follow when a
vibration already established in the body runs into another similar
vibration already so established  on this consciousness and even
action might be supposed to follow without the presence of an external
stimulus
71  this expression seems hardly applicable to the overtaking of an
internal by an external vibration but it is not inconsistent with it
here however as frequently elsewhere i doubt how far professor hering
has fully realised his conception beyond being like myself convinced
that the phenomena of memory and of heredity have a common source
72  see quotation from bonnet p 54 of this volume  by preserving
the memory of habitual actions professor hering probably means retains
for a long while and repeats motion of a certain character when such
motion has been once communicated to it
74a  it should not be if the central nerve system were not able to
reproduce whole series of vibrations but if whole series of vibrations
do not persist though unperceived if professor hering intends what i
suppose him to intend
74b  memory was in full operation for so long a time before anything
like what we call a nervous system can be detected that professor hering
must not be supposed to be intending to confine memory to a motor nerve
system  his words do not even imply that he does but it is as well to
be on ones guard
77  it is from such passages as this and those that follow on the next
few pages that i collect the impression of professor herings meaning
which i have endeavoured to convey in the preceding chapter
78  that is to say an infinitely small change in the kind of
vibration communicated from the parent to the germ
79  it may be asked what is meant by responding  i may repeat that i
understand professor hering to mean that there exists in the offspring
certain vibrations which are many of them too faint to upset equilibrium
and thus generate action until they receive an accession of force from
without by the running into them of vibrations of similar characteristics
to their own which last vibrations have been set up by exterior objects
on this they become strong enough to generate that corporeal earthquake
which we call action
this may be true or not but it is at any rate intelligible whereas much
that is written about fraying channels raises no definite ideas in the
mind
80a  i interpret this we cannot wonder if oftenrepeated vibrations
gather strength and become at once more lasting and requiring less
accession of vibration from without in order to become strong enough to
generate action
80b  characteristics must i imagine according to professor hering
resolve themselves ultimately into vibrations for the characteristics
depend upon the character of the vibrations
81  professor hartog tells me that this probably refers to fritz
mllers formulation of the recapitulation process in facts for
darwin english edition 1869 p 114ras
82  this is the passage which makes me suppose professor hering to mean
that vibrations from exterior objects run into vibrations already
existing within the living body and that the accession to power thus
derived is his key to an explanation of the physical basis of action
84  i interpret this there are fewer vibrations persistent within the
bodies of the lower animals those that there are therefore are
stronger and more capable of generating action or upsetting the status
in quo  hence also they require less accession of vibration from
without  man is agitated by more and more varied vibrations these
interfering as to some extent they must with one another are weaker
and therefore require more accession from without before they can set the
mechanical adjustments of the body in motion

aus derselben quelle stammen dass sie entweder beide wirklicher
instinct oder beide resultate bewusster ueberlegung sindphilosophy

den begriff eines psychischen mechanismus zu richten und da zeigt sich
dass derselbe abgesehen davon wie viel er erklrt so dunke list dass

102a  diese causale verbindung fllt erfahrungsmssig wie wir von
unsern menschlichen instincten wissen nicht ins bewussisein folglich
kann dieselbe wenn sie ein mechanismus sein soll nur entweder ein nicht
ins bewusstsein fallende mechanische leitung und umwandlung der
schwingungen des vorgestellten motivs in die schwingungen der gewollten
handlung im gehirn oder ein unbewusster geistiger mechanismus

102b  man hat sich also zwischen dem bewussten motiv und dem willen
zur insticthandlung eine causale verbindung durch unbewusstes vorstellen
und wollen zu denken und ich weiss nicht wie diese verbindung einfacher
gedacht werden knnte als durch den vorgestellten und gewollten zweck
damit sind wir aber bei dem allen geistern eigenthmlichen und immanenten
mechanismus der logik angelangt und haben die unbewusster
zweckvorstellung bei jeder einzelnen instincthandlung als unentbehrliches
glied gefunden hiermit hat also der begrift des todten usserlich
prdestinirten geistesmechanismus sich selbst aufgehoben und in das
immanente geistesleben der logik umgewandelt und wir sind bei der
letzten mglichkeit angekommen welche fr die auffassung eines

105c  giebt es einen wirklichen instinct oder sind die sogenannten
instincthandlungen nur resultate bewusster ueberlegungphilosophy of
the unconscious 3d ed p 79
111  dieser beweis ist dadurch zu fhren erstens dass die
betreffenden thatsachen in der zukunft liegen und dem verstande die
anhaltepunkte fehlen um ihr zuknftiges eintreten aus den gegenwrtigen
verhltnissen zu erschliessen zweitens dass die betreffenden thatsachen
augenscheinlich der sinnlichen wahrnehmung verschlossen liegen weil nur
die erfahrung frherer flle ber sie belehren kann und diese laut der
beobachtung ausgeschlossen ist  es wrde fr unsere interessen keinen
unterschied machen wenn was ich wahrscheinlich halte bei
fortschreitender physiologischer erkenntniss alle jetzt fr den ersten
fall anzufhrenden beispiele sich als solche des zweiten falls ausweisen
sollten wie dies unleugbar bei vielen frher gebrauchten beispielen
schon geschehen ist denn ein apriorisches wissen ohne jeden sinnlichen
anstoss ist wohl kaum wunderbarer zu nennen als ein wissen welches zwar
bei gelegenheit gewisser sinnlicher wahrnehmung zu tage tritt aber mit
diesen nur durch eine solche kette von schlssen und angewandten
kenntnissen in verbindung stehend gedacht werden knnte dass deren
mglichkeit bei dem zustande der fhigkeiten und bildung der betreffenden
thiere entschieden geleugnet werden mussphilosophy of the
unconscious 3d ed p 85
113  man hat dieselbe jederzeit anerkannt und mit den worten vorgefhl
oder ahnung bezeichnet indess beziehen sich diese wrte einerseits nur
auf zuknftiges nicht auf gegenwrtiges rumlich getrenntes
unwahmehrnbares anderseits bezeichnen sie nur die leise dumpfe
unbestimmte resonanz des bewusstseins mit dem unfehlbar bestimmten
zustande der unbewussten erkenntniss  daher das wort vorgefhl in
rcksicht auf die dumpfheit und unbestimmtheit whrend doch leicht zu
sehen ist dass das von allen auch den unbewussten vorstellungen
entblsste gefhl fr das resultat gar keinen einfluss haben kann
sondern nur eine vorstellung weil diese allein erkenntniss enthlt  die
in bewusstsein mitklingende ahnung kann allerdings unter umstnden
ziemlich deutlich sein so dass sie sich beim menschen in gedanken und
wort fixiren lsst doch ist dies auch im menschen erfahrungsmssig bei
den eigenthmlichen instincten nicht der fall vielmehr ist bei diesen
die resonanz der unbewussten erkenntniss im bewusstsein meistens so
schwach dass sie sich wirklich nur in begleitenden gefhlen oder der

meteorologische schlsse das wetter auf monate im voraus zu berechnen ja

gefhlswahrnehmung gegenwrtiger atmosphrischer einflsse nichts weiter
als die sinnliche wahrnehmung welche als motiv wirkt und ein motiv muss
ja doch immer vorhanden sein wenn ein instinct functioniren soll  es
bleibt also trotzdem bestehen dass das voraussehen der witterung ein
unbewusstes hellsehen ist von dem der storch der vier wochen frher
nach sden aufbricht so wenig etwas weiss als der hirsch der sich vor
einem kalten winter einen dickeren pelz als gewhnlich wachsen lsst

die vorstellung der zuknftigen witterung htten im bewusstsein haben

menschen entsprechend eine strkete resonanz des bewusstseins mit dem
bewussten hellsehen hervor die sich also mehr odor minder deutliche

selbststndigkeit des menschlichen intellects dass diese ahnung nicht
ausschliesslich behufs der unmittelbaren ausfhrung einer handlung
eintritt sondern bisweilen auch unabngig von der bedingung einer
