studies in the psychology of sex volume ii
   sexual inversion
by
havelock ellis
1927
preface to the third edition
it has been remarked by professor wilhelm ostwald that the problem of
homosexuality is a problem left over to us by the middle ages which for
five hundred years dealt with inverts as it dealt with heretics and
witches to regard the matter thus is to emphasize its social and
humanitarian interest rather than its biological and psychological
significance it is no doubt this human interest of the question of
inversion rather than its scientific importance great as the latter is
which is mainly responsible for the remarkable activity with which the
study of homosexuality has been carried on during recent years
the result has been that during the fourteen years that have passed since
the last edition of this study was issued so vast an amount of work has
been carried on in this field that the preparation of a new edition of the
book has been a long and serious task nearly every page has been
rewritten or enlarged and the index of authors consulted has more than
doubled in length the original portions of the book have been still more
changed sixteen new histories have been added selected from others in my
possession as being varied typical and full
these extensive additions to the volume have rendered necessary various
omissions many of the shorter and less instructive histories contained in
earlier editions have been omitted as well as three appendices which no
longer seem of sufficient interest to retain in order to avoid undue
increase in the size of this volume already much larger than in the
previous editions a new study of eonism or sexoesthetic inversion will
be inserted in vol v where it will perhaps be at least as much in place
as here

preface to first edition
it was not my intention to publish a study of an abnormal manifestation of
the sexual instinct before discussing its normal manifestations it has
happened however that this part of my work is ready first and since i
thus gain a longer period to develop the central part of my subject i do
not regret the change of plan
i had not at first proposed to devote a whole volume to sexual inversion
it may even be that i was inclined to slur it over as an unpleasant
subject and one that it was not wise to enlarge on but i found in time
that several persons for whom i felt respect and admiration were the
congenital subjects of this abnormality at the same time i realized that
in england more than in any other country the law and public opinion
combine to place a heavy penal burden and a severe social stigma on the
manifestations of an instinct which to those persons who possess it
frequently appears natural and normal it was clear therefore that the
matter was in special need of elucidation and discussion
there can be no doubt that a peculiar amount of ignorance exists regarding
the subject of sexual inversion i know medical men of many years general
experience who have never to their knowledge come across a single case
we may remember indeed that some fifteen years ago the total number of
cases recorded in scientific literature scarcely equaled those of british
race which i have obtained and that before my first cases were published
not a single british case unconnected with the asylum or the prison had
ever been recorded probably not a very large number of people are even
aware that the turning in of the sexual instinct toward persons of the
same sex can ever be regarded as inborn so far as any sexual instinct is
inborn and very few indeed would not be surprised if it were possible
to publish a list of the names of sexually inverted men and women who at
the present time are honorably known in church state society art or
letters it could not be positively affirmed of all such persons that they
were born inverted but in most the inverted tendency seems to be
instinctive and appears at a somewhat early age in any case however it
must be realized that in this volume we are not dealing with subjects
belonging to the lunatic asylum or the prison we are concerned with
individuals who live in freedom some of them suffering intensely from
their abnormal organization but otherwise ordinary members of society in
a few cases we are concerned with individuals whose moral or artistic
ideals have widely influenced their fellows who know nothing of the
peculiar organization which has largely molded those ideals
i am indebted to several friends for notes observations and
correspondence on this subject more especially to one referred to as
z and to another as q who have obtained a considerable number of
reliable histories for me and have also supplied many valuable notes to
josiah flynt whose articles on tramps in atlantic monthly and
harpers magazine have attracted wide attention for an appendix on
homosexuality among tramps to drs kiernan lydston and talbot for
assistance at various points noted in the text and to dr k an american
woman physician who kindly assisted me in obtaining cases and has also
supplied an appendix other obligations are mentioned in the text
all those portions of the book which are of medical or medicolegal
interest including most of the cases have appeared during the last three
years in the alienist and neurologist the journal of mental science
the centralblatt fr nervenheilkunde the medicolegal journal and
the archivo delle psicopatie sessuale the cases as they appear in the
present volume have been slightly condensed but nothing of genuine
psychological interest has been omitted owing to some delay in the
publication of the english edition of the work a german translation by my
friend dr hans kurella editor of the centralblatt fr
nervenheilkunde has already appeared 1896 in the bibliothek fr
sozialwissenschaft the german edition contains some matter which has
finally been rejected from the english edition as of minor importance on
the other hand much has been added to the english edition and the whole
carefully revised
i have only to add that if it may seem that i have unduly ignored the
cases and arguments brought forward by other writers it is by no means
because i wish to depreciate the valuable work done by my predecessors in
this field it is solely because i have not desired to popularize the
results previously reached but simply to bring forward my own results if
i had not been able to present new facts in what is perhaps a new light i
should not feel justified in approaching the subject of sexual inversion
at all

sexual inversion as here understood means sexual instinct turned by
inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex it is
thus a narrower term than homosexuality which includes all sexual
attractions between persons of the same sex even when seemingly due to
the accidental absence of the natural objects of sexual attraction a
phenomenon of wide occurrence among all human races and among most of the
higher animals it is only during recent years that sexual inversion has
been recognized previously it was not distinguished from homosexuality in
general and homosexuality was regarded as a national custom as an
individual vice or as an unimportant episode in grave forms of
insanity1 we have further to distinguish sexual inversion and all other
forms of homosexuality from another kind of inversion which usually
remains so far as the sexual impulse itself is concerned heterosexual
that is to say normal inversion of this kind leads a person to feel like
a person of the opposite sex and to adopt so far as possible the
tastes habits and dress of the opposite sex while the direction of the
sexual impulse remains normal this condition i term sexoesthetic
inversion or eonism
    the nomenclature of the highly important form of sexual
    perversion with which we are here concerned is extremely varied
    and most investigators have been much puzzled in coming to a
    conclusion as to the best most exact and at the same time most
    colorless names to apply to it
    the first in the field in modern times was ulrichs who as early
    as 1862 used the appellation uranian uranier based on the
    wellknown myth in platos banquet later he germanized this
    term into urning for the male and urningin for the female
    and referred to the condition itself as urningtum he also
    invented a number of other related terms on the same basis some
    of these terms have had a considerable vogue but they are too
    fanciful and highstrung to secure general acceptance if used in
    other languages than german they certainly should not be used in
    their germanized shape and it is scarcely legitimate to use the
    term urning in english uranian is more correct
    in germany the first term accepted by recognized scientific
    authorities was contrary sexual feeling kontrre
    sexualempfindung it was devised by westphal in 1869 and used
    by krafftebing and moll though thus accepted by the earliest
    authorities in this field and to be regarded as a fairly
    harmless and vaguely descriptive term it is somewhat awkward
    and is now little used in germany it was never currently used
    outside germany it has been largely superseded by the term
    homosexuality this also was devised by a littleknown
    hungarian doctor benkert who used the pseudonym kertbeny in
    the same year 1869 but at first attracted no attention it
    has philologically the awkward disadvantage of being a bastard
    term compounded of greek and latin elements but its
    significancesexual attraction to the same sexis fairly clear
    and definite while it is free from any questionbegging
    association of either favorable or unfavorable character edward
    carpenter has proposed to remedy its bastardly linguistic
    character by transforming it into homogenic this however
    might mean not only toward the same sex but of the same
    kind and in german already possesses actually that meaning
    the term homosexual has the further advantage that on account
    of its classical origin it is easily translatable into many
    languages it is now the most widespread general term for the
    phenomena we are dealing with and it has been used by
    hirschfeld now the chief authority in this field as the title
    of his encyclopedic work die homosexualitt
    sexual inversion in french inversion sexuelle and in
    italian inversione sessuale is the term which has from the
    first been chiefly used in france and italy ever since charcot
    and magnan in 1882 published their cases of this anomaly in the
    archives de neurologie it had already been employed in italy
    by tamassia in the revista sperimentale di freniatria in 1878
    i have not discovered when and where the term sexual inversion
    was first used possibly it first appeared in english for long
    before the paper of charcot and magnan i have noticed in an
    anonymous review of westphals first paper in the journal of
    mental science then edited by dr maudsley for october 1871
    that contrre sexualempfindung is translated as inverted
    sexual proclivity so far as i am aware sexual inversion was
    first used in english as the best term by ja symonds in 1883
    in his privately printed essay a problem in greek ethics
    later in 1897 the same term was adopted i believe for the
    first time publicly in english in the present work
    it is unnecessary to refer to the numerous other names which have
    been proposed a discussion of the nomenclature will be found in
    the first chapter of hirschfelds work die homosexualitt and
    of some special terms in an article by schouten
    sexualprobleme december 1912 it may suffice to mention the
    ancient theological and legal term sodomy sodomia because it
    is still the most popular term for this perversion though it
    must be remembered it has become attached to the physical act of
    intercourse per anum even when carried out heterosexually and
    has little reference to psychic sexual proclivity this term has
    its origin in the story narrated in genesis ch xix of lots
    visitors whom the men of sodom desired to have intercourse with
    and of the subsequent destruction of sodom and gomorrah this
    story furnishes a sufficiently good ground for the use of the
    term though the jews do not regard sodomy as the sin of sodom
    but rather inhospitality and hardness of heart to the poor j
    preuss biblischtalmudische medizin pp 57981 and
    christian theologians also both catholic and protestant see
    eg jahrbuch fr sexuelle zwischenstufen vol iv p 199
    and hirschfeld homosexualitt p 742 have argued that it
    was not homosexuality but their other offenses which provoked
    the destruction of the cities of the plain in germany sodomy
    has long been used to denote bestiality or sexual intercourse
    with animals but this use of the term is quite unjustified in
    english there is another term buggery identical in meaning
    with sodomy and equally familiar bugger in french
    bougre is a corruption of bulgar the ancient bulgarian
    heretics having been popularly supposed to practise this
    perversion the people of every country have always been eager to
    associate sexual perversions with some other country than their
    own
    the terms usually adopted in the present volume are sexual
    inversion and homosexuality the first is used more especially
    to indicate that the sexual impulse is organically and innately
    turned toward individuals of the same sex the second is used
    more comprehensively of the general phenomena of sexual
    attraction between persons of the same sex even if only of a
    slight and temporary character it may be admitted that there is
    no precise warrant for any distinction of this kind between the
    two terms the distinction in the phenomena is however still
    generally recognized thus iwan bloch applies the term
    homosexuality to the congenital form and
    pseudohomosexuality to its spurious or simulated forms those
    persons who are attracted to both sexes are now usually termed
    bisexual a more convenient term than psychosexual
    hermaphrodite which was formerly used there remains the normal
    person who is heterosexual
before approaching the study of sexual inversion in cases which we may
investigate with some degree of scientific accuracy there is interest in
glancing briefly at the phenomena as they appear before us as yet
scarcely or at all differentiated among animals among various human
races and at various periods
among animals in a domesticated or confined state it is easy to find
evidence of homosexual attraction due merely to the absence of the other
sex2 this was known to the ancients the egyptians regarded two male
partridges as the symbol of homosexuality and aristotle noted that two
female pigeons would cover each other if no male was at hand buffon
observed many examples especially among birds he found that if male or
female birds of various speciessuch as partridges fowls and
doveswere shut up together they would soon begin to have sexual
relations among themselves the males sooner and more frequently than the
females more recently sainteclaire deville observed that dogs rams and
bulls when isolated first became restless and dangerous and then
acquired a permanent state of sexual excitement not obeying the laws of
heat and leading them to attempts to couple together the presence of the
opposite sex at once restored them to normal conditions3 bombarda of
lisbon states that in portugal it is well known that in every herd of
bulls there is nearly always one bull who is ready to lend himself to the
perverted whims of his companions4 it may easily be observed how a cow
in heat exerts an exciting influence on other cows impelling them to
attempt to play the bulls part lacassagne has also noted among young
fowls and puppies etc that before ever having had relations with the
opposite sex and while in complete liberty they make hesitating attempts
at intercourse with their own sex5 this indeed together with similar
perversions may often be observed especially in puppies who afterward
become perfectly normal among white rats which are very sexual animals
steinach found that when deprived of females the males practise
homosexuality though only with males with whom they have long associated
the weaker rats play the passive part but when a female is introduced
they immediately turn to her although they are occasionally altogether
indifferent to sex they never actually prefer their own sex6
with regard to the playing of the female part by the weaker rats it is
interesting to observe that fr found among insects that the passive part
in homosexual relations is favored by fatigue among cockchafers it was
the male just separated from the female who would take the passive part
on the rare occasions when homosexual relations occurred with a fresh
male7
homosexuality appears to be specially common among birds it was among
birds that it attracted the attention of the ancients and numerous
interesting observations have been made in more recent times thus selous
a careful birdwatcher finds that the ruff the male of the machetes
pugnax suffers from sexual repression owing to the coyness of the female
the reeve and consequently the males often resort to homosexual
intercourse it is still more remarkable that the reeves also even in the
presence of the males will court each other and have intercourse8 we
may associate this with the high erotic development of birds the
difficulty with which tumescence seems to occur in them and their long
courtships
among the higher animals again female monkeys even when grown up as
moll was informed behave in a sexual way to each other though it is
difficult to say how far this is merely in play dr seitz director of
the frankfurt zological garden gave moll a record of his own careful
observations of homosexual phenomena among the males and females of
various animals confined in the garden antelope cervicapra bos indicus
capra hircus ovis steatopyga9 in all such cases we are not concerned
with sexual inversion but merely with the accidental turning of the
sexual instinct into an abnormal channel the instinct being called out
by an approximate substitute or even by diffused emotional excitement in
the absence of the normal object
it is probable however that cases of true sexual inversionin which
gratification is preferably sought in the same sexmay be found among
animals although observations have rarely been made or recorded it has
been found by muccioli an italian authority on pigeons that among
belgian carrierpigeons inverted practices may occur even in the presence
of many of the other sex10 this seems to be true inversion though we
are not told whether these birds were also attracted toward the opposite
sex the birds of this family appear to be specially liable to sexual
perversion thus mj baillymaitre a breeder of great knowledge and a
keen observer wrote to girard that they are strange creatures in their
manners and customs and are apt to elude the most persistent observer no
animal is more depraved mating between males and still more frequently
between females often occurs at an early age up to the second year i
have had several pairs of pigeons formed by subjects of the same sex who
for many months behaved as if the mating were natural in some cases this
had taken place among young birds of the same nest who acted like real
mates though both subjects were males in order to mate them productively
we have had to separate them and shut each of them up for some days with a
female11 in the berlin zological gardens also it has been noticed
that two birds of the same sex will occasionally become attached to each
other and remain so in spite of repeated advances from individuals of
opposite sex this occurred for instance in the case of two males of the
egyptian goose who were thus to all appearance paired and always kept
together vigorously driving away any female that approached similarly a
male australian sheldrake was paired to a male of another species12
among birds generally inverted sexuality seems to accompany the
development of the secondary sexual characters of the opposite sex which
is sometimes found thus a poultrybreeder describes a hen colored
dorking crowing like a cock only somewhat more harshly as a cockerel
crows and with an enormous comb larger than is ever seen in the male
this bird used to try to tread her fellowhens at the same time she laid
early and regularly and produced grand chickens13 among ducks also
it has occasionally been observed that the female assumes at the same time
both male livery and male sexual tendencies it is probable that such
observations will be multiplied in the future and that sexual inversion
in the true sense will be found commoner among animals than at present it
appears to be
traces of homosexual practices sometimes on a large scale have been
found among all the great divisions of the human race it would be
possible to collect a considerable body of evidence under this head14
unfortunately however the travellers and others on whose records we are
dependent have been so shy of touching these subjects and so ignorant of
the main points for investigation that it is very difficult to discover
sexual inversion in the proper sense in any lower race travellers have
spoken vaguely of crimes against nature without defining the precise
relationship involved nor inquiring how far any congenital impulse could
be distinguished
looking at the phenomena generally so far as they have been recorded
among various lower races we seem bound to recognize that there is a
widespread natural instinct impelling men toward homosexual relationships
and that this has been sometimes though very exceptionally seized upon
and developed for advantageous social purposes on the whole however
unnatural intercourse sodomy has been regarded as an antisocial offense
and punishable sometimes by the most serious penalties that could be
invented this was for instance the case in ancient mexico in peru
among the persians in china and among the hebrews and mohammedans
even in very early history it is possible to find traces of homosexuality
with or without an implied disapproval its existence in assyria and
babylonia is indicated by the codex hamurabi and by inscriptions which do
not on the whole refer to it favorably15 as regards egypt we learn from
a fayum papyrus found by flinders petrie translated by griffiths and
discussed by oefele16 that more than four thousand years ago homosexual
practices were so ancient that they were attributed to the gods horus and
set the egyptians showed great admiration of masculine beauty and it
would seem that they never regarded homosexuality as punishable or even
reprehensible it is notable also that egyptian women were sometimes of
very virile type and hirschfeld considers that intermediate sexual types
were specially widespread among the egyptians17
one might be tempted to expect that homosexual practices would be
encouraged whenever it was necessary to keep down the population
aristotle says that it was allowed by law in crete for this end and
professor haddon tells me that at torres straits a native advocated sodomy
on this ground18 there seems however on the whole to be little
evidence pointing to this utilization of the practice the homosexual
tendency appears to have flourished chiefly among warriors and warlike
peoples during war and the separation from women that war involves the
homosexual instinct tends to develop it flourished for instance among
the carthaginians and among the normans as well as among the warlike
dorians scythians tartars and celts19 and when there has been an
absence of any strong moral feeling against it the instinct has been
cultivated and idealized as a military virtue partly because it
counteracts the longing for the softening feminine influences of the home
and partly because it seems to have an inspiring influence in promoting
heroism and heightening esprit de corps in the lament of david over
jonathan we have a picture of intimate friendshippassing the love of
womenbetween comrades in arms among a barbarous warlike race there is
nothing to show that such a relationship was sexual but among warriors in
new caledonia friendships that were undoubtedly homosexual were recognized
and regulated the fraternity of arms according to foley20 complicated
with pederasty was more sacred than uterine fraternity we have
moreover a recent example of the same relationships recognized in a
modern european racethe albanians
    hahn in the course of his albanische studien 1854 p 166
    says that the young men between 16 and 24 lore boys from about 12
    to 17 a gege marries at the age of 24 or 25 and then he
    usually but not always gives up boylove the following passage
    is reported by hahn as the actual language used to him by an
    albanian gege the lovers feeling for the boy is pure as
    sunshine it places the beloved on the same pedestal as a saint
    it is the highest and most exalted passion of which the human
    breast is capable the sight of a beautiful youth awakens
    astonishment in the lover and opens the door of his heart to the
    delight which the contemplation of this loveliness affords love
    takes possession of him so completely that all his thought and
    feeling goes out in it if he finds himself in the presence of
    the beloved he rests absorbed in gazing on him absent he
    thinks of nought but him if the beloved unexpectedly appears he
    falls into confusion changes color turns alternately pale and
    red his heart beats faster and impedes his breathing he has
    ears and eyes only for the beloved he shuns touching him with
    the hand kisses him only on the forehead sings his praise in
    verse a womans never one of these lovepoems of an albanian
    gege runs as follows the sun when it rises in the morning is
    like you boy when you are near me when your dark eye turns
    upon me it drives my reason from my head
    it should be added that prof weigand who knew the albanians
    well assured bethe rheinisches museum fr philologie 1907
    p 475 that the relations described by hahn are really sexual
    although tempered by idealism a german scholar who travelled in
    albania some years ago also assured ncke jahrbuch fr
    sexuelle zwischenstufen vol ix 1908 p 327 that he could
    fully confirm hahns statements and that though it was
    difficult to speak positively he doubted whether these
    relationships were purely ideal while most prevalent among the
    moslems they are also found among the christians and receive
    the blessing of the priest in church jealousy is frequently
    aroused the same writer remarks and even murder may be
    committed on account of a boy
    it may be mentioned here that among the tschuktsches
    kamschatdals and allied peoples according to a russian
    anthropological journal quoted in sexualprobleme january
    1913 p 41 there are homosexual marriages among the men and
    occasionally among the women ritually consecrated and openly
    recognized
the albanians it is possible belonged to the same stock which produced
the dorian greeks and the most important and the most thoroughly known
case of socially recognized homosexuality is that of greece during its
period of highest military as well as ethical and intellectual vigor in
this case as in those already mentioned the homosexual tendency was
frequently regarded as having beneficial results which caused it to be
condoned if not indeed fostered as a virtue plutarch repeated the old
greek statement that the beotians the lacedemonians and the cretans were
the most warlike stocks because they were the strongest in love an army
composed of loving homosexual couples it was held would be invincible
it appears that the dorians introduced paiderastia as the greek form of
homosexuality is termed into greece they were the latest invaders a
vigorous mountain race from the northwest the region including what is
now albania who spread over the whole land the islands and asia minor
becoming the ruling race homosexuality was of course known before they
came but they made it honorable homer never mentions it and it was not
known as legitimate to the olians or the ionians bethe who has written
a valuable study of dorian paiderastia states that the dorians admitted
a kind of homosexual marriage and even had a kind of boymarriage by
capture the scattered vestiges of this practice indicating bethe
believes that it was a general custom among the dorians before the
invasion of greece such unions even received a kind of religions
consecration it was moreover shameful for a noble youth in crete to
have no lover it spoke ill for his character by paiderastia a man
propagated his virtues as it were in the youth he loved implanting them
by the act of intercourse
in its later greek phases paiderastia was associated less with war than
with athletics it was refined and intellectualized by poetry and
philosophy it cannot be doubted that both schylus and sophocles
cultivated boylove while its idealized presentation in the dialogues of
plato has caused it to be almost identified with his name thus in the
early charmides we have an attractive account of the youth who gives his
name to the dialogue and the emotions he excites are described but even
in the early dialogues plato only conditionally approved of the sexual
side of paiderastia and he condemned it altogether in the final
laws21
    the early stages of greek paiderastia are very interestingly
    studied by bethe die dorische knabenliebe rheinisches museum
    fr philologie 1907 ja symondss essay on the later aspects
    of paiderastia especially as reflected in greek literature a
    problem in greek ethics is contained in the early german
    edition of the present study but though privately printed in
    1883 by the author in an edition of twelve copies and since
    pirated in another private edition it has not yet been published
    in english paiderastia in greek poetry has also been studied
    by paul brandt jahrbuch fr sexuelle zwischenstufen vols
    viii and ix 1906 and 1907 and by otto knapp
    anthropophyteia vol iii pp 254260 who seeks to
    demonstrate the sensual side of paiderastia on the other hand
    licht working on somewhat the same lines as bethe zeitschrift
    fr sexualwissenschaft august 1908 deals with the ethical
    element in paiderastia points out its beneficial moral
    influence and argues that it was largely on this ground that it
    was counted sacred licht has also published a learned study of
    paiderastia in attic comedy anthropophyteia vol vii
    1910 and remarks that without paiderastia greek comedy is
    unthinkable paiderastia in the greek anthology has been fully
    explored by p stephanus jahrbuch fr sexuelle zwischenstufen
    vol ix 1908 p 213 kiefer who has studied socrates in
    relation to homosexuality o kiefer socrates und die
    homosexualitt jahrbuch fr sexuelle zwischenstufen vol ix
    1908 concludes that he was bisexual but that his sexual
    impulses had been sublimated it may be added that many results
    of recent investigation concerning paiderastia are summarized
    by hirschfeld die homosexualitt pp 747788 and by edward
    carpenter intermediate types among primitive folk 1914 part
    ii see also bloch die prostitution vol i p 232 et seq
    and der ursprung der syphilis vol ii p 564
it would appear that almost the only indications outside greece of
paiderastic homosexuality showing a high degree of tenderness and
esthetic feeling are to be found in persian and arabian literature after
the time of the abbasids although this practice was forbidden by the
koran22
in constantinople as ncke was informed by german inverts living in that
city homosexuality is widespread most cultivated turks being capable of
relations with boys as well as with women though very few are exclusively
homosexual so that their attitude would seem to be largely due to custom
and tradition adult males rarely have homosexual relations together one
of the couple is usually a boy of 12 to 18 years and this condition of
things among the refined classes is said to resemble ancient greek
paiderastia but ordinary homosexual prostitution is prevalent it is
especially recognized in the baths which abound in constantinople and are
often open all night the attendants at these baths are youths who
scarcely need an invitation to induce them to gratify the client in this
respect the gratification usually consisting in masturbation mutual or
onesided as desired the practice though little spoken of is carried
on almost openly and blackmailing is said to be unknown23 in the new
turkey however it is stated by adler bey that homosexual prostitution
has almost disappeared24
there is abundant evidence to show that homosexual practices exist and
have long existed in most parts of the world outside europe when
subserving no obvious social or moral end how far they are associated
with congenital inversion is usually very doubtful in china for
instance it seems that there are special houses devoted to male
prostitution though less numerous than the houses devoted to females for
homosexuality cannot be considered common in china its prevalence among
chinese abroad being due to the absence of women and it is chiefly found
in the north25 when a rich man gives a feast he sends for women to
cheer the repast by music and song and for boys to serve at table and to
entertain the guests by their lively conversation the boys have been
carefully brought up for this occupation receiving an excellent
education and their mental qualities are even more highly valued than
their physical attractiveness the women are less carefully brought up and
less esteemed after the meal the lads usually return home with a
considerable fee what further occurs the chinese say little about it
seems that real and deep affection is often born of these relations at
first platonic but in the end becoming physical not a matter for great
concern in the eyes of the chinese in the chinese novels often of a very
literary character devoted to masculine love it seems that all the
preliminaries and transports of normal love are to be found while
physical union may terminate the scene in china however the law may be
brought into action for attempts against nature even with mutual consent
the penalty is one hundred strokes with the bamboo and a months
imprisonment if there is violence the penalty is decapitation i am not
able to say how far the law is a dead letter according to matignon so
far as homosexuality exists in china it is carried on with much more
decorum and restraint than it is in europe and he thinks it may be put
down to the credit of the chinese that unlike europeans they never
practice unnatural connection with women his account of the customs of
the chinese confirms moraches earlier account and he remarks that
though not much spoken of homosexuality is not looked down upon he gives
some interesting details concerning the boy prostitutes these are sold by
their parents sometimes stolen from them about the age of 4 and
educated while they are also subjected to a special physical training
which includes massage of the gluteal regions to favor development
dilatation of the anus and epilation which is not however practised by
chinese women at the same time they are taught music singing drawing
and the art of poetry the waiters at the restaurants always know where
these young gentlemen are to be found when they are required to grace a
rich mans feast they are generally accompanied by a guardian and
usually nothing very serious takes place for they know their value and
money will not always buy their expensive favors they are very
effeminate luxuriously dressed and perfumed and they seldom go on foot
there are however lower orders of such prostitutes26
homosexuality is easily traceable in india dubois referred to houses
devoted to male prostitution with men dressed as women and imitating the
ways of women27 burton in the terminal essay to his translation of
the arabian nights states that when in 1845 sir charles napier
conquered and annexed sind three brothels of eunuchs and boys were found
in the small town of karachi and burton was instructed to visit and
report on them hindus in general however it appears hold
homosexuality in abhorrence in afghanistan homosexuality is more
generally accepted and burton stated that each caravan is accompanied by
a number of boys and lads almost in womans attire with kohled eyes and
rouged cheeks long tresses and hennaed fingers and toes riding
luxuriously in camel paniers
if we turn to the new world we find that among the american indians from
the eskimo of alaska downward to brazil and still farther south
homosexual customs have been very frequently observed sometimes they are
regarded by the tribe with honor sometimes with indifference sometimes
with contempt but they appear to be always tolerated although there are
local differences these customs on the whole seem to have much in
common the best early description which i have been able to find is by
langsdorff28 and concerns the aleuts of oonalashka in alaska boys if
they happen to be very handsome he says are often brought up entirely
in the manner of girls and instructed in the arts women use to please
men their beards are carefully plucked out as soon as they begin to
appear and their chins tattooed like those of women they wear ornaments
of glass beads upon their legs and arms bind and cut their hair in the
same manner as the women and supply their place with the men as
concubines this shocking unnatural and immoral practice has obtained
here even from the remotest times nor have any measures hitherto been
taken to repress and restrain it such men are known under the name of
schopans
among the konyagas langsdorff found the custom much more common than among
the aleuts he remarks that although the mothers brought up some of their
children in this way they seemed very fond of their offspring lisiansky
at about the same period tells us that of all the customs of these
islanders the most disgusting is that of men called schoopans living
with men and supplying the place of women these are brought up from
their infancy with females and taught all the feminine arts they even
assume the manner and dress of the women so nearly that a stranger would
naturally take them for what they are not this odious practice was
formerly so prevalent that the residence of one of these monsters in a
house was considered as fortunate it is however daily losing
ground29 he mentions a case in which a priest had nearly married two
males when an interpreter chanced to come in and was able to inform him
what he was doing
the practice has however apparently continued to be fairly common among
the alaska eskimos down to recent times thus dr engelmann mentioned to
me that he was informed by those who had lived in alaska especially near
point barrow that as many as 5 such individuals regarded by uninstructed
strangers as hermaphrodites might be found in a single comparatively
small community it is stated by davydoff as quoted by holmberg30 that
the boy is selected to be a schopan because he is girllike this is a
point of some interest as it indicates that the schopan is not effeminated
solely by suggestion and association but is probably feminine by inborn
constitution
in louisiana florida yucatan etc somewhat similar customs exist or
have existed in brazil men are to be found dressed as women and solely
occupying themselves with feminine occupations they are not very highly
regarded31 they are called cudinas ie circumcized among the
pueblo indians of new mexico these individuals are called mujerados
supposed to be a corruption of mujeriego and are the chief passive
agents in the homosexual ceremonies of these people they are said to be
intentionally effeminated in early life by much masturbation and by
constant horseriding32
among all the tribes of the northwest united states sexual inverts may be
found the invert is called a bot not man not woman by the
montana and a burdash halfman halfwoman by the washington
indians the bot has been carefully studied by dr ab holder33
holder finds that the bot wears womans dress and that his speech and
manners are feminine the dress and manners are assumed in childhood but
no sexual practices take place until puberty these consist in the
practice of fellatio by the bot who probably himself experiences the
orgasm at the same time the bot is not a pederast although pederasty
occurs among these indians holder examined bot who was splendidly
made prepossessing and in perfect health with much reluctance he agreed
to a careful examination the sexual organs were quite normal though
perhaps not quite so large as his physique would suggest but he had
never had intercourse with a woman on removing his clothes he pressed his
thighs together as a timid woman would so as to conceal completely the
sexual organs holder says that the thighs really or to my fancy had
the feminine rotundity he has heard a bot beg a male indian to
submit to his caress and he tells that one little fellow while in the
agency boardingschool was found frequently surreptitiously wearing
female attire he was punished but finally escaped from school and became
a bot which vocation he has since followed
at tahiti at the beginning of the nineteenth century turnbull34 found
that there are a set of men in this country whose open profession is of
such abomination that the laudable delicacy of our language will not admit
it to be mentioned these are called by the natives mahoos they assume
the dress attitude and manners of women and affect all the fantastic
oddities and coquetries of the vainest of females they mostly associate
with the women who court their acquaintance with the manners of the
women they adopt their peculiar employments making cloth bonnets and
mats and so completely are they unsexed that had they not been pointed
out to me i should not have known them but as women i add with some
satisfaction that the encouragement of this abomination is almost solely
confined to the chiefs
among the sakalaves of madagascar there are certain boys called sekatra
as described by lasnet who are apparently chosen from childhood on
account of weak or delicate appearance and brought up as girls they live
like women and have intercourse with men with or without sodomy paying
the men who please them35
among the negro population of zanzibar forms of homosexuality which are
believed to be congenital as well as acquired forms are said to be
fairly common their frequency is thought to be due to arab influence the
male congenital inverts show from their earliest years no aptitude for
mens occupations but are attracted toward female occupations as they
grow older they wear womens clothes dress their hair in womens fashion
and behave altogether like women they associate only with women and with
male prostitutes and they obtain sexual satisfaction by passive pederasty
or in ways simulating coitus in appearance they resemble ordinary male
prostitutes who are common in zanzibar but it is noteworthy that the
natives make a clear distinction between them and men prostitutes the
latter are looked down on with contempt while the former as being what
they are by the will of god are tolerated36
homosexuality occurs in various parts of africa cases of effeminatio
and passive sodomy have been reported from unyamwezi and uganda among the
bangala of the upper congo sodomy between men is very common especially
when they are away from home in strange towns or in fishing camps if
however a man had intercourse with a woman per anum he was at one time
liable to be put to death37
among the papuans in some parts of new guinea as already mentioned
homosexuality is said to be well recognized and is resorted to for
convenience as well perhaps as for malthusian reasons38 but in the
rigo district of british new guinea where habitual sodomy is not
practised dr seligmann of the cambridge anthropological expedition to
torres straits made some highly important observations on several men and
women who clearly appeared to be cases of congenital sexual inversion with
some degree of esthetic inversion and even some anatomical
modification39 these people it may be noted belong to a primitive
race uncontaminated by contact with white races and practically still in
the stone age
finally among another allied primitive people the australians it would
appear that homosexuality has long been well established in tribal
customs among the natives of kimberley western australia who are by no
means of low type quick and intelligent with special aptitudes for
learning languages and music if a wife is not obtainable for a young man
he is presented with a boywife between the ages of 5 and 10 the age when
a boy receives his masculine initiation the exact nature of the
relations between the boywife and his protector are doubtful they
certainly have connection but the natives repudiate with horror and
disgust the idea of sodomy40
further light is thrown on homosexuality in australia by the supposition
of spencer and gillen that the mika operation urethral subincision an
artificial hypospadias is for the purpose of homosexual intercourse
klaatsch has discussed the homosexual origin of the mika operation on
the basis of information he received from missionaries at niolniol on
the northwest coast the subincised man acts as a female to the as yet
unoperated boys who perform coitus in the incised opening both informed
klaatsch in 1906 that at boulia in queensland the operated men are said to
possess a vulva41
these various accounts are of considerable interest though for the most
part their precise significance remains doubtful some of them
howeversuch as holders description of the bot baumanns account of
homosexual phenomena in zanzibar and especially seligmanns observations
in british new guineaindicate not only the presence of esthetic
inversion but of true congenital sexual inversion the extent of the
evidence will doubtless be greatly enlarged as the number of competent
observers increases and crucial points are no longer so frequently
overlooked
on the whole the evidence shows that among lower races homosexual
practices are regarded with considerable indifference and the real
invert if he exists among them as doubtless he does exist generally
passes unperceived or joins some sacred caste which sanctifies his
exclusively homosexual inclinations
even in europe today a considerable lack of repugnance to homosexual
practices may be found among the lower classes in this matter as
folklore shows in so many other matters the uncultured man of
civilization is linked to the savage in england i am told the soldier
often has little or no objection to prostitute himself to the swell who
pays him although for pleasure he prefers to go to women and hyde park
is spoken of as a center of male prostitution
    among the working masses of england and scotland q writes
    comradeship is well marked though not as in italy very
    conscious of itself friends often kiss each other though this
    habit seems to vary a good deal in different sections and
    coteries men commonly sleep together whether comrades or not
    and so easily get familiar occasionally but not so very often
    this relation delays for a time or even indefinitely actual
    marriage and in some instances is highly passionate and
    romantic there is a good deal of grossness no doubt here and
    there in this direction among the masses but there are no male
    prostitutes that i am aware of whose regular clients are manual
    workers this kind of prostitution in london is common enough
    but i have only a slight personal knowledge of it many youths
    are kept handsomely in apartments by wealthy men and they are
    of course not always inaccessible to others many keep
    themselves in lodgings by this means and others eke out scanty
    wages by the same device just like women in fact choirboys
    reinforce the ranks to a considerable extent and private
    soldiers to a large extent some of the barracks notably
    knightsbridge are great centres on summer evenings hyde park
    and the neighborhood of albert gate is full of guardsmen and
    others plying a lively trade and with little disguise in
    uniform or out in these cases it sometimes only amounts to a
    chat on a retired seat or a drink at a bar sometimes recourse is
    had to a room in some known lodginghouse or to one or two
    hotels which lend themselves to this kind of business in any
    case it means a covetable addition to tommy atkinss
    pocketmoney and mr raffalovich speaking of london remarks
    the number of soldiers who prostitute themselves is greater than
    we are willing to believe it is no exaggeration to say that in
    certain regiments the presumption is in favor of the venality of
    the majority of the men it is worth noting that there is a
    perfect understanding in this matter between soldiers and the
    police who may always be relied upon by the former for
    assistance and advice i am indebted to my correspondent z for
    the following notes soldiers are no less sought after in france
    than in england or in germany and special houses exist for
    military prostitution both in paris and the garrisontowns many
    facts known about the french army go to prove that these habits
    have been contracted in algeria and have spread to a formidable
    extent through whole regiments the facts related by ulrichs
    about the french foreign legion on the testimony of a credible
    witness who had been a pathic in his regiment deserve attention
    ara spei p 20 memnon p 27 this man who was a german
    told ulrichs that the spanish french and italian soldiers were
    the lovers the swiss and german their beloved see also general
    brossiers report quoted by burton arabian nights vol x p
    251 in lucien descavess military novel sous offs paris
    tresse et stock 1890 some details are given regarding
    establishments for male prostitution see pages 322 412 and 417
    for description of the drinkingshop called aux amis de
    larme where a few maids were kept for show and also of its
    frequenters including in particular the adjutant laprvotte
    ulrichs reports that in the austrian army lectures on homosexual
    vices are regularly given to cadets and conscripts memnon p
    26 a soldier who had left the army told a friend of mine that
    he and many of his comrades had taken to homosexual indulgences
    when abroad on foreign service in a lonely station he kept the
    practice up in england because the women of his class were so
    unattractive the captain of an english manofwar said that he
    was always glad to send his men on shore after a long cruise at
    sea never feeling sure how far they might not all go if left
    without women for a certain space of time i may add that a
    hamon la france sociale et politique 1891 pp 65355 also
    in his psychologie du militaire professional chapter x gives
    details as to the prevalence of homosexuality in the french army
    especially in algeria he regards it as extremely common
    although the majority are free a fragment of a letter by general
    lamoricire speaking of marshal changarnier is quoted en
    afrique nous en tions tous mais lui en est rest ici
this primitive indifference is doubtless also a factor in the prevalence
of homosexuality among criminals although here it must be remembered
two other factors congenital abnormality and the isolation of
imprisonment have to be considered in russia tarnowsky observes that
all pederasts are agreed that the common people are tolerably indifferent
to their sexual advances which they call gentlemens games a
correspondent remarks on the fact patent to all observers that simple
folk not infrequently display no greater disgust for the abnormalities of
sexual appetite than they do for its normal manifestations42 he knows
of many cases in which men of lower class were flattered and pleased by
the attentions of men of higher class although not themselves inverted
and from this point of view the following case which he mentions is very
instructive
    a pervert whom i can trust told me that he had made advances to
    upward of one hundred men in the course of the last fourteen
    years and that he had only once met with a refusal in which
    case the man later on offered himself spontaneously and only
    once with an attempt to extort money permanent relations of
    friendship sprang up in most instances he admitted that he
    looked after these persons and helped them with his social
    influence and a certain amount of pecuniary supportsetting one
    up in business giving another something to marry on and finding
    places for others
among the peasantry in switzerland i am informed homosexual
relationships are not uncommon before marriage and such relationships are
lightly spoken of as dummheiten no doubt similar traits might be found
in the peasantry of other parts of europe
what may be regarded as true sexual inversion can be traced in europe from
the beginning of the christian era though we can scarcely demonstrate the
congenital element especially among two classesmen of exceptional
ability and criminals and also it may be added among those neurotic and
degenerate individuals who may be said to lie between these two classes
and on or over the borders of both homosexuality mingled with various
other sexual abnormalities and excesses seems to have flourished in rome
during the empire and is well exemplified in the persons of many of the
emperors43 julius csar augustus tiberius caligula claudius nero
galba titus domitian nerva trajan hadrian commodus and
heliogabalusmany of them men of great ability and from a roman
standpoint great moral worthare all charged on more or less solid
evidence with homosexual practices in julius csarthe husband of all
women and the wife of all men as he was satirically termedexcess of
sexual activity seems to have accompanied as is sometimes seen an excess
of intellectual activity he was first accused of homosexual practices
after a long stay in bithynia with king nikomedes and the charge was
very often renewed csar was proud of his physical beauty and like
some modern inverts he was accustomed carefully to shave and epilate his
body to preserve the smoothness of the skin hadrians love for his
beautiful slave antinos is well known the love seems to have been deep
and mutual and antinos has become immortalized partly by the romance of
his obscure death and partly by the new and strangely beautiful type which
he has given to sculpture44 heliogabalus the most homosexual of all
the company as he has been termed seems to have been a true sexual
invert of feminine type he dressed as a woman and was devoted to the men
he loved45
homosexual practices everywhere flourish and abound in prisons there is
abundant evidence on this point i will only bring forward the evidence of
dr wey formerly physician to the elmira reformatory new york
sexuality he wrote in a private letter is one of the most troublesome
elements with which we have to contend i have no data as to the number of
prisoners here who are sexually perverse in my pessimistic moments i
should feel like saying that all were but probably 80 per cent would be
a fair estimate and referring to the sexual influence which some men
have over others he remarks that there are many men with features
suggestive of femininity that attract others to them in a way that reminds
me of a bitch in heat followed by a pack of dogs46 in sing sing prison
of new york 20 per cent of the prisoners are said to be actively
homosexual and a large number of the rest passively homosexual these
prison relationships are not always of a brutal character mcmurtrie
states the attraction sometimes being more spiritual than physical47
prison life develops and fosters the homosexual tendency of criminals but
there can be little doubt that that tendency or else a tendency to sexual
indifference or bisexuality is a radical character of a very large number
of criminals we may also find it to a considerable extent among tramps
an allied class of undoubted degenerates who save for brief seasons are
less familiar with prison life i am able to bring forward interesting
evidence on this point by an acute observer who lived much among tramps in
various countries and largely devoted himself to the study of them48
the fact that homosexuality is especially common among men of exceptional
intellect was long since noted by dante
    in somma sappi che tutti fur cherci
    e litterati grandi et di gran fama
    dun medismo peccato al mondo lerci49
it has often been noted since and remains a remarkable fact
    there cannot be the slightest doubt that intellectual and
    artistic abilities of the highest order have frequently been
    associated with a congenitally inverted sexual temperament there
    has been a tendency among inverts themselves to discover their
    own temperament in many distinguished persons on evidence of the
    most slender character but it remains a demonstrable fact that
    numerous highly distinguished persons of the past and the
    present in various countries have been inverts i may here
    refer to my own observations on this point in the preface
    mantegazza gli amori degli uomini remarks that in his own
    restricted circle he is acquainted with a french publicist a
    german poet an italian statesman and a spanish jurist all men
    of exquisite taste and highly cultivated mind who are sexually
    inverted krafftebing in the preface to his psychopathia
    sexualis referring to the numberless communications he has
    received from these stepchildren of nature remarks that the
    majority of the writers are men of high intellectual and social
    position and often possess very keen emotions raffalovich
    uranisme p 197 names among distinguished inverts alexander
    the great epaminondas virgil the great cond prince eugne
    etc the question of virgils inversion is discussed in the
    revista di filologia 1890 fas 79 but i have not been able
    to see this review moll in his berhmte homosexuelle 1910
    in the series of grenzfragen des nerven und seelenlebens
    discusses the homosexuality of a number of eminent persons for
    the most part with his usual caution and sagacity speaking of
    the alleged homosexuality of wagner he remarks with entire
    truth that the method of arguing the existence of homosexuality
    from the presence of feminine traits must be decisively
    rejected hirschfeld has more recently included in his great
    work die homosexualitt 1913 pp 650674 two lists ancient
    and modern of alleged inverts among the distinguished persons of
    history briefly stating the nature of the evidence in each case
    they amount to nearly 300 not all of them however can be
    properly described as distinguished thus we end in the list 43
    english names of these at least half a dozen were noblemen who
    were concerned in homosexual prosecutions but were of no
    intellectual distinction others again are of undoubted
    eminence but there is no good reason to regard them as
    homosexual this is the case for instance as regards swift who
    may have been mentally abnormal but appears to have been
    heterosexual rather than homosexual fletcher of whom we know
    nothing definite in this respect is also included as well as
    tennyson whose youthful sentimental friendship for arthur hallam
    is exactly comparable to that of montaigne for etienne de la
    botie yet montaigne is not included in the list it may be
    added however that while some of the english names in the list
    are thus extremely doubtful it would have been possible to add
    some others who were without doubt inverts
it has not i think been notedlargely because the evidence was
insufficiently clearthat among moral leaders and persons with strong
ethical instincts there is a tendency toward the more elevated forms of
homosexual feeling this may be traced not only in some of the great
moral teachers of old but also in men and women of our own day it is
fairly evident why this should be so just as the repressed love of a
woman or a man has in normally constituted persons frequently furnished
the motive power for an enlarged philanthropic activity so the person
who sees his own sex also bathed in sexual glamour brings to his work of
human service an ardor wholly unknown to the normally constituted
individual morality to him has become one with love50 i am not
prepared here to insist on this point but no one i think who studies
sympathetically the histories and experiences of great moral leaders can
fail in many cases to note the presence of this feeling more or less
finely sublimated from any gross physical manifestation
if it is probable that in moral movements persons of homosexual
temperament have sometimes become prominent it is undoubtedly true
beyond possibility of doubt that they have been prominent in religion
many years ago in 1885 the ethnologist elie reclus in his charming
book les primitifs51 setting forth the phenomena of homosexuality
among the eskimo innuit tribe clearly insisted that from time immemorial
there has been a connection between the invert and the priest and showed
how well this connection is illustrated by the eskimo schupans much
more recently in his elaborate study of the priest horneffer discusses
the feminine traits of priests and shows that among the most various
peoples persons of sexually abnormal and especially homosexual
temperament have assumed the functions of priesthood to the popular eye
the unnatural is the supernatural and the abnormal has appeared to be
specially close to the secret power of the world abnormal persons are
themselves of the same opinion and regard themselves as divine as
horneffer points out they often really possess special aptitude52
karsch in his gleichgeschlechtliche leben der naturvlker 1911 has
brought out the high religious as well as social significance of castes of
crossdressed and often homosexual persons among primitive peoples at the
same time edward carpenter in his remarkable book intermediate types
among primitive folk 1914 has shown with much insight how it comes
about that there is an organic connection between the homosexual
temperament and unusual psychic or divinatory powers homosexual men were
nonwarlike and homosexual women nondomestic so that their energies
sought different outlets from those of ordinary men and women they became
the initiators of new activities thus it is that from among them would in
some degree issue not only inventors and craftsmen and teachers but
sorcerers and diviners medicinemen and wizards prophets and priests
such persons would be especially impelled to thought because they would
realize that they were different from other people treated with reverence
by some and with contempt by others they would be compelled to face the
problems of their own nature and indirectly the problems of the world
generally moreover carpenter points out persons in whom the masculine
and feminine temperaments were combined would in many cases be persons of
intuition and complex mind beyond their fellows and so able to exercise
divination and prophecy in a very real and natural sense53
this aptitude of the invert for primitive religion for sorcery and
divination would have its reaction on popular feeling more especially
when magic and the primitive forms of religion began to fall into
disrepute the invert would be regarded as the sorcerer of a false and
evil religion and be submerged in the same ignominy this point has been
emphasized by westermarck in the instructive chapter on homosexuality in
his great work on moral ideas54 he points out the significance of the
fact at the first glance apparently inexplicable that homosexuality in
the general opinion of medieval christianity was constantly associated
even confounded with heresy as we see significantly illustrated by the
fact that in france and england the popular designation for homosexuality
is derived from the bulgarian heretics it was westermarck believes
chiefly as a heresy and out of religious zeal that homosexuality was so
violently reprobated and so ferociously punished
in modern europe we find the strongest evidence of the presence of what
may fairly be called true sexual inversion when we investigate the men of
the renaissance the intellectual independence of those days and the
influence of antiquity seem to have liberated and fully developed the
impulses of those abnormal individuals who would otherwise have found no
clear expression and passed unnoticed55
muret the humanist may perhaps be regarded as a typical example of the
nature and fate of the superior invert of the renaissance born in 1526 at
muret limousin of poor but noble family he was of independent
somewhat capricious character unable to endure professors and
consequently he was mainly his own teacher though he often sought advice
from julescsar scaliger muret was universally admired in his day for
his learning and his eloquence and is still regarded not only as a great
latinist and a fine writer but as a notable man of high intelligence
and remarkable moreover for courtesy in polemics in an age when that
quality was not too common his portrait shows a somewhat coarse and
rustic but intelligent face he conquered honor and respect before he died
in 1585 at the age of 59 in early life muret wrote wanton erotic poems
to women which seem based on personal experience but in 1553 we find him
imprisoned in the chtelet for sodomy and in danger of his life so that
he thought of starving himself to death friends however obtained his
release and he settled in toulouse but the very next year he was burnt in
effigy in toulouse as a huguenot and sodomist this being the result of a
judicial sentence which had caused him to flee from the city and from
france four years later he had to flee from padua owing to a similar
accusation he had many friends but none of them protested against the
charge though they aided him to escape from the penalty it is very
doubtful whether he was a huguenot and whenever in his works he refers to
pederasty it is with strong disapproval but his writings reveal
passionate friendship for men and he seems to have expended little energy
in combating a charge which if false was a shameful injustice to him it
was after fleeing into italy and falling ill of a fever from fatigue and
exposure that muret is said to have made the famous retort to the
physician by his bedside who had said faciamus experimentum in anima
vili vilem animam appellas pro qua christus non dedignatus est
mori56
a greater humanist than muret erasmus himself seems as a young man when
in the augustinian monastery of stein to have had a homosexual attraction
to another brother afterward prior to whom he addressed many
passionately affectionate letters his affection seems however to have
been unrequited57
as the renaissance developed homosexuality seems to become more prominent
among distinguished persons poliziano was accused of pederasty aretino
was a pederast as pope julius ii seems also to have been ariosto wrote
in his satires no doubt too extremely
    senza quel vizio son pochi umanisti58
tasso had a homosexual strain in his nature but he was of weak and
feminine constitution sensitively emotional and physically frail59
it is however among artists at that time and later that homosexuality
may most notably be traced leonardo da vinci whose ideals as revealed in
his work are so strangely bisexual lay under homosexual suspicion in his
youth in 1476 when he was 24 years of age charges were made against him
before the florentine officials for the control of public morality and
were repeated though they do not appear to have been substantiated there
is however some ground for supposing that leonardo was imprisoned in his
youth60 throughout life he loved to surround himself with beautiful
youths and his pupils were more remarkable for their attractive appearance
than for their skill to one at least of them he was strongly attached
while there is no record of any attachment to a woman freud who has
studied leonardo with his usual subtlety considers that his temperament
was marked by ideal homosexuality61
michelangelo one of the very chief artists of the renaissance period we
cannot now doubt was sexually inverted the evidence furnished by his own
letters and poems as well as the researches of numerous recent
workersparlagreco scheffler ja symonds etcmay be said to have
placed this beyond question62 he belonged to a family of 5 brothers 4
of whom never married and so far as is known left no offspring the fifth
only left 1 male heir his biographer describes michelangelo as a man of
peculiar not altogether healthy nervous temperament he was indifferent
to women only in one case indeed during his long life is there evidence
even of friendship with a woman while he was very sensitive to the beauty
of men and his friendships were very tender and enthusiastic at the
same time there is no reason to suppose that he formed any physically
passionate relationships with men and even his enemies seldom or never
made this accusation against him we may probably accept the estimate of
his character given by symonds
    michelangelo buonarotti was one of those exceptional but not
    uncommon men who are born with sensibilities abnormally deflected
    from the ordinary channel he showed no partiality for women and
    a notable enthusiasm for the beauty of young men he was a man
    of physically frigid temperament extremely sensitive to beauty
    of the male type who habitually philosophized his emotions and
    contemplated the living objects of his admiration as amiable not
    only for their personal qualities but also for their esthetical
    attractiveness63
a temperament of this kind seems to have had no significance for the men
of those days they were blind to all homosexual emotion which had no
result in sodomy plato found such attraction a subject for sentimental
metaphysics but it was not until nearly our own time that it again became
a subject of interest and study yet it undoubtedly had profound influence
on michelangelos art impelling him to find every kind of human beauty in
the male form and only a grave dignity or tenderness divorced from every
quality that is sexually desirable in the female form this deeply rooted
abnormality is at once the key to the melancholy of michelangelo and to
the mystery of his art
michelangelos contemporary the painter bazzi 14771549 seems also to
have been radically inverted and to this fact he owed his nickname
sodoma as however he was married and had children it may be that he
was as we should now say of bisexual temperament he was a great artist
who has been dealt with unjustly partly perhaps because of the
prejudice of vasariwhose admiration for michelangelo amounted to
worship but who is contemptuous toward sodoma and grudging of
praisepartly because his work is little known out of italy and not
very easy of access there reckless unbalanced and eccentric in his
life sodoma revealed in his painting a peculiar feminine softness and
warmthwhich indeed we seem to see also in his portrait of himself at
monte oliveto maggioreand a very marked and tender feeling for
masculine but scarcely virile beauty64
cellini was probably homosexual he was imprisoned on a charge of
unnatural vice and is himself suspiciously silent in his autobiography
concerning this imprisonment65
in the seventeenth century another notable sculptor who has been termed
the flemish cellini jrme duquesnoy whose still more distinguished
brother franois executed the manneken pis in brussels was an invert
having finally been accused of sexual relations with a youth in a chapel
of the ghent cathedral where he was executing a monument for the bishop
he was strangled and burned notwithstanding that much influence
including that of the bishop was brought to bear in his behalf66
in more recent times winkelmann who was the initiator of a new greek
renaissance and of the modern appreciation of ancient art lies under what
seems to be a wellgrounded suspicion of sexual inversion his letters to
male friends are full of the most passionate expressions of love his
violent death also appears to have been due to a loveadventure with a
man the murderer was a cook a wholly uncultivated man a criminal who
had already been condemned to death and shortly before murdering
winkelmann for the sake of plunder he was found to be on very intimate
terms with him67 it is noteworthy that sexual inversion should so often
be found associated with the study of antiquity it must not however be
too hastily concluded that this is due to suggestion and that to abolish
the study of greek literature and art would be largely to abolish sexual
inversion what has really occurred in those recent cases that may be
studied and therefore without doubt in the older cases is that the
subject of congenital sexual inversion is attracted to the study of greek
antiquity because he finds there the explanation and the apotheosis of his
own obscure impulses undoubtedly that study tends to develop these
impulses
while it is peculiarly easy to name men of distinguished ability who
either certainly or in all probability have been affected by homosexual
tendencies they are not isolated manifestations they spring out of an
element of diffused homosexuality which is at least as marked in
civilization as it is in savagery it is easy to find illustrations in
every country here it may suffice to refer to france germany and
england
in france in the thirteenth century the church was so impressed by the
prevalence of homosexuality that it reasserted the death penalty for
sodomy at the councils of paris 1212 and rouen 1214 while we are told
that even by rejecting a womans advances as illustrated in marie de
frances lai de lanval a man fell under suspicion as a sodomist which
was also held to involve heresy68 at the end of this century about
1294 alain de lille was impelled to write a book de planctu natur in
order to call attention to the prevalence of homosexual feeling he also
associated the neglect of women with sodomy man is made woman he
writes he blackens the honor of his sex the craft of magic venus makes
him of double gender nobly beautiful youths have turned their hammers
of love to the office of anvils and many kisses lie untouched on maiden
lips the result is that the natural anvils that is to say the
neglected maidens bewail the absence of their hammers and are seen sadly
to demand them alain de lille makes himself the voice of this
demand69
a few years later at the beginning of the fourteenth century sodomy was
still regarded as very prevalent at that time it was especially
associated with the templars who it has been supposed brought it from
the east such a supposition however is not required to account for the
existence of homosexuality in france nor is it necessary at a somewhat
later period to invoke as is frequently done the italian origin of
catherine de medici in order to explain the prevalence of homosexual
practices at her court
notwithstanding its prevalence sodomy was still severely punished from
time to time thus in 1586 dadon who had formerly been rector of the
university of paris was hanged and then burned for injuring a child
through sodomy70 in the seventeenth century homosexuality continued
however to flourish and it is said that nearly all the numerous
omissions made in the published editions of tallement des reauxs
historiettes refer to sodomy71
how prominent homosexuality was in the early eighteenth century in
france we learn from the frequent references to it in the letters of
madame the mother of the regent whose husband was himself effeminate and
probably inverted72 for the later years of the century the evidence
abounds on every hand at this time the bastille was performing a useful
function until recently overlooked by historians as an asile de suret
for abnormal persons whom it was considered unsafe to leave at large
inverts whose conduct became too offensive to be tolerated were frequently
placed in the bastille which indeed abounded in homosexual subjects to
a greater extent than any other class of sexual perverts some of the
affairs which led to the bastille have a modern air one such case on a
large scale occurred in 1702 and reveals an organized system of
homosexual prostitution one of the persons involved in this affair was a
handsome wellmade youth named lebel formerly a lackey but passing
himself off as a man of quality seduced at the age of 10 by a famous
sodomist named duplessis he had since been at the disposition of a number
of homosexual persons including officers priests and marquises some of
the persons involved in these affairs were burned alive some cut their
own throats others again were set at liberty or transferred to the
bictre73 during the latter part of the eighteenth century also we
find another modern homosexual practice recognized in france the
rendezvous or center where homosexual persons could quietly meet each
other74
inversion has always been easy to trace in germany ammianus marcellinus
bears witness to its prevalence among some german tribes in later roman
days75 in medival times as schultz points out references to sodomy
in germany were far from uncommon various princes of the german imperial
house and of other princely families in the middle ages were noted for
their intimate friendships at a later date attention has frequently been
called to the extreme emotional warmth which has often marked german
friendship even when there has been no suspicion of any true homosexual
relationship76 the eighteenth century in the full enjoyment of that
abandonment to sentiment initiated by rousseau proved peculiarly
favorable to the expansion of the tendency to sentimental friendship on
this basis a really inverted tendency when it existed could easily come
to the surface and find expression we find this well illustrated in the
poet heinrich von kleist who seems to have been of bisexual temperament
and his feelings for the girl he wished to marry were indeed much cooler
than those for his friend to this friend ernst von pful afterward
prussian war minister kleist wrote in 1805 at the age of 28 you bring
the days of the greeks back to me i could sleep with you dear youth my
whole soul so embraces you when you used to bathe in the lake of thun i
would gaze with the real feelings of a girl at your beautiful body it
would serve an artist to study from there follows an enthusiastic
account of his friends beauty and of the greek idea of the love of
youths and kleist concludes go with me to anspach and let us enjoy
the sweets of friendship i shall never marry you must be wife and
children to me77
in all social classes and in all fields of activity germany during the
nineteenth century produced a long series of famous or notorious
homosexual persons at the one end we find people of the highest
intellectual distinction such as alexander von humboldt whom ncke a
cautious investigator stated that he had good ground for regarding as an
invert78 at the other end we find prosperous commercial and
manufacturing people who leave germany to find solace in the free and
congenial homosexual atmosphere of capri of these fa krupp the head of
the famous essen factory may be regarded as the type79
in england and the same is true today of the united states although
homosexuality has been less openly manifest and less thoroughly explored
it is doubtful whether it has been less prevalent than in germany at an
early period indeed the evidence may even seem to show that it was more
prevalent in the penitentials of the ninth and tenth centuries natural
fornication and sodomy were frequently put together and the same penance
assigned to both it was recognized that priests and bishops as well as
laymen might fall into this sin though to the bishop nearly three times
as much penance was assigned as to the layman among the normans
everywhere homosexuality was markedly prevalent the spread of sodomy in
france about the eleventh century is attributed to the normans and their
coming seems to have rendered it at times almost fashionable at all
events at court in england william rufus was undoubtedly inverted as
later on were edward ii james i and perhaps though not in so
conspicuous a degree william iii80
ordericus vitalis who was himself half norman and half english says that
the normans had become very effeminate in his time and that after the
death of william the conqueror sodomy was common both in england and
normandy guillaume de nangis in his chronicle for about 1120 speaking
of the two sons of henry and the company of young nobles who went down
with them in the white ship states that nearly all were considered to
be sodomists and henry of huntingdon in his history looked upon the
loss of the white ship as a judgment of heaven upon sodomy anselm in
writing to archdeacon william to inform him concerning the recent council
at london 1102 gives advice as to how to deal with people who have
committed the sin of sodomy and instructs him not to be too harsh with
those who have not realized its gravity for hitherto this sin has been
so public that hardly anyone has blushed for it and many therefore have
plunged into it without realizing its gravity81 so temperate a remark
by a man of such unquestionably high character is more significant of the
prevalence of homosexuality than much denunciation
in religious circles far from courts and cities as we might expect
homosexuality was regarded with great horror though even here we may
discover evidence of its wide prevalence thus in the remarkable
revelation of the monk of evesham written in english in 1196 we find
that in the very worst part of purgatory are confined an innumerable
company of sodomists including a wealthy witty and learned divine a
doctor of laws personally known to the monk and whether these people
would ever be delivered from purgatory was a matter of doubt of the
salvation of no other sinners does the monk of evesham seem so dubious
sodomy had always been an ecclesiastical offense the statute of 1533 25
henry viii c 6 made it a felony and pollock and maitland consider that
this affords an almost sufficient proof that the temporal courts had not
punished it and that no one had been put to death for it for a very long
time past82 the temporal law has never however proved very
successful in repressing homosexuality at this period the renaissance
movement was reaching england and here as elsewhere it brought with it
if not an increase at all events a rehabilitation and often an
idealization of homosexuality83
an eminent humanist and notable pioneer in dramatic literature nicholas
udall to whom is attributed ralph roister doister the first english
comedy stands out as unquestionably addicted to homosexual tastes
although he has left no literary evidence of this tendency he was an
early adherent of the protestant movement and when headmaster of eton he
was noted for his love of inflicting corporal punishment on the boys
tusser says he once received from udall 53 stripes for fault but small or
none at all here there was evidently a sexual sadistic impulse for in
1541 the year of ralph roister doister udall was charged with
unnatural crime and confessed his guilt before the privy council he was
dismissed from the headmastership and imprisoned but only for a short
time and his reputation his modern biographer states was not
permanently injured he retained the vicarage of braintree and was much
favored by edward vi who nominated him to a prebend of windsor queen
mary was also favorable and he became headmaster of westminster
school84
an elizabethan lyrical poet of high quality whose work has had the honor
of being confused with shakespeares richard barnfield appears to have
possessed the temperament at least of the invert his poems to male
friends are of so impassioned a character that they aroused the protests
of a very tolerant age very little is known of barnfields life born in
1574 he published his first poem the affectionate shepherd at the age
of 20 while still at the university it was issued anonymously revealed
much fresh poetic feeling and literary skill and is addressed to a youth
of whom the poet declares
    if it be sin to love a lovely lad
    oh then sin i
in his subsequent volume cynthia 1595 barnfield disclaims any
intention in the earlier poem beyond that of imitating virgils second
eclogue but the sonnets in this second volume are even more definitely
homosexual than the earlier poem though he goes on to tell how at last he
found a lass whose beauty surpassed that
          of the swain
    whom i never could obtain
after the age of 31 barnfield wrote no more but being in easy
circumstances retired to his beautiful manor house and country estate in
shropshire lived there for twenty years and died leaving a wife and
son85 it seems probable that he was of bisexual temperament and that
as not infrequently happens in such cases the homosexual element
developed early under the influence of a classical education and
university associations while the normal heterosexual element developed
later and as may happen in bisexual persons was associated with the more
commonplace and prosaic side of life barnfield was only a genuine poet on
the homosexual side of his nature
greater men of that age than barnfield may be suspected of homosexual
tendencies marlowe whose most powerful drama edward ii is devoted to
a picture of the relations between that king and his minions is himself
suspected of homosexuality an ignorant informer brought certain charges
of freethought and criminality against him and further accused him of
asserting that they are fools who love not boys these charges have
doubtless been colored by the vulgar channel through which they passed
but it seems absolutely impossible to regard them as the inventions of a
mere gallowsbird such as this informer was86 moreover marlowes
poetic work while it shows him by no means insensitive to the beauty of
women also reveals a special and peculiar sensitiveness to masculine
beauty marlowe clearly had a reckless delight in all things unlawful and
it seems probable that he possessed the bisexual temperament shakespeare
has also been discussed from this point of view all that can be said
however is that he addressed a long series of sonnets to a youthful male
friend these sonnets are written in lovers language of a very tender and
noble order they do not appear to imply any relationship that the writer
regarded as shameful or that would be so regarded by the world moreover
they seem to represent but a single episode in the life of a very
sensitive manysided nature87 there is no other evidence in
shakespeares work of homosexual instinct such as we may trace throughout
marlowes while there is abundant evidence of a constant preoccupation
with women
while shakespeare thus narrowly escapes inclusion in the list of
distinguished inverts there is much better ground for the inclusion of
his great contemporary francis bacon aubrey in his laboriously compiled
short lives in which he shows a friendly and admiring attitude toward
bacon definitely states that he was a pederast aubrey was only a careful
gleaner of frequently authentic gossip but a similar statement is made by
sir simonds dewes in his autobiography dewes whose family belonged
to the same part of suffolk as bacons sprang from was not friendly to
bacon but that fact will not suffice to account for his statement he was
an upright and honorable man of scholarly habits and moreover a trained
lawyer who had many opportunities of obtaining firsthand information
for he had lived in the chancery office from childhood he is very precise
as to bacons homosexual practices with his own servants both before and
after his fall and even gives the name of a very effeminatefaced youth
who was his catamite and bedfellow he states further that there had
been some question of bringing bacon to trial for sodomy these
allegations may be supported by a letter of bacons own mother printed in
speddings life of bacon reproving him on account of what she had
heard concerning his behavior with the young welshmen in his service whom
he made his bedfellows it is notable that bacon seems to have been
specially attracted to welshmen one might even find evidence of this in
the life of the welshman henry vii a people of vivacious temperament
unlike his own this is illustrated by his long and intimate friendship
with the mercurial sir toby mathew his alter ego a man of dissipated
habits in early life though we are not told that he was homosexual bacon
had many friendships with men but there is no evidence that he was ever
in love or cherished any affectionate intimacy with a woman women play no
part at all in his life his marriage which was childless took place at
the mature age of 46 it was effected in a businesslike manner and
though he always treated his wife with formal consideration it is probable
that he neglected her and certain that he failed to secure her devotion
it is clear that toward the end of bacons life she formed a relationship
with her gentleman usher whom subsequently she married bacons writings
it may be added equally with his letters show no evidence of love or
attraction to women in his essays he is brief and judicial on the
subject of marriage copious and eloquent on the subject of friendship
while the essay on beauty deals exclusively with masculine beauty
during the first half of the eighteenth century we have clear evidence
that homosexuality flourished in london with the features which it
presents today in all large cities everywhere there was a generally known
name mollies applied to homosexual persons evidently having reference
to their frequently feminine characteristics there were houses of private
resort for them molly houses there were special public places of
rendezvous whither they went in search of adventure exactly as there are
today a walk in upper moorfields was especially frequented by the
homosexual about 1725 a detective employed by the police about that date
gave evidence as follows at the old bailey i takes a turn that way and
leans over the wall in a little time the prisoner passes by and looks
hard at me and at a small distance from me stands up against the wall as
if he was going to make water then by degrees he siddles nearer and
nearer to where i stood till at last he was close to me tis a very fine
night says he aye say i and so it is then he takes me by the
hand and after squeezing and playing with it a little he conveys it to
his breeches whereupon the detective seizes the man by his sexual organs
and holds him until the constable comes up and effects an arrest
at the same period margaret clap commonly called mother clap kept a
house in field lane holborn which was a noted resort of the homosexual
to mother claps mollyhouse 30 or 40 clients would resort every night on
sunday there might be as many as 50 for as in berlin and other cities
today that was the great homosexual gala night there were beds in every
room in this house we are told that the men would sit in one anothers
laps kissing in a lewd manner and using their hands indecently then they
would get up dance and make curtsies and mimic the voices of women oh
fie sirpray sirdear sirlord how can you serve me
soi swear ill cry outyoure a wicked deviland youre a
bold faceeh ye dear little toadcome bus theyd hug and play
and toy and go out by couples into another room on the same floor to be
married as they called it
on the whole one gains the impression that homosexual practices were more
prevalent in london in the eighteenth century bearing in mind its
population at that time than they are today88 it must not however be
supposed that the law was indulgent and its administration lax the very
reverse was the case the punishment for sodomy when completely effected
was death and it was frequently inflicted homosexual intercourse
without evidence of penetration was regarded as attempt and was usually
punished by the pillory and a heavy fine followed by two years
imprisonment moreover it would appear that more activity was shown by
the police in prosecution than is nowadays the case this is for
instance suggested by the evidence of the detective already quoted
to keep a homosexual resort was also a severely punishable offense mother
clap was charged at the old bailey in 1726 with keeping a sodomitical
house she protested that she could not herself have taken part in these
practices but that availed her nothing she could bring forward no
witnesses on her behalf and was condemned to pay a fine to stand in the
pillory and to undergo imprisonment for two years the cases were dealt
with in a matteroffact way which seems to bear further witness to the
frequency of the offense and with no effort to expend any specially
vindictive harshness on this class of offenders if there was the
slightest doubt as to the facts even though the balance of evidence was
against the accused he was usually acquitted and the man who could bring
witnesses to his general good character might often thereby escape in
1721 a religious young man married was convicted of attempting sodomy
with two young men he slept with he was fined placed in the pillory and
imprisoned for two months next year a man was acquitted on a similar
charge and another man of decent aspect although the evidence indicated
that he might have been guilty of sodomy was only convicted of attempt
and sentenced to fine pillory and two years imprisonment in 1723
again a schoolmaster was acquitted on account of his good reputation of
the charge of attempt on a boy of 15 his pupil though the evidence
seemed decidedly against him in 1730 a man was sentenced to death for
sodomy effected on his young apprentice this was a bad case and the
surgeons evidence indicated laceration of the perineum homosexuality of
all kinds flourished it will be seen notwithstanding the fearless yet
fair application of a very severe law89
in more recent times byron has frequently been referred to as experiencing
homosexual affections and i have been informed that some of his poems
nominally addressed to women were really inspired by men it is certain
that he experienced very strong emotions toward his male friends my
schoolfriendships he wrote were with me passions when he afterward
met one of these friends lord clare in italy he was painfully agitated
and could never hear the name without a beating of the heart at the age
of 22 he formed one of his strong attachments for a youth to whom he left
7000 in his will90 it is probable however that here as well as in
the case of shakespeare and in that of tennysons love for his youthful
friend arthur hallam as well as of montaigne for etienne de la botie
although such strong friendships may involve an element of sexual emotion
we have no true and definite homosexual impulse homosexuality is merely
simulated by the ardent and hyperesthetic emotions of the poet91 the
same quality of the poets emotional temperament may doubtless also be
invoked in the case of goethe who is said to have written elegies which
on account of their homosexual character still remain unpublished
the most famous homosexual trial of recent times in england was that of
oscar wilde a writer whose literary reputation may be said to be still
growing not only in england but throughout the world wilde was the son
of parents who were both of unusual ability and somewhat eccentric both
these tendencies became in him more concentrated he was born with as it
were a congenital antipathy to the commonplace a natural love of
paradox and he possessed the skill to embody the characteristic in
finished literary form at the same time it must not be forgotten
beneath this natural attitude of paradox his essential judgments on life
and literature were usually sound and reasonable his essay on the soul
of man under socialism witnessed to his large and enlightened conception
of life and his profound admiration for flaubert to the sanity and
solidity of his literary taste in early life he revealed no homosexual
tendencies he married and had children after he had begun to outgrow his
youthful esthetic extravagances however and to acquire success and fame
he developed what was at first a simply inquisitive interest in inversion
such inquisitive interest is sometimes the sign of an emerging homosexual
impulse it proved to be so in wildes case and ultimately he was found to
be cultivating the acquaintance of youths of low class and doubtful
character although this development occurred comparatively late in life
we must hesitate to describe wildes homosexuality as acquired if we
consider his constitution and his history it is not difficult to suppose
that homosexual germs were present in a latent form from the first and it
may quite well be that wildes inversion was of that kind which is now
described as retarded though still congenital
as is usual in england no active efforts were made to implicate wilde in
any criminal charge it was his own action as even he himself seems to
have vaguely realized beforehand which brought the storm about his head
he was arrested tried condemned and at once there arose a general howl
of execration joined in even by the judge whose attitude compared
unfavorably with the more impartial attitude of the eighteenth century
judges in similar cases wilde came out of prison ambitious to retrieve
his reputation by the quality of his literary work but he left reading
gaol merely to enter a larger and colder prison he soon realized that his
spirit was broken even more than his health he drifted at last to paris
where he shortly after died shunned by all but a few of his friends92
in a writer of the first order edward fitzgerald to whom we owe the
immortal and highly individualized version of omar khayyam it is easy
to trace an element of homosexuality though it appears never to have
reached full and conscious development fitzgerald was an eccentric person
who though rich and on friendly terms with some of the most distinguished
men of his time was always out of harmony with his environment he felt
himself called on to marry very unhappily a woman whom he had never been
in love with and with whom he had nothing in common all his affections
were for his male friends in early life he was devoted to his friend wk
browne whom he glorified in euphranor to him browne was at once
jonathan gamaliel apollothe friend the master the godthere was
scarcely a limit to his devotion and admiration93 on brownes
premature death fitzgeralds heart was empty in 1859 at lowestoft
fitzgerald as he wrote to mrs browne used to wander about the shore at
night longing for some fellow to accost me who might give some promise of
filling up a very vacant place in my heart it was then that he met
posh joseph fletcher a fisherman 6 feet tall said to be of the best
suffolk type both in body and character posh reminded fitzgerald of his
dead friend browne he made him captain of his lugger and was thereafter
devoted to him posh was said fitzgerald a man of the finest saxon
type with a complexion vif mle et flamboyant blue eyes a nose less
than roman more than greek and strictly auburn hair that any woman might
envy further he was a man of simplicity of soul justice of thought
tenderness of nature a gentleman of natures grandest type in fact the
greatest man fitzgerald had ever met posh was not however quite so
absolutely perfect as this description suggests and various
misunderstandings arose in consequence between the two friends so unequal
in culture and social traditions these difficulties are reflected in some
of the yet extant letters from the enormous mass which fitzgerald
addressed to my dear poshy94
a great personality of recent times widely regarded with reverence as the
prophetpoet of democracy95walt whitmanhas aroused discussion by his
sympathetic attitude toward passionate friendship or manly love as he
calls it in leaves of grass in this bookin calamus drumtaps
and elsewherewhitman celebrates a friendship in which physical contact
and a kind of silent voluptuous emotion are essential elements in order
to settle the question as to the precise significance of calamus ja
symonds wrote to whitman frankly posing the question the answer written
from camden nj on august 19 1890 is the only statement of whitmans
attitude toward homosexuality and it is therefore desirable that it
should be set on record
    about the questions on calamus etc they quite daze me
    leaves of grass is only to be rightly construed by and within
    its own atmosphere and essential characterall its pages and
    pieces so coming strictly under that the calamus part has ever
    allowed the possibility of such construction as mentioned is
    terrible i am fain to hope that the pages themselves are not to
    be even mentioned for such gratuitous and quite at the time
    undreamed and unwished possibility of morbid inferenceswhich
    are disavowed by me and seem damnable
it would seem from this letter96 that whitman had never realized that
there is any relationship whatever between the passionate emotion of
physical contact from man to man as he had experienced it and sung it
and the act which with other people he would regard as a crime against
nature this may be singular for there are many inverted persons who have
found satisfaction in friendships less physical and passionate than those
described in leaves of grass but whitman was a man of concrete
emotional instinctive temperament lacking in analytical power receptive
to all influences and careless of harmonizing them he would most
certainly have refused to admit that he was the subject of inverted
sexuality it remains true however that manly love occupies in his
work a predominance which it would scarcely hold in the feelings of the
average man whom whitman wishes to honor a normally constituted
person having assumed the very frank attitude taken up by whitman would
be impelled to devote far more space and far more ardor to the subject of
sexual relationships with women and all that is involved in maternity than
is accorded to them in leaves of grass some of whitmans extant letters
to young men though they do not throw definite light on this question
are of a very affectionate character97 and although a man of
remarkable physical vigor he never felt inclined to marry98 it remains
somewhat difficult to classify him from the sexual point of view but we
can scarcely fail to recognize the presence of a homosexual tendency
    i should add that some friends and admirers of whitman are not
    prepared to accept the evidence of the letter to symonds i am
    indebted to q for the following statement of the objections
    i think myself that it is a mistake to give much weight to this
    letterperhaps a mistake to introduce it at all since if
    introduced it will of course carry weight and this for three
    or four reasons
    1 that it is difficult to reconcile the letter itself with its
    strong tone of disapprobation with the general atmosphere of
    leaves of grass the tenor of which is to leave everything open
    and free
    2 that the letter is in hopeless conflict with the calamus
    section of poems for whatever moral lines whitman may have
    drawn at the time of writing these poems it seems to me quite
    incredible that the possibility of certain inferences morbid or
    other was undreamed of
    3 that the letter was written only a few months before his last
    illness and death and is the only expression of the kind that he
    appears to have given utterance to
    4 that symondss letter to which this was a reply is not
    forth coming and we consequently do not know what rash
    expressions it may have containedleading whitman with his
    extreme caution to hedge his name from possible use to justify
    dubious practices
    i may add that i endeavored to obtain symondss letter but he
    was unable to produce it nor has any copy of it been found among
    his papers
    it should be said that whitmans attitude toward symonds was
    marked by high regard and admiration a wonderful man is
    addington symonds he remarked shortly before his own death
    some ways the most indicative and penetrating and significant
    man of our time symonds is a curious fellow i love him dearly
    he is of college breed and education horribly literary and
    suspicious and enjoys things a great fellow for delving into
    persons and into the concrete and even into the physiological
    and the gastric and wonderfully cute but on this occasion he
    delved in vain
    the foregoing remarks substantially contained in the previous
    editions of this book were based mainly on the information
    received from ja symondss side but of more recent years
    interesting light has been thrown on this remarkable letter from
    walt whitmans side the boswellian patience enthusiasm and
    skill which horace traubel has brought to his full and elaborate
    work now in course of publication with walt whitman in
    camden clearly reveal in the course of various conversations
    whitmans attitude to symondss question and the state of mind
    which led up to this letter
    whitman talked to traubel much about symonds from the
    twentyseventh of april 1888 very soon after the date when
    traubels work begins onward symonds had written to him
    repeatedly it seems concerning the passional relations of men
    with men as whitman expressed it he is always driving at me
    about that is that what calamus meansbecause of me or in
    spite of me is that what it means i have said no but no does
    not satisfy him there is however no record from symondss
    side of any letter by whitman to symonds in this sense up to this
    date but read this letterread the whole of it it is very
    shrewd very cute in deadliest earnest it drives me hard
    almost compels meit is urgent persistent he sort of stands in
    the road and says i wont move till you answer my question you
    see this is an old lettersixteen years oldand he is still
    asking the question he refers to it in one of his latest notes
    he is surely a wonderful mana rare cleanedup mana
    whitesouled heroic character you will be writing something
    about calamus some day said w to traubel and this letter
    and what i say may help to clear your ideas calamus needs clear
    ideas it may be easily innocently distorted from its natural
    its motive body of doctrine
    the letter dated feb 7 1872 of some length is then
    reproduced it tells how much leaves of grass and especially
    the calamus section had helped the writer what the love of man
    for man has been in the past symonds wrote i think i know
    what it is here now i know alsoalas what you say it can and
    should be i dimly discern in your poems but this hardly
    satisfies meso desirous am i of learning what you teach some
    day perhapsin some form i know not what but in your own
    chosen formyou will tell me more about the love of friends
    till then i wait
    said w well what do you think of that do you think that
    could be answered i dont see why you call that letter driving
    you hard its quiet enoughit only asks questions and asks the
    questions mildly enough i suppose you are rightdrive is
    not exactly the word yet you know how i hate to be catechised
    symonds is right no doubt to ask the questions i am just as
    much right if i do not answer them just as much right if i do
    answer them i often say to myself about calamusperhaps it
    means more or less than what i thought myselfmeans different
    perhaps i dont know what it all meansperhaps never did know
    my first instinct about all that symonds writes is violently
    reactionaryis strong and brutal for no no no then the
    thought intervenes that i maybe do not know all my own meanings
    i say to myself you too go away come back study your own
    bookas alien or stranger study your own book see what it
    amounts to some time or other i will have to write to him
    definitely about calamusgive him my word for it what i meant or
    mean it to mean
    again a month later may 24 1888 whitman speaks to traubel of
    a beautiful letter from symonds you will see that he harps on
    the calamus poems again i dont see why it should but his
    recurrence to that subject irritates me a little i suppose you
    might saywhy dont you shut him up by answering him there is
    no logical answer to that i suppose but i may ask in my turn
    what right has he to ask questions anyway w laughed a bit
    anyway the question comes back to me almost every time he
    writes he is courteous enough about itthat is the reason i do
    not resent him i suppose the whole thing will end in an answer
    some day
    the letter follows the chief point in it is that the writer
    hopes he has not been importunate in the question he had asked
    about calamus three years before
    i traubel said to w thats a humble letter enough i dont
    see anything in that to get excited about he doesnt ask you to
    answer the old question in fact he rather apologizes for having
    asked it w fired up who is excited as to that question he
    does ask it again and again asks it asks it asks it i
    laughed at his vehemence well suppose he does it does not
    harm besides youve got nothing to hide i think your silence
    might lead him to suppose there was a nigger in your wood pile
    oh nonsense but for thirty years my enemies and friends have
    been asking me questions about the leaves im tired of not
    answering questions it was very funny to see his face when he
    gave a humorous twist to the fling in his last phrase then he
    relaxed and added anyway i love symonds who could fail to love
    a man who could write such a letter i suppose he will yet have
    to be answered damn im
it is clear that these conversations considerably diminish the force of
the declaration in whitmans letter we see that the letter which on the
face of it might have represented the swift and indignant reaction of a
man who suddenly faced by the possibility that his work may be
interpreted in a perverse sense emphatically repudiates that
interpretation was really nothing of the kind symonds for at least
eighteen years had been gently considerately even humbly yet
persistently asking the same perfectly legitimate question if the answer
was really an emphatic no it would more naturally have been made in 1872
than 1890 moreover in the face of this everrecurring question whitman
constantly speaks to his friends of his great affection for symonds and
his admiration for his intellectual cuteness feelings that would both be
singularly out of place if applied to a man who was all the time
suggesting the possibility that his writings contained inferences that
were terrible morbid and damnable evidently during all those
years whitman could not decide what to reply on the one hand he was
moved by his horror of being questioned by his caution by his natural
aversion to express approval of anything that could be called unnatural or
abnormal on the other hand he was moved by the desire to let his work
speak for itself by his declared determination to leave everything open
and possibly by a more or less conscious sympathy with the inferences
presented to him it was not until the last years of his life when his
sexual life belonged to the past when weakness was gaining on him when
he wished to put aside every drain on his energies thatbeing
constitutionally incapable of a balanced scientific statementhe chose
the simplest and easiest solution of the difficulty99
concerning another great modern writerpaul verlaine the first of modern
french poetsit seems possible to speak with less hesitation a man who
possessed in fullest measure the irresponsible impressionability of
genius verlaineas his work shows and as he himself admittedall his
life oscillated between normal and homosexual love at one period
attracted to women at another to men he was without doubt it seems to
me bisexual an early connection with another young poet arthur rimbaud
terminated in a violent quarrel with his friend and led to verlaines
imprisonment at mons in afteryears he gave expression to the exalted
passion of this relationshipmon grand pch radieuxin lti et
errabundi published in the volume entitled paralllement and in later
poems he has told of less passionate and less sensual relationships which
yet were more than friendship for instance in the poem mon ami ma
plus belle amiti ma meilleure in bonheur100
in this brief glance at some of the ethnographical historical religious
and literary aspects of homosexual passion there is one other phenomenon
which may be mentioned this is the alleged fact that while the phenomena
exist to some extent everywhere we seem to find a special proclivity to
homosexuality whether or not involving a greater frequency of congenital
inversion is not usually clear among certain races and in certain
regions101 in europe this would be best illustrated by the case of
southern italy which in this respect is held to be distinct from northern
italy although italians generally are franker than men of northern race
in admitting their sexual practices102 how far the supposed greater
homosexuality of southern italy may be due to greek influence and greek
blood it is not very easy to say
it must be remembered that in dealing with a northern country like
england homosexual phenomena do not present themselves in the same way as
they do in southern italy today or in ancient greece in greece the
homosexual impulse was recognized and idealized a man could be an open
homosexual lover and yet like epaminondas be a great and honored
citizen of his country there was no reason whatever why a man who in
mental and physical constitution was perfectly normal should not adopt a
custom that was regarded as respectable and sometimes as even specially
honorable but it is quite otherwise today in a country like england or
the united states103 in these countries all our traditions and all our
moral ideals as well as the law are energetically opposed to every
manifestation of homosexual passion it requires a very strong impetus to
go against this compact social force which on every side constrains the
individual into the paths of heterosexual love that impetus in a
wellbred individual who leads the normal life of his fellowmen and who
feels the ordinary degree of respect for the social feeling surrounding
him can only be supplied by a fundamentalusually it is probable
inbornperversion of the sexual instinct rendering the individual
organically abnormal it is with this fundamental abnormality usually
called sexual inversion that we shall here be concerned there is no
evidence to show that homosexuality in greece was a congenital perversion
although it appears that coelius aurelianus affirms that in the opinion of
parmenides it was hereditary aristotle also in his fragment on physical
love though treating the whole matter with indulgence seems to have
distinguished abnormal congenital homosexuality from acquired homosexual
vice doubtless in a certain proportion of cases the impulse was organic
and it may well be that there was an organic and racial predisposition to
homosexuality among the greeks or at all events the dorians but the
state of social feeling however it originated induced a large proportion
of the ordinary population to adopt homosexuality as a fashion or it may
be said the environment was peculiarly favorable to the development of
latent homosexual tendencies so that any given number of homosexual
persons among the greeks would have presented a far smaller proportion of
constitutionally abnormal individuals than a like number in england
in a similar mannerthough i do not regard the analogy as
completeinfanticide or the exposition of children was practised in some
of the early greek states by parents who were completely healthy and
normal in england a married woman who destroys her child is in nearly
every case demonstrably diseased or abnormal for this reason i am unable
to see that homosexuality in ancient greecewhile of great interest as a
social and psychological problemthrows light on sexual inversion as we
know it in england or the united states
concerning the wide prevalence of sexual inversion and of homosexual
phenomena generally there can be no manner of doubt this question has
been most fully investigated in germany in berlin moll states that he
has himself seen between 600 and 700 homosexual persons and heard of some
250 to 350 others hirschfeld states that he has known over 10000
homosexual persons
there are i am informed several large cafs in berlin which are almost
exclusively patronized by inverts who come here to flirt and make
acquaintances as these cafs are frequented by male street prostitutes
pupenjunge the invert risks being blackmailed or robbed if he goes home
or to a hotel with a caf acquaintance there are also a considerable
number of homosexual kneipen small and unpretentious barrooms which
are really male brothels the inmates being sexually normal working men
and boys out of employment or in quest of a few marks as pocket money
these places are regarded by inverts as very safe as the proprietors
insist on good order and allow no extortion while the police though of
course aware of their existence never interfere homosexual cafs for
women are also found in berlin
there is some reason for believing that homosexuality is especially
prominent in germany and among germans i have elsewhere referred to the
highly emotional and sentimental traits which have frequently marked
german friendships germany is the only country in which there is a
definite and wellsupported movement for the defense and social
rehabilitation of inverts the study of sexual inversion began in germany
and the scientific and literary publications dealing with homosexuality
issued from the german press probably surpass in quantity and importance
those issued from all other countries put together the homosexual
tendencies of germans outside germany have been noted in various
countries among my english cases i have found that a strain of german
blood occurs much more frequently than we are entitled to expect parisian
prostitutes are said to be aware of the homosexual tastes of germans it
is significant that as a german invert familiar with turkey informed
ncke at constantinople the procurers who naturally supply girls as
well as youths regard germans and austrians as more tending to
homosexuality than the foreigners from any other land germans usually
deny however that there is any special german proclivity to inversion
and it would not appear that such statistics as are available though all
such statistics cannot be regarded as more than approximations show any
pronounced predominance of inversion among germans it is to hirschfeld
that we owe the chief attempt to gain some notion of the percentage of
homosexual persons among the general population104 it may be said to
vary in different regions and more especially in different occupations
from 1 to 10 per cent but the average when the individuals belonging to a
large number of groups are combined is generally found to be rather over 2
per cent so that there are about a million and a half inverted persons in
germany105 this would be a minimum which can scarcely fail to be below
the actual proportion as no one can be certain that he is acquainted with
the real proclivities of all the persons comprising a larger group of
acquaintances106 it is not found in the estimates which have reached
hirschfeld that the french groups show a smaller proportion of homosexual
persons than the german groups and a japanese group comes out near to
the general average for the whole various authorities especially
germans believe that homosexuality is just as common in france as in
germany107 saintpaul dr laupts on the other hand is unable to
accept this view as an army surgeon who has long served in africa he can
as also rebierre in his joyeux et demifous bear witness to the
frequency of homosexuality among the african battalions of the french
army especially in the cavalry less so in the infantry in the french
army generally he finds it rare as also in the general population108
ncke is also inclined to believe that homosexuality is rarer in celtic
lands and in the latin countries generally than in teutonic and slavonic
lands and believes that it may be a question of race109 the question
is still undecided it is possible that the undoubted fact that
homosexuality is less conspicuous in france and the other latin countries
than in teutonic lands may be due not to the occurrence of a smaller
proportion of congenital inverts in the former lands but mainly to
general difference in temperament and in the social reaction110 the
french idealize and emphasize the place of women to a much greater degree
than the germans while at the same time inverts in france have much less
occasion than in germany to proclaim their legal grievances apart from
such considerations as these it seems very doubtful whether inborn
inversion is in any considerable degree rarer in france than in germany
as to the frequency of homosexuality in england111 and the united
states there is much evidence in england its manifestations are well
marked for those whose eyes have once been opened the manifestations are
of the same character as those in germany modified by social and national
differences and especially by the greater reserve puritanism and
prudery of england112 in the united states these same influences exert
a still greater effect in restraining the outward manifestations of
homosexuality hirschfeld though so acute and experienced in the
investigation of homosexuality states that when visiting philadelphia and
boston he could scarcely detect any evidence of homosexuality though he
was afterward assured by those acquainted with local conditions that its
extension in both cities is colossal there have been numerous criminal
cases and scandals in the united states in which homosexuality has come to
the surface and the very frequently occurring cases of transvestism or
crossdressing in the states seem to be in a large proportion associated
with homosexuality
in the opinion of some english homosexuality has become much more
conspicuous during recent years and this is sometimes attributed to the
oscar wilde case no doubt the celebrity of oscar wilde and the universal
publicity given to the facts of the case by the newspapers may have
brought conviction of their perversion to many inverts who were before
only vaguely conscious of their abnormality and paradoxical though it
may seem have imparted greater courage to others but it can scarcely
have sufficed to increase the number of inverts rather one may say the
development of urban life renders easier the exhibition and satisfaction
of this as of all other forms of perversion regarding the proportion of
inverts among the general population it is very difficult to speak
positively the invert himself is a misleading guide because he has formed
round himself a special coterie of homosexual persons and moreover he
is sometimes apt to overestimate the number of inverts through the
misinterpretation of small indications that are not always conclusive
the estimate of the ordinary normal person feeling the ordinary disgust
toward abnormal phenomena is also misleading because his homosexual
acquaintances are careful not to inform him concerning their proclivities
a writer who has studied the phenomena of homosexuality is apt to be
misguided in the same way as the invert himself and to overestimate the
prevalence of the perversion striving to put aside this source of
fallacy and only considering those individuals with whom i have been
brought in contact by the ordinary circumstances of life and with whose
modes of feeling i am acquainted i am still led to the conclusion that
the proportion is considerable among the professional and most cultured
element of the middle class in england there must be a distinct
percentage of inverts which may sometimes be as much as 5 per cent
though such estimates must always be hazardous among women of the same
class the percentage seems to be at least double though here the
phenomena are less definite and deepseated this seems to be a moderate
estimate for this class which includes however it must be remembered a
considerable proportion of individuals who are somewhat abnormal in other
respects as we descend the scale the phenomena are doubtless less common
though when we reach the working class we come to that comparative
indifference to which allusion has already been made taken altogether we
may probably conclude that the proportion of inverts is the same as in
other related and neighboring lands that is to say slightly over 2 per
cent that would give the homosexual population of great britain as
somewhere about a million

am informed by a medical correspondent in the united states that inversion
is extremely prevalent among american negroes i have good reason to
believe he writes that it is far more prevalent among them than among
the white people of any nation if inversion is to be regarded as a
penalty of civilization this is remarkable perhaps however the negro
relatively to his capacity is more highly civilized than we are at any
rate his civilization has been thrust upon him and not acquired through
the long throes of evolution colored inverts desire white men as a rule
but are not averse to men of their own race i believe that 10 per cent
of negroes in the united states are sexually inverted

50 hirschfeld and others have pointed out very truly that inverts are
less prone than normal persons to regard caste and social position this

emotional attitude that is to say of those rare souls of whom it may be

75 in early teutonic days there was little or no trace of any punishment
for homosexual practices in germany this according to hermann michalis
only appeared after the church had gained power among the west goths in
the breviarium of alaric ii 506 the sodomist was condemned to the
stake and later in the seventh century by an edict of king
chindasvinds to castration the frankish capitularies of charlemanges
time adopted ecclesiastical penances in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries death by fire was ordained and the punishments enacted by the
german codes tended to become much more ferocious than that edicted by the
justinian code on which they were modelled

topics was merely due to a search for novelty that it was for the most
part but an amusement and had little serious or personal in it those
readers of barnfield however who are acquainted with homosexual
literature will scarcely fail to recognize a personal preoccupation in his
poems this is also the opinion of moll in his berhmte homosexuelle

87 as raffalovich acutely points out the twentieth sonnet with its
reference to the one thing to my purpose nothing is alone enough to
show that shakespeare was not a genuine invert as then he would have
found the virility of the loved object beautiful his sonnets may fairly
be compared to the in memoriam of tennyson whom it is impossible to
describe as inverted though in his youth he cherished an ardent
friendship for another youth such as was also felt in youth by montaigne
88 a scene in vanbrughs relapse and the chapter ch li in
smolletts roderick random describing lord strutwell may also be
mentioned as evidencing familiarity with inversion in our country said

will become in a short time a more fashionable vice than simple
fornication

95 it is as such that whitman should be approached and i would desire
to protest against the tendency now marked in many quarters to treat him
merely as an invert and to vilify him or glorify him accordingly however
important inversion may be as a psychological key to whitmans
personality it plays but a small part in whitmans work and for many who
care for that work a negligible part i may be allowed to refer to my own
essay on whitman in the new spirit written nearly thirty years ago
96 i may add that symonds in his book on whitman accepted this letter
as a candid and final statement showing that whitman was absolutely
hostile to sexual inversion that he had not even taken its phenomena into
account and that he had omitted to perceive that there are inevitable
points of contact between sexual inversion and his doctrine of
friendship he recalls however whitmans own lines at the end of
calamus in the camden edition of 1876
    here my last words and the most baffling
    here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongestlasting
    here i shade down and hide my thoughtsi do not expose them
    and yet they expose me more than all my other poems
97 whitmans letters to peter doyle an uncultured young tramconductor
deeply loved by the poet have been edited by dr bucke and published at
boston calamus a series of letters 1897
98 whitman acknowledged however as in the letter to symonds already
referred to that he had had six children they appear to have been born
in the earlier part of his life when he lived in the south see a chapter
on walt whitmans children in edward carpenters interesting book days
with walt whitman 1906 yet his brother george whitman said i never
knew walt to fall in love with young girls or even to show them marked
attention and doyle who knew him intimately during ten years of late
life said women in that sense never came into his head the early
heterosexual relationship seems to have been an exception in his life
with regard to the number of children i am informed that in the opinion
of a lady who knew whitman in the south there can be no reasonable doubt
as to the existence of one child but that when enumerating six he
possibly included grandchildren
99 while the homosexual strain in walt whitman has been more or less
definitely admitted by various writers the most vigorous attempts to
present the homosexual character of his personality and work are due to
eduard bertz in germany and to dr wc rivers in england bertz has
issued three publications on whitman see especially his der
yankeeheiland 1906 and whitmanmysterien 1907 the arguments of
rivers are concisely stated in a pamphlet entitled walt whitmans
anomaly london george allen 1913 both bertz and rivers emphasize the
feminine traits in whitman an interesting independent picture of whitman
at about the date of the letter to symonds accompanied by the authors
excellent original photographs is furnished by dr john johnston a
visit to walt whitman 1898 it may be added that probably both the
extent and the significance of the feminine traits in whitman have been
overestimated by some writers most artists and men of genius have some
feminine traits they do not prove the existence of inversion nor does
their absence disprove it dr clark bell writes to me in reference to the
little book by dr rivers i knew walt whitman personally to me mr
whitman was one of the most robust and virile of men extraordinarily so
he was from my standpoint not feminine at all but physically masculine
and robust the difficulty is that a virile and strong man who is poetic
in temperament ardent and tender may have phases and moods of passion
and emotion which are apt to be misinterpreted a somewhat similar view
in opposition to bertz and rivers has been vigorously set forth by
bazalgette who has written a very thorough study of whitman in french
especially in the mercure de france for 1st july 1st oct and 15th
nov 1913
100 lepelletier in what may be regarded as the official biography of
verlaine paul verlaine 1907 seeks to minimize or explain away the
homosexual aspect of the poets life so also berrichon rimbauds
brotherinlaw mercure de france 16 july 1911 and 1 feb 1912 p
escoube in a judicious essay included in prfrences 1913 presents
a more reasonable view of this aspect of verlaines temperament even
apart altogether from the evidence as to the poets tendency to passionate
friendship there can be no appeal from the poems themselves which
clearly possess an absolute and unquestionable sincerity
101 sir richard burton who helped to popularize this view regarded the
phenomenon as geographical and climatic not racial and held that
within what he called the sotadic zone the vice is popular and endemic
held at the worst to be a mere peccadillo while the races to the north
and south of the limits here defined practice it only sporadically amid
the opprobrium of their fellows who as a rule are physically incapable
of performing the operation and look upon it with the liveliest disgust
he adds the only physical cause for the practice which suggests itself
to me and that must be owned to be purely conjectural is that within the
sotadic zone there is a blending of the masculine and feminine
temperaments a crasis which elsewhere only occurs sporadically arabian
nights 1885 vol x pp 205254 the theory of the sotadic zone fails
to account for the custom among the normans celts scythians bulgars
and tartars and moreover in various of these regions different views
have prevailed at different periods burton was wholly unacquainted with
the psychological investigations into sexual inversion which had indeed
scarcely begun in his day
102 spectator anthropophyteia vol vii 1910 referring especially
to the neighborhood of sorrento states that the southern italians regard
passive pedicatio as disgraceful but attach little or no shame to
active pedicatio this indifference enables them to exploit the
homosexual foreigners who are specially attracted to southern italy in the
development of a flourishing homosexual industry
103 it is true that in the solitude of great modern cities it is
possible for small homosexual coteries to form in a certain sense an
environment of their own favorable to their abnormality yet this fact
hardly modifies the general statement made in the text
104 see especially hirschfeld die homosexualitt chs xxiv and xxv
105 ulrichs in his argonauticus in 1869 estimated the number as
only 25000 but admitted that this was probably a decided underestimate
bloch die prostitution bd i p 792 has found reason to believe that
in cologne in the fifteenth century the percentage was nearly as high as
hirschfeld finds it today a few years earlier bloch had believed
beitrge part i p 215 1902 that hirschfelds estimate of 2 per
cent was sheer nonsense
106 hirschfeld mentions the case of two men artists one of them
married who were intimate friends for a great many years before each
discovered that the other was an invert

110 it is a fact significant of the french attitude toward homosexuality
that the psychologist dr saintpaul when writing a book on this
subject though in a completely normal and correct manner thought it
desirable to adopt a pseudonym

nature concerning homosexuality in england will be found in eugen dhren

themselves outside england paris florence nice naples cairo and
other places are said to swarm with homosexual englishmen
chapter ii
the study of sexual inversion
westphalhsslicasperulrichskrafftebingmollfrkiernan
lydstonraffalovichedward carpenterhirschfeld
westphal an eminent professor of psychiatry at berlin may be said to be
the first to put the study of sexual inversion on an assured scientific
basis in 1870 he published in the archiv fr psychiatrie of which he
was for many years editor the detailed history of a young woman who from
her earliest years differed from other girls she liked to dress as a
boy only cared for boys games and as she grew up was sexually attracted
only to women with whom she formed a series of tender relationships in
which the friends obtained sexual gratification by mutual caresses while
she blushed and was shy in the presence of women more especially the girl
with whom she chanced to be in love she was always absolutely indifferent
in the presence of men westphala pupil it may be noted of griesinger
who had already called attention to the high character sometimes shown by
subjects of this perversioncombined keen scientific insight with a rare
degree of personal sympathy for those who came under his care and it was
this combination of qualities which enabled him to grasp the true nature
of a case such as this which by most medical men at that time would have
been hastily dismissed as a vulgar instance of vice or insanity westphal
perceived that this abnormality was congenital not acquired so that it
could not be termed vice and while he insisted on the presence of
neurotic elements his observations showed the absence of anything that
could legitimately be termed insanity he gave to this condition the name
of contrary sexual feeling kontrre sexualempfindung by which it
was long usually known in germany the way was thus made clear for the
rapid progress of our knowledge of this abnormality new cases were
published in quick succession at first exclusively in germany and more
especially in westphals archiv but soon in other countries also
chiefly italy and france113
while westphal was the first to place the study of sexual inversion on a
progressive footing many persons had previously obtained glimpses into
the subject thus in 1791 two cases were published114 of men who
showed a typical emotional attraction to their own sex though it was not
quite clearly made out that the inversion was congenital in 1836 again
a swiss writer heinrich hssli published a rather diffuse but remarkable
work entitled eros which contained much material of a literary
character bearing on this matter he seems to have been moved to write
this book by a trial which had excited considerable attention at that
time a man of good position had suddenly murdered a youth and was
executed for the crime which according to hssli was due to homosexual
love and jealousy hssli was not a trained scholar he was in business at
glarus as a skillful milliner the most successful in the town his own
temperament is supposed to have been bisexual his book was prohibited by
the local authorities and at a later period the entire remaining stock was
destroyed in a fire so that its circulation was very small it is now
however regarded by some as the first serious attempt to deal with the
problem of homosexuality since platos banquet115
some years later in 1852 casper the chief medicolegal authority of his
time in germanyfor it is in germany that the foundations of the study
of sexual inversion have been laidpointed out in caspers
vierteljahrsschrift that pederasty in a broad sense of the word was
sometimes a kind of moral hermaphroditism due to a congenital psychic
condition and also that it by no means necessarily involved sodomy
immissio penis in anum casper brought forward a considerable amount
of valuable evidence concerning these cardinal points which he was the
first to note116 but he failed to realize the full significance of his
observations and they had no immediate influence though tardieu in
1858 admitted a congenital element in some pederasts
the man however who more than anyone else brought to light the phenomena
of sexual inversion had not been concerned either with the medical or the
criminal aspects of the matter karl heinrich ulrichs born in 1825 near
aurich who for many years expounded and defended homosexual love and
whose views are said to have had some influence in drawing westphals
attention to the matter was a hanoverian legal official amtsassessor
himself sexually inverted from 1864 onward at first under the name of
numa numantius and subsequently under his own name ulrichs published
in various parts of germany a long series of works dealing with this
question and made various attempts to obtain a revision of the legal
position of the sexual invert in germany
although not a writer whose psychological views can carry much scientific
weight ulrichs appears to have been a man of most brilliant ability and
his knowledge is said to have been of almost universal extent he was not
only well versed in his own special subjects of jurisprudence and
theology but in many branches of natural science as well as in
archeology he was also regarded by many as the best latinist of his time
in 1880 he left germany and settled in naples and afterward at aquila in
the abruzzi whence he issued a latin periodical he died in 1895117
john addington symonds who went to aquila in 1891 wrote ulrichs is
chrysostomos to the last degree sweet noble a true gentleman and man
of genius he must have been at one time a man of singular personal
distinction so finely cut are his features and so grand the lines of his
skull118
for many years ulrichs was alone in his efforts to gain scientific
recognition for congenital homosexuality he devised with allusion to
uranos in platos symposium the word uranian or urning ever since
frequently used for the homosexual lover while he called the normal
heterosexual lover a dioning from dione he regarded uranism or
homosexual love as a congenital abnormality by which a female soul had
become united with a male bodyanima muliebris in corpore virili
inclusaand his theoretical speculations have formed the starting point
for many similar speculations his writings are remarkable in various
respects although on account of the polemical warmth with which as one
pleading pro domo he argued his cause they had no marked influence on
scientific thought119
this privilege was reserved for westphal after he had shown the way and
thrown open his journal for their publication new cases appeared in rapid
succession in italy also ritti tamassia lombroso and others began to
study these phenomena in 1882 charcot and magnan published in the
archives de neurologie the first important study which appeared in
france concerning sexual inversion and allied sexual perversions they
regarded sexual inversion as an episode syndrome in a more fundamental
process of hereditary degeneration and compared it with such morbid
obsessions as dipsomania and kleptomania from a somewhat more
medicolegal standpoint the study of sexual inversion in france was
furthered by brouardel and still more by lacassagne whose stimulating
influence at lyons has produced fruitful results in the work of many
pupils120
of much more importance in the history of the theory of sexual inversion
was the work of richard von krafftebing born at mannheim in 1840 and
died at graz in 1902 for many years professor of psychiatry at vienna
university and one of the most distinguished alienists of his time while
active in all departments of psychiatry and author of a famous textbook
from 1877 onward he took special interest in the pathology of the sexual
impulse his psychopathia sexualis contained over two hundred histories
not only of sexual inversion but of all other forms of sexual perversion
for many years it was the only book on the subject and it long remained
the chief storehouse of facts it passed through many editions and was
translated into many languages there are two translations in english
enjoying an immense and not altogether enviable vogue
krafftebings methods were open to some objection his mind was not of a
severely critical order he poured out the new and everenlarged editions
of his book with extraordinary rapidity sometimes remodelling them he
introduced new subdivisions from time to time into his classification of
sexual perversions and although this rather finespun classification has
doubtless contributed to give precision to the subject and to advance its
scientific study it was at no time generally accepted krafftebings
great service lay in the clinical enthusiasm with which he approached the
study of sexual perversions with the firm conviction that he was
conquering a great neglected field of morbid psychology which rightly
belongs to the physician he accumulated without any false shame a vast
mass of detailed histories and his reputation induced sexually abnormal
individuals in all directions to send him their autobiographies in the
desire to benefit their fellowsufferers
it is as a clinician rather than as a psychologist that we must regard
krafftebing at the outset he considered inversion to be a functional
sign of degeneration a partial manifestation of a neuropathic and
psychopathic state which is in most cases hereditary this perverse
sexuality appears spontaneously with the developing sexual life without
external causes as the individual manifestation of an abnormal
modification of the vita sexualis and must then be regarded as
congenital or it develops as a result of special injurious influences
working on a sexuality which had at first been normal and must then be
regarded as acquired careful investigation of these socalled acquired
cases however krafftebing in the end finally believed would indicate
that the predisposition consists in a latent homosexuality or at least
bisexuality which requires for its manifestation the operation of
accidental causes in the last edition of his work krafftebing was
inclined to regard inversion as being not so much a degeneration as a
variation a simple anomaly and acknowledged that his opinion thus
approximated to that which had long been held by inverts themselves121
at the time of his death krafftebing who had begun by accepting the
view at that time prevalent among alienists that homosexuality is a sign
of degeneration thus fully adopted and set the seal of his authority on
the view already expressed alike by some scientific investigators as well
as by inverts themselves that sexual inversion is to be regarded simply
as an anomaly whatever difference of opinion there might be as to the
value of the anomaly the way was even opened for such a view as that of
freud and most of the psychoanalysts today who regard a strain of
homosexuality as normal and almost constant with a profound significance
for the psychonervous life in 1891 dr albert moll of berlin published
his work die kontrre sexualempfindung which subsequently appeared in
much enlarged and revised editions it speedily superseded all previous
books as a complete statement and judicious discussion of sexual
inversion moll was not content merely to present fresh clinical material
he attacked the problem which had now become of primary importance the
nature and causes of sexual inversion he discussed the phenomena as a
psychologist even more than as a physician bearing in mind the broader
aspects of the problem keenly critical of accepted opinions but
judiciously cautious in the statement of conclusions he cleared away
various ancient prejudices and superstitions which even krafftebing
sometimes incautiously repeated he accepted the generally received
doctrine that the sexually inverted usually belong to families in which
various nervous and mental disorders prevail but he pointed out at the
same time that it is not in all cases possible to prove that we are
concerned with individuals possessing a hereditary neurotic taint he also
rejected any minute classification of sexual inverts only recognizing
psychosexual hermaphroditism and homosexuality at the same time he cast
doubt on the existence of acquired homosexuality in a strict sense
except in occasional cases and he pointed out that even when a normal
heterosexual impulse appears at puberty and a homosexual impulse later
it may still be the former that was acquired and the latter that was
inborn
in america attention had been given to the phenomena at a fairly early
period mention may be specially made of jg kiernan and g frank
lydston both of whom put forward convenient classifications of homosexual
manifestations some thirty years ago122 more recently 1911 an
american writer under the pseudonym of xavier mayne privately printed an
extensive work entitled the intersexes a history of similisexualism as
a problem in social life popularly written and compiled from many
sources this book from a subjective and scarcely scientific standpoint
claims that homosexual relationships are natural necessary and
legitimate123
in england the first attempts to deal seriously from the modern point of
view with the problem of homosexuality came late and were either
published privately or abroad in 1883 john addington symonds privately
printed his discussion of paiderastia in ancient greece under the title
of a problem in greek ethics and in 18891890 he further wrote and in
1891 privately printed a problem of modern ethics being an enquiry into
the phenomena of sexual inversion in 1886 sir richard burton added to
his translation of the arabian nights a terminal essay on the same
subject in 1894 edward carpenter privately printed in manchester a
pamphlet entitled homogenic love in which he criticised various
psychiatric views of inversion at that time current and claimed that the
laws of homosexual love are the same as those of heterosexual love
urging however that the former possesses a special aptitude to be
exalted to a higher and more spiritual level of comradeship so fulfilling
a beneficent social function more recently 1907 edward carpenter
published a volume of papers on homosexuality and its problems under the
title of the intermediate sex and later 1914 a more special study of
the invert in early religion and in warfare intermediate types among
primitive folk
in 1896 the most comprehensive book so far written on the subject in
england was published in french by mr andr raffalovich in lacassagnes
bibliothque de criminologie uranisme et unisexualit this book
dealt chiefly with congenital inversion publishing no new cases but
revealing a wide knowledge of the matter raffalovich put forward many
just and sagacious reflections on the nature and treatment of inversion
and the attitude of society toward perverted sexuality the historical
portions of the book which are of special interest deal largely with the
remarkable prevalence of inversion in england neglected by previous
investigators raffalovich whose attitude is on the whole philosophical
rather than scientific regards congenital inversion as a large and
inevitable factor in human life but taking the catholic standpoint he
condemns all sexuality either heterosexual or homosexual and urges the
invert to restrain the physical manifestations of his instinct and to aim
at an ideal of chastity on the whole it may be said that the book is the
work of a thinker who has reached his own results in his own way and
those results bear an imprint of originality and freedom from tradition
in recent years no one has so largely contributed to place our knowledge
of sexual inversion on a broad and accurate basis as dr magnus hirschfeld
of berlin who possesses an unequalled acquaintance with the phenomena of
homosexuality in all their aspects he has studied the matter exhaustively
in germany and to some extent in other countries also he has received the
histories of a thousand inverts he is said to have met over ten thousand
homosexual persons as editor of the jahrbuch fr sexuelle
zwischenstufen which he established in 1899 and author of various
important monographsmore especially on transitional psychic and physical
stages between masculinity and femininityhirschfeld had already
contributed greatly to the progress of investigation in this field before
the appearance in 1914 of his great work die homosexualitt des mannes
und des weibes this is not only the largest but the most precise
detailed and comprehensiveeven the most condensedwork which has yet
appeared on the subject it is indeed an encyclopedia of homosexuality
for such a task hirschfeld had been prepared by many years of strenuous
activity as a physician an investigator a medicolegal expert before the
courts and his position as president of the wissenschaftlichhumanitren
komitee which is concerned with the defense of the interests of the
homosexual in germany in hirschfelds book the pathological conception
of inversion has entirely disappeared homosexuality is regarded as
primarily a biological phenomenon of universal extension and secondarily
as a social phenomenon of serious importance there is no attempt to
invent new theories the main value of hirschfelds work lies indeed in
the constant endeavor to keep close to definite facts it is this quality
which renders the book an indispensable source for all who seek
enlightened and precise information on this question
even the existence of such a treatise as this of hirschfelds is enough to
show how rapidly the study of this subject has grown a few years agofor
instance when dr paul moreau wrote his aberrations du sens
gnsiquesexual inversion was scarcely even a name it was a loathsome
and nameless vice only to be touched with a pair of tongs rapidly and
with precautions as it now presents itself it is a psychological and
medicolegal problem so full of interest that we need not fear to face it
and so full of grave social actuality that we are bound to face it

sexual inversion in men
relatively undifferentiated state of the sexual impulse in early lifethe
freudian viewhomosexuality in schoolsthe question of acquired
homosexualitylatent inversionretarded inversionbisexualitythe
question of the inverts truthfulnesshistories
when the sexual instinct first appears in early youth it is much less
specialized than normally it becomes later not only is it at the outset
less definitely directed to a specific sexual end but even the sex of its
object is sometimes uncertain124 this has always been so well
recognized that those in authority over young men have sometimes forced
women upon them to avoid the risk of possible unnatural offenses125
the institution which presents these phenomena to us in the most marked
and the most important manner is naturally the school in england
especially the public school in france where the same phenomena are
noted tarde called attention to these relationships most usually
platonic in the primitive meaning of the word which indicate a simple
indecision of frontier between friendship and love still undifferentiated
in the dawn of the awakening heart and he regretted that no one had
studied them in england we are very familiar with vague allusions to the
vices of public schools from time to time we read letters in the
newspapers denouncing public schools as hotbeds of vice and one
anonymous writer remarks that some of our public schools almost provoke
the punishment of the cities of the plain126 but these allegations are
rarely or never submitted to accurate investigation the physicians and
masters of public schools who are in a position to study the matter
usually possess no psychological training and appear to view
homosexuality with too much disgust to care to pay any careful attention
to it what knowledge they possess they keep to themselves for it is
considered to be in the interests of public schools that these things
should be hushed up when anything very scandalous occurs one or two lads
are expelled to their own grave and perhaps lifelong injury and
without benefit to those who remain whose awakening sexual life rarely
receives intelligent sympathy
    in several of the histories which follow in this chapter as well
    as in histories contained in other volumes of these studies
    details will be found concerning homosexuality as it occurs in
    english schools public or private see also the study
    autoerotism in vol i the prevalence of homosexual and
    erotic phenomena in schools varies greatly at different schools
    and at different times in the same school while in small private
    schools such phenomena may be entirely unknown as an english
    schoolboy i never myself saw or heard anything of such practices
    and in germany professor gurlitt die neue generation
    january 1909 among others testifies to similar absence of
    experience during his whole school life although there was much
    talk and joking among the boys over sexual things i have added
    some observations by a correspondent whose experiences of english
    public school life are still recent
    in the years i was a member of a public school i saw and heard
    a good deal of homosexuality though till my last two years i did
    not understand its meaning as a prefect i discussed with other
    prefects the methods of checking it and of punishing it when
    detected my own observations supported by those of others led
    me to think that the fault of the usual method of dealing with
    homosexuality in schools is that it regards all school
    homosexualists as being in one class together and has only one
    way of dealing with themthe birch for a first offense
    expulsion for a second now i think we may distinguish three
    classes of school homosexualists
    a a very small number who are probably radically inverted and
    who do not scruple to sacrifice young and innocent boys to their
    passions these and these only are a real moral danger to
    others and i believe them to be rare
    b boys of various ages who having been initiated into the
    passive part in their young days continue practices of an active
    or passive kind but only with boys already known to be
    homosexualists they draw the line at corrupting fresh victims
    this class realize more or less what they are about but cannot
    be called a danger to the morals of pure boys
    c young boys who whether in the development of their own
    physical nature or by the instruction of older boys of the class
    a find out the pleasures of masturbation or intercrural
    connection i never heard of a case of pedicatio at my school
    and only once of fellatio which was attempted on a quite young
    boy who complained to his house master and the offender was
    expelled boys in this class have probably little or no idea of
    what sexual morality means and can hardly be accused of a
    moral offense at all
    i submit that these three classes should receive quite different
    treatment expulsion may occasionally be necessary for class a
    but the few who belong to this class are usually too cunning to
    get caught it used to be notorious at school that it was almost
    always the wrong people who got dropped on i do not think a boy
    in the other two classes should ever be expelled and even when
    expulsion is unavoidable it should if possible be deferred
    till the end of the term so as to make it indistinguishable from
    an ordinary departure after all there is no reason to ruin a
    boys prospects because he is a little beast at sixteen there
    are very few hopeless incorrigibles at that age
    as regards the other two classes i should begin by giving boys
    very much fuller enlightenment on sexual subjects than is usually
    done before they go to a public school at all either a boy is
    pitchforked into the place in utter innocence and ignorance and
    yields to temptations to do things which he vaguely if at all
    realizes are wrong and that only because a puzzling sort of
    instinct tells him so or else he is given just enough
    information to whet his curiosity usually in the shape of
    warnings against certain apparently harmless bodily acts which
    he not unnaturally tries out of curiosity and finds them very
    pleasant it may be undesirable that a boy should have full
    knowledge at the time he goes to school but it is more
    undesirable that he should go with a burning curiosity or a
    total ignorance on the subject i am convinced that much might
    be done in the way of prevention if boys were told more and
    allowed to be open much of the pleasure of sexual talk among
    boys i believe to be due to the spurious interest aroused by the
    fact that it is forbidden fruit and involves risk if caught it
    seems to me that frankness is far more moral than suggestion i
    would not expurgate school editions of great authors the frank
    obscenity of parts of shakespeare is far less immoral than the
    prurient prudishness which declines to print it but numbers the
    lines in such a way that the boy can go home and look up the
    omitted passage in a complete edition with a distinct sense of
    guilt which is where the harm comes in
    it is probable that only a small proportion of homosexual boys in
    schools can properly be described as vicious a hoche
    describing homosexuality in german schools zr frage der
    forensischen beurteilung sexuellen vergehen neurologisches
    centralblatt 1896 no 2 and putting together communications
    received from various medical men regarding their own youthful
    experiences at school finds relationships of the kind very
    common usually between boys of different ages and
    schoolclasses according to one observer the feminine or
    passive part was always played by a boy of girlish form and
    complexion and the relationships were somewhat like those of
    normal lovers with kissing poems loveletters scenes of
    jealousy sometimes visits to each other in bed but without
    masturbation pederasty or other grossly physical
    manifestations from his own youthful experience hoche records
    precisely similar observations and remarks that the lovers were
    by no means recruited from the vicious elements in the school
    the elder scholars of 21 or 22 years of age formed regular
    sexual relationships with the servantgirls in the house it is
    probable that the homosexual relationships in english schools
    are as a rule not more vicious than those described by hoche
    but that the concealment in which they are wrapped leads to
    exaggeration in the course of a discussion on this matter over
    thirty years ago olim etoniensis wrote journal of
    education 1882 p 85 that on making a list of the vicious
    boys he had known at eton he found that these very boys had
    become cabinet ministers statesmen officers clergymen
    countrygentlemen etc and that they are nearly all of them
    fathers of thriving families respected and prosperous but as
    marro has remarked the question is not thus settled public
    distinction by no means necessarily implies any fine degree of
    private morality
    sometimes the manifestations thus appearing in schools or
    wherever youths are congregated together are not truly
    homosexual but exhibit a more or less brutal or even sadistic
    perversion of the immature sexual instinct this may be
    illustrated by the following narrative concerning a large london
    city warehouse a youth left my class at the age of 16 writes
    a correspondent to take up an apprenticeship in a large
    wholesale firm in g street fortunately he went on probation
    of three weeks before articling he came to me at the end of the
    first week asking me to intercede with his mother he had no
    father not to let him return he told me that almost nightly
    and especially when new fellows came the youths in his dormitory
    eleven in number would waylay him hold him down and rub his
    parts to the tune of some comic song or dancemusic the boy who
    could choose the fastest time had the privilege of performing the
    operation and most had to be the victim in turn unless new boys
    entered when they would sometimes be subjected to this for a
    week this boy having been brought up strictly was shocked
    dazed and alarmed but they stopped him from calling out and he
    dared not report it most boys entered direct on their
    apprenticeship without probation and had no chance to get out i
    procured the boys release from the place and gave the manager to
    understand what went on in such a case as this it has usually
    happened that a strong boy of brutal and perverse instincts and
    some force of character initiates proceedings which the others
    either fall into with complacency or are too weak to resist
max dessoir127 came to the conclusion that an undifferentiated sexual
feeling is normal on the average during the first years of
pubertyie from 13 to 15 in boys and from 12 to 14 in girlswhile
in later years it must be regarded as pathological he added very truly
that in this early period the sexual emotion has not become centered in
the sexual organs this latter fact is certainly far too often forgotten
by grownup persons who suspect the idealized passion of boys and girls of
a physical side which children have often no suspicion of and would view
with repulsion and horror how far the sexual instinct may be said to be
undifferentiated in early puberty as regards sex is a little doubtful it
is comparatively undifferentiated but except in rare cases it is not
absolutely undifferentiated
we have to admit however that in the opinion of the latest
physiologists of sex such as castle heape and marshall each sex
contains the latent characters of the other or recessive sex each sex is
latent in the other and each as it contains the characters of both
sexes and can transmit those of the recessive sex is latently
hermaphrodite a homosexual tendency may thus be regarded as simply the
psychical manifestation of special characters of the recessive sex
susceptible of being evolved under changed circumstances such as may
occur near puberty and associated with changed metabolism128
    william james principles of psychology vol ii p 439
    considered inversion a kind of sexual appetite of which very
    likely most men possess the germinal possibility conolly norman
    article sexual perversion tukes dictionary of psychological
    medicine also stated that the sexual passion at its first
    appearance is always indefinite and is very easily turned in a
    wrong direction and he apparently accounted for inversion by
    this fact and by the precocity of neurotics obici and
    marchesini le amicizie di collegio p 126 refer to the
    indeterminate character of the sexual feelings when they first
    begin to develop a correspondent believes that sexual feelings
    are undifferentiated in the early years about puberty but at the
    same time considers that school life is to some extent
    responsible the holidays he adds are sufficiently long to
    counteract it however provided the boy has sisters and they
    have friends the change from school fare and work to home
    naturally results in a greater surplus of nerveforce and i
    think most boys fool about with servants or their sisters
    friends moll kontrre sexualempfindung 1889 pp 6 and 356
    does not think it proved that a stage of undifferentiated sexual
    feeling always occurs although we have to recognize that it is
    of frequent occurrence in his later work 1909 das sexualleben
    des kindes english translation the sexual life of the child
    ch iv moll remains of the same opinion that a homosexual
    tendency is very frequent in normal children whose later
    development is quite normal it begins between the ages of 7 and
    10 or even at 5 and may last to 20
    in recent years freud has accepted and developed the conception
    of the homosexual strain as normal in early life thus in 1905
    in his bruchstck einer hysterieanalyse reprinted in the
    second series of sammlung kleiner schriften zur neurosenlehre
    1909 freud regards it as a wellknown fact that boys and girls
    at puberty normally show plain signs of the existence of a
    homosexual tendency under favorable circumstances this tendency
    is overcome but when a happy heterosexual love is not
    established it remains liable to reappear under the influence of
    an appropriate stimulus in the neurotic these homosexual germs
    are more highly developed i have never carried through any
    psychoanalysis of a man or a woman freud states without
    discovering a very significant homosexual tendency ferenczi
    again jahrbuch fr psychoanalytische forschungen bd iii
    1911 p 119 without reference to any physical basis of the
    impulse accepts the psychic capacity of the child to direct his
    originally objectless eroticism to one or both sexes and terms
    this disposition ambisexuality the normality of a homosexual
    element in early life may be said to be accepted by most
    psychoanalysts even of the schools that are separated from
    freud stekel would go farther and regards various psychic
    sexual anomalies as signs of a concealed bisexual tendency
    psychic impotence the admiration of men for masculine women and
    of women for feminine men various forms of fetichismthey are
    all masks of homosexuality stekel zentralblatt fr
    psychoanalyse vol ii april 1912
these schoolboy affections and passions arise to a large extent
spontaneously with the evolution of the sexual emotions though the
method of manifestation may be a matter of example or suggestion as the
sexual emotions become stronger and as the lad leaves school or college
to mix with men and women in the world the instinct usually turns into
the normal channel in which channel the instincts of the majority of boys
have been directed from the earliest appearance of puberty if not
earlier but a certain proportion remain insensitive to the influence of
women and these may be regarded as true sexual inverts some of them are
probably individuals of somewhat undeveloped sexual instincts the members
of this group are of some interest psychologically although from the
comparative quiescence of their sexual emotions they have received little
attention the following communication which i have received from a
wellaccredited source is noteworthy from this point of view
    the following facts may possibly be of interest to you though
    my statement of them is necessarily general and vague i happen
    to know intimately three cases of men whose affections have
    chiefly been directed exclusively to persons of their own sex
    the first having practised masturbation as a boy and then for
    some ten years ceased to practise it to such an extent that he
    even inhibited his erotic dreams has since recurred to it
    deliberately at about fortnightly intervals as a substitute for
    copulation for which he has never felt the least desire but
    occasionally when sleeping with a male friend he has emissions
    in the act of embracing the second is constantly and to an
    abnormal extent i should say troubled with erotic dreams and
    emissions and takes drugs by doctors advice to reduce this
    activity he has recently developed a sexual interest in women
    but for ethical and other reasons does not copulate with them of
    the third i can say little as he has not talked to me on the
    subject but i know that he has never had intercourse with women
    and has always had a natural and instinctive repulsion to the
    idea in all these i imagine the physical impulse of sex is
    less imperative than in the average man the emotional impulse
    on the other hand is very strong it has given birth to
    friendships of which i find no adequate description anywhere but
    in the dialogues of plato and beyond a certain feeling of
    strangeness at the gradual discovery of a temperament apparently
    different to that of most men it has provoked no kind of
    selfreproach or shame on the contrary the feeling has been
    rather one of elation in the consciousness of a capacity of
    affection which appears to be finer and more spiritual than that
    which commonly subsists between persons of different sexes these
    men are all of intellectual capacity above the average and one
    is actively engaged in the world where he is both respected for
    his capacity and admired for his character i mention this
    particularly because it appears to be the habit in books upon
    this subject to regard the relation in question as pathological
    and to select cases where those who are concerned in it are
    tormented with shame and remorse in the cases to which i am
    referring nothing of the kind subsists
    in all these cases a physical sexual attraction is recognized as
    the basis of the relation but as a matter of feeling and partly
    also of theory the ascetic ideal is adopted
    these are the only cases with which i am personally and
    intimately acquainted but no one can have passed through a
    publicschool and college life without constantly observing
    indications of the phenomenon in question it is clear to me that
    in a large number of instances there is no fixed line between
    what is called distinctively friendship and love and it is
    probably the influence of custom and public opinion that in most
    cases finally specializes the physical passion in the direction
    of the opposite sex
the classification of the varieties of homosexuality is a matter of
difficulty and no classification is very fundamental the early attempts
of krafftebing and others at elaborate classification are no longer
acceptable even the most elementary groupings become doubtful when we
have definitely to fit our cases into them the old distinction between
congenital and acquired homosexuality has ceased to possess significance
when we have recognized that there is a tendency for homosexuality to
arise in persons of usually normal tendency who are placed under
conditions as on board ship or in prison where the exercise of normal
sexuality is impossible there is little further classification to be
achieved along this line129 we have gone as far as is necessary by
admitting a general undefined homosexualitya relationship of
unspecified nature to persons of the same sexin addition to the more
specific sexual inversion130
it may now be said to be recognized by all authorities even by freud who
emphasizes a special psychological mechanism by which homosexuality may
become established that a congenital predisposition as well as an
acquired tendency is necessary to constitute true inversion apparent
exceptions being too few to carry much weight krafftebing ncke iwan
bloch who at one time believed in the possibility of acquired inversion
all finally abandoned that view and even schrencknotzing a vigorous
champion of the doctrine of acquired inversion twenty years ago admits
the necessity of a favoring predisposition an admission which renders the
distinction between innate and acquired an unimportant if not a merely
verbal distinction131 supposing indeed that we are prepared to admit
that true inversion may be purely acquired the decision in any particular
case must be extremely difficult and i have found very few cases which
even with imperfect knowledge could fairly so be termed
even the cases to which schopenhauer long since referred in which
inversion is only established late in life are no longer regarded as
constituting a difficulty in accepting the doctrine of the congenital
nature of inversion in such cases the inversion is merely retarded the
conception of retarded inversionthat is to say a latent congenital
inversion becoming manifest at a late period in lifewas first brought
forward by thoinot in 1898 in his attentats aux moeurs in order to
supersede the unsatisfactory conception as he considered it to be of
acquired inversion thoinot regarded retarded inversion as relatively rare
and of no great importance but more accessible to therapeutic measures
three years later krafftebing toward the close of his life adopted the
same conception the cases to which he applied it were all he considered
of bisexual disposition and usually also marked by sexual hyperesthesia
this way of looking at the matter was speedily championed by ncke and may
now be said to be widely accepted132
moll earlier than thoinot had pointed out that it is difficult to
believe that homosexuality in late life can ever be produced without at
least some inborn weakness of the heterosexual impulse and that we must
not deny the possibility of heredity even when homosexuality appears at
the age of 50 or 60133
    moll believes it is very doubtful whether heterosexual satiety
    alone can ever suffice to produce homosexuality ncke was
    careful to set aside the cases to which much significance was
    once attached in which old men with failing sexual powers or
    younger men exhausted by heterosexual debauchery are attracted
    to boys in such cases which include the majority of those
    appearing late ncke regarded the inversion as merely spurious
    the faute de mieux of persons no longer apt for normal sexual
    activity
    such cases no doubt need more careful psychological study than
    they usually receive fr once investigated a case of this kind
    in which a healthy young man though with slightly neurotic
    heredity on one side practised sexual intercourse excessively
    between the ages of 20 and 23often impelled more by amour
    propre or what adler would term the masculine protest of the
    organically inferior than sexual desireand then suddenly
    became impotent at the same time losing all desire but without
    any other loss of health six months later potency slowly
    returned though never to the same extent and he married at the
    age of 35 symptoms of locomotor ataxia began to appear and some
    years later he again became impotent but without losing sexual
    desire suddenly one day on sitting in close contact with a
    young man at a table dhte he experienced a violent erection
    he afterward found that the same thing occurred with other young
    men and though he had no psychic desire for men he was
    constrained to seek such contact and a repugnance for women and
    their sexuality arose five months later a complete paraplegic
    impotence set in and then both the homosexual tendency and the
    aversion to women disappeared fr linstinct sexuel p
    184 in such a case under the influence of disease excessive
    stimulation seems to result in more or less complete sexual
    anesthesia just as temporarily we may be more or less blinded by
    excess of light and functional power reasserts itself under the
    influence of a different and normally much weaker stimulus
    leppmann who has studied the homosexual manifestations of
    previously normal old men toward boys greisenalter und
    kriminalitt zeitschrift fr psychotherapie bd i heft 4
    1909 considers the chief factor to be a flaring up of the
    sexual impulse in a perverted direction in an early stage of
    morbid cerebral disturbance not amounting to insanity and not
    involving complete irresponsibility in such cases leppmann
    believes the subject may through his lack of power be brought
    back to the beginning of his sexual life and to the perhaps
    unconsciously homosexual attractions of that age
with the recognition that homosexuality in youth may be due to an as yet
undifferentiated sexual impulse homosexuality in mature age to a retarded
development on a congenital basis and homosexuality in sold age to a
return to the attitude of youth the area of spurious or pseudo
homosexuality seems to me to be very much restricted most perhaps all
authorities still accept the reality of this spurious homosexuality in
heterosexual persons but they enter into no details concerning it and
they bring forward no minutely observed cases in which it occurred
hirschfeld in discussing the diagnosis of homosexuality and seeking to
distinguish genuine from spurious inverts134 enumerates three classes
of the latter 1 those who practise homosexuality for purposes of gain
more especially male prostitutes and blackmailers 2 persons who from
motives of pity good nature friendship etc allow themselves to be the
objects of homosexual desire 3 normal persons who when excluded from
the society of the opposite sex as in schools barracks on board ship
or in prison have sexual relations with persons of their own sex now
hirschfeld clearly realizes that the mere sexual act is no proof of the
direction of the sexual impulse it may be rendered possible by mechanical
irritation as by the stimulation of a full bladder and in women without
any stimulation at all such cases can have little psychological
significance moreover he seems to admit that some subdivisions of his
first class are true inverts he further mentions that some 75 per cent
of the individuals included in these classes are between 15 and 25 years
of age that is to say that they have scarcely emerged from the period
when we have reason to believe that in a large number of individuals at
all events the sexual impulse is not yet definitely differentiated so
that neither its homosexual nor its heterosexual tendencies can properly
be regarded as spurious
if indeed we really accept the very reasonable view that the basis of
the sexual life is bisexual although its direction may be definitely
fixed in a heterosexual or homosexual direction at a very early period in
life it becomes difficult to see how we can any longer speak with
certainty of a definitely spurious class of homosexual persons everyone
of hirschfelds three classes may well contain a majority of genuinely
homosexual or bisexual persons the prostitutes and even the blackmailers
are certainly genuine inverts in very many cases those persons again
who allow themselves to be the recipients of homosexual attentions may
well possess traces of homosexual feeling and are undoubtedly in very
many cases lacking in vigorous heterosexual impulse finally the persons
who turn to their own sex when forcibly excluded from the society of the
opposite sex can by no means be assumed without question to be normal
heterosexual persons it is only a small proportion of heterosexual
persons who experience these impulses under such conditions there are
always others who under the same conditions remain emotionally attracted
to the opposite sex and sexually indifferent to their own sex there is
evidently a difference and that difference may most reasonably be
supposed to be in the existence of a trace of homosexual feeling which is
called into activity under the abnormal conditions and subsides when the
stronger heterosexual impulse can again be gratified
the real distinction would seem therefore to be between a homosexual
impulse so strong that it subsists even in the presence of the
heterosexual object and a homosexual impulse so weak that it is eclipsed
by the presence of the heterosexual object we could not however
properly speak of the latter as any more spurious or pseudo than the
former a heterosexual person who experiences a homosexual impulse in the
absence of any homosexual disposition is not today easy to accept we can
certainly accept the possibility of a mechanical or other nonsexual
stimulus leading to a sexual act contrary to the individuals disposition
but usually it is somewhat difficult to prove and when proved it has
little psychological significance or importance we may expect therefore
to find pseudohomosexuality or spurious homosexuality playing a
dwindling part in classification
the simplest of all possible classifications and that which i adopted in
the earlier editions of the present study merely seeks to distinguish
between those who not being exclusively attracted to the opposite sex
are exclusively attracted to the same sex and those who are attracted to
both sexes the first are the homosexual whether or not the attraction
springs from genuine inversion the second are the bisexual or as they
were formerly more often termed following krafftebing psychosexual
hermaphrodites135 there would thus seem to be a broad and simple
grouping of all sexually functioning persons into three comprehensive
divisions the heterosexual the bisexual and the homosexual
even this elementary classification seems however of no great practical
use the bisexual group is found to introduce uncertainty and doubt not
only a large proportion of persons who may fairly be considered normally
heterosexual have at some time in their lives experienced a feeling which
may be termed sexual toward individuals of their own sex but a very large
proportion of persons who are definitely and markedly homosexual are found
to have experienced sexual attraction toward and have had relationships
with persons of the opposite sex the social pressure urging all persons
into the normal sexual channel suffices to develop such slight germs of
heterosexuality as homosexual persons may possess and so to render them
bisexual in the majority of adult bisexual persons it would seem that the
homosexual tendency is stronger and more organic than the heterosexual
tendency bisexuality would thus in a large number of cases be comparable
to ambidexterity which biervliet has found to occur most usually in
people who are organically lefthanded136 while therefore the division
into heterosexual bisexual and homosexual is a useful superficial
division it is scarcely a scientific classification
in the face of these various considerations and in view of the fact that
while i feel justified in regarding the histories of my cases as reliable
so far as they go i have not been always able to explore them
extensively it has seemed best to me to attempt no classification at all
the order in which the following histories appear is not therefore to be
regarded as possessing any significance
    it may be proper at this point to say a few words as to the
    reliability of the statements furnished by homosexual persons
    this has sometimes been called in question many years ago we
    used to be told that inverts are such lying and deceitful
    degenerates that it was impossible to place reliance on anything
    they said it was also usual to say that when they wrote
    autobiographical accounts of themselves they merely sought to
    mold them in the fashion of those published by krafftebing more
    recently the psychoanalysts have made a more radical attack on
    all histories not obtained by their own methods as being quite
    unreliable even when put forth in good faith in part because
    the subject withholds much that he either regards as too trivial
    or too unpleasant to bring forward and in part because he cannot
    draw on that unconscious field within himself wherein it is
    held the most significant facts in his own sexual history are
    concealed thus sadger ueber den wert der autobiographien
    sexuell perverser fortschritte der medizin nos 2628 1913
    vigorously puts forward this view and asserts that the
    autobiographies of inverts are worthless although his assertions
    are somewhat discounted by the fact that they accompany an
    autobiography written in the usual manner to which he
    attributes much value
    the objection to homosexual autobiographic statements dates from
    a period when the homosexual were very little known and it was
    supposed that their moral character generally was fairly
    represented by a small section among them which attracted more
    attention than the rest by reason of discreditable conduct but
    in reality as we now know there are all sorts of people with
    all varieties of moral character to be found among inverts just
    as among normal people sadger archiv fr
    kriminalanthropologie 1913 p 199 complains of the great
    insincerity of inverts in not acknowledging their inversion
    but as sadger himself admits we cannot be surprised at this so
    long as inversion is counted a crime the most normal persons
    under similar conditions would be similarly insincere if the
    homosexual differ in any respect under this aspect from the
    heterosexual it is by exhibiting a more frequent tendency to be
    slightly neuropathic nervously sensitive and femininely
    emotional these tendencies while on the one hand they are
    liable to induce a very easily detectable vanity may also lead
    to an unusual selfsubordination to veracity on the whole it
    may be said in my own experience that the best histories
    written by the homosexual compare favorably for frankness
    intelligence and power of selfanalysis with those written by
    the heterosexual
    the ancient allegation that inverts have written their own
    histories on the model or under the suggestion of those
    published in krafftebings psychopathia sexualis can scarcely
    have much force now that the published histories are so extremely
    varied and numerous that they cannot possibly produce any uniform
    impression on the most sensitively receptive mind as a matter of
    fact there is no doubt that inverts have frequently been
    stimulated to set down the narrative of their own experiences
    through reading those written by others but the stimulation has
    as often as not lain in the fact that their own experiences have
    seemed different not that they have seemed identical the
    histories that they read only serve as models in the sense that
    they indicate the points on which information is desired i have
    often been able to verify this influence which would in any case
    seem to be fairly obvious
    psychoanalysis is in theory an ideal method of exploring many
    psychic conditions such as hysteria and obsessions which are
    obscure and largely concealed beneath the psychic surface in
    most homosexual cases the main facts are with the patients
    goodwill and the investigators tact not difficult to
    ascertain any difficulties which psychoanalysis may help to
    elucidate mainly concern the early history of the case in
    childhood and regarding these psychoanalysis may sometimes
    raise questions which it cannot definitely settle
    psychoanalysis reveals an immense mass of small details any of
    which may or may not possess significance and in determining
    which are significant the individuality of the psychoanalyst
    cannot fail to come into play he will necessarily tend to
    arrange them according to a system if for instance he regards
    infantile incestuous emotions or early narcissism as an essential
    feature of the mechanism of homosexuality a conscientious
    investigator will not rest until he has discovered traces of
    them as he very probably will see eg sadger fragment der
    psychoanalyse eines homosexuellen jahrbuch fr sexuelle
    zwischenstufen bd ix 1908 and cf hirschfeld die
    homosexualitt p 164 but the exact weight and significance
    of these traces may still be doubtful and even if considerable
    in one case may be inconsiderable in another freud who sets
    forth one type of homosexual mechanism admits that there may be
    others moreover it must be added that the psychoanalytic method
    by no means excludes unconscious deception by the subject as
    freud found and so was compelled to admit the patients tendency
    to fantasy as adler has to fictions as a fundamental
    psychic tendency of the unconscious
    the force of these considerations is now beginning to be
    generally recognized thus moll art homosexualitt in 4th
    ed of eulenburgs realencyclopdie der gesamten heilkunde
    1909 p 611 rightly says that while the invert may occasionally
    embroider his story the expert can usually distinguish between
    the truth and the poetry though it is unnecessary to add that
    complete confidence on the patients part is necessary ncke
    again sexualprobleme september 1911 p 619 after quoting
    with approval the remark of one of the chief german authorities
    dr numa praetorius that a great number of inverts histories
    are at the least as trustworthy as the attempts of
    psychoanalysts especially when they come from persons skillful
    in selfanalysis adds that even freudian analysis gives no
    absolute guarantee for truth a healthy skepticism is
    justifiablebut not an unhealthy skepticism hirschfeld also
    die homosexualitt p 164 whose knowledge of such histories
    is unrivalled remarks that while we may now and then meet with a
    case of pseudologia fantastica in connection with psychic
    debility on the basis of a psychopathic constitution taken all
    in all any generalized assertion of the falsehood of inverts is
    an empty fiction and is merely a sign that the physicians who
    make it have not been able to win the trust of the men and women
    who consult them my own experience has fully convinced me of
    the truth of this statement i am assured that many of the
    inverts i have met not only possess a rare power of intellectual
    selfanalysis stimulated by the constant and inevitable contrast
    between their own feelings and those of the world around them
    but an unsparing sincerity in that selfanalysis not so very
    often attained by normal people
    the histories which follow have been obtained in various ways
    and are of varying degrees of value some are of persons whom i
    have known very well for very long periods and concerning whom i
    can speak very positively a few are from complete strangers
    whose good faith however i judge from internal evidence that i
    am able to accept two or three were written by persons
    whothough educated in one case a journalisthad never heard
    of inversion and imagined that their own homosexual feelings
    were absolutely unique in the world a fair number were written
    by persons whom i do not myself know but who are well known to
    others in whose judgment i feel confidence perhaps the largest
    number are concerned with individuals who wrote to me
    spontaneously in the first place and whom i have at intervals
    seen or heard from since in some cases during a very long
    period so that i have slowly been able to fill in their
    histories although the narratives as finally completed may
    have the air of being written down at a single sitting i have
    not admitted any narrative which i do not feel that i am
    entitled to regard as a substantially accurate statement of the
    facts although allowance must occasionally be made for the
    emotional coloring of these facts the invert sometimes
    cherishing too high an opinion and sometimes too low an opinion
    of his own personality
    history iboth parents healthy father of unusually fine
    physique he is himself a manual worker and also of
    exceptionally fine physique he is however of nervous
    temperament he is mentally bright though not highly educated a
    keen sportsman and in general a good example of an allaround
    healthy englishman
    while very affectionate his sexual desires are not strongly
    developed on the physical side and seem never to have been so
    he sometimes masturbated about the age of puberty but never
    afterward he does not appear to have wellmarked erotic dreams
    there used to be some attraction toward women though it was
    never strong at the age of 26 he was seduced by a woman and had
    connection with her once afterward he had reason to think she
    had played him false in various ways this induced the strongest
    antipathy not only to this woman but to all marriageable women
    a year after this episode homosexual feeling first became clear
    and defined he is now 33 and feels the same antipathy to women
    he hates even to speak of marriage
    there has only been one really strong attraction toward a man of
    about the same age but of different social class and somewhat a
    contrast to him both physically and mentally so far as the
    physical act is concerned this relationship is not definitely
    sexual but it is of the most intimate possible kind and the
    absence of the physical act is probably largely due to
    circumstances at the same time there is no conscious desire for
    the act for its own sake and the existing harmony and
    satisfaction are described as very complete there is no
    repulsion to the physical side and he regards the whole
    relationship as quite natural
    history iibo english aged 35 missionary abroad a brother
    is more definitely inverted bo has never had any definitely
    homosexual relationships although he has always been devoted to
    boys nor has he had any relationships with women as regards
    women he says i feel i have not the patience to try and
    understand them they are petulant and changeable etc he
    objects to being called abnormal and thinks that people like
    himself are extremely common
    i have never wanted to kiss boys he writes nor to handle
    them in any way except to put my arm around them at their studies
    and at other similar times of course with really little boys
    it is different but boys and girls under 14 seem to me much
    alike and i can love either equally well as to any sort of
    sexual connection between myself and one of my own sex i cannot
    think of it otherwise than with disgust i can imagine great
    pleasure in having connection with a woman but their natures do
    not attract me indeed my liking for my own sex seems to consist
    almost entirely in a preference for the masculine character and
    the feeling that as an object to look at the male body is
    really more beautiful than the female when any strong
    temptations to sexual passion come over me in my waking moments
    it is of women i think on the other hand i have to confess that
    after being with some lad i love for an hour or two i have
    sometimes felt my sexual organs roused but only once in my life
    have i experienced a strong desire to sleep in the same bed with
    a particular lad and even then no idea of doing anything entered
    my mind needless to say i did not sleep with him
    i never feel tempted by any girls here although i see so many
    with their bodies freely exposed and plenty of them have really
    pretty faces neither do i feel tempted to do anything improper
    with any of the boys although i frequently sit talking with one
    who has very little on but i find the constant sight of
    wellshaped bare limbs has a curious effect on the mind and comes
    before ones imagination as a picture at unlookedfor times but
    the most curious thing of all is this there are several lads
    here of whom i am very fond now when they are near me i think of
    them with only the purest and most tender feelings but sometimes
    at night when i am half asleep or when i am taking my midday
    siesta my imagination pictures one of these lads approaching a
    girl or actually lying with her and the strange thing is that i
    do not feel any desire myself to approach the girl but i feel i
    wish i were in her place and the lad was coming to me in my
    calm waking moments it disgusts and rather horrifies me to find
    myself apparently so unsexedyet such is the fact and the
    experience with only slight changes repeats itself over and
    over again it is not that i as a man wish even in imagination
    to act improperly with a boy but i feel i would like to be in
    the girls place and the strange thing is that in all these
    dreams and imaginings i can always apparently enter into the
    feelings of the woman better than into those of the man
    sometimes i fancy for a moment that perhaps reincarnation is true
    and i was a woman in my last life sometimes i fancy that when i
    was in the womb i was formed as a girl and the sexual organs
    changed just at the last moment it is a curious problem dont
    think i worry about it only at long intervals do i think of
    it the thing has its bright side boys and men seem to have
    tender feelings toward me such as one expects them to have for
    members of the opposite sex and i get into all the closer
    contact with them in consequence
    history iiifr english aged 50 belongs on both sides to
    healthy normal families of more than average ability father
    was 35 at birth and mother 27 he is the second of four
    children there was a considerable interval between the births of
    the children which were spread over twentyone years all are
    normal except fr two of them married and with families
    owing to the difference of age between the children fr who
    was three years younger than his elder brother and more than
    four years older than his sister the third child had no male
    companionship and was constantly alone with his mother being
    naturally imitative he remarks i think i acquired her tastes
    and interests and habits of thought however that may be i feel
    sure that my interests and amusements were more girlish than
    boyish by way of illustration i may mention that i have often
    been told by a friend of my mothers that on one occasion i was
    wanting a new hat and none being found of a size to fit me i
    congratulated myself that i should therefore be obliged to have a
    bonnet as regards my feminine tastes and instincts i have
    always been conscious of taking interest in questions of family
    relationships etiquette dress womens as much as or more
    than mens and other things of that kind which as a rule
    were treated with indifference or contempt in the house i take
    more notice than my sister does of the servants deficiencies and
    neglects and am much more orderly in my arrangements than she
    is
    there is nothing markedly feminine in the general appearance
    pubertal development took place at an early age long before
    fourteen with nocturnal emissions but without erotic dreams
    the testicles are well developed the penis perhaps rather below
    the average in size and the prepuce long and narrow erection
    occurs with much facility especially at night when young he
    knew nothing of masturbation but he began the habit about ten
    years ago and has practised it occasionally ever since
    although he likes the society of women to a certain extent he
    soon grows tired of it and has never had any desire to marry
    his sexual dreams never have any relation to women i am
    generally doing or saying something he remarks to some man
    whom i know when awake something which i admit i might wish to
    do or say if it were not quite out of the question on grounds of
    propriety and selfrespect
    he has however never had any intimate relationships with men
    and much that he has heard of such relationships fills him with
    horror
    what i feel about myself is he writes that i have to a
    certain extent or in some respects a feminine mind in a male
    body or i might put it that i am a combination of an immoral
    in tendency rather than in act woman and a religious man
    from time to time i have felt strong affection for young men but
    i cannot flatter myself that my affection has been reciprocated
    at the present time there is a young fellow 23 years old who
    acts as my clerk and sits in my room he is extremely
    goodlooking and of a type which is generally considered
    aristocratic but so far as i or he know he is quite of the
    lower middle class he has little to recommend him but a fine
    face and figure and there is nothing approaching to mental or
    social equality between us but i constantly feel the strongest
    desire to treat him as a man might a young girl he warmly loved
    various obvious considerations keep me from more than
    quasipaternal caresses and i feel sure he would resent very
    strongly anything more this constant repression is trying beyond
    measure to the nerves and i often feel quite ill from that
    cause having had no experiences of my own i am always anxious
    to learn anything i can of the sexual relations of other men and
    their organs but i have no curiosity whatever concerning the
    other sex my chief pleasure and source of gratification is found
    in the opportunities afforded by turkish and other baths
    wherever in fact there is the nude male to be found but i
    seldom find in these places anyone who seems to have the same
    tendency as myself and certainly i have not met with more than
    two cases among the attendants who responded to my hinted desire
    to see everything under a shampooer particularly an unfamiliar
    one i occasionally experience an orgasm but less often now than
    when i was younger
    fr is very shortsighted his favorite color is blue he is
    able to whistle his tastes are chiefly of a literary character
    and he has never had any liking for sports i have been
    generally considered ineffective in the use of my hands he
    writes and i am certainly not skillful all i have ever been
    able to do in that way is to net and do the simpler forms of
    needlework but it seems more natural to me to do or try to do
    everything of that sort and to play on the piano rather than to
    shoot or play games i may add that i am fonder of babies than
    many women and am generally considered to be surprisingly
    capable of holding them certainly i enjoy doing so as a youth
    i used to act in charades but i was too shy to do so unless i
    was dressed as a woman and veiled and when i took a womans part
    i felt less like acting than i have done in propria
    persona a remark made by an uncle once rather annoyed me that
    it seemed more like nature than art but he was quite right
    history ivof lowland scotch parentage both sides of house
    healthy and without cerebral or nervous disease homosexual
    desires began at puberty he practised onanism to a limited
    extent at school and up to the age of about 22 his erotic dreams
    are exclusively about males while very friendly and intimate
    with women of all ages he is instantly repelled by any display
    of sexual affection on their side this has happened in varying
    degree in three or four cases with regard to marriage he
    remarks as there seems no immediate danger of the race dying
    out i leave marriage to those who like it his male ideal has
    varied to some extent it has for some years tended toward a
    healthy welldeveloped athletic or outofdoor working type
    intelligent and sympathetic but not specially intellectual
    at school his sexual relations were of the simplest type since
    then there have been none this he says is not due either to
    absence of desire or presence of morals to put it shortly
    there were never the time and the place and the loved one
    together in another view physical desire and the general
    affection have not always coexisted toward the same person and
    the former without the latter is comparatively transient while
    the latter stops the gratification of the former if it is felt
    that that gratification could in any way make the object of
    affection unhappy mentally or emotionally
    he is healthy and fairly well developed of sensitive emotional
    nature but selfcontrolled mentally he is receptive and
    aggressive by turns sometimes uncritical sometimes analytical
    his temper is equable and he is strongly affectionate very fond
    of music and other arts but not highly imaginative
    of sexual inversion in the abstract he says he has no views but
    he thus sums up his moral attitude i presume that if it is
    there it is there for use or abuse as men please i condemn
    gratification of bodily desire at the expense of others in
    whatever form it may take i condemn it no more in its inverted
    form than in the ordinary i believe that affection between
    persons of the same sex even when it includes the sexual passion
    and its indulgences may lead to results as splendid as human
    nature can ever attain to in short i place it on an absolute
    equality with love as ordinarily understood
    history vsw aged 64 english musical journalist the
    communication which follows somewhat abbreviated was written
    before sw had heard or read anything about sexual inversion
    and when he still believed that his own case was absolutely
    unique
    i am the son of a clergyman and lived for the first thirteen
    years of my life in the country town where i was born then my
    father became the vicar of a country village where i lived until
    i went out into the world at the age of 18 as during the whole
    of this time my father had a few pupils i was educated with
    them and never went to school i was born i fancy with sexual
    passions about as strong as can well be imagined and at the same
    time was very precocious in my entry into the stage of puberty
    semen began to form a little before my twelfth birthday hair
    soon followed and in a year i was in that respect the equal of
    an average boy of 15 or 16 i conversed freely with my companions
    on the relations of the sexes but unlike them had no personal
    feeling toward girls in time i became conscious that i was
    different as i then believed and believe now from all other
    men my sexual organs were quite perfect but in the frame of a
    man i had the sexual mind of a female i distinctly disclaim the
    faintest inclination to perform unnatural acts the idea of
    committing sodomy would be most disgusting
    to come to my actual condition of mind while totally
    indifferent to the person of woman i always enjoyed their
    friendship and companionship and many of my best friends have
    been ladies i had a burning desire to have carnal intercourse
    with a male and had the capacity for falling in love as it is
    called to the utmost extent in imagination i possessed the
    female organ and felt toward man exactly as an amorous female
    would at the time when i became fully conscious of my condition
    i attached little importance to it i had not a notion of its
    terrible import nor of the future misery it would entail all
    that i had to learn by bitter experience
    i did once think of forcing myself to have connection with a
    prostitute in order to see whether the actual sensual enjoyment
    might bring a change and so have the power to marry but when it
    came to thinking over ways and means my repugnance to the act
    became so strong that it was quite out of the question in the
    case of any male to whom i became attached i wanted to feel
    ourselves together skin to skin and to be privileged to take
    such liberties as an amorous female would take if that were all
    permitted i sought no purely sensual gratification of any kind
    my love was far too genuine for that
    during the rather more than half a century which has elapsed
    since my twelfth birthday i have been genuinely in love about
    thirteen times i despair attempting to give an idea of the depth
    and reality of my feelings i have alluded to my precocity i was
    in love when 12 years old the object being a man of 24 a
    wellknown analytical chemist he came to my fathers house very
    frequently and my heart beat almost at the mention of his name
    the next serious time i was about 15 it was a farmers son
    about two years older i dont think that i was ever alone with
    him and really only knew him as a member of his family yet for
    a time he was my chief interest in life
    when 21 i had a chum a youth of 17 who entertained for me
    at any rate a brotherly affection we were under the same roof
    and early one summer morning he got out of bed and came direct to
    my room to talk about some matter or other in order to talk more
    comfortably he got into bed with me and we lay there just as two
    schoolgirls might have done this proximity was more than i
    could stand and my heart began to beat so that it was impossible
    that he should not notice it as of course he could not have
    the slightest notion of the reason he said in all innocence
    why how your heart beats i can hear it quite plainly
    so far my details are purely innocent up to 18 familiarities
    passed at intervals between me and the son of the village doctor
    a youth about two years older than myself and precociously
    immoral i did not really care for him much but he was my chief
    companion then i became a schoolassistant and for about six
    years managed to control myself only alas to fall again
    another resolution i kept for eight years one long fight with my
    nature again i sinned in three instances extending over three
    or four years i now come to a very painful and eventful episode
    in my unhappy life which i would gladly pass over were it
    possible it was a case in middle life of sin discovery and
    great folly in addition
    before going into details so far as may be necessary i cannot
    help asking you to consider calmly and dispassionately my exact
    condition compared with that of my fellowcreatures as a whole
    in my struggles to resist in the past i have at times felt as if
    wrestling in the folds of a python i again sinned then with a
    youth and his friend oddly enough discovery followed through a
    man who was actuated by a feeling of revenge for a strictly right
    act on my part the lads refused to state more than the truth
    and this did not satisfy the man and a third lad was
    introduced who was prepared to say anything this was not all
    some twelve or fifteen more boys made similar accusations the
    general belief in consequence was that i had committed
    nameless crimes in all directions ad lib if you were to ask
    me for an explanation of the action of all these boys beyond the
    third who of course had some special inducements i can
    offer none they may have thought that the original trio were
    regarded rather in the light of heroes why should they not
    be heroes too
    i might well feel crushed under such a load of accusations but
    that does not excuse the incredible folly of my conduct i denied
    alike the modicum of truth and the mass of lying and went off to
    america however as time passed on and my mind got into a proper
    state i felt that the truth must be told some time or other i
    accordingly wrote from america to the proper quarter a full
    confession of my sin with regard to the two youths who had told
    merely the truth at the same time pointing out the falsehood of
    all the rest of the accusations
    i remained in america six years and actually made money so
    that i could return to england with a small capital i was also
    under a promise to my three sisters all older than myself that
    i would return in their lifetime my programme was to purchase a
    small light business in london and quietly earn my living at
    the same time making my presence known to no one i did buy
    such a business got swindled in the most clever way and lost
    every farthing i possessed in the world i had to make my plight
    known to old friends who all either gave or lent me money still
    my position was a very precarious one i tried an insurance
    agency one of the last resources of the educated destitute but
    soon found out that i was unfitted for work in which impudence
    is a prime factor then an extraordinary stroke of good fortune
    took place almost simultaneously i began to get a few music
    pupils and literary work in connection with a good musical
    journal
    making my presence known to old friends involved the same
    information to those who were not friends my identity as a
    journalist became known and as time passed by it seemed to me as
    if half the world had heard of my alleged iniquities people who
    have never set eyes on me seem to regard me in the light of a
    monster of iniquity who ought not to be suffered to exist all
    these outsiders believe that i have committed nameless offenses
    times innumerable and lift up their hands in speechless horror at
    the audacity of a man who so situated dares to appear openly in
    public under his own name and look people in the face they
    have not even the brains to see that this very fearlessness
    proves the fictitious character of their beliefs next they
    believe that if only they could get my dismissal from my
    journalistic post i should be brought to starvation point this
    up to a year ago was true then an old relative died and left me
    some property which i sold to invest in an annuity and thus have
    just enough to live on quietly apart from what i may earn under
    such strange conditions it might be asked whether life was not
    unendurable frankly speaking i cannot say that i find it so i
    have in london a few bachelor friends who go with me to theaters
    etc in the suburbs i have about half a dozen family friends
    here i meet with pleasant society and a hearty welcome i am
    passionately fond of music have an excellent piano and can hear
    the best concerts in europe i go to all good plays i am a good
    chess player lastly i am an omnivorous reader you will allow
    that my resources for passing the time are not limited
    of course i am sorry that i sinned and wish that i had not
    done so but i disclaim any feeling of shame
    sw was the youngest of four children and the only boy his
    father was 40 at his birth his mother 33 the father was an
    intellectual man of weak character the mother a woman of violent
    and eccentric temper with he believes strong sexual passions
    sw knows of nothing in the family to account for his own
    abnormal condition
    he is short five feet five inches but well built with strong
    chest and a powerful voice his arms are weak and flabby
    feminine he thinks but the legs muscular as a boy of 14 he
    could walk forty miles with ease and he played football till
    near the age of 45 he is considered manly in character and
    tastes but is easily moved to tears under strong excitement
    there is no information as to the type of man to whom he is
    attracted i may observe however that the analytical chemist
    who first evoked sws admiration was well known to me some
    thirty years later as he was my own teacher in chemistry at
    that time he was an elderly man of attractive appearance and
    character sympathetic and winning in manner to an almost
    feminine extent
    sw has never felt the slightest sexual attraction toward the
    opposite sex the first indications of inverted feeling were at
    the age of 6 or 7 watching his fathers pupils boys of 13 or
    14 from the windows he speculated on what their organs of
    generation were like in connection with a girl he writes i
    should no more have thought of such a thing than in the case of a
    block of marble about this time indeed he at times slept with
    a sister of 10 who induced him to go through the form of sexual
    connection saying that it felt so funny but he merely did
    this to please her and without the slightest interest or feeling
    on his own part this attitude became more marked with increased
    knowledge until he fell ardently in love at the age of 12
    throughout life he has practised masturbation to a certain
    extent and is prepared to defend the practice in his own case
    his erotic dreams have been of only the vaguest and most shadowy
    character he is able to whistle he takes a warm interest in
    politics and in philanthropic work but his chief love is for
    music and he has published many musical compositions on the
    whole and notwithstanding the persecution he has endured he
    does not regard his life as unhappy at the same time he is
    keenly conscious of the atmosphere of pariahdom which surrounds
    inverts and in his own case this has never been alleviated by
    any sense of companionship in misery the facility with which
    some inverts are said to recognize others of their own kind is
    quite incomprehensible to him he has never to his knowledge met
    one
    history vies physician aged 50
    i have some reason he writes for believing that some of my
    relatives on the paternal side were not normal in their sexual
    life but i am sure that no such suspicion was entertained by
    their friends or associates they were very reticent people a
    great proportion of my near relatives have remained unmarried or
    deferred marriage until late in life none of them have been good
    business men all seem to have been more deeply concerned in
    other things than in makingor in keepingmoney they have
    mostly taken little or no share in public life and not cared
    much for society yet they have been folk of more than average
    ability with intellectual and sthetic interests we are prone
    to enthusiasms but lack perseverance we are discursive and
    superficial perhaps but none would call us stupid we are
    perhaps abnormally selfcentered and selfconsciousnever cruel
    or vicious our powers of selfcontrol are considerable we are
    conventional people only because we are lazy and intensely
    dislike any open selfassertion yet we are nervous rather than
    phlegmatic all that is on the fathers side my maternal
    ancestors have been concerned with farming and the sea and have
    also had a similar lack of business capacity but with less
    mental adaptiveness and alertness with more steadiness of
    purpose however always doers rather than dreamers among them i
    remember one cousin who was probably abnormal although he died
    when i was too young to notice much again they were all rather
    reserved people but more genial with strangers more socially
    inclined and with less selfcontrol
    i was an only child and a spoilt one i was always quick at
    school fond of learning and finding my lessons no trouble
    serious study i disliked but for school purposes i did not find
    it necessary and had no difficulty in carrying all before me i
    was never fond of games although very fond of being out of doors
    and of walking few of my relatives have been at all keen on
    sport i made no close friendships at school and was never very
    popular with my schoolfellows who however tolerated my odd
    ways better than might have been expected i was easily brought
    to appreciate good literature but i never had much power of
    expression or of strenuous thought i was extremely susceptible
    and impressible moved by beauty of any kind but never at all
    ambitious or in any way creative i was easily stimulated to
    work and then loved to work but unless the stimulus were
    maintained the natural indolence of my disposition asserted
    itself and i wasted my powers in dreams and trifles my memory
    was very quick and retentive in the main but curiously
    capricious i always lacked initiative and decision at college
    my successes were continued i gained medals and prizes passed
    my examinations easily and graduated with firstclass honors
    in my professional lifework i have been successful rather beyond
    the average i love it with all my heart
    i cannot speak with any confidence about the first stirrings of
    my sexual instincts but i think i can assert that they have at
    no time led me to any desire for the opposite sex it is true
    that my earliest recollection of the kind is concerned with
    intimacies with a girl playfellow but as we had at the time
    reached only the mature age of 7 at the most i fancy that our
    mutual exhibitionsfor there was nothing moresimply satisfied
    our natural curiosity certainly these memories are in my mind
    in no way set apart from the recollections of other kinds of
    play next to that i remember the usual schoolboy talk about
    things hidden and forbidden but up till i was 12 or so this was
    simply dirty talk concerned more with renal and intestinal
    functions than with any sexual feelings or understanding one boy
    was known to us all and of my not inconsiderable circle of early
    friends all grew up to be normal people who married and had
    children in due course for the unusual size of his parts and for
    the freedom with which he invited and satisfied the curiosity of
    his friends he must have been precocious for he could not have
    been more than 12 and i remember to have heard that he had a
    thick growth of pubic hair even then although i know that my
    curiosityto put it at that onlywas active i never allowed
    myself to have any dealings with him and i think i should have
    discouraged them had they been suggested to me that is the odd
    thing about my life the things i longed intensely to do i would
    not let myself do not from any religious or moral scruple but
    from some inexplicable fastidiousness or scrupulosity which is
    yet as active as ever although i am sure that it would not be
    able to hold its own could these favorable conditions be
    repeated but would be overcome by the imperious and fully grown
    desires which by long repression or by unsatisfactory
    diversion have grown to be so strong indeed given the
    opportunity and the assurance that no first seduction or
    corruption of anyone was in question they would prove quite
    irrepressible
    certainly long before pubertywhich was early with mei
    remember being greatly attracted to certain boys and wishing to
    have an opportunity of sleeping with them had i been able to do
    so i am sure i should have been impelled to get into as close
    contact with their naked body as possible and i do not think i
    should then have craved for anything more i knew some
    boysperhaps a little olderwho even then had relations which
    were certainly not innocent with a girl who was a year or two
    older than any of us she once kissed me to my intense shame
    but i felt that these relations would have been unspeakably
    disgusting and i took no particular interest in hearing about
    them i remember being fondled and caressed by a very
    goodlooking boy of 16 when i was three or four years younger and
    had sustained some hurt at play and i am still able to recall
    the thrill of delight that i experienced at his touch nothing
    took place that all the world might not have seen but i remember
    being taken between his knees as he sat and his arms being put
    around my neck and the warm soft pressure of his thighs had an
    unspeakable effect on me
    about this time too an older boy perhaps about 18 used to
    get hold of smaller boys when on country walks to throw them
    down and then look at and toy with their genitals he was
    himself a handsome boy and i was greatly excited when told about
    this by boys who had experienced it and wished greatly to have
    it done to me it never was and if it had been attempted i know
    i should have resisted with all my strength although my desires
    would have set me aflame this boy died before he was 20 with a
    psoas abscess and i remember crying myself to sleep the night i
    learned of his death another boy about three years older than
    myself who had very silky hair i used to be attracted by and i
    was always trying to stroke his hair but he always objected
    i must have been about 12 when i first was taught to masturbate
    by a cousin who was slightly older at first i thought it silly
    but i used to watch him at it and practised it myself from time
    to time until i became old enough to experience the proper
    sensation then i have reason to think i gave myself up to it
    rather freely but it was generally done in solitude although it
    was long before i realized that there was anything wrong about it
    or that it might prove hurtful looking back now i feel
    perfectly certain that my instincts were wholly homosexual from
    the very first this cousin who possessed notable intellectual
    and artistic gifts married but i feel sure his liking for his
    own sex was not normal
    with another cousin almost years my junior i was always on
    terms of the most affectionate intimacy my holidays at his
    parents house were my greatest delight we were always together
    by night or day we slept in the same bed literally in each
    others arms to me it afforded the keenest sexual pleasure to
    press close to his naked body we used mutually to handle and
    caress our parts but without any attempt at mutual masturbation
    although at that period i regularly practised it on myself i
    asked him once about it but he had not been taught it by others
    and to my great pride and satisfaction i can say that i never
    either did it to him or asked him to do it to me this i mention
    as an instance of my restraint in act although my thoughts and
    desires knew no such curb i remember also an elder brother of
    his perhaps three or four years my senior once showing me then
    about 12 i suppose his semierect penis he would not allow me
    to touch it but showed me how to draw back the foreskin so as to
    uncover the glans his penis was large and the incident was not
    forgotten we had no other relation and i know that both he and
    my own friend grew up to be quite normal men
    i think i must have been about 17 when i got frightened about
    the occurrence of nocturnal emissions which i believed were the
    evil result of masturbation and for two or three years i
    continued in considerable mental distress until when in my
    second or third year at college i summoned up courage enough to
    consult our good old family doctor who reassured me but made i
    now think too light of my confidences so that i relapsed the
    more readily although much later on into old habits
    from our windows at home we looked over a bit of common or down
    to the beach and i used to keep watch on warm summer afternoons
    over boys who might be bathing to observe them through our
    telescope all this i kept strictly secret and i was never
    surprised i might just as well and without arousing the
    slightest suspicion of my motive have walked down to the beach
    and seen them and chatted with them but this i could not have
    brought myself to do it gave me considerable sexual satisfaction
    when i was able to see them bathing without pants i also used to
    watch them at play on the common and felt rewarded when i saw
    as i not infrequently did sexual familiarities taking place
    these violently excited me and sometimes brought on orgasm
    always erection with pleasure indeed it was an experience of
    this kind that made me return to masturbation after i had given
    it up for a while i remember one day seeing two lads of about 16
    lying on the grass in the sunshine all at once the bigger lad
    put out his hand and tried to open his companions trousers he
    resisted with all his might and a long struggle ensued ending
    in the smaller lad having his penis exposed and manipulated by
    the other even at this day the recollection of this excites me
    both lads grew up to be normal men
    twice only have i been approached by grownup people when i was
    about 13 i used to meet often when going to school by train an
    old gentleman who courted me as it were used often to talk to
    me and asked me to come to see his wellknown scientific
    collections but i always had a vague distrust of him and never
    went one day in the summer during a spare hour i met him in an
    empty room in the museum where there were usually very few
    visitors at that time of day and where large showcases gave
    concealment he came up to me and told me he had been away in the
    country and that when making his way home through hedges and
    thorny bushes some of the thorns got stuck amongst his clothes
    and were still giving him uneasiness i would be very grateful
    he said if you would put your hand down and try if you can feel
    any thorns sticking in my underflannels and pull them out he
    then unbuttoned his braces on one side undid his trousers and
    made me thrust my hand over his groin and lower abdomen i
    avoided touching his genitals but he pushed my hand down in that
    direction until burning with shame i made my escape and ran
    off not stopping until i was safe in school i scarcely
    understood it but never spoke of it and avoided him ever
    afterward i learned later on that he was a welloff bachelor
    who took a great interest in working lads and young men and did
    much to help them on in life and keep them so it was said from
    falling into bad company he died at a great age and left most of
    his fortune to an institution for lads as well as large legacies
    to youths in whom he had been interested
    the other time was on top of a tramcar when a grownup man who
    was near pressed as close to me as he could began to talk
    praised my dark eyes then put his hand on my thigh under my
    loose cloak and felt up toward my parts at the same time he took
    hold of my hand caressed it and put it over his parts it was in
    the dusk this excited me and if we had not been at our
    destination i think i would gladly have permitted further
    familiarities he tried to ask me where i lived but there was no
    time to answer and the female relative who was with me on
    another seat would no doubt have prevented this from having any
    further sequel
    on more than one occasion i have experienced the sexual orgasm
    as the result of mental anxiety the first time this occurred was
    when i was hurrying to avoid being late for school another time
    was when i was about 24 and was extremely anxious to fill an
    appointment for which i was late so copious was the emission
    that i had to go home and change
    as a medical student the first reference bearing definitely on
    the subject of sexual inversion was made in the class of medical
    jurisprudence where certain sexual crimes were alluded tovery
    summarily and inadequatelybut nothing was said of the existence
    of sexual inversion as the normal condition of certain unhappy
    people nor was any distinction drawn between the various
    nonnormal acts which were all classed together as
    manifestations of the criminal depravity of ordinary or insane
    people to a student beginning to be acutely conscious that his
    sexual nature differed profoundly from that of his fellows
    nothing could be more perplexing and disturbing and it shut me
    up more completely in my reserve than ever i felt that this
    teaching must be based on some radical error or prejudice or
    misapprehension for i knew from my own very clear remembrance of
    my own development that my peculiarity was not acquired but
    inborn my great misfortune undoubtedly but not my fault
    it was still more unfortunate that in the course of the lectures
    on clinical medicine there was not the slightest allusion to the
    subject all sorts of rare diseasessome of which i have not yet
    met with in the course of twentyone years of a busy
    practicewere fully discussed but we were left entirely
    ignorant of a subject so vitally important to me personally and
    as it seems to me to the profession to which i aspired there
    might have been an incidental reference to masturbationalthough
    i do not remember itbut its real significance received no
    attention and what we students knew of it was the result of our
    reading or of our personal experiences
    in the class of mental disease there was naturally more
    detailed and systematic reference to facts in the sexual life and
    to sexual inversion as a rare pathological condition but still
    there was not a comforting word to reassure me growing ever more
    hopelessly ashamed of what it seemed was a criminal or a gravely
    morbid nature
    among all my fellowstudents i knew of no one constituted like
    myself but my natural reserveincreased of course by my
    consciousness of what i saw would be thought to be a criminal
    tendencydid not urge me to exchange of confidences or to the
    formation of close friendships
    after graduation i became a resident medical officer in the
    hospital and private assistant to one of the professorsa
    physician and teacher of worldwide reputation with him i
    associated on the most cordial and affectionate terms and often
    in the course of conversation i tried to bring him to discuss the
    subject but without success it was obviously unpleasant and
    uninteresting to him enough was said however to enable me to
    realize that he held the current ideas on the subject and i
    would not for worlds have allowed him to guess that i myself
    came under the despised and tainted category
    i have seldom heard sexual inversion discussed among my
    professional friends they speak of it with disgust or amusement
    i have never met a professional man who would consider it
    dispassionately and scientifically for them it was a subject
    entirely belonging to psychological medicine
    i have had no admitted case of it among my patients but i have
    often instinctively felt that some who consulted me about other
    matters would have taken me into their confidence about that but
    for their fear of being cruelly misunderstood
    as to my moral attitude i fear to speak grossness disgusts me
    but i am not sure that i should be able to resist temptation
    placed in my way but i am absolutely sure that i should never
    under any circumstances tempt others to any disgraceful act if
    i ever committed any sexual act with one of my own sex whom i
    loved i could not look at it or approach it in any other than a
    sacramental way this sounds blasphemous and shocking but i
    cannot otherwise express my meaning
    as regards the marriage of inverts my own feeling is that for a
    congenital invertno matter how fully the situation be explained
    beforehandit is a step fraught with too great possibilities of
    tragedy and of the deepest unhappiness to be advised at all my
    view is that for the invert far more than for the ordinary
    person there is no escape from the supreme necessity of
    selfcontrol in any relationship he may form if that be attained
    then the ideal is a relationship with another man of similar
    temperamentnot a platonic one necessarilyby means of which
    the highest happiness of both may be reached but this can occur
    very seldom
    to poetry and the fine arts i am very susceptible and i have
    given a great deal of time to this study i am devoted heart and
    soul to music which is more and more to me every year i live
    trivial or light music i cannot endure but of beethoven bach
    hndel schumann schubert brahms tschaikowsky and wagner i
    should never hear enough here too my sympathies are very
    catholic and i delight in mcdowell debussy richard strauss
    and hugo wolf
    history viimy parentage is very sound and healthy both my
    parents who belong to the professional middle class have good
    general health nor can i trace any marked abnormal or diseased
    tendency of mind or body in any records of the family
    though of a strongly nervous temperament myself and sensitive
    my health is good i am not aware of any tendency to physical
    disease in early manhood however owing i believe to the
    great emotional tension under which i lived my nervous system
    was a good deal shattered and exhausted mentally and morally my
    nature is pretty well balanced and i have never had any serious
    perturbations in these departments
    at the age of 8 or 9 and long before distinct sexual feelings
    declared themselves i felt a friendly attraction toward my own
    sex and this developed after the age of puberty into a
    passionate sense of love which however never found any
    expression for itself till i was fully 20 years of age i was a
    dayboarder at school and heard little of schooltalk on sex
    subjects was very reserved and modest besides no elder person
    or parent ever spoke to me on such matters and the passion for
    my own sex developed gradually utterly uninfluenced from the
    outside i never even during all this period and till a good
    deal later learned the practice of masturbation my own sexual
    nature was a mystery to me i found myself cut off from the
    understanding of others felt myself an outcast and with a
    highly loving and clinging temperament was intensely miserable
    i thought about my male friendssometimes boys of my own age
    sometimes elder boys and once even a masterduring the day and
    dreamed about them at night but was too convinced that i was a
    hopeless monstrosity ever to make any effectual advances later
    on it was much the same but gradually though slowly i came to
    find that there were others like myself i made a few special
    friends and at last it came to me occasionally to sleep with
    them and to satisfy my imperious need by mutual embraces and
    emissions before this happened however i was once or twice on
    the brink of despair and madness with repressed passion and
    torment
    meanwhile from the first my feeling physically toward the
    female sex was one of indifference and later on with the more
    special development of sex desires one of positive repulsion
    though having several female friends whose society i like and to
    whom i am sincerely attached the thought of marriage or
    cohabitation with any such has always been odious to me
    as a boy i was attracted in general by boys rather older than
    myself after leaving school i still fell in love in a romantic
    vein with comrades of my own standing nowat the age of
    37my ideal of love is a powerful strongly built man of my
    own age or rather youngerpreferably of the working class
    though having solid sense and character he need not be specially
    intellectual if endowed in the latter way he must not be too
    glib or refined anything effeminate in a man or anything of the
    cheap intellectual style repels me very decisively
    i have never had to do with actual pederasty so called my
    chief desire in love is bodily nearness or contact as to sleep
    naked with a naked friend the specially sexual though urgent
    enough seems a secondary matter pederasty either active or
    passive might seem in place to me with one i loved very
    devotedly and who also loved me to that degree but i think not
    otherwise i am an artist by temperament and choice fond of all
    beautiful things especially the male human form of active
    slight muscular build and sympathetic but somewhat indecisive
    character though possessing selfcontrol
    i cannot regard my sexual feelings as unnatural or abnormal
    since they have disclosed themselves so perfectly naturally and
    spontaneously within me all that i have read in books or heard
    spoken about the ordinary sexual love its intensity and passion
    lifelong devotion love at first sight etc seems to me to be
    easily matched by my own experiences in the homosexual form and
    with regard to the morality of this complex subject my feeling
    is that it is the same as should prevail in love between man and
    woman namely that no bodily satisfaction should be sought at
    the cost of another persons distress or degradation i am sure
    that this kind of love is notwithstanding the physical
    difficulties that attend it as deeply stirring and ennobling as
    the other kind if not more so and i think that for a perfect
    relationship the actual sex gratifications whatever they may be
    probably hold a less important place in this love than in the
    other
    history viiimn aged 30 my grandfather might be said to be
    of abnormal temperament for though of very humble origin he
    organized and carried out an extremely arduous mission work and
    became an accomplished linguist translating the bible into an
    eastern tongue and compiling the first dictionary of that
    language he died practically of overwork at the age of 45 he
    was twice married my father being his third son by the second
    wife i believe that two if not more of the family numbering
    seven in all were inverted and the only one of them to marry
    was my father my grandmother was the last representative of an
    old and very wild irish family she died at an advanced age of
    paralysis my father was 36 and my mother 21 at the time of their
    marriage i was born three years after and was their only child
    the marriage proved a most unhappy one they being utterly
    unsuited to each other in every way
    my fathers health during the first years of his marriage was
    very delicate and i have reason to believe that it had been
    undermined in certain ways by his life abroad i understand i was
    born with slight gonorrheal affection and as a child my health
    was very indifferent this latter may have been brought about by
    the peculiarly unhappy and unnatural life i led i had no
    companions of my own age and did not even attend any school
    until after my mothers death my father superintended my
    education up to that time and i had free access to a large and
    very varied library and a great deal of solitary leisure to
    enjoy it in there were a number of medical and scientific books
    in it which were my principal favorites and i remember deciding
    at a very early age to be a doctor when about 5 years old i
    recollect having a sexual dream connected with a railway porter
    it afforded me great pleasure to recall this dream and about
    that time i discovered a method of selfgratification there is
    not much teaching required in these matters
    i cannot say that the dream i have mentioned constituted
    absolutely the first intimation of inverted feeling but rather
    that it crystallized vague ideas which i might have already had
    on the subject i can recollect that when about between 3 and 4
    years of age a young fellow of about 20 came to our house several
    times as a visitor he was fond of children i suppose and i
    generally sat on his knee and was kissed by him this was a
    source of great pleasure to me but i cannot remember if it was
    accompanied by erection i can only recall that his attention and
    caresses made a greater impression upon me than those of women
    when about that age too i was often aroused when sleeping with my
    mother and told not to lie on my face i remember that erection
    was always present on these occasions the dream was the first of
    many of its kind and in my case they have never been accompanied
    by emission they have always been of an inverted character
    though i have occasionally had dreams about women these latter
    however have usually partaken somewhat of the nature of a
    nightmare
    up to the age of 14 i felt much perplexed and depressed by my
    views on sexual desire and was convinced that they were peculiar
    to myself this combined with the solitary condition of my
    life and about four years continued illtreatment prior to my
    mothers death she had given way to drink for that period had
    a very injurious effect on my health mental and bodily looking
    back from my present point of view i can understand and forgive
    many things which appeared monstrous and unjust to me as a child
    my mothers life must have been a very unhappy one and she was
    bitterly disappointed in many ways very likely in me as well my
    unfortunate misunderstood temperament led me to be shy and
    secretive and i was often ailing and my training was not
    calculated to improve matters at last however change and
    freedom came and i was sent to a boardingschool here of
    course i soon met with attachments and gratifications with other
    boys i arrived at puberty and my health improved under happier
    surroundings i was not long in discovering that my companions
    viewed the pleasures that meant so much to me from an entirely
    different standpoint their gratifications were usually
    accompanied by conversation about and a general direction of
    thought toward females when i had turned 15 owing to monetary
    difficulties i was obliged to leave school and was soon not only
    thrown on my own resources but accountable to no one but myself
    for my conduct of course my next discovery was that my case so
    far from being peculiar was a most common one and i was quickly
    initiated into all the mysteries of inversion with its
    freemasonry and argot altogether my experience of inverts has
    been a pretty wide and varied one and i have always endeavored
    to classify and compare cases which have come under my notice
    with a view to arriving at some sort of conclusion or
    explanation
    i suppose it is due to female versatility or impressibility that
    it is possible for me to experience mentally the emotions
    attributable to either sex according to the age and temperament
    of my companion for instance with one older than myself
    possessing wellmarked male characteristics i am able to feel
    all that surrender and dependence which is so essentially
    feminine on the other hand if with a youth of feminine type and
    behavior i can realize with an equal amount of pleasure the
    tender yet dominant attitude of the male
    i experience no particular horror of women sexually i should
    imagine that my feeling toward them resembles very much what
    normal people feel with regard to others of their own sex mn
    remarks that he cannot whistle and that his favorite color is
    green
in this case the subject easily found a moral modus vivendi with his
inverted instinct and he takes its gratification for granted in the
following case which i believe is typical of a large group the subject
has never yielded to his inverted impulses and except so far as
masturbation is concerned has preserved strict chastity
    history ixrs aged 31 american of french descent upon the
    question of heredity i may say that i belong to a reasonably
    healthy prolific and longlived family on my fathers side
    however there is a tendency toward pulmonary troubles he
    himself died of pneumonia and two of his brothers and a nephew
    of consumption neither of my parents were morbid or eccentric
    excepting for a certain shyness with strangers my father was a
    very masculine man my mother is somewhat nervous but is not
    imaginative nor at all demonstrative in her affections i think
    that my own imaginative and artistic temperament must come from
    my fathers side perhaps my french ancestry has something to do
    with it with the exception of my maternal grandfather all my
    progenitors have been of french descent my mothers father was
    english
    i possess a mercurial temperament and a strong sense of the
    ludicrous though my physique is slight my health has always
    been excellent of late years especially i have been greatly
    given to introspection and selfscrutiny but have never had any
    hallucinations mental delusions nor hysterics and am not at
    all superstitious spiritualistic manifestations hypnotic
    dabblings and the other psychical fads of the day have little or
    no attraction for me in fact i have always been skeptical of
    them and they rather bore me
    at school i was an indolent dreamy boy shirking study but
    otherwise fairly docile to my teachers from earliest childhood i
    have indulged in omnivorous taste for reading my particular
    likings being for travels esthetics metaphysical and
    theological subjects and more recently for poetry and certain
    forms of mysticism i never cared much for history or for
    scientific subjects from the beginning too i showed a strong
    artistic bent and possessed an overpowering love for all things
    beautiful as a child i was passionately fond of flowers loved
    to be in the woods and alone and wanted to become an artist my
    parents opposed the latter wish and i gave way before their
    opposition
    in me the homosexual nature is singularly complete and is
    undoubtedly congenital the most intense delight of my childhood
    even when a tiny boy in a nurses charge was to watch acrobats
    and riders at the circus this was not so much for the skillful
    feats as on account of the beauty of their persons even then i
    cared chiefly for the more lithe and graceful fellows people
    told me that circus actors were wicked and would steal little
    boys and so i came to look upon my favorites as halfdevil and
    halfangel when i was older and could go about alone i would
    often hang around the tents of travelling shows in hope of
    catching a glimpse of the actors i longed to see them naked
    without their tights and used to lie awake at night thinking of
    them and longing to be loved and embraced by them a certain
    bareback rider a sort of jockey used especially to please me on
    account of his handsome legs which were clothed in fleshlings up
    to his waist leaving his beautiful loins uncovered by a
    breechclout there was nothing consciously sensual about these
    reveries because at the time i had no sensual feelings or
    knowledge curiously enough the womenactors repelled me then
    as they do to this day quite as strongly as i was attracted by
    the men
    i used also to take great pleasure in watching men and boys in
    swimming but my opportunities for seeing them thus were
    extremely rare i never dared let my comrades know how i felt
    about these matters but the sight of a wellformed naked youth
    or man would fill me and does now with mingled feelings of
    bashfulness anguish and delight i used to tell myself endless
    stories of a visionary castle inhabited by beautiful boys one of
    whom was especially my dear chum
    it was always the prince in fairy tales who held my interest
    or affection i was constantly falling in love with handsome boys
    whom i never knew nor did i ever try to mix in their company
    for i was abashed before them and had no liking nor aptitude for
    boyish games sometimes i played with girls because they were
    more quiet and gentler but i cared for them little or not at
    all
    as is usually the case my parents neglected to impart to me any
    sexual knowledge and such as i possessed was gathered furtively
    from tainted sources bad boys talk at school and elsewhere my
    elders let me know in a vague way that talk of the kind was
    wicked and natural timidity and a wish to be good kept me from
    learning much about sexual matters as i never went to
    boardingschool i was spared perhaps many of the degrading
    initiations administered by knowing boys at such institutions
    in spite of what has been said above i do not believe that i
    was sexually very precocious and even now i feel that more
    pleasure would ensue from merely contemplating than from personal
    contact with the object of my amorous attentions
    as i grew older there came of course an undefined physical
    longing but it was the beauty of those i admired which mainly
    appealed to me at the time of puberty i spontaneously acquired
    the habit of masturbation once while bathing i found that a
    pleasant feeling came with touching the sexual organs it was not
    long before i was confirmed in the habit at first i practised it
    but seldom but afterward much more frequently say once a
    week though at times months have elapsed without any
    indulgences on my part i have only had erotic dreams three or
    four times in my life the masturbation habit i regard as
    morally reprehensible and have made many resolutions to break it
    but without avail it affords me only the most momentary
    satisfaction and is always followed by remorseful scruples
    i have never in my life had any sexual feeling for a woman nor
    any sexual connection with any woman whatsoever the very thought
    of such a thing is excessively repugnant and disgusting to me
    this is true apart from any moral considerations and i do not
    think i could bring myself to it i am not attracted by young
    women in any way even their physical beauty has little or no
    charm for me and i often wonder how men can be so affected by
    it on the other hand i am not a womanhater and have several
    strong friends of the opposite sex they are however women
    older than myself and our friendship is based solely on certain
    intellectual or esthetic tastes we have in common
    i have had practically no physical relations with men at any
    rate none specifically sexual once when about 19 or 21 i
    started to embrace a beautifully formed youth with whom i was
    sleeping but timidity and scruples got the better of my
    feelings and as my bedfellow was not amorously inclined toward
    me nothing came of it a few years after this i became strongly
    attached to a friend whom i had already known for several years
    circumstances threw us very much together during one summer it
    was now that i felt for the first time the full shock of love he
    returned my affection but both of us were shy of showing our
    feelings or speaking of them often when walking together after
    nightfall we would put our arms about each other sometimes
    too when sleeping together we would lie in close contact and my
    friend once suggested that i put my legs against his he
    frequently begged me to spend the night with him but i began to
    fear my feelings and slept with him but seldom we neither of us
    had any definite ideas about homosexual relations and apart
    from what i have related above we had no further contact with
    each other a few months after our amorous feelings had developed
    my friend died his death caused me great distress and my
    naturally religious temperament began to manifest itself quite
    strongly at this time too i first read some writings of mr
    addington symonds and certain allusions in his work coupled
    with my recent experience soon stirred me to a full
    consciousness of my inverted nature
    about eight months after my friends death i happened to meet in
    a strange town a youth of about my own age who exerted upon me a
    strong and instant attraction he possessed a refined handsome
    face was gracefully built and though he was rather
    undemonstrative we soon became fast friends
    we were together only for a few days when i was obliged to
    leave for my home and the parting caused me great unhappiness
    and depression a few months after we spent a vacation together
    one day during our trip we went swimming and undressed in the
    same bathhouse when i saw my friend naked for the first time he
    seemed to me so beautiful that i longed to throw my arms about
    him and cover him with kisses i kept my feelings hidden
    however hardly daring to look at him for fear of being unable to
    restrain my desires several times afterward in his room i saw
    him stripped with the same effect upon my emotions until i had
    seen him naked my feelings for him were not of a physical
    character but afterward i longed for actual contact but only by
    embraces and kisses though he was fond of me he had absolutely
    no amorous longings for me and being a simple pureminded
    fellow would have loathed me for mine and my inverted nature i
    was careful never to let him discover it and i was made very
    unhappy when he confided that he was in love with a young girl
    whom he wished to marry this episode took place several years
    ago and though we are still friends my emotional feelings for
    him have cooled considerably
    i have always been very shy of showing any affectionate
    tendencies most of my acquaintances and close friends even
    think me curiously cold and often wonder why i have never fallen
    in love or married for obvious reasons i have never been able to
    tell them
    three or four years ago a little book by coventry patmore fell
    into my hands and from its perusal resulted a strange blending
    of my religious and erotic notions the desire to love and be
    loved is hard to drown and when i realized that homosexually it
    was neither lawful nor possible for me to love in this world i
    began to project my longings into the next by birth i am a roman
    catholic and in spite of a somewhat skeptical temper manage to
    remain one by conviction
    from the doctrines of the trinity incarnation and eucharist i
    have drawn conclusions which would fill the minds of the average
    pietist with holy horror nevertheless i believe that granting
    the premises these conclusions are both logically and
    theologically defensible the divinity of my fancied paradise
    resembles in no way the vapid conceptions of fra angelico or the
    quartier st sulpice his physical aspect at least would be
    better represented by some praxitilean demigod or flandrins
    naked brooding boy
    while these imaginings have caused me considerable moral
    disquietude they do not seem wholly reprehensible because i
    feel that the chief happiness i would derive by their realization
    would be mainly from the contemplation of the loved one rather
    than from closer joys
    i possess only a slight knowledge of the history and particulars
    of erotic mysticism but it is likely that my notions are neither
    new nor peculiar and many utterances of the few mystical writers
    with whose works i am acquainted seem substantially in accord
    with my own longings and conclusions in endeavoring to find for
    them some sanction of valid authority i have always sought
    corroboration from members of my own sex hence am less likely to
    have fashioned my views after those of hypersensitive or
    hysterical women
    you will rightly infer that it is difficult for me to say
    exactly how i regard morally the homosexual tendency of this
    much however i am certain that even if it were possible i
    would not exchange my inverted nature for a normal one i suspect
    that the sexual emotions and even inverted ones have a more
    subtle significance than is generally attributed to them but
    modern moralists either fight shy of transcendental
    interpretations or see none and i am ignorant and unable to
    solve the mystery these feelings seem to imply
    patmore speaks boldly enough in his way and lacordaire has
    hinted at things but in a very guarded manner i have neither
    the ability nor opportunity to study what the mystics of the
    middle ages have to say along these lines and besides the
    medieval way of looking at things is not congenial to me the
    chief characteristic of my tendency is an overpowering admiration
    for male beauty and in this i am more akin to the greeks
    i have absolutely no words to tell you how powerfully such
    beauty affects me moral and intellectual worth is i know of
    greater value but physical beauty i see more clearly and it
    appears to me the most vivid if not the most perfect
    manifestation of the divine a little incident may perhaps
    reveal to you my feelings more completely not long ago i
    happened to see an unusually wellformed young fellow enter a
    house of assignation with a common woman of the streets the
    sight filled me with the keenest anguish and the thought that
    his beauty would soon be at the disposal of a prostitute made me
    feel as if i were a powerless and unhappy witness to a sacrilege
    it may be that my rage for male loveliness is only another
    outbreaking of the old platonic mania for as time goes on i find
    that i long less for the actual youth before me and more and
    more for some ideal perfect being whose bodily splendor and
    loving heart are the realities whose reflections only we see in
    this cave of shadows since the birth and development within me
    of what for lack of a better name i term my homosexualized
    patmorean ideal life has become in the main a weary business
    i am not despondent however because many things still hold for
    me a certain interest when that interest dies down as it is
    wont from time to time i endeavor to be patient god grant that
    after the end here i may be drawn from the shadow and
    seemingly vain imaginings into the possession of their
    neverending reality hereafter
    history xah aged 62 belongs to a family which cannot be
    regarded as healthy but there is no insanity among near
    relations father a very virile man of high character and good
    intelligence but not sound physical health mother was
    highstrung and nervous but possessed of indomitable courage and
    very affectionate she lived very happily with her husband she
    became a chronic invalid and died of consumption ah was a
    seven months child the third in the family who were born very
    rapidly so that there is only three years difference in the ages
    of the first and third children ah believes that one of his
    brothers who has never married and prefers men to women is also
    inverted though not to the same degree as himself and he also
    suspects that a relation of his mothers may have been an invert
    sister who resembles the father in character is married but is
    spoken of as a womans woman rather than a mans woman the
    family generally are considered proud and reserved but of
    superior mental endowment
    in early life ah was delicate and his studies were often
    interrupted by illness though living under happy conditions he
    was shy and nervous often depressed in later life his health
    has been up to the average and he has usually been able to
    conceal his mental doubts and diffidence
    as a child he played with dolls and made girls his companions
    until an age when he grew conscious that his conduct was unusual
    and became ashamed while his father seemed troubled about him
    he regards himself as having been a very childish child
    his conscious sexual life began between the ages of 8 and 10 he
    was playing in the garden when he saw a manservant who had long
    been with the family standing at the door of a shed with his
    penis exposed and erect the boy had never seen anything of the
    kind before but felt great delight in the exhibition and moved
    shyly toward the man who retreated into the shed the boy
    followed and was allowed to caress and play with the penis until
    ejaculation took place the man replying in reply to the childs
    innocent inquiries that it felt good this experience was
    frequently repeated with the same man and the boy confided in a
    boy friend with whom he tried to ascertain by personal
    experience what the good feeling was like but they were too
    young to derive any pleasure from the attempt beyond the joy of
    what was instinctively felt to be eating forbidden fruit
    from this period his sexual tendencies began to become fixed and
    selfconscious he has never at any period of life had a moments
    conscious sexual attraction toward a person of the opposite sex
    his warmest friendships have indeed been with women and much
    perhaps most of the happiness he has enjoyed has been furnished
    by those friendships but passion has only been aroused by
    persons of his own sex generally by men much younger than
    himself he feels shy and uncomfortable in the presence of men
    of his own age but even at his present age a touch of a man or
    boy may cause the liveliest gratification
    shortly after the incident in boyhood already narrated ah
    induced a little boy companion to go to a quiet spot where at
    ahs suggestion each placed the others penis in his mouth by
    turns ah had never heard of such a proceeding it was a
    natural instinct he began to masturbate at an early age but he
    soon found a companion to share his passion an older man
    especially married and with a family became his accomplice on
    every possible opportunity and they would manipulate each other
    at the age of 21 fellatio began to be practised with this man
    it became a lifelong practice and the preferred method of sexual
    gratification he likes best to have it performed on himself but
    he has never asked anyone to do for him what he would not himself
    do for the other if desired there has never been pedicatio
    the penis it may be added is of good size and the testicles
    rather large
    no one has ever suspected ahs sexual perversion not even his
    physician with whom he has long had a close friendship until at
    a time of great mental distress ah voluntarily revealed his
    state he is accustomed to refined society has always read much
    abhorred athletic pursuits and loved poetry children and
    flowers his love of nature amounts indeed to a passion
    wherever he has been he has made friends among the best people
    he confesses to occasional periods of addiction to intoxicants
    induced by sociable companionship and only controlled by force
    of will
    for business he has not the slightest aptitude and cannot look
    after his own affairs he is always dreading poverty and
    destitution he believes however that he passes among his
    friends as fairly capable
    he considers that inversion is natural in his case and that he
    has a perfect right to gratify his own natural instincts though
    he also admits they may be vices he has never sought to
    influence an innocent person toward his own tendencies
    history xitd knows of nothing abnormal in his ancestry his
    brother has homosexual tendencies but is also attracted to
    women a sister who is very religious states that she has
    little or no sexual inclinations they were all of a dreamy
    disposition when young to the disgust of their teachers he sent
    the following account of himself from the university at the age
    of 20
    when i was a child before i went to school at 9 he writes
    i was already of an affectionate disposition an affection
    turned readily to either sex no boy was the cause of my
    inclinations which were quite spontaneous no doubt part of
    the cause may be found in our social system by which ladies are
    rather drawingroom creatures to be treated with distant
    respect when i was 10 at a preparatory school i first began
    to form attachments with other boys of my own age in which i
    always had regard to physical beauty it is this stage in which
    the sexual element is latent that shelley speaks of as preceding
    love in ardent natures
    at 12 i learned masturbation apparently by instinct and i
    regret to say practised it to excess for the next seven years
    always secretly and with shame and often with the accompaniment
    of prurient imaginings which did not prevent my relations with
    those i loved being of a very spiritual nature masturbation was
    often practised daily with bursts of repentance and abstinence
    latterly more rarely but until i was 15 i really knew nothing of
    sexual matters and it was not till i was at least 17 that i was
    conscious of sexual desire which i repressed with shame
    owing to excessive selfabuse i am unable to emit except
    manually but desire is strong i think naked contact would
    suffice and in any case intercrural connection pedicatio and
    fellatio i abhor i love boys between the ages of 12 and 15
    they must be of my own class refined and lovable i only desire
    the active masculine part i now regard my inclinations as
    natural and normal to me the difficulty is that of leading the
    other party to regard it as such besides the young age required
    and clandestine nature of proceedings necessary the moral
    difficulties of circumstances are so strong that i have little
    hope of ever gratifying my passion fully i have found myself
    deceived in the character of the boy twice the last friendship
    lasted three years during which time i only saw him naked two or
    three times this caused erection never touched him pruriently
    and only kissed him once
    i have never found a satisfactory object of my affections and
    my happiness perhaps my health have been seriously injured at
    my public school a master helped me to a truer understanding of
    these things the merely animal sodomy which exists in many
    public schools was unknown what i learned of sex i learned for
    myself i am recommended to turn my aspirations to the abstract
    universal maid but so far at least i cannot do it
    male greek statuary and the phoedrus of plato have had a
    great though only confirmatory influence on my feelings my
    ideal is that of theocritus xiii wherein hercules was bringing
    hylas to the perfect measure of a man my first thought is the
    good of my friend but except for the good subjective influence
    of passion i have failed utterly
    i am very tall dark rather strong fond of games though i do
    not excel owing to short sight i am english though i have
    french blood which may account for an unreservedly passionate
    disposition though unlike other people i am not in the least
    feminine nor has anyone thought so to my knowledge i can
    whistle easily and well i am so masculine that i cannot even
    conceive of passive sexual pleasure in women much less in men
    that is one of the difficulties in boylove my affections are
    inextricably bound up in the ideals of protection of one weaker
    than myself in the earlier days when sexuality was less
    conscious this was a great source of romantic feeling the
    glamour of which is rather departing i cannot understand love of
    adult males much less if they are of lower class and the idea
    of prostitution is nauseous to me
    i think i may say that i have the esthetic and moral sense very
    strongly ingrained indeed they are largely synonymous with me
    i have no dramatic aptitude and though i flatter myself that my
    taste is good in music i have no knowledge of music if i have a
    favorite color it is a dark crimson or blue of the nature of
    old stained glass i derive great pleasure from all literary and
    pictorial art and architecture indeed art of all kinds i have
    facility in writing personal lyrical verse it affords me relief
    i think my inversion must be congenital as the desire of
    contact with those boys i loved began before masturbation and has
    lasted through private and public resorts and into university
    life the other sex does not attract me but i am very fond of
    children girls as well as boys if there is sexuality in this
    which i trust there is not it is latent
    this statement is of interest because it may well lead us to
    suppose that the writer who is of balanced mind and sound
    judgment possesses a confirmed homosexual outlook on life
    while however it is the rule for the permanent direction of the
    sexual impulse to be decided by the age of 20 that age is too
    early to permit us to speak positively especially in a youth
    whose adolescent undifferentiated or homosexual impulses are
    fostered by university life this proved to be the case with
    td who though doubtless possessing a psychically anomalous
    strain is yet predominantly masculine on leaving the university
    his heterosexuality asserted itself normally about six years
    after the earlier statement he wrote that he had fallen in love
    i am on the eve of marrying a girl of nearly my own age she has
    sympathy as well as knowledge in my fields of study it was thus
    easier for me to explain my past and i found that she could not
    understand the moral objections to homosexual practices my own
    opinion always was that the moral objections were very
    considerable but might in some cases be overcome in any case i
    have entirely lost my sexual attraction toward boys though i am
    glad to say that the appreciation of their charm and grace
    remains my instincts therefore have undergone a considerable
    change but the change is not entirely in the direction of
    normality the instinct for sodomy in the proper sense of the
    word used to be unintelligible to me since the object of
    attraction has become a woman this instinct is mixed with the
    normal in my desire further an element which much troubled me
    as being most foreign to my ideal feelings has not quite left
    methe indecent and often scatologic curiosity about immature
    girls i can only hope that the realization of the normal in
    marriage may finally kill these painful aberrations i should add
    that the practice of masturbation has been abandoned
    history xiiaged 24 father and mother both living the latter
    is of a better social standing than the father he is much
    attached to his mother and she gives him some sympathy he has a
    brother who is normally attracted to women he himself has never
    been attracted to women and takes no interest in them nor in
    their society
    at the age of 4 he first became conscious of an attraction for
    older males from the ages of 11 and 19 at a large
    grammarschool he had relationships with about one hundred boys
    needless to add he considers homosexuality extremely common in
    schools it was however the oscar wilde case which first opened
    his eyes to the wide prevalence of homosexuality and he
    considers that the publicity of that case has done much if not
    to increase homosexuality at all events to make it more
    conspicuous and outspoken
    he is now attracted to youths about 5 or 6 years younger than
    himself they must be goodlooking he has never perverted a boy
    not already inclined to homosexuality in his relationship he
    does not feel exclusively like a male or a female sometimes one
    sometimes the other he is often liked he says because of his
    masculine character
    he is fully developed and healthy well over middle height
    inclined to be plump with full face and small moustache he
    smokes many cigarettes and cannot get on without them though his
    manners are very slightly if at all feminine he acknowledges
    many feminine ways he is fond of jewelry until lately always
    wore a bangle and likes womens rings he is very particular
    about fine ties and uses very delicate womens handkerchiefs he
    has always had a taste for music and sings he has a special
    predilection for green it is the predominant color in the
    decoration of his room and everything green appeals to him he
    finds that the love of green and also of violet and purple is
    very widespread among his inverted friends
    history xiiiartist aged 34 the earliest sex impression that
    i am conscious of he writes is at the age of 9 or 10 falling
    in love with a handsome boy who must have been about two years my
    senior i do not recollect ever having spoken to him but my
    desire so far as i can recall was that he should seize hold of
    and handle me i have a distinct impression yet of how
    pleasurable even physical pain or cruelty would have been at his
    hands i have noticed that in young children it is often
    difficult to differentiate the sexual emotions from what in the
    grown up would be definite cruelty
    it must have been at about this time that i discoveredentirely
    by myselfthe act of masturbation the process grew up quite
    naturally though i cannot but think that the coopedup life in a
    london street and a london school with want of physical
    exercise as well as want of landscape color and beautiful
    form had much to do with it the tone of the school i was at was
    singularly clean but i question whether the vaunted cleanliness
    of tone of dayschools can compensate for the open life and large
    discipline of an english public school
    how far the rather frequent masturbation between the ages of 10
    and 13 may have had to do with weakly health i do not know but
    when i was 12 i was taken by my mother to a famous doctor he
    made no inquiries of a sexual nature but he advised that i
    should be sent away from london he had a sentimental horror of
    violent games etc for boys and put aside various suggested
    public schools finally i was sent to a private school at the
    seaside
    the private school was clean and wholesome the plunge into the
    sexual cocytus of the great public school that followed was
    effectually sudden in my day  was a perfect stew of
    uncleanness there was plenty of incontinence not much cruelty
    no end of dirty conversation and a great deal of genuine
    affection even to heroism shown among the boys in their
    relations to one another all these things were treated by
    masters and boys alike as more or less unholy with the result
    that they were either sought after or flung aside according to
    the sexual or emotional instinct of each no attempt was made at
    discrimination a kiss was as unclean as the act of fellatio
    and no one had any gauge or principle whatever on which to guide
    the cravings of boyhood
    my first initiation into the mysteries of sex was at the hands
    of the dormitory servant who showed me his penis when he woke me
    in the mornings and masturbated me when he gave me my hot bath
    on a saturday night this old reprobate of 45 committed the act
    of fellatio with most of the boys in turn as he went the
    dormitory rounds for the older lads i cannot speak but over us
    younger ones of 14 and 15 he exercised a sort of unholy terror
    and fascination he was very popular we came to him like doves
    to a snake when i revisited my old school many years later he
    was occupying a very responsible position in the college chapel
    and i noticed that he wore that expression of sly reverence which
    i think i can now instantly detect when i see it in a man
    for the rest the dormitory was boisterous and lewd and there
    was a good deal of bullying which probably did little harm my
    principal recollection now is of the filthy mystery of foul talk
    that i neither cared for nor understood what i really needed
    like all the other boys was a little timely help over the
    sexual problems but this we none of us got and each had to work
    out his own principle of conduct for himself it was a long
    difficult and wasteful process and i cannot but believe that
    many of us failed in the endeavor we had come unprepared with
    any advice the principle upon which we were apparently trained
    was the repression of every instinct my mother was ignorant from
    innocence my father from indifference and so between them i was
    sent out helpless a mother incurs great responsibility in
    sending her child away unprepared a parent should not seek to
    shift his responsibility upon the schoolmaster love alone should
    be the fount from which revelations should flow the master from
    the very nature of his position cannot reveal
    an imminent breakdown in healthdue it would now appear to
    quite obvious causesrelieved me from the purgatory of the
    college dormitory and i was removed to one of the private
    houses these establishments were considered more select and less
    rough the social atmosphere was however perhaps more
    unwholesome because more effeminate and was full of noble young
    sucklings the nominal head of the house under normal conditions
    might have been a real leader as it was the real head of the
    house was a gilded young pariah fairly low down in the school
    and full of hypocrisy and unnatural lusts the boy who occupied
    the cubicle next to mine was also a bad case of sexual
    misdirection though he had not the social distinction to make
    him quite so refined a terror i had every opportunity of
    watching him until two years later he was fortunately asked to
    leave he talked bawd from morning till night got drunk on one
    or two occasions masturbated constantly without concealment had
    several of the younger boys inter femora though without
    evincing any care or affection for them and gave one the
    impression of having been born for a brothel his one redeeming
    quality was an element of good nature a characteristic one often
    finds among such as are selfish and irresponsible i have since
    been told that he has gone completely to the dogs whether this
    young cubs sexual instincts could have been turned or guided i
    do not know but in a rougher and simpler life than that of a
    public school in a more open and less hypocritical atmosphere
    he might perhaps have been licked into better shape hypocrisy
    is a vice however that schoolboys themselves are fortunately
    free from it comes later the tone among the boys was frankly
    and violently unclean though unclean not from instinct but from
    want of direction and from repression
    i have not a single happy recollection of this period of my
    school life yet out of this morass of misbegotten virtues i
    plucked my first blossom of genuine affection i call it a
    blossom because it never ripened even to flower i had been given
    the extreme of filth to feed upon at the outset and now i found
    for myself the extreme of chastity it will be a matter of
    lifelong regret to me that the love which was the lodestar of my
    school years was never fulfilled or set upon a sound basis of
    comradeship
    when i was about 16 years old there came into the house a boy
    about two years younger than myself and who became the absorbing
    thought of my school days i do not remember a moment from the
    time i first saw him to the time i left school that i was not in
    love with him and the affection was reciprocated if somewhat
    reservedly he was always a little ahead of me in books and
    scholarship but as our affection ripened we spent most of our
    spare time together and he received my advances much as a girl
    who is being wooed a little mockingly perhaps but with real
    pleasure he allowed me to fondle and caress him but our
    intimacy never went further than a kiss and about that even was
    the slur of shame there was always a barrier between us and we
    never so much as whispered to one another concerning those things
    of which all the school obscenely talked any connection between
    our own emotions and the sexual morals of the school never
    occurred to us in fact we lived a dreamlife of chastity that
    could not relate itself to any human conditions this was
    suddenly broken in upon my friend was very beautiful and an
    object of attraction to others that some of the elder boys had
    made offers of sexual intercourse to him i knew but to him as
    to me that was unspeakable wickedness one day i heard that four
    or five of these suitors of his had mishandled him they had i
    believe taken off his trousers and attempted to masturbate him
    the offense was probably horse play of an animal nature to me it
    seemed an unpardonable offense the matter had been reported to
    the master by a servant but confirmatory evidence was needed
    before punishment could follow i was torn asunder by passions i
    could not then analyze and in the end committed the greatest of
    schoolboy crimesi sneaked the action under the circumstances
    was courageous but i was indifferent so long as the boy i loved
    judged me rightly the result was that at the close of the term
    four or five of the senior boys were asked to leave the
    remaining brief period of my school life which had previously
    been a living hell became really happy that this should have
    been brought about to the harm of four or five boys whose sin
    after all was but a misdirected impulse for which the system was
    responsible seems to me now all very wrong of the boys sent
    away however certainly three have made honorable careers for
    my friend and i we became more afraid of each other than before
    as our affections increased so our fear of them increased also
    the friendship was too ethereal to live but even yet we still
    have a deep respect for one another
    when at the age of 19 i left school i was allowed to knock about
    for a year before entering college during this time i picked up
    a sexual experience that may or may not have been a valuable one
    i certainly look back upon it now with regret if not with
    horror my father had discovered some months before this date
    that i was in the habit of masturbating and he gave me what he
    conceived to be the right counsel under the circumstances if
    you do this he said you will never be able to use your penis
    with a woman therefore your best plan will be to go with a
    prostitute should you do this however you will probably pick
    up a beastly disease therefore the safest way would be to do it
    abroad if you get the chance for there the houses are licensed
    having delivered himself of this advice he troubled himself no
    further in the matter but left me to work out my own destiny
    the great physician to whom i was taken about this time also
    gave me his advice on this point masturbation he said is
    death a number of young men come to me with the same story i
    tell them they are killing themselves and you will kill
    yourself too the doctors hope was apparently to frighten his
    young patients into what he conceived to be natural conditions of
    life and one went away from him with the impression that every
    sexual manifestation in ones self was a physical infirmity due
    to ones own moral weakness it took me some time before i could
    make up my mind to follow my fathers advice but after a period
    of real moral agony i deliberately and entirely in cold blood
    acted upon it i sought out a scarlet woman in the streets of
     and went home with her from something she said to me i know
    that i gave her pleasure and she asked me to come to her again
    this i did twice but without any real pleasure the whole thing
    was too sordid and soulless and the man who decides to take an
    evil medicine regularly has first to make up his mind that he
    really needs it
    at about the same time i chanced to be for a few months in a
    german university town and i determined as i had the
    opportunity to carry the parental advice to the logical
    conclusion i tried a licensed house the place was clean and
    decent and the conditions i take it such as one would normally
    find in any properly regulated continental city but to me the
    whole thing appeared unspeakably horrible it was a purely
    commercial transaction and it had not even the redeeming element
    of risk to ones self or of offense against a social or
    disciplinary code i came away feeling that i had touched bottom
    in my sexual experiences and i understood what it was that faust
    saw when the red mouse sprang from the mouth of the witch in the
    walpurgis dance
    these were the only occasions upon which i have had sexual
    intercourse with women looking back to them now they appear to
    me to have been almost inevitable but if i had my life over
    again i would shun them as i would a lethal draught i believe i
    came out of the fire unscathed probably indeed it did me good
    in the sense that it made it possible for me to look deeper into
    life though to what extent seeing the torments of the damned
    makes us do this perhaps only a dante could tell to gain
    knowledge at the expense of the shame and misery of others i hold
    to be fundamentally wrong and immoral what is to me however
    the chief and bitterest thought is that i flung away the first
    spring of manhood where i got no love in return his virginity
    is or should be as glorious and sacred a possession to a youth
    as to a maiden to be guarded jealously to be given only at the
    call of love to one who loves himbe it comrade mistress or
    wifeand whom he can love in return
    the full university life into which i now entered at the age of
    20 brought with it a flood of new ideas feelings and sensations
    the friendships i made there will always remain the central ones
    in my life up to my last term at college at the age of 24 i
    still wore my chainmail of artificial chastity but then a
    change gradually set in and i began to understand the
    relationship of the physical phenomena of sex to its intellectual
    and imaginative manifestations i was not destined to fully
    realize this for some years and then exclusively through and out
    of my own personal experience it was the study of walt
    whitmans leaves of grass that first brought me light upon this
    question hitherto i had kept the two things locked up as it
    were in two separate airtight compartmentsmy friendships in
    one my sex instincts in anotherto be kept under and repressed
    by the publicschool code as i conceived it
    it is needless to say that i was continually troubled by the
    customary sex phenomena erotic dreams loss of semen
    troublesome erections at night etc these i repressed as best i
    could by habitual masturbation and by the regular diet and
    exercise which academic life made possible at one time for the
    period of a year i should say i tried to overcome the desire for
    masturbation by gradual stages on the principle of the
    drunkards cure by which he took every day less tipple by the
    insertion of one pebble more in his bottle i marked on my
    calendar the erotic dreams and the nights on which i masturbated
    and sought gradually to extend the intervening periods six
    weeks however was the longest time for which i was able to
    abstain
    a few years later the writer of this communication formed an
    intimate relationship in which he did not make the first
    advances with a youth some years younger than himself and of
    lower social class whose development he was able to assist but
    for my part he remarks i owe him as much as i gave him for
    his love lighted up the gold of affection that was in me and
    consumed the dross it was from him that i first learned that
    there was no such thing as a hardandfast line between the
    physical and the spiritual in friendship this relationship
    lasted for some years when the young man married its effects
    are described as very beneficial to both parties all the sexual
    troubles vanished together with the desire to masturbate
    everything in life began to sing with joy and what little of
    real creative work i may have done i attribute largely to the
    power of work that was born in me during those years
    history xivscotchman aged 38 his paternal ancestors were
    normal so far as he knows his mother belonged to a very
    eccentric old celtic family soon after 5 he became so enamored
    of a young shepherd that the boy had to be sent away he
    practised masturbation many years before the age of puberty and
    attaches importance to this as a factor in the evolution of his
    homosexual life
    he has had erotic dreams rarely about men about women more
    frequently while indifferent to women he has no repulsion
    toward them he has had connection with women two or three times
    but without experiencing the same passionate emotions as with
    men
    he would like a son but he has never been able to get up the
    necessary amount of passion to lead to marriage
    he has always had a sentimental and platonic affection for men
    of late years he has formed two friendships with adults of an
    affectionate and also erotic character he cares little for
    anything beyond mutual masturbation and kissing what he desires
    is the love of the male
    in appearance there is nothing abnormal about him except an air
    of youth he is vigorous both in body and mind and has enormous
    power of resisting fatigue he is an excellent man of business
    is a patient student he sees no harm in his homosexual passions
    he is averse to promiscuity his ideal is a permanent union which
    includes sexual relations

    the british and jewish races hate business politics sports
    and society love music art literature and nature deep
    interest in mysticism am clairvoyant have been used many times
    as a medium lead two separate lives an outer and inner psychic

    reincarnation always have had because when i was a little child
    i could remember so much have an excellent memory dating back
    to my third year have always been too selfanalytical have from
    my earliest childhood felt myself an alien am very sensitive
    physically and psychically have no wish to wear womans clothing
    or do womans work as to clothes for myself i prefer black and
    not much jewelry
    i could only love a perfectly manly man from 21 to 40 years of
    age he must be physically beautiful and well made size of
    sexual organs plays no part the muscles must be developed and
    the hands must be especially well shaped hands are my fetish i

    intelligent love music art literature and nature he must be
    refined and cultured and have been about the world he must have
    simplicity in behavior dress and manner and above all be
    cleanbodied as cleanminded cynicism i cannot stand here i
    may state i once owned a st bernard dog which reminded me much
    of my ideal he was always sedate always loving and faithful
    generally quiet he only got excited when out in the elements i
    have not been able to get on with people who have no sense of
    humor from my birth i was physically weak first i suffered from
    eczema being born with a double squint i was operated on at 2
    and again at 3 years of age with excellent result from 4 to 12
    years of age i had convulsions often and all the illnesses of
    childhood at the age of 12 years i took scarlet fever followed
    by a weak heart which grew stronger after a year and brights
    disease which lasted fifteen years with hardly a break this
    illness had its wonted effect of producing melancholia and
    upsetting the whole nervous system brights disease stopped
    suddenly but was followed by a succession of illnesses then i
    had neuritis very badly i then removed to bavaria and to regain
    nervous strength i was treated by freuds psychoanalytical
    method with great success i had a very bad relapse as my
    brother who had just heard i was homosexual came to visit me
    and threatened to have me put under guardians if my father
    should die it took me weeks to recover from the shock we broke
    off all intercourse and though my brother has been several times
    in the same town where i have been we remain strangers at this
    time my father died suddenly last spring four suicides of
    friends in so many weeks had a very bad effect on my nerves i am
    now in berlin in better spirits but the cramp continues badly at
    times
    to this i must add that since my fourteenth year independent of
    any illness i have suffered mentally and physically from
    menstrual pains recurring every twentyeight days and lasting
    from six to eight days that these were the equivalent pains to a
    womans menstruation periods i could get no doctor to admit till
    i was treated for a length of time by a german nerve specialist
    the physical pains begin abruptly sudden congestions of blood
    in the brain and in the abdomen sudden perspirations heat and
    cold great nervous pains in the small of the back also in the
    nervecenters of abdomen and stomach sharp shooting pains in
    the breasts and especially the nipples sudden toothache which
    stops as suddenly the skin becomes darker sometimes mottled i
    have the whole time a taste of blood in my mouth and often
    everything i eat tastes of blood i have great difficulty at that
    time in eating meat physical longings for erotic adventure
    counterbalanced by mental nausea at the bare idea
    the mental symptoms are sudden feeling of deep depression
    suicidal tendencies alternating with sudden inexplicable
    lightheartedness capriciousness and great dissatisfaction with
    myself and life generally horror at my own incompleteness of sex
    and sudden fits of hatred toward women and a great longing to be
    loved by men this condition changes slowly back to the normal
    one it takes several days for me to lose my physical weakness
    owing to it
    physically i was developed at 16 years of age mentally i was
    developed at a very early age but i kept my inner life quite
    dark always playing the innocent nobody at home believed me to
    know anything about life they were at times very surprised when
    i fell out of the rle i had planned for myself up till i was 17
    years of age nothing to do with other peoples morals was ever
    discussed before me i looked so pure and do now that people
    are always careful in front of me my father never discussed such
    things with me from my earliest childhood i loved men dearly
    though i was always at daggers drawn with my father and brother
    i worshipped my mother then as i do now my sister and i did not
    at all get on as children though we are the best of friends now
    she and her husband as well as my mother have been kindness
    itself ever since they knew of my condition not till i was over
    30 years did i meet a man i loved as well as my mother and he is
    heterosexual i must have loved my father and brother at first
    but continual conflicts incompatible temperaments and mutual
    misunderstandings and want of sympathy made life at home
    horrible i must admit from my earliest childhood i had a certain
    contempt for my father and brother because i found them so
    materialistic i had all my childhood rows with my brother my
    father took his part my mother mine after i had recovered from
    my fathers sudden death my first words were after reading the
    letter thank god it isnt mother i felt a great relief but
    it took a long time for me to grasp that i was really free
    i have always liked womens society and as a youth i was very
    fond of gossip which i by no means am now i have many women
    friends more than men friends these women friends are all
    heterosexual except one i very often like elderly women i
    suppose i see mother in such women a woman never could make me
    blush but a man i admired could easily
    i was 23 years of age when a married woman of good family asked
    me to come and spend the night with her i went and though she
    was beautifully built cleanly and though her garments and
    apartments were of the utmost good taste i did not have any
    erection on the other hand i felt myself to be most unclean and
    bathed three times each of the following three days since then i
    have never tried to have sexual intercourse with women
    in copenhagen i tried to excite my feelings with every class of
    woman in vain i suppose it is that my nature is so like womans
    that there can be no reaction with men i am often very shy and
    nervous tonguetied and my hands perspire never so with women
    as a child i loved men and used to fall desperately in love with
    some who came to the house i would when no one was there kiss
    their hats or gloves or even their sticks
    i can remember when i was about 6 years how i fell in love
    with a very goodlooking 26yearold german he had very curly
    hair and his hands were very beautiful he was very fond of me
    and i used to call him my boy when visiting us he often used
    to tuck me in after the nurse had gone down he always had
    sweets or something for me i can remember how i used to fling my
    arms round his neck and cover his face with kisses i would then
    draw his head down on my pillow and he would tell me fairytales
    and i would go off to sleep quite happy
    at 7 years of age while staying in the country a very
    goodlooking groom about 25 years of age misbehaved himself
    with me i often used to visit him in the stables as this man
    had a strange attraction for me one day he tickled me while
    doing so he produced my penis and also his own which was in full
    erection he tried in every way to excite my feelings in vain
    for him the occasion terminated in an ejaculation he forbade me
    to tell anyone and i did not do so but tried to find out all i
    could on the subject with little or no result from that day i
    hated the groom and i felt a sort of guilt as if i had lost
    something not till i was 12 years did i understand
    from my earliest childhood i had one ideal of a man from that
    ideal i have never swerved at the age of 30 i found a friend
    who though quite heterosexual has without giving me any sexual
    intercourse given me the love i have always needed he has been
    for the last couple of years a second mother father sister
    brother and lover through him i have regained my health my
    love of nature and he has helped to deaden my hatred toward
    human nature and my bitterness a better friend i never wish to
    find it has made up for all the years of mental and physical
    suffering one strange thing is that the feeling is mutual he
    has had a tragic life for his wife whom he loved beyond
    everything died under very sad circumstances he says i am the
    best male friend he has ever had while with him much of the
    lower nature in me was stamped out i shall always look upon him
    as the turning point in my life i think he wrought some of his
    finest influence through his music he played beethoven and
    wagner for me for a couple of hours every day for months and
    thus opened up a new world to me he is six years older than i
    am
    at 10 years of age we moved to sweden a country i hated from
    first to last about this time i began to notice that there was
    something strange about myself i felt myself an alien and have
    done so ever since an event of importance in my life was i feel
    sure when my fathers sister tried to take away my mothers
    character it was done in jealousy and spite and my aunt had to
    beg my parents pardon outwardly the affair was patched up but
    i feel sure my father never really forgave his sister jews never
    forgive
    this event awoke in me a great hatred toward women and it was
    many years before i could at all control it
    at the age of 14 i was much with a goodlooking musical
    american a year older than myself one day while romping very
    much the same thing occurred as with the groom i still had no
    sexual feelings we remained good friends i often wished to kiss
    him after the first time he would not allow it he was very much
    liked among the officers and socalled high society men and had
    always much money about ten years later i heard he used to
    accept money after intimate intercourse with those society men
    during my fifteenth year i had great longing for sexual
    intercourse with men at this time the first signs of hair were
    to be seen on my abdomen
    at the age of 16 a gardener a married man with family
    initiated me into mutual selfabuse he lived in the back house
    of the apartment house we then inhabited he was about 40 years
    of age an ugly but muscularly developed man these practices
    took place in the cellar to which there were three entrances i
    never allowed him to kiss me and the sight of his children always
    awoke in me a great feeling of nausea that was the natural
    reaction of a bad conscience for the man himself i had the
    utmost contempt this man told me of several parks and pissoirs
    where men met and i went to these places now and again for
    erotic adventure
    i must here relate that at the age of 16 my mother warned me
    against selfabuse it had the opposite effect made me curious
    so i began at once i have continued ever since at least once a
    day i have never had an involuntary emission in my whole life
    between 17 and 22 it became necessary for me to do so several
    times a day working at art painting and above all music and
    beauty have a strong influence over me and set my erotic longings
    in violent motion i have never found this do me any harm
    abstinence on the other hand has a very harmful effect on me
    upsetting the whole nervous and physical system i often find
    that there is a something very much wanting in selfabuse the
    commingling of two human bodies who are mentally as well as
    physically in sympathy gives an electrical satisfaction which
    quiets the whole nervous system that at least has been my
    experience
    the gardener left and moved to the country i then sometimes
    visited pissoirs or as they are often called panoramas
    because they are round and one sees much there what i saw in
    the parks during the long summer nights was quite a revelation
    during the summer when the husbands had sent their families in
    the country many of them led a very indiscreet life what i saw
    the first summer killed all the respect i had for elderly people
    i had always connected marriage and gray hairs with virtue and
    morals then i learnt otherwise i must say i became about this
    time a sensual pig i knew how dangerous these places were on
    account of the police and blackmailers but that gave the hunt a
    double zest at this time i led a double life and was always
    watching and analyzing myself i had to do with heaps of men of
    all classes i was often offered money but that i would on no
    condition accept to pay or to be paid kills every sort of erotic
    feeling in me and always has done so i once wished to experiment
    with myself i was offered a small sum of money by a former
    schoolmaster i accepted this just to see how it would affect me
    the next moment i threw the money as far away as possible then i
    saw i had none of the prostitute nature in me i was simply
    overwhelmed with sensuality i considered i was a criminal and
    wished to see in how many ways my nature had the criminal
    instinct i wanted to see if i could become a thief i stole a
    silver button in a shop where antiquities were sold but i went
    to the shop the same day again and returned the button without
    the people knowing i found i could not become a thief then the
    question came why had i felt a criminal since my seventh year
    was it my fault if not whose fault was it not till i studied
    freuds psychoanalytical system did i get a clear insight into my
    own character
    when i was 20 years of age i met a gentleman one night in a
    heavy snowstorm we walked and talked and understood each other
    he belonged to one of swedens first aristocratic families he
    was extremely refined he asked me to his rooms we undressed and
    lay down he had a very beautiful head and a still more beautiful
    body i think that all my erotic feelings were numbed by looking
    at his beautiful body to me anything sensual would have been
    sacrilege i thought and i can remember the feeling of awe which
    came over me he was them 20 years of age but his hair was quite
    white first he did not understand and then he was very gentle
    to me i kept perfectly chaste for three whole months after the
    sight of his body we saw each other often eight years later we
    met for the last time he suffered much from melancholia at that
    time i prevented him from committing suicide this winter
    however he shot himself
    at the age of 22 my sister introduced me to a charming
    intelligent and refined halfenglish halfswedish painter we
    recognized each other at once though we had never seen each
    other before and even knew each others characters to the
    smallest traits my parents liked him better than any friend i
    had ever had my sister and he were from the first like sister
    and brother the first evening in my home he and i kissed each
    other the women were mad about him later i found many men were
    too i was three weeks his senior he had his own rooms i have
    never felt any such wonderful harmony as when our naked bodies
    mingled it was like floating in ether with him it was the only
    time i had been active in fellatio we were much together
    though not much physically for he had many love affairs with
    women what i loved was the way he would cut off all advances of
    men i was his little brother and so he calls me to this day
    he is now married in america and the father of a pretty little
    daughter we are the best of friends to this day
    the two years in copenhagen were some of the happiest i have
    spent though nearly the whole time i was in physical pain in
    austria i found among the tyrolese peasants that the
    englishmen who come there in winter for sports and in the summer
    for mountain climbing have demoralized the young male peasants
    with money homosexual intercourse is easy to get if you are
    willing to pay the pricelarger in season less out of season
    in italy it is merely a question of money or passion but
    everything in love there is quite transient
    in bavaria i found the love and peace which passeth all
    understanding this love and friendship without anything of a
    physically intimate nature brought me back from the deep black
    gulf to which i was swiftly floating when i met my friend i was
    nearly at the end of my tether what his love and friendship has
    done for me together with freuds psychoanalytical system
    nobody will ever know
    since being in berlin a town i like very much a new life has
    opened for me a life where one lives as one likes if one does
    not have to do with young boys here are homosexual baths
    pensions restaurants and hotels where you can go with one of
    your own sex at a certain fee per hour berlin is a revelation
    but since being here i find the physical erotic side of my nature
    is little excited i suppose it is the old story of forbidden
    fruit
    my parents kept a very hospitable home the last two years in
    sweden i was never at home i hated society and knew much too
    much about the private histories of those who came to my home
    they all belonged to the highest society the highest society and
    the lowest are very much alike of course my parents knew nothing
    about these people when i told my mother a great deal of private
    history of people who came to our house she was thunderstruck
    and could at last understand my contempt for socalled good
    society i have visited in later years only in artistic and
    theatrical circles i consider that class of people more natural
    than the other class and much more kindhearted
    my life has quite another side the mystic side but that would
    be a much longer story than this suffice it to say i am of a
    highly sensitive nature gifted with second sight a detailed
    record of the subjects visions premonitions of death of
    acquaintances etc has been furnished by him
    i tried on four occasions to commit suicide but i now see there
    is nothing to be gained by doing so
    two years ago i told my parents about my sexual condition it
    was a frightful blow to them my father had the circumstances
    explained to him he never understood the matter and never
    discussed it with me had i told him earlier i feel quite certain
    that with his despotic nature he would have put me in a
    madhouse my mother and sister have treated me very kindly
    always my brother has disowned me
    history xviirish aged 36 knows of nothing unusual in his
    ancestry his tastes are masculine in every respect he is
    strong healthy and fond of exercises and sports the sexual
    instincts are abnormally developed he confesses to an enormous
    appetite for almost everythingfood drink smoking and all
    the good things of life
    at about the age of 14 he practised masturbation with other boys
    of the same age and also had much pleasure in being in bed with
    an uncle with whom the same thing was practised later on he
    practised masturbation with every boy or man with whom he was on
    terms of intimacy to have been in bed with anyone without
    anything of the sort taking place would have made sleep
    impossible and rendered him utterly wretched his erotic dreams
    at first were concerned with women but more recently they are
    usually of young men and very rarely of women he is mostly
    indifferent to women as also they have always been to him
    although goodlooking strong and masculine he has never known
    a woman to be in love with him when about the age of 18 he
    imagined he was in love with a girl and he had often between
    the ages of 20 to 30 cohabited with prostitutes he remembers on
    one occasion many years ago having connection with a woman
    seven or eight times in one night and then having to masturbate
    at noon the next day he is unmarried and thinks it is unlikely
    that he ever will marry but he adds that if a healthy handsome
    and intelligent woman fell in love with him he might change his
    mind as it would be lonely to be old and alone and he would
    like to have children
    he is never attracted to men older than himself and prefers
    youths between the ages of 18 and 25 they may be of any class
    but he does not like common people and is not attached to
    uniforms or liveries the requisite attractions are an
    intelligent eye a voluptuous mouth and intelligent teeth if
    alcibiades himself tried to woo me he says and had bad teeth
    his labor would be in vain he has sometimes been the active
    participant in pedicatio and has tried the passive rle out of
    curiosity but prefers fellatio
    he does not consider that he is doing anything wrong and regards
    his acts as quite natural his only regret is the absorbing
    nature of his passions which obtrude themselves in season and
    out of season seldom or never leaving him quiet and sometimes
    making his life a hell yet he doubts whether he would change
    himself even if he had the power
    history xviiage 25 is employed in an ordinary workshop and
    lives in the back alley of a large town in which he was born and
    bred fair slight and refined in appearance the sexual organs
    are normal and well developed and the sexual passions strong
    his mother is a big masculine woman and he is much attached to
    her father is slight and weakly he has seven brothers and one
    sister homosexual desires began at an early age though he does
    not seem to have come under any perverse influences he is not
    inclined to masturbation erotic dreams are always of males he
    declares he never cared for any woman except his mother and that
    he could not endure to sleep with a woman
    he says he generally falls in love with a man at first sightas
    a rule some one older than himself and of higher classand
    longs to sleep and be with him in one case he fell in love with
    a man twice his own age and would not rest until he had won his
    affection he does not much care what form the sexual relation
    takes he is sensitive and feminine by nature gentle and
    affectionate he is neat and orderly in his habits and fond of
    housework helps his mother in washing etc he appears to think
    that male attachments are perfectly natural
    history xviiienglishman born in paris aged 26 an actor he
    belongs to an old english family his father so far as he is
    aware had no homosexual inclinations nor had any of his
    ancestors on the paternal side but he believes that his
    mothers family and especially a maternal uncle who had a strong
    feeling for beauty of form were more akin to him in this
    respect
    his earliest recollections show an attraction for males at
    childrens parties he incurred his fathers anger by kissing
    other small boys and his feelings grew in intensity with years
    he has never practised selfabuse and seldom had erotic dreams
    when they do occur they are about males
    his physical feeling for women is one of absolute indifference
    he admires beautiful women in the same way as one admires
    beautiful scenery at the same time he likes to talk with clever
    women and has formed many friendships with frank pure and
    cultivated english girls for whom he has the utmost admiration
    and respect marriage is impossible because physical pleasure
    with women is impossible he has tried but cannot obtain the
    slightest sexual feeling or excitement
    he especially admires youths though they must not be immature
    from 16 or 17 to about 25 the type which physically appeals to
    him most and to which he appeals is fair smoothskinned
    gentle rather girlish and effeminate with the effeminacy of the
    ingnue not the cocotte his favorite to attract him must be
    submissive and womanly he likes to be the man and the master on
    this point he adds the great passion of my life is an
    exception and stands on an utterly different level it realizes
    an ideal of marriage in which neither is master but both share a
    joint empire and in which tyranny would be equally painful to
    both but this friendship and love is for an equal a year
    younger than myself and does not preclude other and less
    creditable liaisons physical constancy being impossible to men
    of our caliber
    pedicatio is the satisfaction he prefers provided he takes the
    active never the passive rle he is handsome with broad
    shoulders good figure and somewhat classic type of face with
    fine blue eyes he likes boating and skating though not cricket
    or football and is usually ready for fun but has at the same
    time a taste for reading
    he has no moral feelings on these matters he regards them as
    outside ethics mere matters of temperament and social feeling
    if england were underpopulated he thinks he might possibly feel
    some slight pangs of remorse but as things are he feels that
    in prostituting males rather than females he is doing a
    meritorious action
    history xixtn his history is given in his own words
    from the time of my earliest imaginings i have always been
    attached by strength in men and often thought about being carried
    off by big warriors and living with them in caves and elsewhere
    when about 7 a young man used to show me his penis and handle
    mine occasionally at private boarding school masturbation was
    fairly frequent and i suppose i was initiated about 12 or 13
    after leaving i occasionally indulged but nothing happened until
    i was about 20 except that i was often attracted by strong
    wellbuilt young men of good character a man who was not honest
    and goodhearted had no attraction at 20 i was much attached to
    a young man of my own age he was engaged this did not prevent
    him on one occasion endeavoring playfully and with his brother to
    obtain access to my person i successfully resisted although if
    he only had been present i should not have done so but
    welcomed the attempt and i have often regretted i did not let
    him know this but i had a dim idea that my penis was somewhat
    undeveloped and this made me shy circumstances separated us
    about two years later i was crossing the channel when i engaged
    in conversation with a man about eight years older who was one
    of our travelling party i think the attraction was a case of
    love at sight certainly on my side a few nights later he had so
    arranged that we shared a bedroom and he very soon came over to
    me and tenderly handled my person i reciprocated and i look back
    all these years to that night with pleasure and no feeling of
    shame on one occasion about this time i happened to be
    sleeping with another young fellow an office mate on a holiday
    when i awoke and found him handling my penis caressingly i
    gently removed his hand and turned over i thought none the less
    of him but my body seemed to belong only to myself and the
    friend i loved he was not an urning i am sure but we were
    often together and i much entered into his interests and felt
    infinite satisfaction with life made good progress and many
    friends our physical intimacy was repeated he taking the active
    part in intercrural contact then he married very happily our
    friendship remains but circumstances prevent our often meeting
    and there is no longer desire on either part
    for some years i was rather lonely in spite of friends i was
    somewhat attracted to another man but his superior social
    position was a defect to me then when about 28 i came in contact
    with a young man of 24 of the artisan class but superior in
    ideals and intelligence to most men i loved him at first glance
    and to this day at first it was just friendship but soon his
    form voice and thoughts entered into my very soul by day and
    night i longed always to be near him to see him progress and
    help him if i could i would joyfully have given up home
    friends and income and followed him to the end of the world
    preferably an island where we two might at least be the only
    white men he seemed to embody all i longed for in the way of
    knowledge of nature of strength of practical ability and the
    desire to imitate him in these things widened and strengthened my
    character the first time i slept with him i could only summon
    courage to put my arm over his chest but i could not sleep for
    unsatisfied desire and the unrelieved erection caused a dull
    pain on the morrow i had always disliked conversation that might
    be regarded as bordering on the obscene and consequently was
    very ignorant on most matters it pained me even to hear him
    laugh at such remarks i think if he had been intimate with me i
    should have not conversed much on such topics but now i felt
    pleasure in such things with him as they expressed intimacy i
    dreamed about him and was never really happy in his absence the
    greatest joy would have been to have slept in his arms the
    hairiness of his legs and arms were also most fascinating
    perhaps a year later we were again at night together and this
    time i by degrees felt his private organs but he was cold and i
    felt a little unsatisfied i wanted to be hugged this happened
    once more and then on a later occasionnot that it afforded me
    much gratification but because i wanted to stimulate him to
    ardori attempted masturbation this aroused his disgust and i
    was consequently dismayed he told me i ought to marry and
    although i knew his love was all i wanted i did not feel but
    what i could make a woman happy the constant unrelieved
    erections which took place when i saw my friend adopt a graceful
    attitude caused pain at the bottom of my back and i consulted
    two specialists who also advised marriage i did not tell them i
    was an invert for i hardly knew it was a recognized thing but
    i did tell them something of what had taken place and they made
    next to no comment but implied it was frequent my friend now
    felt repulsion toward me but did not express himself and as
    other circumstances then caused a barrier between us to a certain
    extent i did not realize the true reason of his coldness but i
    felt utterly miserable when i met a noble woman whom i had long
    known i asked her to be my wife and she consented although i
    told her very soon and long before our marriage of my
    limitations as a husband and of my continued longing for my
    friend i feel now i did a great wrong and i cannot understand
    why i was not more conscious of this at the time that i was to a
    certain extent deceiving her relations was inevitable i had
    expected to devote my life in making her happy but i soon found
    that the true reason of my friends apparent unfaithfulness was
    my own action combined with a feeling on his part that it was as
    well that our affection should cease even at the cost of
    misunderstanding since then three years ago i have not had a
    happy day or night and am therefore quite unable to promote
    happiness in others without my friend i can find no
    satisfaction with wife child or home life has become almost
    unbearable often i have seriously thought of committing suicide
    only to postpone it to a time which would be less cruelly
    inopportune to others i see my friend now married almost
    daily and suffer tortures at seeing others nearer to him than
    myself no explanation seems possible as the whole idea of
    inversion is so repugnant to him and being an honorable man he
    would feel marital ties preclude any warmth of affection but
    all the longing of my life seems to be culminating in a driving
    force which will carry me to the male prostitute or to death i
    can concentrate my mind on nothing else and consequently have
    become inefficient in work and have no heart for play i know if
    my longings could be occasionally satisfied i should immediately
    recover but my fear is that if i killed myself those who knew me
    in happier days would only be confirmed in the impression of my
    degeneracy and would feel my instincts had caused it whereas it
    is the denial and starvation of them which would have brought
    about the result i know now by experience of self and others
    that my disposition is congenital and that i have been rendered
    unhappy myself and a cause of unhappiness to others by the too
    late knowledge of myself the example of my former friend who
    married misled me to think i too could marry and make a happy
    home so that when the man i loved advised me i resolved to do
    so as i would have done almost anything else he suggested if
    i could have withdrawn from the engagement without embarrassment
    to the devoted woman who became my wife i would have done so if
    she gave me the opportunity nothing in my married state has
    brought me pleasure and i often wish my wife would cease to love
    me so that we might separate but she would be heartbroken at
    the suggestion and i feel driven to attempt to relieve my
    feelings even in a way that has previously seemed repulsive to
    mei mean by use of money
    about my feelings toward my child there is not much to say as
    they are not very strong i believe i carry him and help bathe
    and attend to him as much as most fathers and when he is a few
    years older i hope i may find him very companionable but he has
    brought me no real joy though i see other men look at him almost
    with affection but he has brought added happiness to his
    mother
the next case is interesting as showing the mental and emotional
development in a very radical case of sexual inversion
    history xxenglishman of independent means aged 49 his
    father and his fathers family were robust healthy and
    prolific on his mothers side phthisis insanity and
    eccentricity are traceable he belongs to a large family some of
    whom died in early childhood and at birth while others are
    normal he himself was a weakly and highly nervous child subject
    to nightterrors and somnambulism excessive shyness and
    religious disquietude
    sexual consciousness awoke before the age of 8 when his
    attention was directed to his own penis his nurse while out
    walking with him one day told him that when little boys grow
    up their penes fall off the nurserymaid sniggered and he felt
    that there must be something peculiar about the penis he
    suffered from irritability of the prepuce and the nurse
    powdered it before he went to sleep there was no transition from
    this to selfabuse
    about the same time he became subject to curious halfwaking
    dreams in these he imagined himself the servant of several adult
    naked sailors he crouched between their thighs and called
    himself their dirty pig and by their orders he performed
    services for their genitals and buttocks which he contemplated
    and handled with relish at about the same period when these
    visions began to come to him he casually heard that a man used
    to come and expose his person before the window of a room where
    the maids sat this troubled him vaguely between the age of 8
    and 11 he twice took the penis of a cousin into his mouth after
    they had slept together the feeling of the penis pleased him
    when sleeping with another cousin they used to lie with hands
    outstretched to cover each others penis or nates he preferred
    the nates but his cousin the penis neither of these cousins was
    homosexual and there was no attempt at mutual masturbation he
    was in the habit of playing with five male cousins one of these
    boys was unpopular with the others and they invented a method of
    punishing him for supposed offenses they sat around the room on
    chairs each with his penis exposed and the boy to be punished
    went around the room on his knees and took each penis into his
    mouth in turn this was supposed to humiliate him it did not
    lead to masturbation on one occasion the child accidentally
    observed a boy who sat next to him in school playing with his
    penis and caressing it this gave him a powerful uneasy
    sensation with regard to all these points the subject observes
    that none of the boys with whom he was connected at this period
    and who were exposed to precisely the same influences became
    homosexual
    he was himself from the first indifferent to the opposite sex
    in early childhood and up to the age of 13 he had frequent
    opportunities of closely inspecting the sexual organs of girls
    his playfellows these roused no sexual excitement on the
    contrary the smell of the female parts affected him
    disagreeably when he once saw a schoolfellow copulating with a
    little girl it gave him a sense of mystical horror nor did the
    sight of the male organs arouse any particular sensations he is
    however of opinion that living with his sisters in childhood
    he felt more curious about his own sex as being more remote from
    him he showed no effeminacy in his preferences for games or
    work
    he went to a public school here he was provoked by boy friends
    to masturbate but though he often saw the act in process it
    only inspired him with a sense of indecency in his fifteenth
    year puberty commenced with nocturnal emissions and at the
    same time he began to masturbate and continued to do so about
    once a week or once a fortnight during a period of eight
    months always with a feeling that that was a poor satisfaction
    and repulsive his thoughts were not directed either to males or
    females while masturbating he spoke to his father about these
    signs of puberty and by his fathers advice he entirely
    abandoned onanism he only resumed the practice to some extent
    after the age of 30 when he was without male comradeship
    the nocturnal emissions after he had abandoned selfabuse
    became very frequent and exhausting they were medically treated
    by tonics such as quinine and strychnine he thinks this
    treatment exaggerated his neurosis
    all this time no kind of sexual feeling for girls made itself
    felt he could not understand what his schoolfellows found in
    women or the stories they told about wantonness and delight of
    coitus
    his old dreams about the sailors had disappeared but now he
    enjoyed visions of beautiful young men and exquisite statues he
    often shed tears when he thought of them these dreams persisted
    for years but another kind gradually usurped their place to some
    extent these second visions took the form of the large erect
    organs of naked young grooms or peasants these gross visions
    offended his taste and hurt him though at the same time they
    evoked a strong active desire for possession he took a strange
    poetic pleasure in the ideal form but the seminal losses which
    accompanied both kinds of dreams were a perpetual source of
    misery to him
    there is no doubt that at this timethat is between the
    fifteenth and seventeenth yearsa homosexual diathesis had
    become established he never frequented loose women though he
    sometimes thought that would be the best way of combating his
    growing inclination for males and he thinks that he might have
    brought himself to indulge freely in purely sexual pleasure with
    women if he made their first acquaintance in a male costume as
    dbardeuses cherubino courtpages young halberdiers as it
    is only when so clothed that women on the stage or in the
    ballroom have excited him
    his ideal of morality and fear of venereal infection more than
    physical incapacity kept him what is called chaste he never
    dreamed of women never sought their society never felt the
    slightest sexual excitement in their presence never idealized
    them esthetically he thought them far less beautiful than men
    statues and pictures of naked women had no attraction for him
    while all objects of art which represented handsome males deeply
    stirred him
    it was in his eighteenth year that an event occurred which he
    regards as decisive in his development he read plato a new
    world opened and he felt that his own nature had been revealed
    next year he formed a passionate but pure friendship with a boy
    of 15 personal contact with the boy caused erection extreme
    agitation and aching pleasure but not ejaculation through four
    years he never saw the boy naked or touched him pruriently only
    twice he kissed him he says that these two kisses were the most
    perfect joys he ever felt
    his father now became seriously anxious both about his health and
    his reputation he warned him of the social and legal dangers
    attending his temperament but he did not encourage him to try
    coitus with women he himself thinks that his own sense of danger
    might have made this method successful or that at all events
    the habit of intercourse with women might have lessened neurosis
    and diverted his mind to some extent from homosexual thoughts
    a period of great pain and anxiety now opened for him but his
    neurasthenia increased he suffered from insomnia obscure
    cerebral discomfort stammering chronic conjunctivitis
    inability to concentrate his attention and dejection meanwhile
    his homosexual emotions strengthened and assumed a more sensual
    character he abstained from indulging them as also from
    onanism but he was often forced with shame and reluctance to
    frequent placesbaths urinaries and so forthwhere there were
    opportunities of seeing naked men
    having no passion for women it was easy to avoid them yet they
    inspired him with no exact horror he used to dream of finding an
    exit from his painful situation by cohabitation with some coarse
    boyish girl of the people but his dread of syphilis stood in the
    way he felt however that he must conquer himself by efforts of
    will and by a persistent direction of his thoughts to
    heterosexual images he sought the society of distinguished
    women once he coaxed up a romantic affection for a young girl of
    15 which came to nothing probably because the girl felt the
    want of absolute passion in his wooing she excited his
    imagination and he really loved her but she did not even in
    the closest contact stimulate his sexual appetite once when he
    kissed her just after she had risen from bed in the morning a
    curious physical repugnance came over him attended with a sad
    feeling of disappointment
    he was strongly advised to marry by physicians at last he did
    so he found that he was potent and begot several children but
    he also found to his disappointment that the tyranny of the
    male genital organs on his fancy increased owing to this cause
    his physical mental and moral discomfort became acute his
    health gave way
    at about the age of 30 unable to endure his position any longer
    he at last yielded to his sexual inclinations as he began to do
    this he also began to regain calm and comparative health he
    formed a close alliance with a youth of 19 this liaison was
    largely sentimental and marked by a kind of etherealized
    sensuality it involved no sexual acts beyond kissing naked
    contact and rare involuntary emissions about the age of 36 he
    began freely to follow homosexual inclinations after this he
    rapidly recovered his health the neurotic disturbances subsided
    he has always loved men younger than himself at about the age of
    27 he had begun to admire young soldiers since he yielded freely
    to his inclinations the men he has sought are invariably persons
    of a lower social rank than his own he carried on one liaison
    continuously for twelve years it began without passion on the
    friends side but gradually grew to nearly equal strength on
    both sides he is not attracted by uniforms but seeks some
    uncontaminated child of nature
    the methods of satisfaction have varied with the phases of his
    passion at first they were romantic and platonic when a
    handtouch a rare kiss or mere presence sufficed in the second
    period sleeping side by side inspection of the naked body of the
    loved man embracements and occasional emissions after prolonged
    contact in the third period the gratification became more
    frankly sensual it took every shape mutual masturbation
    intercrural coitus fellatio irrumatio and occasionally
    active pedicatio always according to the inclination or
    concession of the beloved male
    he himself always plays the active masculine part he never
    yields himself to the other and he asserts that he never has the
    joy of finding himself desired with ardor equal to his own he
    does not shrink from passive pedicatio but it is never
    demanded of him coitus with males as above described always
    seems to him healthy and natural it leaves a deep sense of
    wellbeing and has cemented durable friendships he has always
    sought to form permanent ties with the men whom he has adored so
    excessively
    he is of medium height not robust but with great nervous
    energy with strong power of will and selfcontrol able to
    resist fatigue and changes of external circumstances
    in boyhood he had no liking for female occupations or for the
    society of girls preferring study and solitude he avoided games
    and the noisy occupations of boys but was only nonmasculine in
    his indifference to sport was never feminine in dress or habit
    he never succeeded in his attempts to whistle he is a great
    smoker and has at times drunk much he likes riding skating
    and climbing but is a poor horseman and is clumsy with his
    hands he has no capacity for the fine arts and music though
    much interested in them and is a prolific author
    he has suffered extremely throughout life owing to his sense of
    the difference between himself and normal human beings no
    pleasure he has enjoyed he declares can equal a thousandth
    part of the pain caused by the internal consciousness of
    pariahdom the utmost he can plead in his own defense he admits
    is irresponsibility for he acknowledges that his impulse may be
    morbid but he feels absolutely certain that in early life his
    health was ruined and his moral repose destroyed owing to the
    perpetual conflict with his own inborn nature and that relief
    and strength came with indulgence although he always has before
    him the terror of discovery he is convinced that his sexual
    dealings with men have been thoroughly wholesome to himself
    largely increasing his physical moral and intellectual energy
    and not injurious to others he has no sense whatever of moral
    wrong in his actions and he regards the attitude of society
    toward those in his position as utterly unjust and founded on
    false principles
the next case is like the foregoing that of a successful man of letters
who also passed through a long period of mental conflict before he became
reconciled to his homosexual instincts he belongs to a family who are all
healthy and have shown marked ability in different intellectual
departments he feels certain that one of his brothers is as absolute an
invert as himself and that another is attracted to both sexes i am
indebted to him for the following detailed narrative describing his
emotions and experiences in childhood which i regard as of very great
interest not only as a contribution to the psychology of inversion but
to the embryology of the sexual emotions generally we here see described
in an unduly precocious and hyperesthetic form ideas and feelings which
in a slighter and more fragmentary shape may be paralleled in the early
experiences of many normal men and women but it must be rare to find so
many points in sexual psychology so definitely illustrated in a single
child it may be added that the narrative is also not without interest as
a study in the evolution of a man of letters a child whose imagination
was thus early exercised and developed was predestined for a literary
career
    history xxialmost the earliest recollection i have is of a
    dream which from my vivid recollection of its details must
    have repeated itself i think more than once unless my waking
    thoughts unconsciously added definition from this dream dated my
    consciousness of the attraction to me of my own sex which has
    ever since dominated my life the dream suggested in part i
    think by a picture in an illustrated newspaper of a mob
    murdering a church dignitary took this form i dreamed that i
    saw my own father murdered by a gang of ruffians but i do not
    remember that i felt any grief though i was actually an
    exceedingly affectionate child the body was then stripped of its
    clothing and eviscerated i had at the time no notion of
    anatomical details but the particulars remain distinct to my
    minds eye of entrails uniformly brown the color of dung and
    there was no accompaniment of blood when the abdomen had been
    emptied the incident in which i became an active participant
    occurred i was seized and the fact that i was overpowered
    contributed to the agony of delight it afforded me and was laid
    between the thighs of my murdered parent and from there i had
    presently crawled my way into the evacuated abdomen the act so
    far as i can decide of a dream at an age when emission was out of
    the question caused in me extreme organic excitement at all
    events i used afterward definitely to recur to it in the waking
    moments before sleep for the purpose of gaining a state of
    erection the dream had no outcome it seemed to reach its goal
    in the excitement it caused i was at that time between 3 and 4
    years old i have been told that erections occurred when i was
    only 2 years old it was between 3 and 4 that i used to induce
    at all events the sensation of an erection but i was nearer 5
    when sitting on my bed and waiting to be dressed i got an
    involuntary erection and called my nurses attention to it
    asking what it meant the appearance must therefore have been
    usual to me at that date but certainly the sensation was not
    at that time i was totally ignorant of the conditions of
    puberty which afterward when i discovered them so powerfully
    affected me i could not even visualize the private organs of a
    man i made no deductions from myself the only naked bodies i
    had seen theni judge from circumstances not from any actual
    memory of the factswere those of my own sisters in the waking
    dreams which i began to construct though i recurred often to the
    one already narrated the goal of my desire was generally to
    nestle between the thighs or to have my face pressed against the
    hinder parts of the object of my worship but for a time my first
    dream so engrossed me that i did not indulge in any promiscuity
    gradually however my horizon enlarged and took in besides the
    first mentioned three others a cousin very much my elder an
    uncle and the curate of the parish
    at this stage i began to invent circumstances for the indulgence
    of my passion one of the earliest was to imagine myself in a
    tank with my three lovers floating in the water above me from
    this position i visited their limbs in turn the attraction
    rested in the thighs and buttocks only i fancy this limitation
    of the charm to the lower parts only lasted until actual
    experience of a more complete embrace made me as much a lover of
    the arms and breast indeed later i became more emotionally
    enamored of these parts than of all the rest at the beginning of
    things i simply loved best what my mind could first get hold of
    quite early in my experience when i was not more than 5 i
    awoke earlier than usual and saw my nurse standing in complete
    nudity commencing her toilet she seemed to me a gross coarse
    and meaningless object the hair under her armpits displeased me
    and still more that on the lower part of her body in the case of
    men directly i came to have cognizance of the same thing on
    their bodies the effect was exactly the opposite it so happened
    that about this time the gardener had received some injury to his
    leg and in showing the bruise to another exhibited before my
    eyes a skin completely shagged over with dark hair though the
    sight of the bruise repulsed me my pleasure was intense and the
    vision of the gardeners legs was in my bed every night for a
    week afterward my point is that the sight of my nurse was liable
    to rouse interest just as much as the far more prosaic display of
    the gardeners wounded leg but my nature made it impossible
    it was about this time if not before that an enormous sense of
    shyness with regard to all my private duties began to afflict me
    so great was it that i could endure from no hand except my
    mothers or my nurses the necessary assistance in the buttoning
    and unbuttoning of my garments always excepting those who were
    about my own age toward whom i felt no privacy whatever
    when i was a little more than 5 i formed a friendship with a
    young clerk a youth of about 15 though he seemed to me a
    grownup person one day as he sat at his desk writing i sat
    down and began playing with his feet investigating the height to
    which his socks went under his trousers in this way i obtained
    six inches of bare leg conscious of my courage i fell to kissing
    it my friend laughed but left me to my devotions in peace this
    was the first time in which a feeling of romance mixed itself in
    my dreams the physical excitement was less but the pleasure was
    greater i cannot understand why i never repeated the experience
    he remained to me an object of very special and tender
    consideration
    in the next episode i have to relate the ideal was totally
    absent and the part i played was passive rather than active i
    was put to sleep with a boy considerably my senior his
    initiation led to a physical familiarity between us which was not
    warm or kind and i was allowed no scope for my own instinctive
    desires for a warmer kind of contact if i sought it under cover
    of my companions slumbers i found myself kicked away only on
    one occasion did i find a few moments of supreme charm while his
    sleep remained sound by discovering in the recesses of the sheet
    an exposed surface of flesh against which i pressed my face in an
    abandonment of joy for the rest i was a passive participant his
    pleasure seeming to end in the mere handling of the fleshy
    portions of my body for this purpose i usually lay face downward
    across his knees so far as i can remember this intimacy led to
    a decrease in my pursuit of imaginative pleasures for about a
    year no further development took place
    at about this date i was circumcised on account of the prepuce
    being too long
    between the 6th and 7th years a change of environment brought me
    into contact with a new set of faces i had then a bed to myself
    and once more my imagination awoke to life it was at this time
    that i found myself constructing from mens faces suppositions as
    to the rest of their bodies a brown face led me to suppose a
    uniformly brown body a pale face a pale body this idea of
    variety began to charm me i now made definite choice in my
    reveries whether i would go to sleep between white thighs or red
    thighs or brown thighs going to sleep definitely describes the
    goal of the method to which i had addicted myself as soon as i
    entered my bed i abandoned myself to the construction of an amour
    and retained it as long as i had consciousness i may say that i
    was not conscious of any emissions under these circumstances
    until some years later when i brought it about by my own act
    but the pleasure was fairly acute
    all this time there were secret meetings with my bedfellow of
    the year before but they now took place by day in various
    hidingplaces with little unclothing or exposure and my
    companion was cold and fastidious and repelled any warmth on my
    part it became to me a dry sort of ritual i had an idea at that
    time that the whole thing was so much an original invention of
    his and mine that there was no likelihood of it being practised
    by anyone else in the world but this consideration did not
    restrain me in constructing love scenes with all those whose
    appearance attracted me at this period nearly every man with
    whom i came in contact won at least my transient desire only the
    quite old and deformed lay outside the scope of my wishes many
    of my amours developed in church the men who sat near me were
    the objects of my attention and the clergyman whose sermon i
    did not listen to supplied me with an occasion for reverie on
    the charms his person would have for me under other
    circumstances it must have been at this time that i began to
    elaborate ideas of a serried rank of congregated thighs across
    which i lay and was dragged i would arrange them in definite
    order and then imagine myself drawn across from one to the other
    somewhat forcibly admiration of strength was beginning at this
    time to have a definite part in my conceptions but anything of
    the nature of cruelty had not then appealed to me i except the
    original dream of my childhood which seems to me still to stand
    fantastically apart in the inventions to which i now gave
    myself the sense of being passed across limbs of different
    texture and color was subtle and pleasurable i think the note of
    constructive cruelty which now followed arose from an imagined
    rivalry among my lovers for possession of me the idea that i was
    desired made me soon take a delight in imagining myself torn and
    snatched about by the contending parties presently out of this i
    began constructing definite scenes of violence i was able in
    imagination to lie in the thick and stress of conglomerated
    deliciousness of thighs struggling to hold me i was able to
    imagine at least six bodies encircling me with passionate
    contact at the same time i had an ingrained feeling of my own
    physical smallness in relation to the limbs whose contact threw
    me into such paroxysms of delight a new and sufficiently
    ludicrous invention took possession of me i imagined myself
    strapped to the thigh always i think the right one of the man
    on whom i chose for the time to concentrate my desires and so
    to be worn by him during his days work hidden beneath his
    garments i was not conscious of any difficulty due to my size
    the charm of bondage and compulsion was here again in the
    ascendant i fancy that it was in this connection that i first
    anticipated whipping as the delightful climax to my emotions
    administered when my possessor at the end of his days work
    unclothed himself for rest
    up to this stage my attraction to the male organ of generation
    had been slight and vague two things now contributed to bring
    thought of it into prominence on two or three occasions when i
    accompanied farm laborers to their occupations i saw them pause
    by the way to relieve nature my extreme shyness as regards such
    matters in my own person made this performance in my presence
    like an outrage on my modesty it had about it the suggestion of
    an indecent solicitation to one whose inclination was to headlong
    and delirious surrender i stood rooted and flushing with
    downcast eyes till the act was over and was conscious for a
    considerable time of stammering speech and bewildered faculties
    when i afterward reviewed the circumstances they had the same
    attraction for me that amorous cruelty was just then beginning to
    exercise on my imagination my mind secretly embraced the fearful
    sweetness of the newly discovered sensation surrounding the
    performance of the function with all sorts of atrocious and
    bizarre inventions for a time my intellect hung back from
    accepting this as the central and most fiery secret of the male
    attraction but shortly afterward when out walking with my
    father i saw him perform the same act i was overwhelmed with
    emotion and could barely drag my feet from the spot or my eyes
    from the damp herbage where he had deposited the waters of
    secrecy even today when my mind has been long accustomed to the
    knowledge of generative facts i cannot dissociate myself from
    the shuddering charm that moment had for me the attraction my
    fathers person had always had for me was now increased tenfold
    by the performance i had witnessed though i had not seen the
    penis in any of these cases
    for a considerable time only those lovers were dominant in my
    imagination whom i had witnessed in the act that had so
    poignantly affected me my delight now took the form of imagining
    myself strapped to the thighs of the person while this function
    was in progress
    by this time i must have been 8 years old the cold and secret
    relationship of which i have given an account had continued
    without instructing me in any of the ardent possibilities it
    might have suggested no force or cruelty was used upon me no
    warmth was lavished it made little difference that my companion
    had now discovered the act of masturbation it had no meaning to
    me since it led to no warmth of embrace his method was to avert
    himself from me i had to fawn upon him from the rear and also to
    invent indecent stories to stimulate his imagination i felt
    myself a despised instrument the mere spectator of an act which
    if directed toward me with any warmth would have aroused the
    liveliest appetite at this time as i have since seen my
    companion was gaining knowledge from the ancient classics for a
    time some charm was imparted by his instructing me to adopt a
    superincumbent facetoface embrace the beginning of his puberty
    was enormously attractive to me had he been less coldblooded i
    could have responded passionately to his endearments but he
    always insisted on rigorous passivity on my part and he
    explained nothing one day by a small gratuity he induced me to
    offer him my mouth though i still had no comprehension of the
    result i was helping to attain once the orgasm occurred and the
    effect was extremely nauseous after that he was more careful my
    companion was approaching manhood and his demands became more
    frequent his exactions more humiliating
    at the same time my passion for male love was growing stronger
    i was able to construct from the unsatisfactory bondage in which
    i was held images of bodily embrace which i had not before had
    sufficient sense of human contact to form though i seldom
    imagined any of the acts that in actual experience repulsed me
    one day however i shirked a particularly repulsive humiliation
    which my companion had forced upon me he discovered the
    deception rose from the prone position in which he lay and
    throwing me across his knees thrashed me violently i submitted
    without a struggle experiencing a curious sensation of pleasure
    in the midst of my pain when he repeated his order i found its
    accomplishment no longer repulsive one of the few pleasurable
    memories this intimacy extending over years has left for me is
    that moment of abject abasement to one who with no warmth of
    feeling had yet once had sufficient energy to be brutal to me
    it must have been from this incident that the calculated effect
    of flagellation began to have weight with me when i indulged my
    imagination a wish to be repulsed trampled violated by the
    object of my passion took hold of my instincts even thenand
    indeed up to my 13th yeari had no idea of normal sexual
    connection i knew vaguely that children were born from womens
    bodies i did not knowand when told i did not believethe true
    facts of the marital relationship all that i had
    experiencedboth in fact and imaginationwas to me so highly
    individual that i had no notion anything kindred to it could
    exist outside of my own experience i had no notion of sex as the
    basis of life even when i came gradually to realize that men and
    women were formed in a way that argued connection with each
    other i still believed it to be a dissolute sort of conduct not
    to be indulged in by those who had claims to respectability
    i had however by this time arrived at a strong attraction
    toward the organs of generation and all aspects of puberty and
    my imagination spent itself in a fantastic worship of every sign
    of masculinity my enjoyment now was to imagine myself forced to
    undergo physical humiliation and submission to the caprice of my
    male captors and the central fact became the discharge of urine
    from my lover over my body and limbs or if i were very fond of
    him i let it be in my face this was followed usually by a
    halfcaressing castigation in which the hand only was
    instrumental
    the period of which i am now writing was that of my entry into
    school life my imaginary lovers immediately became numerous all
    the masters and all the boys above a certain age attracted me
    for two i had in addition a feeling of romantic as well as
    physical attachment indeed from this time onward i was never
    without some heroes toward whom i indulged a perfectly separate
    and tenderly ideal passion the announcement that one was about
    to leave surprised me into a passionate fit of weeping yet my
    reserve was so great and my sense of isolation so crushing that i
    made no effort at intimacy and to one for whom i felt
    inexhaustible devotion i barely spoke for the first three years
    though meeting him daily at this time the subjects of my
    contemplation had distinctly individualized methods of approach
    thus in one case i imagined we stood face to face in our
    nightgear suddenly mine was stripped from me i was seized and
    forcibly thrust under his and made to hang with my feet off the
    ground by my full weight on the erect organ which inserted
    itself between my thighs so suspendedmy body enveloped in the
    folds of his linen and my face pressed upon his hearti
    underwent a castigation which continued until i was thrown down
    to receive a discharge of urine over my prostrate body such
    images seemed to come independently of my will
    it was at this time that i found a large pleasure in imagining
    contact with people whom i disliked the prevailing note of these
    intimacies was always cruelty to which i submitted with acute
    relish i discovered however from the ordinary school
    experiences of corporal punishment that it had no charm to me
    when administered for school offenses even from the hands under
    which at other times i imagined myself as delighting to receive
    pain the necessary link was lacking had i perceived on the part
    of my judge any liking for the operation there would probably
    have been a response on my side on one occasion i was flogged
    unjustly conscious as i was of its cruel instead of judiciary
    character this was the only castigation i received which had in
    it an element of gratification for my instincts at the same time
    i never forgave the hand that administered it it is the only
    instance i remember in myself of a grudge nourished for years
    meanwhile amid this chaos of confused love and hatred of
    relish for cruelty and loathing for injustice my first
    thoroughly romantic and ideal attachment was developing itself i
    may say of those to whom romance as well as physical attachment
    bound me that they have remained unchangeable parts of my
    nature today as it was twenty years ago when i think of them
    the blood gushes to my brain my hands tingle and moisten with an
    emotion i cannot subdue i am at their feet worshipping them of
    them my dreams were entirely tender the idea of cruelty never
    touched the conception i had of them but i return to that one
    who was the chief influence of my youth older than myself by
    only three years he was of fine build and athletic with
    adolescence showing in his face my tremulous beginnings of
    worship were confirmed by a word of encouragement thrown to me
    one day as i went to receive my first flogging no doubt my
    small scared face excited his kind pity i made it my concern
    afterward to let him know that i had not cried under the ordeal
    and i believe he passed the word around that i had taken my
    punishment pluckily so little contact had i with him that beyond
    constant worship on my part i remember nothing till about three
    years later i received from him a kind halfjoking
    solicitation spoken in clean and simple language so terrific
    was my shyness and secrecy that i had even then no idea that
    familiarity of the sort was common enough in schools i was
    absolutely unable to connect my own sensations with those of the
    world at large or to believe that others felt as i did on this
    occasion i simply felt that some shrewd thrust had been made at
    me for the detection of my secret he had drawn me upon his knee
    i sat there silent flushing and dumbfounded he made no attempt
    to press me he had as he thought said enough if i chose to be
    reciprocal beyond that he would not tempt me a few years ago i
    heard of him married and prosperous
    in following up my emotions in this direction i have far
    outstripped the period up to which i have given a complete
    exposition of my development i must have been more than 12 years
    old before school life persuaded me to face as taught by
    sniggering novices the actual facts of sexual intercourse at
    the same time i learned that i had means of extracting enjoyment
    from my own body in a definite direction which i had not till
    then suspected a growing resistance on my part to his cold
    desires had led to a break with my former intimate to the last
    he had taught me nothing except distaste for himself i now
    found ready teachers right and left of me one of my
    schoolfellows invited me to watch him in the process of
    masturbation the spectacle left me quite unmoved the result
    appeared to me far less exciting than the discharge of urine
    which until then i had associated with male virility i was so
    accustomed to my own lone amorous broodings that the effort and
    action required for this process when i attempted to imitate it
    disconcerted my thoughts and interfered with concentration on my
    own inventions i had never experienced the pleasure accompanying
    the spasm of emission and there seemed to be nothing worth
    trying for along that road i desisted and returned to my
    reveries i was now in a perfect maze of promiscuity there must
    have been at least fifty people who attracted me at that time i
    developed a liking for imagining myself between two lovers
    generally men who were physical contrasts it was my habit to
    analyze as minutely as possible those who attracted me to gain
    intimacy with what was below the surface i studied with attention
    their hands the wrists where they disappeared showing the hair
    of the forearm and the neck i estimated the comparative size
    of the generative organs the formation of the thighs and
    buttocks and thus constructed a presentment of the whole man
    the more vividly i could do this the keener was the pleasure i
    was able to obtain from their contemplated embraces
    till now i had been absolutely untouched by any moral scruples
    i had the usual acquiescence in the religious beliefs in which i
    had been trained it did not enter my head that there was any
    divine law one way or the other concerning the allurements of
    the imagination from my thirteenth year slight hints of
    uneasiness began to creep into my conscience i began perhaps to
    understand that the formulas of religion to which i had listened
    all my life with as little attention as possible had some
    meaning which now and then touched the circumstances of my own
    life i had not yet realized that my past foretold my future and
    that women would be to me a repulsion instead of an attraction
    where things sexual were concerned i had the full conviction
    that one day i should be married i had also some fear that as i
    grew to manhood i might succumb to the temptations of loose
    women i had an incipient revulsion from such a fate and this
    seemed to me to indicate that moral stirrings were at work within
    me one night i was amorously attacked in my bedroom by two of
    the domestics i experienced an acute horror which i hid under
    laughter my resistance was so desperate that i escaped with a
    tickling i had been accustomed to sit on the servants knees a
    habit i had innocently retained from childhood i can now recall
    in detail the approaches these women had been used to make me at
    the time i was utterly oblivious that anything was intended
    i was equally oblivious to things that had a nearer relation to
    my own feelings in passing along a sidestreet one night i was
    overtaken by a man who began conversation on the weather he
    asked me if i were not cold began passing his hand up and down
    my back then came a question about caning at school whether
    certain parts of me were not sore leading to an investigating
    touch i put his hand aside shyly but did not resent the action
    presently he was for exploring my trousers pockets and i began to
    think him a pickpocket repulsed in that direction he returned
    to rubbing my back the sensation was pleasant i now took him
    for a pimp who wished to take me to a prostitute and as at that
    time i had begun to realize that such pleasures were not to my
    taste i was glad to find myself at my destination and said
    goodbye sharply leaving him standing full of astonishment at
    his failure with one who had taken his advances so pleasantly i
    could not bring myself to believe that others had the same
    feelings as myself later i realized my escape not without a
    certain amount of regret and constructed for my own pleasure a
    different termination to the incident
    i was now so possessed by masculine attraction that i became a
    lover of all the heroes i read of in books some became as vivid
    to me as those with whom i was living in daily contact for a
    time i became an ardent lover of napolon the incident of his
    anticipation of the nuptials with his second wife attracting me
    by its impetuous brutality of edward i and of julius csar
    charles ii i remember by a caressing cruelty with which my
    imagination gifted him jugurtha was a great acquisition
    bothwell judge jefferies and many villains of history and
    fiction appealed to me by their cruelty
    i had become an adept in the mental construction necessary for
    the satisfaction of my desires and yet up to that date i had
    never seen the nude body of a fullgrown adult i had no
    knowledge of the extent to which hair in certain instances
    develops on the torso indeed my efforts at characterization
    centered for the most part around the thighs and generative
    organs at this time one of my schoolfellows saw a common
    workman known to me by name bathing in a stream with some
    companions all his body was my informant told me covered with
    hair from throat to belly in face the man was coarse and
    repulsive but i now began to regard him as a lovely monstrosity
    and for many nights embraced the vision of him passionately with
    face buried in the jungle growth of hair that covered his chest
    i was for the first time conscious of deliberately and
    successfully willing not to see his face which was distasteful
    to me at the same time another schoolfellow told me concerning
    a master who bathed with the boys that hair showed above his
    bathingdrawers as high as the navel i now began definitely to
    construct bodies in detail the suggestion of extensive hairiness
    maddened me with delight but remained in my mind strongly
    associated with cruelty my hairy lovers never behaved to me with
    tenderness everything at this period i think tended to draw me
    toward force and violence as an expression of amativeness a
    schoolfellow a few years my senior of a cruel bullying
    disposition took a particular delight in inflicting pain on me
    he had particularly pointed shoes and it was his custom to make
    me stand with my back to him while he addressed me in petting and
    caressing tones just when his words were at their kindliest he
    would inflict a sharp stroke with the toe of his boot so as to
    reach the most tender part of my fundament the pain was
    exquisite i was conscious that he experienced sexual pleasure i
    had seen definite signs of it beneath his clothing and though
    loathing him i would after i had suffered from his kicks throw
    myself into his imaginary embraces and indulge in a perfect rage
    of abject submission yet all the time i would gladly have killed
    him
    at the age of 14 i went for a time to a farmhouse where i
    was allowed to mingle familiarly with the farmlaborers a fine
    set of muscular young men i became a great favorite and having
    childish caressing manners a good deal behind my real age i was
    allowed to take many liberties with them they all lived under
    the farmers roof in the oldfashioned way and in the evening i
    used to sit on their knees and caress and hug them to my hearts
    content they took it phlegmatically it apparently gave them no
    surprise one of the men used to return my squeezes and caresses
    and once allowed me to put my hand under his shirt but there
    were no further liberties
    it was not until i was nearly 15 that the event happened which
    made me for the first time restless in my enforced solitude i
    was verging on puberty and perhaps in the hope that i should
    find my own development met by a corresponding warmth i again
    came into intimate relations with the companion whose frigid
    performances had caused me weariness and disgust he was now a
    man having reached majority he put me into his bed while he
    undressed himself and came toward me in perfect nudity in a
    moment we were in each others arms and the deliciousness of that
    moment intoxicated me suddenly lying on the bed i felt
    attacked as i thought by an imperative need to make water i
    leaped up with a hurried excuse but already the paroxysm had
    subsided no discharge came to my relief yet the need seemed to
    have passed i returned to my companion but the glamour of the
    meeting was already over my companion evidently found more
    pleasure in my person than when i was a mere child i felt moved
    and flattered by the pleasure he took in pressing his face
    against certain parts of my body on a second occasion one day
    i seemed involuntarily about to transgress decency but again as
    before separated myself and remained ignorant of what it was on
    which i had verged in my excitement at another meeting however
    i had been allowed to prolong my embrace and to act indeed upon
    my full instincts once more i felt suddenly the coming of
    something acutely impending i took my courage in my hands and
    went boldly forward in another moment i had hold of the
    mysterious secret of masculine energy to which all my years of
    dilirious imaginings had been but as a waiting at the threshold
    the knocking on a closed door
    it was inevitable that from that day our intimacy should dwindle
    into dissolution though other causes anticipated this natural
    decay but i no longer found masturbation a dry and wearisome
    formula in my novitiate i was disheartened to find how long it
    took me to dissociate myself from the contemplative and attach
    myself to the active form of selfgratification but i presently
    found myself committed to the repetition of the act three times a
    day on almost the last occasion i met my intimate he showed an
    exceptional ardor at that meeting he proposed to attempt an act
    i had not previously considered possible far less had i heard
    that it was considered the worst criminal connection that could
    take place i had a slight fear of pain but was willing to
    gratify him and for the first time found in my submission a
    union of the two amative instincts which had before disputed sway
    in me the instinct for tenderness and the instinct for cruelty
    pedicatio failed to take place but i received an embrace which
    for the first time gave me full satisfaction my delight was
    enormous i was filled with emotions i have no words to describe
    the extraordinary charm of the warm smooth flesh upon mine and
    the rougher contact of the hairy parts yet i was conscious even
    at the time that this was but the physical side of pleasure and
    that he was not and never could be one whom i might truly be said
    to love
    i was now in my sixteenth year and under the influence of these
    and many other emotions then for the first time beginning to
    seize me a sense of literary power and a desire to express
    myself through imaginative channels began to take hold of me i
    feared that my indulgence was having an enfeebling power on my
    faculties i had begun to experience physical languor and
    depression and certain religious scruples the result of my
    early training took hold of me for the first time i became
    conscious that the ardors i felt toward my own sex were a
    diversion of the sexinstinct itself and to my astonishment and
    consternation i found by chance the practices i had already
    indulged in definitely denounced in the bible as an abomination
    from that moment began a struggle which lasted for years i made
    a final breach with my former intimate and thereupon a long
    dispute took place between the conflicting influences that strove
    for possession of my body for a time i broke off the habit of
    masturbation but i could not so easily rid myself of the mental
    indulgence which was now almost an essential sedative for
    inducing sleep at this time a visit to the seaside where for
    the first time i was able to see men bathing in complete nudity
    frankly in the full light of day plunged me again for a time
    headforemost into imaginative amours and my scruples and
    resolutions were flung to the winds but on the whole i had now
    entered a stage which for want of a better term i must describe
    as the emotionally moral to whatever depth of indulgence i
    descended i carried a sense of obliquity with me i believed that
    i was a rebel from a law natural and divine of which yet no
    instinct had been implanted in me i still held unquestioned the
    truth of the religion i had been brought up in and my whole
    life every thought of my brain every impulse of my body were
    in direct antagonism to the will of god at times physical desire
    broke down these barriers but i practised considerable restraint
    physically though not mentally and made great efforts to
    conquer my aversion from women and extreme devotion for men
    without the slightest success i was 30 however before i found
    a companion to love me in the way my nature required i am quite
    a healthy person and capable of working at very high pressure
    under sexual freedom i have become stronger
    history xxiitj aged 50 man of letters height 5 feet 7
    inches weight 10 stone but formerly much less belongs to an
    entirely normal family all married and with children
    owing to the fact that my mother suffered from some malady the
    whole period of gestation prior to my birth i came into the
    world so puny a child so illnourished that for some time the
    doctors despaired of my life till the age of puberty though
    never ill i suffered greatly from delicate health i was
    abnormally sensitive and all my affections and passions
    extraordinarily developed owing to my brothers being much older
    than myself i was thrown into the society of my sister till 8
    years old she was my chief playmate with her i played with dolls
    and abandoned myself wholly to the delights of an imaginary land
    which was much more real to me than the world around me i never
    remember learning to read but at 5 the arabian nights and
    kingsleys hereward the wake were my favorite books living in
    the country the society of other children was difficult to
    obtain my whole affections centered in my father my mother
    having died when i was a child this affection for my father was
    rather a morbid passion which absorbed my life i dared not leave
    his side for fear of a final separation from him i would wake
    him when asleep to see if he still lived to this day though he
    died twentysix years ago his memory haunts me
    my first abnormal desires were connected with him i had seen
    him occasionally micturating in the garden alleys or out in the
    country these occasions excited me terribly and i would if
    possible wait till he had gone and touch the humid leaves
    drawing a terrible pleasure from the contact afterward though
    he never suspected it desire for him became a consuming passion
    and i remember on one occasion when on a holiday i occupied the
    same bed with him the excitement of his propinquity brought on
    such a formidable attack of heart palpitation that my father
    called in the family physician on our return home needless to
    say my heart was found quite sound the desire still remains
    after all these years and nothing excites me more even now than
    the memory of my father in his morning bath
    the whole world for me in my early childhood was peopled with
    imaginary beings while still a young child i would invent
    stories and relate them to any listener i could find one such
    story lasting three years i was an omnivorous reader but my
    favorite reading was poetry at 7 i could repeat the greater part
    of longfellows poems scott followed then milton captivated me
    when i was 14 then came tennyson arnold swinburne and morris
    later came the greek and latin poets from 7 years on i wrote
    verses to my father till 8 years i was excessively timid of the
    dark and indeed of all loneliness this passed however and
    developed into an extreme sensitiveness of seeing or meeting
    people even on a country road i would walk miles out of my way
    to avoid meeting the ordinary yokel at this period my daydreams
    were my favorite occupation even to the present day my visions
    take up the greater part of my life though timid i was not
    wanting in courage at an early age i would fight boys even older
    than myself later i have risked my life many times in various
    parts of europe as regards sports i can do a little of
    everything swimming riding fencing shootinga little of
    each cricket and football i also played passably but sports
    never interested me much literature became and is the passion
    of my life and for some years has remained my sole occupation
    at 8 years the sexual inversion began to manifest itself though
    till i had attained 10 years of age i was practically quite
    innocent at 8 years of age my family removed to another country
    and i made the acquaintance of a little boy who attracted me
    sexually we masturbated in company without any reason except
    the pleasure of seeing each other exposed then i had connection
    with him in anum this really at that time was an exception to
    my ordinary tastes which speedily developed into an intense
    desire of fellatio and later on of intercrural pleasures this
    latter perhaps may be accounted for by the visit to our house of
    a small boy with whom i slept for about a year every night
    during this period i had intercrural connection with him twice
    and sometimes three times then came a consuming passion for all
    young boys and very old men boys after 14 or 15 ceased to
    attract me more particularly when the hair of the pubes began to
    develop from 8 to 14 when first i had sexual emissions i
    masturbated at every opportunity from 14 to 27 always once a
    day generally twice and sometimes three times a day at 27 i
    took rooms and formed acquaintance with the family occupying the
    house the boys one by one were allowed to sleep with me and i
    conceived an extraordinary passion for one of them an attachment
    which lasted till i finally left england the attachment was much
    more that of a man for his wife and had nothing degrading in it
    i was wretched when away from him and as he was very attached to
    sport of all kinds i suffered divers kinds of death each time
    that i imagined his life to be endangered i can honestly say
    that in each of my attachments and i have had many the
    prevailing sentiment was the delight of protecting a weaker being
    than myself each person whom i have loved has been perfectly
    normal and all are now fathers of families each still regards me
    with affection and respect in spite of what has passed between
    us all my life i have been possessed with the passion for
    paternity i could almost say maternity willingly would i have
    suffered the pains of hell could i have borne a son to the person
    i loved that i can honestly say has been the dominant instinct
    of my life in my passion i have never been brutal nor save
    under the influence of wine have i had connection with men over
    the age of puberty in southern europe my experiences have been
    the same a predominant passion for a boy exhibiting itself in
    every species of protecting care and though terminating so far
    as sexual passion was concerned when the boy reached 15 or 16
    years yet still lasting and enduring in an honest and unselfish
    affection at the age of 51 i still masturbate once or twice a
    week though i long for some person whom i love to share the
    pleasure with me i tried vainly at the age of 27 to bring
    myself into line with others prostitutes caused me horror
    whether male or female i attempted the act of coitus four or
    five times twice with women of loose lives and at other times
    with married women save in one case the attempts were either
    abortive or caused me extreme disgust
    practically from the time of puberty i have attracted sexually
    not only women but men women oddly enough though i care
    nothing for them sexually either hate me or adore me and i have
    had five offers of marriage at the same time up till five years
    ago i was pursued by men and have had the oddest experiences
    both in england and abroad in the early period of this history i
    suffered tremendously from the feeling that i was isolated and
    unique in the world i strove against the habit of masturbation
    and my perverted tastes with all my might scourges vigils
    burnings all were of no avail deeper reading in the classics
    showed me how common was the taste of sex for the same sex at 27
    i began to have a settled philosophy then as now i made endless
    resolutions to avoid masturbation though i can see nothing wrong
    in the mutual act of two persons drawn together by love i am and
    always have been an extremely religious man and if i am not
    altogether an orthodox catholic do my duties and have a high
    sense of the supernatural i suffered much from melancholy from
    my earliest years at 18 though nothing definitely was wrong a
    vague but profound malaise induced me to open the veins of my
    arm i fainted however and was promptly succored at the age of
    35 after a return from abroad i took an enormous dose of
    poison this time again a singular coincidence saved me and i
    once more came back to life after this i purposely went abroad
    to obtain death and sought it in every possible way quite in
    vain as you see one thing i have never had a fear of but have
    always longed fordeath i am sure that if we only knew what
    joys lay on the other side of death the whole world would rush
    madly to suicide i have apart from any perversion of taste an
    honest and genuine passion for children and animals and i am
    never happier than when in their society both adore me
    my life has not dimmed nor deadened my faculties for i am
    occupied at the present time with very important work and i write
    steadily but my real life is passed in my visions which take me
    into another world quite as real as this sensuous one and where
    i always retreat on all occasions possible and yet a strange
    paradoxi am a convinced stoic and almost confine my reading to
    epictetus marcus aurelius and the imitation i am extremely
    emotional fond of the society of women though i loathe the
    sexual side of them and when i love though passion is certainly
    inextricably mixed the prevailing sentiment is spiritual i
    shall probably end by being a carthusian or a fakir
    history xxiiienglishman aged 70 of german descent on
    fathers side was first child of his mother who was 36 at his
    birth a younger brother normal has no other relatives
    he was brought up in england and went to school at the age of
    13 at a very early age between 6 and 8 was deeply impressed by
    the handsome face of a young man a royal trumpeter on horseback
    seen in a procession this and the sight of the naked body of
    young men in a rowingmatch on the river caused great commotion
    but not of a definitely sexual character this was increased by
    the sight of a beautiful male model of a young turk smoking with
    his dress open in front showing much of the breast and below the
    waist he became familiar with pictures admired the male figures
    of italian martyrs and the full rich forms of the antinous and
    he read with avidity the arabian nights and other oriental
    tales translations from the classics suetonius petronius etc
    he drew naked models in life schools and delighted in male
    balletdancers as a child he used to perform in private
    theatricals he excelled in female parts and sang the songs of
    madame vestris encouraged in this by his father
    the sexual organs have never been fully developed and the
    testicles though large are of a flabby consistence he cannot
    whistle he thinks he ought to have been a woman
    at school he was shy and reserved and had no particular intimacy
    with anyone although he once desired it he learned selfabuse
    from his younger brother who had learned it from an older boy
    he has never had erotic dreams he never touched anyone but his
    brother until later when travelling in italy and then only his
    fellowtraveller when travelling in asia minor he had many
    opportunities but always put them aside from fear afterward
    regretting his fearfulness he yearned for intimacy with
    particular friends but never dared to express it he went much
    to theaters and what he saw there incited him to masturbation
    when he was about 30 years of age his reserve and his fear of
    treachery and extortion were at last overcome by an incident
    which occurred late at night at the royal exchange and again in
    a dark recess in the gallery of the olympic theater when gustavus
    brooke was performing from that time the adelphi theater the
    italian opera and the open parks at night became his fields of
    adventure he remarks that among people crowding to witness a
    fire he found many opportunities his especial intimates were a
    railway clerk and an italian model in more recent years he has
    chiefly found gratification among footmen and policemen
    he is exclusively passive also likes mutual fellatio he used
    greatly to admire finely developed forms conscious of his own
    shortcomings shapely limbs and delicate brown hair and always
    admired strength and manly vigor he never took any interest in
    boys and has always been indifferent to women
    history xxiva medical man english aged 30 he believes that
    his father who was a magistrate was very sympathetic toward
    men on several occasions he has sat with him on the bench when
    cases of indecent assault were brought up he discharged three
    cases although there could be little doubt as to their guilt
    and was very lenient to the others
    from the age of 9 he loved to sleep with his brother ten years
    older who was in the navy they slept in different beds and the
    child went to bed early but he always kept awake to see his
    brother undress as he adored his naked body and would then get
    into his bed he learned the habit of masturbation from his
    brother at the age of 9 at that time there was no sexual orgasm
    but watching it in his brother was a perpetual source of wonder
    and pleasure during his brothers absence at sea the boy longed
    for his return and would practice selfabuse with the thought of
    his brothers naked body before him this brothers death was a
    source of great grief at the age of 12 he went to
    boardingschool and was constantly falling in love with
    goodlooking boys he was always taken into one of the bigger
    boys beds at this age he was thoroughly able to enjoy the
    sexual orgasm with boys his erotic dreams have always been of
    men and especially of boys he has never dreamed sexually of
    women from the age of 9 to the age of 21 when he left school
    he never gave women a thought sexually though he always liked
    their society for two years after leaving school he had
    connection with women not because he thought there was sin in
    loving his own sex but because he regarded it as a thing that no
    one did after leaving school during these two years he still
    really preferred men and used to admire the figures of soldiers
    and sailors he then paid a visit to london which may be
    described in his own words i went to see an old schoolfellow
    who was living there in his room was a young fellow fair
    extremely good looking with a good figure and charming manners
    from that moment all my past recollections came back i could not
    get him out of my mind in fact i was in love with him i
    pictured him naked before me as a lovely statue my dreams were
    frequent at night always of him for a fortnight afterward i
    practised masturbation with the picture of his lovely face and
    form always before me we became fast friends and from that day
    women have never entered my thoughts
    although up to the present he has no wish or intention to marry
    he believes that he will eventually do so because it is thought
    desirable in his profession but he is quite sure that his love
    and affection for men and boys will never lessen
    in earlier life he preferred men from 20 to 35 now he likes boys
    from 16 upward grooms for instance who must be good looking
    well developed cleanly and of a lovable unchanging nature but
    he would prefer gentlemen he does not care for mere mutual
    embracing and reciprocal masturbation when he really loves a man
    he desires pedicatio in which he is himself the passive
    subject
    he has curly hair and moustache and welldeveloped sexual
    organs his habits are masculine he has always enjoyed field
    sports and can swim ride drive and skate at the same time
    he is devoted to music can draw and paint and is an ardent
    admirer of male statuary while fond of practical occupations of
    every sort he dislikes anything that is theoretical
    he adds as a medical man i fail to see morally any
    unhealthiness or anything that nature should be ashamed of in
    connection with and sympathy for men
    history xxvas schoolmaster aged 46
    my father was i should say below the average in capacity for
    friendship he liked young girls and was never interested in
    boys he was a man of strongly puritanical morality capable of
    condemning with gloomy bitterness he was also a man capable of
    great sacrifice for principle and mentally very well endowed my
    mother was a clever practical woman with wide sympathies she
    was capable of warm friendship especially toward those younger
    than herself her father whom i never saw was a teacher he was
    devoted to his wife but also delighted in the company of young
    men he had always some young man on his arm my mother would
    tell me my mothers family is of welsh descent i learned to
    read at 5 and i can scarcely have been more than 6 when i used
    to read again and again davids lament for absalom even now i
    can dimly recall the siren charm for me of that melancholy
    refrain o my son absalom o absalom my son my son of
    late when i have thought of the amount of devotion i have shown
    to lads and the amount i have sometimes suffered for them i
    have felt as if there were something almost weirdly prophetic in
    that early incident
    i was always an impressionable creature my mother was very
    musical and her singing got hold of me wonderfully the
    dramatic and the poetic always strongly appealed to me
    i felt i should like to act but i never dared in the same way
    i felt that one day i should like to be a schoolmaster but i
    dared not say so a shy retiring creature was obviously unfitted
    for such occupations well the teaching came about and the
    strange part was that the boys were somehow or other attracted
    by me and the worst customers were attracted most and there
    came a chance of acting too owing to some difficulties about the
    cast in a play at school i took a part after that i knew that
    within a certain range i could act i spent two holidays with a
    dramatic company i should undoubtedly have remained on the
    stage but for one thing i dont wish to be sanctimonious but
    dirty and ugly jokes are odious to me it was this sort of thing
    that drove me away i threw myself into the school work instead
    it was partly the dramatic interest partly a quite genuine
    interest in human nature that led me to do some preaching too
    when i had been badly hurt by one or two youngsters whom i loved
    i thought of going in for pastoral work but this too was given
    upand very wisely i should never be able to work comfortably
    with any organization for one thing i have a way of taking on
    new ideas and organizations do not like that for another all
    social functions are anathema to me
    interest in art as usually understood began to be marked only
    after i was 30 it started with architecture and passed on to
    painting and sculpture the tendency to do rather a variety too
    great a variety of things characterizes many uranians we are
    rather like the labile chemical compounds our molecules readily
    rearrange themselves
    as a boy of 10 i had the ordinary sweethearting with a girl of
    the same age the incident is worth perhaps a little further
    comment for the following reason when i was 16 years old the
    girl lived with us for a year she was a nice pleasant bright
    girl and she thought a great deal of me i was strongly
    attracted by her i remember especially one little incident i
    had been showing her how to do some algebra and she was kneeling
    at the table by the side of my chair her hair was flowing over
    her shoulders and she looked rather charming she expressed warm
    admiration of the way i had worked the problem out i remember
    that i deliberately squashed out the feeling of attraction that
    came over me i scarcely know why i did this but i fancy there
    was a vague sense that i did not want my work disturbed there
    was no sexual attraction or at least none that was manifest
    the girl there is no doubt grew to love me i am sorry to say
    that in two other cases later women loved me and have both
    permanently remained unmarried on my account i sometimes feel
    that in a wisely free society i should be able to give both of
    these women children that i believe i could do and i think it
    would be an immense satisfaction to them a permanent union with
    a woman would however be impossible to me a permanent union
    with a man would i believe be possible at least i know that
    attractions which have been at all homosexual in character have
    in my case been very lasting
    i was strongly attracted when not more than 13 to a lad slightly
    older it was a love story there is no doubt but i do not
    recollect any outer sexual signs there were other passing cases
    but in no case was there any warm response till i was 15 i then
    made friends with a lad of entirely different type from myself i
    was a reader i liked long walks and fresh air but i was too shy
    to go in for sports indeed i was frightfully shy he was a great
    sportsman and always at home in society but he asked me to help
    him with some work and we took to working together i grew
    passionately fond of him his caresses always caused some
    erection personally i believe it would have been wiser to have
    obtained complete sexual expression the absence of knowledge led
    to two distinctly undesirable results the first was marked
    congestion and pain at times the second was a tendency to a sort
    of modified masochism there is always i suppose some erotic
    attraction about the buttocks and of course also to boys they
    afford an irresistibly attractive mark for a good smack i found
    that when this lad spanked me it produced some amount of sexual
    excitement and the desire for this form of stimulus grew upon
    me the result in my case was bad it was sensualism not love
    i can say this with confidence because in a much later case of
    deeply passionate love i shrank from any such method but the
    mutual naked embrace i found was for me an absolutely natural
    and pure expression of love i never felt any touch of
    grossness in it and it destroyed the earlier and for me at
    least less wholesome desire
    the school friendship disappeared with the marriage of my
    friend i was furiously jealous and the young mans mother was
    opposed to me but i still think of that early friendship with
    tenderness i know that my boy friend was the first who made me
    capable of selfexpression the first who taught me how to make
    friends at all and if he still cared for me i know that his
    love would be dear to me still
    my chief regret as i look back is that i did not know about
    these things early i cannot but think that all youngsters should
    be spoken to about the love of comrades and encouraged to seek
    help in any sort of trouble that this may bring we homogenic
    folk may be but a small percentage of mankind but our numbers
    are still great and surely the making or marring of our lives
    should count for something at college i fell violently in love
    with a friend with whom i did work in science he loved me too
    though not with such heat he also was largely uranian but this
    i only realized a year or two back he remains unmarried and is
    still my friend we did some research work together which is
    pretty well known i am quite sure that the love we had for each
    other gave tremendous zest to our work and greatly increased our
    powers
    while i was working at college i was interested in a lad who was
    working as errand boy for a city firm i helped him to get better
    training and spent money on him my father was making me some
    allowance at the time and demurred i said i would in future
    support myself and in this way came to take up schoolmastering
    i at once became quite absorbed in my work with the boys of
    course i loved them and here i feel i must touch upon what seems
    to me a characteristic of most of us uranians our genital organs
    are with us ordinarily and usually organs of expression the
    cleanminded heterogenic man is apt to look upon such a view of
    the genital organs as monstrous we on the other hand are
    compelled at least for ourselves to regard it as the natural
    and pure one for my own part i had many puritan
    prejudicesprejudices that i retained for many a long and weary
    daybut my affection for those of my own sex so often expressed
    itself by some sexual stirring and more or less erection that i
    was obliged to look upon this as inevitable and in general i
    paid no attention to it whatever it was the older boys who
    sometimes attracted me strongly my love for them was i know a
    genuinely spiritual thing though inevitably having some physical
    expression i was capable of great devotion to them and sacrifice
    for them and i would certainly rather have died than have
    injured them the boys got on well with me i was never weak with
    them and i was able to allow all kinds of familiarities without
    any loss of respect the older boys usually out of class called
    me by my christian name and i remember one writing to ask me
    whether he might do so as it made him feel nearer to me a few
    of the lads i of course loved with special devotion they kissed
    me and loved to have me embrace them one of these was i now
    know pure uranian and there was in his case certainly some
    sexual response but though i often slept with him when he was a
    lad of 17 and 18 there was never any idea in our minds of any
    sexual act we are still warm friends and always kiss when we
    meet looking back upon those days i feel that i was a little
    inclined to pass on from one love to another but each was a
    genuine devotion and involved real hard work on the lads
    behalf and i know that where the lad stuck to me into manhood a
    real tenderness and love remain still
    while teaching i made the acquaintance of a nonconformist
    minister who though happily married had certainly some
    homogenic tendencies he was most devoted to boys and helped me
    with regard to some difficult cases it was the difficult cases
    that always attracted me i had to punish these lads and my
    friend recommended spanking with the hand on the bare buttocks i
    mention that i adopted this method because it might have been
    thought specially dangerous to me it certainly never produced in
    me the remotest suggestion of any sexual act though it did
    sometimes produce a slight amount of sexual excitement i
    disregarded this or put it out of my mind as i found the method
    most efficacious it was capable of great variation of intensity
    and the boys were always ready to joke about it i never came
    across a case where any sexual excitement was produced by it the
    boys whom i had to be most down on almost always however grew
    fonder of me there may be a slight and normal masochistic
    tendency in most boys and perhaps the erogenic character of
    the buttocks has something to do with the development of
    affection if so i am inclined to regard it as normal and useful
    rather than otherwise for in my experience no undesirable result
    was ever produced but then of course there was no playing with
    the business that might i am sure in some cases be decidedly
    injurious
    one experience of my schoolmastering days is i think important
    in its bearing upon general sexual psychology i always noticed
    that during the term i was specially free from wet dreams what
    is noteworthy is this during term there was never anything more
    than a very partial sexual expression of any feeling of mine
    such expression indeed as was wholly inevitable there was
    therefore no actual loss of semen and it seems clear that the
    wet dreams were not due to mere physical pressure the psychic
    satisfaction of love in this case made the complete physical
    expression less urgent but it was a love of a distinctly tender
    kind that was needed to keep the physical from obtruding of that
    further experience has made me sure i am moreover now
    convinced that a mutual uranian love will reach its best
    results both spiritual and physical where there is complete
    sexual expression
    of the character of the sexual dreams i have had there is not
    much to be said during the period of masochistic tendency they
    were masochistic in character otherwise they have been dreams
    simply of the naked embrace usually there has been a
    considerable element of ideal love in the dream i have not more
    than three times at most dreamed of intercourse with one of the
    opposite sex there was only in one case anything that i could
    call actual emotion in such a dream the other dreams have often
    not always been dreams of real yearning and not at all what i
    should call merely sensual
    in the course of time i wanted more freedom to do things in my
    own way than could be obtained in a public school i started a
    school of my own the work was for a good many years very happy
    i loved the boys and they loved me i was active ardent and
    they made a chum of me but people got into the way of sending me
    awkward customers i poured out my love on these i used myself
    up for them unfortunately though i was never orthodox my
    puritanical morality was still strong within me my views of
    human psychology were too limited and i imposed them on the
    boys some were very devoted but as years went by and the
    proportion of mauvais sujets increased there tended to be a
    split in the small camp and one or two boys whom i loved deceived
    me terribly to a man of my temperament this was heartrending
    and from then the work was doomed troubles at school went along
    with troubles at home and these things contributed to center my
    affection upon a lad who was with me and who had given me much
    trouble for some reason or other i went on believing that he
    would get right deceit was his great difficulty he was
    certainly partly homosexual himself looking back i can see that
    with a wider and more charitable knowledge i could have dealt
    more wisely and helpfully with certain homosexual episodes of
    his i am convinced now that mere sweeping condemnation of the
    physical is not the wholesome way of help however to cut the
    story short all seemed at last to go well and the lad was
    growing into a young man our love deepened and we always slept
    together but quite ascetically later when quite in his young
    manhood he had left school there was unfortunately
    misunderstandings with his parents who forbad him to sleep with
    me what followed is of some importance up till then though
    certainly his affection seemed ardent i had observed no sexual
    signs on his part i had been quite frank with him as to mine he
    was then 19 and i thought old enough to have things explained to
    him sleeping with him i had found peaceful and helpful and more
    than once he told me that it greatly helped him but after we
    were forbidden to sleep together i found the passion in me more
    difficult to control and it suddenly leaped out in him we were
    still however rather ascetic though we used to kiss each
    other and we used to embrace naked this produced emission not
    infrequently with me but only once with him though always
    powerful erection i would not allow any friction perhaps this
    was a mistake a more complete expression might have helped him
    all my life i had been hungry for a complete response and at
    one time the lad thought he could give it he was then nearing
    20 i have never been so happy in my life he said it was a
    blow to me when i found he had mistaken his own feelings but i
    was quite ready to accept what love he could give i also never
    dreamed of any sort of insistence on sexual expression with such
    love as he could give i was quite ready to make myself content
    the true measure of love wrote a uranian schoolmaster to me
    once is selfsacrifice not what will you give but what
    will you give up not what will you do for him but what will
    you forego for his sake i quote this gladly for the
    conventional english moralists regard an invert as a kind of
    deformed beast i can only say that i tried to realize the ideal
    which these words express no moralist would have helped me one
    whit the parents also separated us they have done much harm
    by their mistake how difficult it is for parents to allow
    freedom to their children their ideal is successful constraint
    not free selfdiscovery but in spite of them and in spite of
    the separation i know that my friend and i have helped each
    other
    there is one fear parents have which i believe is unwarranted
    as far as i have seen i do not conclude that the early
    expression of homosexual love prevents heterosexual love from
    developing later where this love is a part of the individuals
    inborn nature it will show itself i do however believe that a
    noble homogenic love in early life will sometimes help a lad to
    avoid a low standard of heterogenic attachment the greeks did
    well at their best time in cultivating and ennobling the
    homogenic love amongst us as can be understood by all who know
    the working of society taboos it is the baser forms that are
    unhindered the noblest forms that are debased
    we urnings are i think dependent upon individual love many of
    us i know need to work for an individual to do our best is
    this the outcome of the woman in the uranian temperament and the
    tragedy of our fate is that we whose souls vibrate only to the
    touch of the hand of eros are faced with the fiercest taboo of
    all that can give our lives meaning the other taboos have been
    given up one by one will not this the last of the taboos soon
    vanish i have known lives darkened by it weakened by it
    crushed out by it how long are the western moralists to maim and
    brand and persecute where they do not understand
the next case belongs to a totally different class from all the preceding
histories theseall british or americanwere obtained privately they
are not the inmates of prisons or of asylums and in most cases they have
never consulted a physician concerning their abnormal instincts they pass
through life as ordinary sometimes as honored members of society the
following case which happens to be that of an american is acquainted
with both the prison and the lunatic asylum there are several points of
interest in his history and he illustrates the way in which sexual
inversion can become a matter of medicolegal importance i think
however that i am justified in believing that the proportion of sexually
inverted persons who reach the policecourt or the lunatic asylum is not
much larger in proportion to the number of sexually inverted persons among
us than it is among my cases for the documents on which i have founded
the history of guy olmstead i am indebted to the kindness of dr talbot
of chicago well known from his studies of abnormalities of the jaws and
face so often associated with nervous and mental abnormality he knew the
man who addressed to him the letters from which i here quote
    history xxvion the twentyeighth of march 1894 at noon in
    the open street in chicago guy t olmstead fired a revolver at a
    lettercarrier named william l clifford he came up from behind
    and deliberately fired four shots the first entering cliffords
    loins the other three penetrating the back of his head so that
    the man fell and was supposed to be fatally wounded olmstead
    made little attempt to escape as a crowd rushed up with the
    usual cry of lynch him but waved his revolver exclaiming
    ill never be taken alive and when a policeofficer disarmed
    him dont take my gun let me finish what i have to do this
    was evidently an allusion as will be seen later on to an
    intention to destroy himself he eagerly entered the prisonvan
    however to escape the threatening mob
    olmstead who was 30 years of age was born near danville ill
    in which city he lived for many years both parents were born in
    illinois his father some twenty years ago shot and nearly
    killed a wealthy coal operator induced to commit the crime it
    is said by a secret organization of a hundred prominent citizens
    to whom the victim had made himself obnoxious by bringing suits
    against them for trivial causes the victim became insane but
    the criminal was never punished and died a few years later at
    the age of 44 this man had another son who was considered
    peculiar
    guy olmstead began to show signs of sexual perversity at the age
    of 12 he was seduced we are led to believe by a man who
    occupied the same bedroom olmsteads early history is not clear
    from the data to hand it appears that he began his career as a
    schoolteacher in connecticut and that he there married the
    daughter of a prosperous farmer but shortly after he fell in
    love with her male cousin whom he describes as a very handsome
    young man this led to a separation from his wife and he went
    west
    he was never considered perfectly sane and from october 1886
    to may 1889 he was in the kankakee insane asylum his illness
    was reported as of three years duration and caused by general
    illhealth heredity doubtful habits good occupation that of a
    schoolteacher his condition was diagnosed as paranoia on
    admission he was irritable alternately excited and depressed he
    returned home in good condition
    at this period and again when examined later olmsteads
    physical condition is described as on the whole normal and
    fairly good height 5 feet 8 inches weight 159 pounds special
    senses normal genitals abnormally small with rudimentary penis
    his head is asymmetrical and is full at the occiput slightly
    sunken at the bregma and the forehead is low his cephalic index
    is 78 the hair is sandy and normal in amount over head face
    and body his eyes are gray small and deeply set the zygom
    are normal the nose is large and very thin there is arrested
    development of upper jaw the ears are excessively developed and
    malformed the face is very much lined the nasolabial fissure is
    deeply cut and there are wellmarked horizontal wrinkles on the
    forehead so that he looks at least ten years older than his
    actual age the upper jaw is of partial vshape the lower well
    developed the teeth and their tubercles and the alveolar process
    are normal the breasts are full the body is generally well
    developed the hands and feet are large
    olmsteads history is defective for some years after he left
    kankakee in october 1892 we hear of him as a lettercarrier in
    chicago during the following summer he developed a passion for
    william clifford a fellow lettercarrier about his own age also
    previously a schoolteacher and regarded as one of the most
    reliable and efficient men in the service for a time clifford
    seems to have shared this passion or to have submitted to it
    but he quickly ended the relationship and urged his friend to
    undergo medical treatment offering to pay the expenses himself
    olmstead continued to write letters of the most passionate
    description to clifford and followed him about constantly until
    the latters life was made miserable in december 1893 clifford
    placed the letters in the postmasters hands and olmstead was
    requested to resign at once olmstead complained to the civil
    service commission at washington that he had been dismissed
    without cause and also applied for reinstatement but without
    success
    in the meanwhile apparently on the advice of friends he went
    into hospital and in the middle of february 1894 his testicles
    were removed no report from the hospital is to hand the effect
    of removing the testicles was far from beneficial and he began
    to suffer from hysterical melancholia a little later he went
    into hospital again on march 19th he wrote to dr talbot from
    the mercy hospital chicago i returned to chicago last
    wednesday night but felt so miserable i concluded to enter a
    hospital again and so came to mercy which is very good as
    hospitals go but i might as well go to hades as far as any hope
    of my getting well is concerned i am utterly incorrigible
    utterly incurable and utterly impossible at home i thought for
    a time that i was cured but i was mistaken and after seeing
    clifford last thursday i have grown worse than ever so far as my
    passion for him is concerned heaven only knows how hard i have
    tried to make a decent creature out of myself but my vileness is
    uncontrollable and i might as well give up and die i wonder if
    the doctors knew that after emasculation it was possible for a
    man to have erections commit masturbation and have the same
    passion as before i am ashamed of myself i hate myself but i
    cant help it i have friends among nice people play the piano
    love music books and everything that is beautiful and
    elevating yet they cant elevate me because this load of inborn
    vileness drags me down and prevents my perfect enjoyment of
    anything doctors are the only ones who understand and know my
    helplessness before this monster i think and work till my brain
    whirls and i can scarce refrain from crying out my troubles
    this letter was written a few days before the crime was
    committed
    when conveyed to the police station olmstead completely broke
    down and wept bitterly crying oh will will come to me why
    dont you kill me and let me go to him at this time he
    supposed he had killed clifford a letter was found on him as
    follows mercy march 27th to him who cares to read fearing
    that my motives in killing clifford and myself may be
    misunderstood i write this to explain the cause of this homicide
    and suicide last summer clifford and i began a friendship which
    developed into love he then recited the details of the
    friendship and continued after playing a liszt rhapsody for
    clifford over and over he said that when our time to die came he
    hoped we would die together listening to such glorious music as
    that our time has now come to die but death will not be
    accompanied by music cliffords love has alas turned to deadly
    hatred for some reason clifford suddenly ended our relations and
    friendship in his cell he behaved in a wildly excited manner
    and made several attempts at suicide so that he had to be
    closely watched a few weeks later he wrote to dr talbot cook
    county gaol april 23 i feel as though i had neglected you in
    not writing you in all this time though you may not care to hear
    from me as i have never done anything but trespass on your
    kindness but please do me the justice of thinking that i never
    expected all this trouble as i thought will and i would be in
    our graves and at peace long before this but my plans failed
    miserably poor will was not dead and i was grabbed before i
    could shoot myself i think will really shot himself and i feel
    certain others will think so too when the whole story comes out
    in court i cant understand the surprise and indignation my act
    seemed to engender as it was perfectly right and natural that
    will and i should die together and nobody elses business do
    you know i believe that poor boy will yet kill himself for last
    november when i in my grief and anger told his relations about
    our marriage he was so frightened hurt and angry that he wanted
    us both to kill ourselves i acquiesced gladly in this proposal
    to commit suicide but he backed out in a day or two i am glad
    now that will is alive and am glad that i am alive even with
    the prospect of years of imprisonment before me but which i will
    cheerfully endure for his sake and yet for the last ten months
    his influence has so completely controlled me both body and
    soul that if i have done right he should have the credit for my
    good deeds and if i have done wrong he should be blamed for the
    mischief as i have not been myself at all but a part of him
    and happy to merge my individuality into his
    olmstead was tried privately in july no new points were brought
    out he was sentenced to the criminal insane asylum shortly
    afterward while still in the prison at chicago he wrote to dr
    talbot as you have been interested in my case from a scientific
    point of view there is a little something more i might tell you
    about myself but which i have withheld because i was ashamed to
    admit certain facts and features of my deplorable weakness among
    the few sexual perverts i have known i have noticed that all are
    in the habit of often closing the mouth with the lower lip
    protruding beyond the upper usually due to arrested development
    of upper jaw i noticed the peculiarity in mr clifford before
    we became intimate and i have often caught myself at the trick
    before that operation my testicles would swell and become sore
    and hurt me and have seemed to do so since just as a man will
    sometimes complain that his amputated leg hurts him then too
    my breasts would swell and about the nipples would become hard
    and sore and red since the operation there has never been a day
    that i have been free from sharp shooting pains down the abdomen
    to the scrotum being worse at the base of the penis now that my
    fate is decided i will say that really my passion for mr
    clifford is on the wane but i dont know whether the improvement
    is permanent or not i have absolutely no passion for other men
    and have begun to hope now that i can yet outlive my desire for
    clifford or at least control it i have not yet told of this
    improvement in my condition because i wished people to still
    think i was insane so that i would be sure to escape being sent
    to the penitentiary i know i was insane at the time i tried to
    kill both clifford and myself and feel that i dont deserve such
    a dreadful punishment as being sent to a state prison however i
    think it was that operation and my subsequent illness that caused
    my insanity rather than passion for clifford i should very much
    like to know if you really consider sexual perversion an
    insanity
    when discharged from the criminal insane asylum olmstead
    returned to chicago and demanded his testicles from the city
    postmaster whom he accused of being in a systematized conspiracy
    against him he asserted that the postmaster was one of the chief
    agents in a plot against him dating from before the castration
    he was then sent to the cook insane hospital it seems probable
    that a condition of paranoia is now firmly established
the following cases are all bisexual attraction being felt toward both
sexes usually in predominant degree toward the male
    history xxviihc american aged 28 of independent means
    unmarried the elder of two children his history may best be
    given in his own words
    i am on both sides distantly of english ancestry the first
    colonists of my name having come to new england in 1630 both my
    mothers and my fathers families have been prolific in soldiers
    and statesmen my mothers contributed one president to the
    united states so far as i am aware none of my antecedents have
    betrayed mental vagaries except a maternal uncle who from
    overstudy became for a year insane
    i am a graduate of two universities with degrees in arts and
    medicine after a year as physician in a hospital i relinquished
    medicine altogether to follow literature a predilection since
    early boyhood
    i awoke to sexual feeling at the age of 7 when at a small
    private school glimpsing bare thighs above the stockings of girl
    schoolmates i dimly exulted this fetishism as it grew more
    definite centered at last upon the thighs and then the whole
    person of one girl in particular my first sexually tinged dream
    was of herthat while she stood near i impinged my penis upon a
    redhot anvil and then in beatific selfimmolation exhibited
    the charred stump to her wondering round eyes this love
    however abated at the coming of a new girl to the school who
    not more beautiful but more buxom made stronger appeal to my
    nascent sexuality one afternoon in the loft of her fathers
    stable she induced me to disrobe herself setting the example
    the erection our mutual handlings produced on me was without
    conscious impulse i felt only a childish curiosity on beholding
    our genital difference but the episode started extravagant
    whimsies one of which persistently obsessed me with these
    obviously compensatory differences why might not the girl and i
    effect some sort of copulation this fantasy drawn exclusively
    from that unique experience charmed with its grotesqueness only
    for at that time my sense of sex was but inchoate and my
    knowledge of it was nothing the bizarre conceit submitted to
    the equally ignorant girl and approved was borne to the paternal
    hayloft and there with much bungling brought to surprising and
    pleasurable consummation
    in the four ensuing years i repeated the act not seldom with
    this girl and with others
    when i was 11 my sister and i were taken by our parents to
    europe where we remained six years attending school each winter
    in a different city and during the summer travelling in various
    countries
    abroad my lust was glutted to the full the amenable
    girlplaymate was ubiquitous whom i plied with ardor at swiss
    hotels german wateringplaces french pensionswhere not
    toward puberty i first repaired at times to prostitutes
    masturbation excepting a few experiments i never resorted to
    few of my schoolmates avowedly practised it
    of homosexuality my sole hearing was through the classics
    where with no long pondering i opined it merely our modern
    comradery poetically aggrandized masquerading in antique
    habiliments and phraseology it never came home to me it attuned
    to no tone in the scale of my sympathies i possessed no
    touchstone for transmitting the recitals of those ambiguous
    amours into fiery messages the relation to my own sex was
    intellectually an occasional friendship devoid of strong
    affection physically a mild antagonism the naked body of a man
    was slightly repellant statues of women evoked both carnal and
    esthetic response of men no emotions whatever save a deepening
    of that native antipathy similarly in paintings in literature
    the drama the men served but as foils for the delicious maidens
    who visited my arial seraglios and lapped me in roseate
    dreamings
    in my eighteenth year we returned to america where i entered
    the university
    the course of my love of women was now a little erratic normal
    connection began to lose fascination as long ago i had
    formulated untutored the rationale of coitus so now
    imagination groping in the dark conceived a fresh fillip for
    the appetitecunnilinctus but this though for a while quite
    adequate soon ceased to gratify at this juncture christmas of
    my first college year i was appointed editor of a small
    magazine an early stricture of whose new conduct was paucity of
    love stories such improvident neglect was in keeping with my
    altering view of women a view accorded to me by selfdissipation
    of the glamour through which they had been wont to appear i had
    wandered somehow behind the scenes and beheld no footlights of
    sex intervening the once so radiant fairies resolved into a
    raddled humanity as likable as ever but desirable no longer
    soon after this the oscar wilde case was bruiting about the
    newspaper accounts of it while illuminating flashed upon me no
    light of selfrevelation they only amended some idle conjectures
    as to certain mystic vices i had heard whispered of here and
    there a newspaper allusion still too recondite was painstakingly
    clarified by an effeminate fellowstudent who i fancy now
    would have shown no reluctance had i begged him to adduce
    practical illustration i purchased too photographs of oscar
    wilde scrutinizing them under the unctuous auspices of this same
    emasculate and blandiloquent mentor if my interest in oscar
    wilde arose from any other emotion than the rather morbid
    curiosity then almost universal i was not conscious of it
    erotic dreams precluded hitherto by coition came now to beset
    me the persons of these dreams were and still are invariably
    women with this one remembered exception i dreamed that oscar
    wilde one of my photographs of him incarnate approached me with
    a buffoon languishment and perpetrated fellatio an act
    verbally expounded shortly before by my oracle for a month or
    more recalling this dream disgusted me
    the few subsequent endeavors tentative and halfhearted to
    repristinate my venery were foredoomed partly because i had
    feared they were to failure erection was incomplete
    ejaculation without pleasure
    there seemed a fallacy in this behavior why coitus without
    sensual desire for it no sense of duty impelled me nor dread of
    sexual aberration the explanation is this attraction to females
    was not expunged simply sublimed my imagination no longer
    importing women from observation created its own delectable
    sirens grown exacting and transcendental petitioned reality in
    vain substance had receded for good now and soon even these
    tormenting shadows of it became ever dimmer and dimmer until
    they too at length faded into nothingness
    the antipodes of the sexual sphere turned more and more toward
    the light of my tolerance inversion till now stained with a
    slight repugnance became esthetically colorless at last and
    then delicately retinted at first solely with pity for its
    victims but finally the color deepening with halfconscious
    inclination to attach it to myself as a remote contingency this
    revolution however was not without external impetus the
    prejudiced tone of a book i was reading krafftebings
    psychopathia sexualis by prompting resentment led me on to
    sympathy my championing purely abstract though it was to begin
    with none the less involved my looking at things with eyes
    hypothetically invertedan orientation for the sake of
    argument after a while insensibly and at no one moment
    hypothesis merged into reality i myself was inverted that
    occasional and fictitious inversion had never i believe
    superposed this true inversion rather a true inversion those
    many years dormant had simply responded finally to a stimulus
    strong and prolonged enough as a man awakens when he is loudly
    called
    in presenting myself thus sexually transformed i do not aver
    having had at the outset any definitive inclination the instinct
    so freshly evolved remained for a while obscure its primary
    expression was a feebly sensuous interest in the physical
    character of boysin their feminine resemblances especially to
    this interest i opposed no discountenance for wantonness with
    women under many and diverse conditions having long ago medicined
    my sexual conscience to lethargy no access of reasons came to me
    now for its refreshment on the other hand intellectual delight
    in the promises of the new world as well as sensuality conduced
    to its deliberate exploration still for a year the yearning
    settled with true lust upon no object more concrete than youths
    whose only habitation was my fancy
    a young surgeon having read my copy of psychopathia sexualis
    fell one evening to discussing inverts with such relish that i
    inquired ingenuously if he himself was one he colored whether
    confirmatively or otherwise i could not guess in spite of his
    vehement no presently he very subtly recanted his denial but to
    his counterquestion i maintained my own no lest he propose some
    sexual act a point the esthetics of my developing inversion
    would not yet concede the boys of my imagination being still
    predominant
    one evening soon after this he convoyed me to several of the
    cafs where inverts are accustomed to foregather these trysting
    places were much alike a long hall with sparse orchestra at one
    end marbletopped tables lining the walls leaving the floor
    free for dancing round the tables sat boys and youths adonises
    both by art and nature ready for a drink or a chat with the
    chance samaritan and shyly importunate for the pleasures for
    which upstairs were small rooms to let one of the boys
    supported by the orchestra sang the jewel song out of
    faust his voice had the limpid treble purity of a
    clarinet and his face the beauty of an angel the song
    concluded we invited him to our table where he sat sipping neat
    brandy as he mockingly encountered my bookbegotten queries the
    boyprostitutes gracing these halls he apprised us bore
    fanciful names some of wellknown actresses others of heroes in
    fiction his own being dorian gray rivals he complained had
    assumed the same appellation but he was the original dorian the
    others were jealous impostors his curly hair was golden his
    cheeks were pink his lips coral red parted incessantly to
    reveal the glistening pearliness of his teeth yet though
    deeming him the beautifulest youth in the world i experienced no
    sexual interest either in him or in the other boys who indeed
    were all beautifulbeauty was their chief asset dorian
    further dilated on the splendor of his female attire satin
    corsets lowcut evening gowns etc donned on gala nights to
    display his gleaming shoulders and dimpled plump white arms
    thus arrayed he bantered he would bewitch even me now so
    impassive until i should throw myself in tears of happiness
    into his loving embrace
    my first venture upon fellatio was a month later with the
    young surgeon i confessed the whim to try it and he acceded
    though this nauseous and fatiguing act very imperfectly
    performed was prompted mostly by curiosity there arose soon a
    passional hankering for repetition in short appetence for
    fellatio grew slowly from the night of that mawkish fiasco and
    waxed eventually into a sovereign want
    perhaps miscarriage of that initiatory experiment was due to
    precipitance incubation of my perverse instinct being not yet
    complete a hiatus of a month now supervened in which while
    further fellatio was not attempted my mind came always nearer
    to a reconcilement with the grossness of the act and began to
    discover for its creatures some correlation in pretty boys beheld
    in the flesh one evening in broadway i conceived suddenly a
    fullfledged desire for a youth issuing from an hotel as i
    passed our glances met and dwelled together at a shopwindow he
    first accosted me he was an invert with him in his room at the
    hotel whence i had seen him emerge i passed an apocalyptic
    night thereafter commerce with boys only in the spirit ceased to
    be an end the images were carnalized stepped from their
    framework into the streets that boy that god out of the
    machine i see him clearly his brown curling hair his eyes
    blue as the sea his chest both arched and so plump his rounded
    arms his taper waist the graceful swell of his hips and full
    snowy thighs i recall as of yesterday the dimples in his knees
    the slenderness of his ankles the softness of his little feet
    with insteps pink like the inside of a shell how i gloated over
    his ample roundness his rich undulations
    in the last eight years i have performed fellatio never
    pedicatio with more than three hundred men and boys my
    preference is for boys between 15 and 20 refined pretty
    girlish and themselves homosexual
    personally barring this love for males i am in all ways
    masculine given to outdoor sports and to smoking and drinking
    moderately in appearance i am but a boy of 18 my face and
    figure are generally considered beautiful i am cleanshaved
    with black curling hair red cheeks and brown eyes features
    delicate and regular body of medium height everywhere
    practically hairless by years of training i have attained alike
    great strength and classic proportions the muscular contours
    smoothly rounded with adipose tissue my hands and feet are
    small my penis though perfectly shaped is rather
    enormouserect ten and a half inches in length seven and a
    quarter inches in circumference
    some abetment of my apostasy from orthodox methods was no
    doubt this hypertrophy of the penis which already in my
    twentieth year had acquired its present redundance rendering
    coitus impracticable with most women i essayed and painful where
    insertion was effected since falling heir to inversion a unique
    recurrence of normal desire six years ago persuaded me to
    attempt coitus with eleven or twelve prostitutes and strangely
    enough with much of the oldtime salacity and full erection
    but as it chanced always with too great disparity of parts for
    success
    a certain preciosity in the manner of this communication may be
    put down partly to the nature of the literary avocations with
    which the writer is by preference occupied and partly no doubt
    more fundamentally to the special character of his predominantly
    esthetic temperament and attraction to the exotic an attraction
    for exotic experiences will not however suffice to account for
    the rather late development of homosexual tendencies a late
    development which may be held to place this case in the retarded
    group of inverts hc has himself pointed out to me that his
    aversion to women beginning to appear in the eighteenth year
    was already well pronounced before he had ever heard definitely
    of specific homosexual acts and fully a year before he
    experienced the slightest sexual interest in men or boys
    moreover while it is true that the actual tendency to homosexual
    attraction only appeared after he had read krafftebing and come
    in contact with inverts such influences would not suffice to
    change the sexual nature of a normally constituted man
    it may be added that hc is not attracted to normal males as
    regards his moral attitude he remarks i have no scruples in the
    indulgence of my passion i perceive the moral objections
    advanced but how speculative they are and constructive while
    immediately inversion is the source of so much good he looks
    upon the whole sexual question as largely a matter of taste
i regard the foregoing case as of considerable interest it presents what
is commonly supposed to be a very common type of inversion oscar wilde
being the supreme exemplar in which a heterosexual person apparently
becomes homosexual by the exercise of intellectual curiosity and esthetic
interest in reality the type is far from common indeed an intellectual
curiosity and an esthetic interest strong enough even apparently to
direct the sexual impulse in any new channel are themselves far from
common moreover a critical reading of this history suggests that the
apparent control over the sexual impulse by reason is merely a superficial
phenomenon here as ever reason is but a tool in the hands of the
passions the apparent causes are really the results we are witnessing
the gradual emergence of a retarded homosexual impulse
    history xxviiienglish aged 40 surgeon sexual experiences
    began early about the age of 10 when a companion induced him to
    play at intercourse with their sisters he experienced no
    pleasure a little later a servantgirl began to treat him
    affectionately and at last called him into her bedroom when she
    was partially undressed fondled and kissed his member and
    taught him to masturbate her on subsequent occasions she
    attempted a simulation of intercourse which gave her
    satisfaction but failed to induce emission in him on returning
    to school mutual masturbation was practised with schoolfellows
    and the first emission took place at the age of 14
    on leaving school he became a slave to the charms of women and
    had frequent coitus about the age of 17 but he preferred
    masturbating girls and especially in persuading girls of good
    position to whom the experience was entirely novel to allow him
    to take liberties with them at 25 he became engaged and mutual
    masturbation was practised to excess during the engagement after
    marriage connection generally took place twice every twentyfour
    hours until pregnancy
    at this time he writes i stayed at the house of an old
    schoolfellow due of my lovers of old days there were so many
    guests that i shared my friends bedroom the sight of his body
    gave rise to lustful feelings and when the light was out i stole
    across to his bed he made no objection and we passed the night
    in mutual masturbation we passed the next fortnight together
    and i never took the same pleasure in coitus with my wife though
    i did my duty she died five years later and i devoted myself
    heart and soul to my friend until his death by accident last
    year since then i have lost all interest in life
    i am indebted for this case to a wellknown english alienist who
    remarks that the patient is fairly healthy to look at but with
    neurasthenia and tendency to melancholia and neurotic
    temperament the body is masculine and pubic hair abundant one
    testicle shows wasting
    histories xxix and xxxi give the following narrative in the
    words of an intimate friend of one of the cases in question my
    attention was first drawn to the study of inversionthough i
    then regarded all forms of it as depraving and abominableat a
    public school where in our dormitory a boy of 15 initiated his
    select friends into the secrets of mutual masturbation which he
    had learned from his brother a midshipman i gave no heed to
    this at the time though i remembered it in afteryears when
    immersed in plato lucretius and the epicurean writers but my
    attention was riveted to it at the age of 20 when i spent a
    holiday with a a companion with whom i was and still am on
    terms of great friendship we enjoyed many things in common
    studied together and discussed most unconventional matters but
    not this previously we had always occupied separate sleeping
    apartments on this occasion we were abroad in a country place
    and were compelled to put up with what we could get we not only
    had to share a room but a bed i was not surprised at his
    throwing his arm over me as i knew he was extraordinarily
    attached to me and i had always felt a brute for not returning
    his affection so warmly but i was surprised when later i awoke
    to find him occupied in fellatio and endeavoring to obtain my
    response had it been anyone else i should have resented strongly
    such a liberty and our acquaintance would have ended but i
    cared for him too well though never very demonstrative this
    episode led to discussion of the topic he told me that his
    sexual strength was great that he had tested it in many ways
    and that it was essential to his wellbeing that he should have
    satisfaction in some way he loathed prostitution and considered
    it degrading he felt physically attracted to some women and
    intellectually to others but the two elements were never
    combined and though he had been intimate with a few he felt that
    it was not right to them as he could not marry them because he
    held too high an ideal of marriage he had always felt attracted
    to his own sex and had kept up a platonic friendship with a
    college chum x to whom i knew he was passionately attached
    for some years both considered it perfectly moral and both
    felt better for it both abhor pedicatio x however would
    never discuss the subject and seemed halfashamed of it a on
    the other hand though showing a great selfrespect in all things
    else feels no shame though he says he would never discuss it
    except with close friends or if asked for private advice
    a is the elder child of a military officer his parents were 21
    and 19 respectively at the time of his birth both parents are
    healthy and the two children both boys have good
    constitutions though the elder has the better he is of medium
    height and slender limbs proud carriage handsome and
    intellectual face classic greek type excellent complexion
    charming manners and good temper the penis is large the
    foreskin very short he is fond of philosophy natural science
    history and literature he is reflective and patient rather than
    smart but strongwilled and very active when roused never
    resting till he has accomplished what he wants even if this
    takes years he sings excellently and is fond of cycling
    boating swimming and mountainclimbing he enjoys excellent
    health and has never had a days illness since he was 12 years
    of age he says the only time he cannot sleep has been when in
    bed with some one who could not or would not satisfy him he
    requires satisfaction at least once a week twice or thrice in
    the hot season he never smokes nor drinks beer or spirits he
    is still single but believes that marriage would meet all his
    needs
    x is also an oldest child of young and healthy parents
    between 21 and 24 at his birth of different class father a
    builder he is of pleasing but not handsome appearance very
    sensitive very neat and methodical in all things not very
    strongwilled and very reserved to women he is of very studious
    disposition especially fond of philosophy politics and natural
    science a good musician takes moderate exercise but rather
    easily fatigued is generally healthy but not overstrong he is
    a vegetarian and was brought up as a freethinker until two
    years ago he was never attracted toward a girl indeed he
    disliked girls but he is now engaged for about eighteen months
    he has relinquished homosexuality but has suffered from dreams
    bad digestion and peevishness since he thinks the only remedy
    is marriage which he is pushing on he regards homosexuality as
    quite natural and normal though his desires are not strong and
    once a fortnight has always satisfied him he was led to the
    practice by the reasoning of a and because he felt a certain
    vague need and this comforted him he thinks it a matter of
    temperament and not to be discussed except by scientists he
    says he could never perform it except with his dearest friend
    whose request he could not resist he has a long foreskin flesh
    like a womans and is well proportioned
    both men are ardent for social reform the one actively the
    other passively engaged in it both also regard the law as to
    homosexuality as absurd and demoralizing they also think that
    the law prohibiting polygamy is largely the cause of
    prostitution as many women are prevented from living honest
    lives and being cared for by someone and many men could marry
    one woman for physical satisfaction and another for intellectual
    they were devoted to each other when i first knew them they are
    still friends but separated by distance both are exceedingly
    honorable and the latter is truthful to a fault
    according to later information x had married and his homosexual
    tendencies were almost completely in abeyance partly perhaps
    owing to the fact that he now lives quietly in the country a
    has surprised his friends by his ardent attachment to a lady of
    about his own age to whom he has become engaged he declares that
    he loves this woman better than any man but nevertheless he
    still feels strong passion for his men friends it is evident
    that the homosexual tendency in a is distinctly more pronounced
    than in his friend x as is found more often in bisexual than in
    homosexual persons he is of predominantly masculine type
    possesses great vitality and desires to exert all his faculties
    he has a sound nervous system and is very free from all
    nervousness he has written a scientific treatise and can study
    undisturbed amid violent noises his voice is manly in singing
    deep base he can whistle he is not vain though well formed
    and his hands are delicate his favorite color is green the
    demonstrative warmth of his affection for his friends is the
    chief feminine trait noted in him he rarely dreams and has never
    had an erotic dream this he explains by saying earlier than
    freud that all dreams not caused by physical conditions are
    wishdreams and as he always satisfies his sexual needs at once
    with a friend or by masturbation his sexual needs have no
    opportunity of affecting his subconscious life
there may be some doubt as to the classification of the two foregoing
cases they are not personally known to me the following case with which
i have been acquainted for many years i regard as clearly a genuine
example of bisexuality
    history xxxienglishman independent means aged 52 married
    his ancestry is of a complicated character some of his mothers
    forefathers in the last and earlier centuries are supposed to
    have been inverted he remembers liking the caresses of his
    fathers footmen when he was quite a little boy he dreams
    indifferently about men and women and has strong sexual feeling
    for women can copulate but does not insist on this act there
    is a tendency to refined voluptuous pleasure he has been
    married for many years and there are several children by the
    marriage
    he is not particular about the class or age of the men he loves
    he feels with regard to older men as a women does and likes to
    be caressed by them he is immensely vain of his physical beauty
    he shuns pedicatio and does not much care for the sexual act
    but likes long hours of voluptuous communion during which his
    lover admires him he feels the beauty of boyhood at the same
    time he is much attracted by young girls
    he is decidedly feminine in his dress manner of walking love of
    scents ornaments and fine things his body is excessively
    smooth and white the hips and buttocks rounded genital organs
    normal his temperament is feminine especially in vanity
    irritability and petty preoccupations he is much preoccupied
    with his personal appearance and fond of admiration on one
    occasion he was photographed naked as bacchus he is physically
    and morally courageous he has a genius for poetry and
    speculation with a tendency to mysticism
    he feels the discord between his love for men and society also
    between it and his love for his wife he regards it as in part
    at least hereditary and inborn in him
    history xxxiicr physician age 38 nationality irish with
    a portuguese strain my mother came of an old quaker family i
    was quite unaware of sexual differences until i was about 14 as
    i was carefully kept separate from my sisters and although from
    time to time strange longings which i did not understand
    possessed me i was a virgin in thought and deed until that
    period of life
    when i was 14 a cousin some years older than myself came to stay
    with us and shared my bed to my surprise he took hold of my
    penis and rubbed it for a time when a most pleasant feeling
    seized me and increased until a discharge came out of my organ
    he then asked me to do the same to him we frequently repeated
    the process during the following month i was quite unaware of
    any harm resulting
    the same year i went to school but none of my schoolmates for
    some time even suggested such actions until a friend staying with
    us for the holidays one day in the bathroom repeated the process
    and pressed his penis between my thighs when a similar discharge
    took place i shortly found out that several of my school friends
    and male cousins had the same desires and an elder brother of my
    first introducer into sexuality repeatedly spent the night with
    me when we would amuse ourselves in a similar way
    a little later my mother being away from home i shared my
    fathers bed and he took my penis in his hand and pulled my
    foreskin back i in return took hold of his and found that he had
    an erection i proceeded to rub him when he stopped me and told
    me that i should not do so that when i was a little older i
    should love a woman to do it and that if i did not rub myself and
    allow other boys to do so i would enjoy myself much more i am
    quite certain that my father was inverted as he frequently if
    sleeping with me used to press my naked body against his and he
    always had a strong erection on one occasion he rubbed me until
    i had a discharge and then turning over on his back made me
    take his penis in my hand and rub him for a few minutes i used
    to jest frequently with my father as from my seventeenth year my
    penis was larger than his i will return to my father a little
    later when i was 17 a college friend shared my bed and when
    undressing he said that he envied me my penis being so much
    larger than his after getting into bed he asked me to turn on
    my side and i found that he was attempting pedicatio i was
    astonished at his doing so when he informed me that next to a
    woman this process gave most pleasure however nothing resulted
    and this is the only experience of pedicatio that i have ever
    had
    when i was 18 one evening a college chum introduced me to a
    woman and she was the first i ever had connection with we went
    behind some rocks and she took hold of my penis and pressed it
    into her body lying against me
    my father evidently suspected me when i came home and a few
    days afterward told me that it was very dangerous to have
    anything to do with women that i should wait until i was older
    that when a boy became a man he ought to have a woman
    occasionally and that if i ever had a nasty disease i should
    promptly tell him so that i could be properly cured
    at college i found several chums who were fond of sharing my bed
    and indulging in mutual masturbation pressing our bodies
    together face to face until there was mutual discharge but never
    again anyone who tried anal connection
    a short time afterward i was in brussels and i paid my first
    visit to a brothel a place close to the cathedral i picked a
    girl of about 18 from eight naked beauties paraded for my choice
    she was avaricious and demanded 10 francs i had paid 20 for my
    room and had only 2 left i wanted her to play with me but she
    only seized the penis and pulled me to her with such vigorous
    action that i discharged very rapidly i was so disgusted with
    the result that i masturbated when i returned to my boarding
    house
    a year later i paid portugal a visit and my friends there
    frequently brought me to brothels and also introduced me to
    ladies of easy virtue i had connection with them the portuguese
    prostitutes never suggested anything unnatural and in no instance
    did a male approach me for sexual purposes
    when i became a medical student i used to visit a turkish bath
    frequently on one occasion i playfully slapped a friend on the
    buttocks when my father who was present told me not to do so
    as it was not proper conduct in public that if i liked to do so
    to him or one or two others it was no harm in private until i
    was 21 in the bath my father always covered his penis from my
    view but after i attained my majority he always exposed himself
    and repeatedly showed me pictures of naked women he also taught
    me the use of the condom
    in my twentyfourth year a tall handsome man who used to
    frequent the baths one day sat down beside me and playfully
    knocked my toes with his he then pressed his naked thigh against
    mine and a little later in the cooling room slipped his hand
    under my sheet and grasped my penis he then asked me to meet him
    a few days later in the baths saying i would be pleased with
    what he would do
    i kept the appointment and he took me into the hottest room
    where we lay on the floor in a few minutes he turned on his side
    and threw one of his legs across me i got frightened and jumped
    up he had a powerful erection but i refused to lie down again
    although he pulled his foreskin back to excite my desires i was
    afraid of being surprised by another bather twice on future
    occasions i met this man and he made advances i believe that i
    would have yielded then if we had met at a private house
    shortly afterward i met an elderly gentleman at the baths who
    also made advances to me but from fear i resisted him i also
    disliked him as he had a foul breath and bad teeth besides i was
    now able to go to the continent and enjoy female charms to my
    hearts desire
    after qualification i joined the army in south africa and to my
    astonishment found many of my comrades fond of male society one
    officer who had been wounded shared my bedroom at a military
    hospital and when undressing frequently admired my penis we used
    to play with each other until we had powerful erections but we
    never masturbated or tried any unnatural vice
    i used to have connection with women as frequently as i could
    and i frequently visited the turkish baths and found that several
    clients were abnormal including one of the masseurs the latter
    enjoyed playing with my penis kissing and tickling me
    i married at 28 my married life has been normal and my wife and
    i are still in love with one another we have had several
    children
    my last sexual experiences have been in australia once in
    sydney at the baths a fellowbather playfully began tickling me
    when i had an erection he grasped my penis i jumped up and he
    asked me to do anything that i liked with him i refused once
    on board a coasting steamer a fellowpassenger used to expose
    himself posing as a statue we became very familiar and he
    wanted me to spend a night with him i also refused his offers
    i am very healthy and strong fond of riding fishing and
    shooting i lead a very active life i am neither musician nor
    artist but fond of hearing music and i admire works of art
    in person i am 6 feet high inclined to fat my body is very
    strong my penis is six inches long in repose and eight in
    erection i can without fatigue discharge twice in the night and
    have connection at least twice a week my scrotum is tense and
    both testicles large i am rather slow at discharging i have
    never had any desire to have connection with any other woman
    since marriage but several times i have met men who attracted
    me i have a friend another doctor who is very familiar with me
    and if we spend a night together we will play with each other i
    have a great desire for him to circumcize me we have never
    indulged in anything beyond feeling or pressing our bodies
    together like schoolboys
    my favorite color is green
    my erotic dreams when i have any are of my wife or of a male
    lover
    sexual inversion is more widespread than is popularly supposed
    and i have never had any twinge of conscience after any of my
    affairs i regard the homosexual instinct as quite natural and
    except in regard to my wife it is stronger in my case than the
    heterosexual instinct i have never initiated a youth into the
    sexual life or had any desire to seduce a girl boys under 17 or
    persons of lower social class have no attraction for me
    history xxxiiimo 30 years of age born in the united
    states of english father and of mother whose father was
    scotchthe rest of his ancestry being english of long standing
    in america with a very little admixture of dutch blood he is 5
    feet 8 inches in height and has brown hair and eyes no
    hereditary troubles so far as known in childhood for some time
    threatened with chorea is subject to tonsillitis and a
    stubborn though not severe form of indigestion induced by
    sedentary habits he is of quick nervous temperament has an
    aversion from most outdoor sports but a great esthetic
    attraction to nature highly educated
    as far back as he can remember he lived in a house from which
    his parents removed when he was 4 years old before this removal
    he remembers two distinctly sexual experiences a cousin five
    years older was in the bathroom seated and mo was feeling his
    sexual organs his mother called him out on another occasion he
    was in a wagonhouse with a girl of his own age they were lying
    on a carriageseat attempting intercourse the girls older
    sister came in and found them she said i am going to tell
    mamma you know she said for you not to do that any more with
    each of these clear memories comes the strong impression that it
    was but one among many five years ago mo met a man of his own
    age who had lived in that neighborhood at the same time
    comparing notes they found that nearly all the small children in
    it had been given to such practices the neighborhood was a
    thoroughly respectable middleclass one
    from it mo removed to another of just about the same
    character and lived there until he was 11 years old of this
    period his memories are very fresh and abundant with a single
    exception all the children between 5 and 14 years of age appear
    to have indulged freely in promiscuous sexual play in little
    companies of from four to twelve they went where trees or long
    grass hid them from observation and exhibited their persons to
    one another sometimes also they handled one another but not
    in the way of masturbation of this last mo was wholly
    ignorant sometimes when but two or three were together
    intercourse was attempted in mos case there was eager sexual
    curiosity and a more or less keen desire but actual contact
    brought no great satisfaction on two or three occasions girls
    practised fellatio and he then reciprocated with
    cunnilinctus but without pleasure in all these plays he is
    sure that girls took the initiative as often as boys did
    during all this period mo had now one girl sweetheart and now
    another this was conventional among the children and was
    fostered by the banter of older persons mos sexual curiosity
    was certainly greater in regard to the opposite sex at this
    time however his homosexual interests appeared with a boy two
    or more years older he frequently went to some hidingplace where
    they looked at each others organs and handled them he and
    another boy were once in an abandoned garden and they took off
    all their clothes the better to examine each other the other
    boy then offered to kiss mos fundament and did so it caused
    a surprisingly keen and distinctly sexual sensation the first
    sexual shock that he can remember experiencing he refused to
    reciprocate however when asked
    toward the end of this period there was a new and increasing
    development of another sort not recognized then as at all sexual
    in character he began to feel toward certain boys in a way very
    different and much keener than he had done thus far toward girls
    although at the time he made no comparisons for instance there
    was a boy whom he considered very pretty they visited each other
    often and spent long times playing together in school they
    looked and looked at each other until delicious uncontrollable
    giggling spells came on sexual matters were never discussed or
    thought of these experiences were in their way very
    sentimental and ideal mo is sure that with himself the main
    consideration was always the other boys beauty he began to
    recall with great fondness a certain much older and very handsome
    youth who had lived near him in the first neighborhood and had
    at the time shown him various little friendly attentions he
    seldom saw him now and hardly sought to do so yet was immensely
    pleased by a casual word or look from him in the schoolyard and
    much interested when other people spoke of him
    a cousin about two years younger than mo often visited him and
    slept with him they were very fond of each other and handled
    each others organs
    when mo was about 11 years of age the family removed to a
    distant neighborhood where there were almost no children of his
    own age and where any association with those in the one just
    left was practically impossible from this time until the changes
    of puberty were well under way his sexual life contrasted
    strongly in its solitude with the former promiscuity he
    remembers liking to wrestle with two or three schoolboys and to
    get their heads between his legs he thinks they were not aware
    of his sexual impulses he flirted consciously flirted with
    certain schoolgirls but never even suggested anything sexual to
    them he read a few family medical books
    one day lying on an old uneven couch innocently enough at
    first he induced a new and delicious sensation altogether
    different from any he had ever dreamed ofsomething far beyond
    the satisfaction of mere curiosity he repeated the thing and
    before long produced emissions masturbation soon followed
    certain days he would perform the act two or three times but
    again he would avoid it for days he began at once to fight the
    tendency and felt very guilty and very ashamed for indulging it
    he prayed for help and at times wept over his failures to break
    the habit so quickly formed for a certain period after two or
    three years he seemed to have succeeded but he observed that he
    had intense erotic dreams with copious emissions regularly every
    eight days just then certain newspaper advertisements fell under
    his eye and these persuaded him that he had produced in himself
    a diseased condition he never resorted to the remedies
    advertised but he was discouraged in his efforts to overcome the
    bad habit and since the evil effects appeared to consist only in
    the seminal losses he concluded that he might as well have the
    greater enjoyment of masturbation
    for a short time he remembers that he had an intense but
    revolting interest in the sexual organs of animals especially
    horses the males were much more interesting
    gradually he began to develop entirely from within the ideal of
    a male comradea beautiful emotional boy between whom and
    himself there might exist a powerful romantic passion he lay for
    hours dreaming of this and inventing thrilling situations
    suddenly at church he became acquainted with the very youth
    edmund who seemed to satisfy all his longings mo was then 16
    and edmund 15 a real wooing ensued edmund finally yielding to
    the physical appeals of mo after several fits of misgiving the
    yielding was in the end complete however the two spent night
    after night together enjoying intercrural intercourse and
    sometimes mutual masturbation their parents may have been
    slightly uneasy at times but the connection continued
    uninterruptedly for a year and a half or more in the meantime
    mo occasionally had relations with other boys but never
    wavered in his real preference for edmund for girls he had no
    sexual desire whatever though he was much associated with them
    then mo and edmund went to college at different places but
    they met in vacations and wrote frequent and ardent loveletters
    both had genuine attacks of lovesickness and of jealousy as
    mo looks back on this first love passion he can by no means
    regret it it doubtless had great formative influence
    after the first year at college edmund transferred to another
    school farther away from mo and the opportunities for meeting
    became rarer but their affection was maintained and the
    intercourse resumed whenever it was possible gradually however
    edmund became interested in women and finally married mo also
    formed relations repeatedly with college friends and occasionally
    with others
    on the whole mo preferred boys a year or two younger than
    himself but as he grew older the age difference increased at 30
    he regarded himself as virtually engaged to a youth of 17 one
    unusually mature however and much larger than himself
    mo is always unhappy unless his affections have fairly free
    course life has been very disappointing to him in other
    respects his greatest joys have come to him in this way if he
    is able to consummate his present plan of union with the youth
    just referred to he will feel that his life has been crowned by
    what is for him the best possible end otherwise he declares he
    would not care to live at all
    he admires male beauty passionately feminine beauty he perceives
    objectively as he would any design of flowing curves and
    delicate coloring but it has no sexual charm for him whatever
    women have put themselves in his way repeatedly but he finds
    himself more and more irritated by their specifically feminine
    foibles with men generally he is much more patient and
    sympathetic
    the first literature that appealed to him was platos dialogues
    first read at 20 years of age until then he had not known but
    what he stood alone in his peculiarity he read what he could of
    classic literature he enjoys pater appreciating his attitude
    toward his own sex four or five years later he came across
    raffalovichs book and ever since has felt a real debt of
    gratitude to its author
    mo has no wish to injure society at large as an individual he
    holds that he has the same right to be himself that anyone else
    has he thinks that while boys of from 13 to 15 might possibly be
    rendered inverts those who reach 16 without it cannot be bent
    that way they may be devoted to an invert enough in other ways
    to yield him what he wishes sexually but they will remain
    essentially normal themselves his observations are based on
    about 30 homosexual relationships that have lasted various
    lengths of time
    mo feels strongly the poetic and elevated character of his
    principal homosexual relationships but he shrinks from appearing
    too sentimental
    with regard to the traces of feminism in inverts he writes
    up to the age of 11 i associated much with a cousin five years
    older the one referred to above and took great delight in a
    game we often played in which i was a girla neverending
    romance a nonsexual love story
    somewhat later and until puberty i took great delight in
    acting but generally took female roles wearing skirts shawls
    beads wigs headdresses when i was about 13 my family began to
    make fun of me for it i played secretly for a while and then
    the desire for it left never to return
    there still lingers however a minor interest which began
    before puberty in valentines my feeling for them is much like
    my feeling for flowers
    before i reached puberty i was sometimes called a sissy by my
    father such taunts humiliated me more than anything else has
    ever done after puberty my father no longer applied the term
    and gradually other persons ceased to tease me that way the
    sting of it lasted though and led me more than once to ask
    intimate friends both men and women if they considered me at
    all feminine every one of them has been very emphatically of the
    opinion that my rational life is distinctively masculine being
    logical impartial skeptical one or two have suggested that i
    have a finer discrimination than most men and that i take care
    of my rooms somewhat as a woman might though this does not
    extend to the style of decorations one man said that i lacked
    sympathy with certain grosser manifestations of masculine
    character such as smoking some women think me unusually
    observing of womens dress my own is by no means effeminate in
    a muscular way i have average strength but am supple far beyond
    what is usual if trained for it early i believe i would have
    made a good contortionist
    i have never had the least inclination to use tobacco generally
    take neither tea nor coffee and seldom any liquor never malt
    liquors the dessert is always the best part of the meal these
    tastes i attribute largely to my sedentary life when out camping
    i observed a marked change in the direction of heartier food and
    mild stimulants
    my physical courage has never been put to the test but i
    observe that others appear to count on it i am very aggressive
    in matters of religious political social opinion in moral
    courage i am either reckless or courageous i do not know which
    i am perhaps a better whistler than most men
    when i was quite little my grandmother taught me to do certain
    kinds of fancywork and i continued to do a little from time to
    time until i was 24 then i became irritated over a piece that
    troubled me put it in the fire and have not wanted to touch any
    since as a pet economy i continue to do nearly all of my own
    mending
    i have a decided aversion for much jewelry my estheticism is
    very pronounced as compared with most of the men with whom i
    associate although i have never been able to give it much scope
    it makes for cleanliness order and general good taste my dress
    is economical and by no means fastidious yet it seems to be
    generally approved i have been complimented often on my ability
    to select appropriate presents clothing and to arrange a room
    mo states that he practises the lovebite at times though very
    gently he often wants to pinch one who interests him sexually
    he considers very silly the statement somewhere made that
    inverts are always liars very few people he says are perfectly
    honest and the more dangerous society makes it for a man to be
    so the less likely he is to be while he himself has been unable
    in two or three instances to keep promises made to withhold from
    sexual intercourse with certain attractive individuals he has
    never otherwise been guilty of untruth about his homosexual
    relations
    the foregoing narrative was received eight years ago during this
    interval mos health has very greatly improved there has been
    a marked increase in outdoor activities and interests
    two years since mo consulted a prominent specialist who
    performed a thorough psychoanalysis he informed mo that he
    was less strongly homosexual than he himself supposed and
    recommended marriage with some young and pretty woman he
    attributed the homosexual bent to mos having had his nose
    broken at the age of 6 by the birth of a younger brother who
    from that time on received all the attention and petting mo
    had continued up to that age very affectionate toward his mother
    and dependent on her he can remember friends and neighbors
    commenting on it at first mo was inclined to reject this
    suggestion of the specialist but on long reflection he inclines
    to believe that it was indeed a very important factor though not
    the sole one from his later observations of children and
    comparisons of these with memories of his own childhood mo
    says he is sure he was affectionate and demonstrative much beyond
    the average his greatest craving was for affection and his
    greatest grief the fancied belief that no one cared for him at
    10 or 11 he attempted suicide for this reason
    also as a result of the psychoanalysis but trying to eliminate
    the influence of suggestion he recollects and emphasizes more
    the attraction he felt toward girls before the age of 12 had his
    sexual experiences subsequently proved normal he doubts if those
    before 12 could be held to give evidence of homosexuality but
    only of precocious nervous and sexual irritability greatly
    heightened and directed by the secret practices of the children
    with whom he associated he does not see why these experiences
    should have given him a homosexual bent any more than a
    heterosexual one
    the psychoanalysis recalled to mo that during the period of
    early flirtation he had often kissed and embraced various girls
    but likewise he recalled having observed at the same time with
    some surprise that no definitely sexual desire arose though the
    way was probably open to gratify it such interest as did exist
    ceased wholly or almost so as the relation with edmund developed
    there was no aversion from the company of girls and women
    however the intellectual friendships were mainly with them
    while the emotional ones were with boys
    very recently mo spent several days with edmund who has been
    married for several years with absolutely no sexual interest in
    each other they nevertheless found a great bond of love still
    subsisting neither regrets anything of the past but feels that
    the final outcome of their earlier relation has been good
    edmunds beauty is still pronounced and is remarked by others
    in spite of his precocious sexuality mo had from the very
    first an extreme disgust for obscene stories and for any
    association of sexual things with filthy words and anecdotes
    owing in part to this and in part to his temperamental
    skepticism he disbelieved what associates told him regarding
    sexual emissions only becoming convinced when he actually
    experienced them and the facts of reproduction he denied
    indignantly until he read them in a medical work until he was
    well over 25 the physical aversion from any thought of
    reproduction was intense he knows other normal young men who
    have felt the same way but he believes it would be prevented or
    overcome by sexeducation such as is now being introduced in
    american schools
    again as to traces of feminism perhaps two years ago all
    impulse to give the lovebite disappeared suddenly there has
    been lately a marked increase of dramatic interest arising in
    perfectly natural ways and without any of the peculiarities
    noted before the childish pleasure in valentines has all gone
    mo believes that circumstances have lately been more
    favorable for the development of a more robust estheticism
    for some years he has heard no definite reproach for feminism
    though some persons tell his friends that he is very peculiar
    he forms many intimate enduring nonsexual friendships with
    both men and women and he doubts if the peculiarity noted by
    others is due so much to his homosexuality as it is to his
    estheticism skepticism and the unconventional opinions which he
    expresses quite indiscreetly at times with the improvement in
    general health has come the changes that would be expected in
    food and other matters of daily life
    resuming his narrative at the point where the earlier
    communication left it mo says that about a year after that
    time the youth of 17 to whom he had considered himself virtually
    engaged withdrew from the agreement so far as it bore on his own
    future but not from the sentimental relation as it existed
    although separated most of the time by distance the physical
    relation was resumed whenever they met subsequently however
    the young man fell in love with a young woman and became engaged
    to her his physical relation with mo then ceased but the
    friendship otherwise continues strong
    shortly after the first break in this relation mo became
    through the force of quite unusual circumstances very friendly
    and intimate with a young woman of considerable charm he
    confided to her his abnormality and was not repulsed to others
    their relation probably appeared that of lovers and a painful
    situation was created by the slander of a jealous woman mo
    felt that in honor he must propose marriage to her the young
    woman was noncommittal but invited mo to spend several months
    at her home shortly after his arrival a sad occurrence in his
    own family compelled him to go away and they did not meet again
    for four years they corresponded but less and less often his
    relations with boys continued
    before his final meeting with her he became acquainted with a
    woman whom he has since married the acquaintance began in a
    wholly nonsentimental community of interests in certain
    practical affairs and very gradually widened into an
    intellectual and sympathetic friendship mo had no secrets from
    this woman after a full and prolonged consideration of all sides
    of the matter they married since that event he has had no sexual
    relations except with his wife with her they are not passionate
    but they are animated by the strong desire for children of the
    parental instinct he had become aware several years before this
    mo believes that no moral stigma should be attached to
    homosexuality until it can be proved to result from the vicious
    life of a free moral agentand of this he has no expectation
    he believes that much of its danger and unhappiness would be
    prevented by a thorough yet discreet sexeducation such as
    should be given to all children whether normal or abnormal

instinct but also the presence of both sexes in the same individual

womenthe modern development of homosexuality among women
homosexuality is not less common in women than in men in the seriocomic
theory of sex set forth by aristophanes in platos symposium males and
females are placed on a footing of complete equality and however
fantastic the theory suffices to indicate that to the greek mind so
familiar with homosexuality its manifestations seemed just as likely to
occur in women as in men that is undoubtedly the case like other
anomalies indeed in its more pronounced forms it may be less frequently
met with in women in its less pronounced forms almost certainly it is
more frequently found a catholic confessor a friend tells me informed
him that for one man who acknowledges homosexual practices there are three
women for the most part feminine homosexuality runs everywhere a parallel
course to masculine homosexuality and is found under the same conditions
it is as common in girls as in boys it has been found under certain
conditions to abound among women in colleges and convents and prisons as
well as under the ordinary conditions of society perhaps the earliest
case of homosexuality recorded in detail occurred in a woman137 and it
was with the investigation of such a case in a woman that westphal may be
said to have inaugurated the scientific study of inversion
moreover inversion is as likely to be accompanied by high intellectual
ability in a woman as in a man the importance of a clear conception of
inversion is indeed in some respects under present social conditions
really even greater in the case of women than of men for if as has
sometimes been said of our civilization this is a mans world the
large proportion of able women inverts whose masculine qualities render
it comparatively easy for them to adopt masculine avocations becomes a
highly significant fact138
it has been noted of distinguished women in all ages and in all fields of
activity that they have frequently displayed some masculine traits139
even the first great woman in history as she has been called by a
historian of egypt queen hatschepsu was clearly of markedly virile
temperament and always had herself represented on her monuments in
masculine costume and even with a false beard140 other famous queens
have on more or less satisfactory grounds been suspected of a homosexual
temperament such as catherine ii of russia who appears to have been
bisexual and queen christina of sweden whose very marked masculine
traits and high intelligence seem to have been combined with a definitely
homosexual or bisexual temperament141
great religious and moral leaders like madame blavatsky and louise
michel have been either homosexual or bisexual or at least of
pronounced masculine temperament142 great actresses from the eighteenth
century onward have frequently been more or less correctly identified with
homosexuality as also many women distinguished in other arts143 above
all sappho the greatest of women poets the peer of the greatest poets
of the other sex in the supreme power of uniting art and passion has left
a name which is permanently associated with homosexuality
    it can scarcely be said that opinion is unanimous in regard to
    sappho and the reliable information about her outside the
    evidence of the fragments of her poems which have reached us is
    scanty her fame has always been great in classic times her name
    was coupled with homers but even to antiquity she was somewhat
    of an enigma and many legends grew up around her name such as
    the familiar story that she threw herself into the sea for the
    love of phaon what remains clear is that she was regarded with
    great respect and admiration by her contemporaries that she was
    of aristocratic family that she was probably married and had a
    daughter that at one time she had to take her part in political
    exile and that she addressed her girl friends in precisely
    similar terms to those addressed by alcaeus to youths we know
    that in antiquity feminine homosexuality was regarded as
    especially common in sparta lesbos and miletus horace who was
    able to read sapphos complete poems states that the objects of
    her loveplaints were the young girls of lesbos while ovid who
    played so considerable a part in weaving fantastic stories round
    sapphos name never claimed that they had any basis of truth it
    was inevitable that the early christians should eagerly attack so
    ambiguous a figure and tatian oratio ad graecos cap 52
    reproached the greeks that they honored statues of the tribade
    sappho a prostitute who had celebrated her own wantonness and
    infatuation the result is that in modern times there have been
    some who placed sapphos character in a very bad light and others
    who have gone to the opposite extreme in an attempt at
    rehabilitation thus w mure in his history of the language

    4968 dealing very fully with sappho is disposed to accept
    many of the worst stories about her though he has no pronounced
    animus and as regards female homosexuality which he considers
    to be far more venial than male homosexuality he remarks that
    in modern times it has numbered among its votaries females
    distinguished for refinement of manners and elegant
    accomplishments bascoul on the other hand will accept no
    statements about sappho which conflict with modern ideals of

    according to which the attribution of homosexuality is a charge
    of vice to be repudiated with indignation most competent and
    reliable authorities today however while rejecting the
    accretions of legend around sapphos name and not disputing her
    claim to respect are not disposed to question the personal and
    homosexual character of her poems all ancient tradition and the
    character of her extant fragments says prof ja platt
    encyclopedia britannica 11th ed art sappho show that
    her morality was what has ever since been known as lesbian
    what exactly that lesbian morality involved we cannot indeed
    exactly ascertain it is altogether idle as a croiset remarks
    of sappho histoire de la littrature grecque vol ii ch v
    to discuss the exact quality of this friendship or this love or
    to seek to determine with precision the frontiers which language
    itself often seems to seek to confuse of a friendship more or
    less esthetic and sensual of a love more or less platonic see
    also jm edmonds sappho in the added light of the new
    fragments 1912 iwan bloch similarly concludes ursprung der
    syphilis vol ii 1911 p 507 that sappho probably combined
    as modern investigation shows to be easily possible lofty ideal
    feelings with passionate sensuality exactly as happens in normal
    love
it must also be said that in literature homosexuality in women has
furnished a much more frequent motive to the artist than homosexuality in
men among the greeks indeed homosexuality in women seldom receives
literary consecration and in the revival of the classical spirit at the
renaissance it was still chiefly in male adolescents as we see for
instance in marinos adone that the homosexual ideal found expression
after that date male inversion was for a long period rarely touched in
literature save briefly and satirically while inversion in women
becomes a subject which might be treated in detail and even with
complacence many poets and novelists especially in france might be
cited in evidence
    ariosto it has been pointed out has described the homosexual
    attractions of women diderots famous novel la religieuse
    which when first published was thought to have been actually
    written by a nun deals with the torture to which a nun was put
    by the perverse lubricity of her abbess for whom it is said
    diderot found a model in the abbess of chelles a daughter of the
    regent and thus a member of a family which for several
    generations showed a marked tendency to inversion diderots
    narrative has been described as a faithful description of the
    homosexual phenomena liable to occur in convents feminine
    homosexuality especially in convents was often touched on less
    seriously in the eighteenth century thus we find a homosexual
    scene in les plaisirs du clotre a play written in 1773 le
    thtre damour an xviiie sicle 1910 balzac who treated so
    many psychological aspects of love in a more or less veiled
    manner has touched on this in la fille aux yeux dor in a
    vague and extravagantly romantic fashion gautier made the
    adventures of a woman who was predisposed to homosexuality and
    slowly realizes the fact the central motive of his wonderful
    romance mademoiselle de maupin 1835 he approached the
    subject purely as an artist and poet but his handling of it
    shows remarkable insight gautier based his romance to some
    extent on the life of madame maupin or as she preferred to call
    herself mademoiselle maupin who was born in 1673 her fathers
    name being daubigny dressed as a man and became famous as a
    teacher of fencing afterward as an opera singer she was
    apparently of bisexual temperament and her devotion to women led
    her into various adventures she ultimately entered a convent
    and died at the age of 34 with a reputation for sanctity ec

    popular novelist a belot published a novel called
    mademoiselle giraud ma femme which was much read the
    novelist took the attitude of a moralist who is bound to treat
    frankly but with all decorous propriety a subject of increasing
    social gravity the story is that of a man whose bride will not
    allow his approach on account of her own liaison with a female
    friend continued after marriage this book appears to have given
    origin to a large number of novels some of which touched the
    question with considerable less affectation of propriety among
    other novelists who have dealt with the matter may be mentioned

    damour catulle mends mphistophla and willy in the
    claudine series
    among poets who have used the motive of homosexuality in women
    with more or less boldness may be found lamartine regina
    swinburne first series of poems and ballads verlaine
    paralllement and pierre louys chansons de bilitis the
    lastnamed book a collection of homosexual prosepoems
    attracted considerable attention on publication as it was an
    attempt at mystification being put forward as a translation of
    the poems of a newly discovered oriental greek poetess bilitis
    more usually beltis is the syrian name for aphrodite les
    chansons de bilitis are not without charm but have been
    severely dealt with by wilamowitzmoellendorff sappho und
    simonides 1913 p 63 et seq as a travesty of hellenism
    betraying inadequate knowledge of greek antiquity
    more interesting as the work of a woman who was not only highly
    gifted but herself of homosexual temperament are the various
    volumes of poems published by rene vivien this lady whose
    real name was pauline tarn was born in 1877 her father was of
    scotch descent and her mother an american lady from honolulu as
    a child she was taken to paris and was brought up as a french
    girl she travelled much and at one time took a house at
    mitylene the chief city of ancient lesbos she had a love of
    solitude hated publicity and was devoted to her women friends
    especially to one whose early death about 1900 was the great
    sorrow of pauline tarns life she is described as very
    beautiful very simple and sweetnatured and highly accomplished
    in many directions she suffered however from nervous
    overtension and incurable melancholy toward the close of her
    life she was converted to catholicism and died in 1909 at the
    age of 32 she is buried in the cemetery at passy her best verse
    is by some considered among the finest in the french language
    charles brun pauline tarn notes and queries 22 aug
    1914 the same writer who knew her well has also written a
    pamphlet rene vivien sansot paris 1911 her chief volumes
    of poems are etudes et preludes 1901 cendres et poussires
    1902 evocations 1903 a novel une femme mapparut
    1904 is said to be to some extent autobiographical rene
    vivien also wrote a volume on sappho with translations and a
    further volume of poems les kithardes suggested by the
    fragments which remain of the minor women poets of greece
    followers of sappho
it is moreover noteworthy that a remarkably large proportion of the
cases in which homosexuality has led to crimes of violence or otherwise
come under medicolegal observation has been among women it is well
know that the part taken by women generally in open criminality and
especially in crimes of violence is small as compared with men144 in
the homosexual field as we might have anticipated the conditions are to
some extent reversed inverted men in whom a more or less feminine
temperament is so often found are rarely impelled to acts of aggressive
violence though they frequently commit suicide inverted women who may
retain their feminine emotionality combined with some degree of infantile
impulsiveness and masculine energy present a favorable soil for the seeds
of passional crime under those conditions of jealousy and allied emotions
which must so often enter into the inverts life
    the first conspicuous example of this tendency in recent times is
    the memphis case 1892 in the united states arthur macdonald
    observation de sexualit pathologique feminine archives
    danthropologie criminelle may 1895 see also krafftebing
    psychopathia sexualis eng trans of 10th ed p 550 in
    this case a congenital sexual invert alice mitchell planned a
    marriage with freda ward taking a malename and costume this
    scheme was frustrated by fredas sister and alice mitchell then
    cut fredas throat there is no reason to suppose that she was
    insane at the time of the murder she was a typical invert of a
    very pronounced kind her mother had been insane and had
    homicidal impulses she herself was considered unbalanced and
    was masculine in her habits from her earliest years her face was
    obviously unsymmetrical and she had an appearance of youthfulness
    below her age she was not vicious and had little knowledge of
    sexual matters but when she kissed freda she was ashamed of
    being seen while freda could see no reason for being ashamed
    she was adjudged insane
    there have been numerous cases in america more recently one case
    for some details concerning which i am indebted to dr jg
    kiernan of chicago is that of the tiller sisters two
    quintroons who for many years had acted together under that name
    in cheap theaters one who was an invert with a horror of men
    dating from early girlhood was sexually attached to the other
    who was without inborn inversion and was eventually induced by a
    man to leave the invert the latter overcome by jealousy broke
    into the apartment of the couple and shot the man dead she was
    tried and sent to prison for life a defense of insanity was
    made but for this there was no evidence in another case also
    occurring in chicago reported in medicine june 1899 and
    alienist and neurologist october 1899 a trained nurse lived
    for fourteen years with a young woman who left her on four
    different occasions but was each time induced to return
    finally however she left and married whereupon the nurse shot
    the husband who was not however fatally wounded the culprit
    in this case had been twice married but had not lived with
    either of her husbands it was stated that her mother had died in
    an asylum and that her brother had committed suicide she was
    charged with disorderly conduct and subjected to a fine
    in another later case in chicago a russian girl of 22 named anna
    rubinowitch shot from motives of jealousy another russian girl
    to whom she had been devoted from childhood and then fatally
    shot herself the relations between the two girls had been very
    intimate our love affair is one purely of the soul anna
    rubinowitch was accustomed to say we love each other on a
    higher plane than that of earth i am informed that there were
    in fact physical relationships the sexual organs were normal
    this continued with great devotion on each side until annas
    sweetheart began to show herself susceptible to the advances of
    a male wooer this aroused uncontrollable jealousy in anna whose
    father it may be noted had committed suicide by shooting some
    years previously
    homosexual relationships are also a cause of suicide among women
    such a case was reported in massachusetts early in 1901 a girl
    of 21 had been tended during a period of nervous prostration
    apparently of hysterical nature by a friend and neighbor
    fourteen years her senior married and having children an
    intimate friendship grew up equally ardent on both sides the
    mother of the younger woman and the husband of the other took
    measures to put a stop to the intimacy and the girl was sent
    away to a distant city stolen interviews however still
    occurred finally when the obstacles became insurmountable the
    younger woman bought a revolver and deliberately shot herself in
    the temple in presence of her mother dying immediately though
    sometimes thought to act rather strangely she was a great
    favorite with all handsome very athletic fond of all outdoor
    sports an energetic religious worker possessing a fine voice
    and was an active member of many clubs and societies the older
    woman belonged to an aristocratic family and was loved and
    respected by all in another case in new york in 1905 a retired
    sailor captain john weed who had commanded transatlantic
    vessels for many years was admitted to a home for old sailors
    and shortly after became ill and despondent and cut his throat
    it was then found that captain weed was really a woman i am
    informed that the old sailors despondency and suicide were due
    to enforced separation from a female companion
    the infatuation of young girls for actresses and other prominent
    women may occasionally lead to suicide thus in philadelphia a
    few years ago a girl of 19 belonging to a very wealthy family
    beautiful and highly educated acquired an absorbing infatuation
    for miss mary garden the prima donna with whom she had no
    personal acquaintance the young girl would kneel in worship
    before the singers portrait and studied hairdressing and
    manicuring in the hope of becoming miss gardens maid when she
    realized that her dream was hopeless she shot herself with a
    revolver cases more or less resembling those here brought
    forward occur from time to time in all parts of the civilized
    world reports mostly from current newspapers of such cases as
    well as of simple transvestism or eonism in both women and men
    will be found in the publications of the berlin
    wissenschaftlichhumanitren komitee the monatsberichte up to
    1909 then in the vierteljahrsberichte and from 1913 onward in
    the jahrbuch fr sexuelle zwischenstufen
yet until recently comparatively little has been known of sexual
inversion in women even so lately as 1901 after the publication of the
first edition of the present study krafftebing wrote that scarcely
fifty cases had been recorded the chief monographs devoted but little
space to women
    krafftebing himself in the earlier editions of psychopathia
    sexualis gave little special attention to inversion in women
    although he published a few cases moll however included a
    valuable chapter on the subject in his kontrre
    sexualempfindung narrating numerous cases and inversion in
    women also received special attention in the present study
    hirschfeld however in his homosexualitt 1914 is the first
    authority who has been able to deal with feminine homosexuality
    as completely coordinate with masculine homosexuality the two
    manifestations masculine and feminine are placed on the same
    basis and treated together throughout the work
it is no doubt not difficult to account for this retardation in the
investigation of sexual inversion in women notwithstanding the severity
with which homosexuality in women has been visited in a few cases for the
most part men seem to have been indifferent toward it when it has been
made a crime or a cause for divorce in men it has usually been considered
as no offense at all in women145 another reason is that it is less
easy to detect in women we are accustomed to a much greater familiarity
and intimacy between women than between men and we are less apt to
suspect the existence of any abnormal passion and allied with this
cause we have also to bear in mind the extreme ignorance and the extreme
reticence of women regarding any abnormal or even normal manifestation of
their sexual life a woman may feel a high degree of sexual attraction for
another woman without realizing that her affection is sexual and when she
does realize this she is nearly always very unwilling to reveal the
nature of her intimate experience even with the adoption of precautions
and although the fact may be present to her that by helping to reveal the
nature of her abnormality she may be helping to lighten the burden of it
on other women among the numerous confessions voluntarily sent to
krafftebing there is not one by a woman there is again the further
reason that wellmarked and fully developed cases of inversion are
probably rarer in women though a slighter degree may be more common in
harmony with the greater affectability of the feminine organism to slight
stimuli and its lesser liability to serious variation146
the same aberrations that are found among men are however everywhere
found among women feminine inversion has sometimes been regarded as a
vice of modern refined civilization yet it was familiar to the
anglosaxons and theodores penitential in the seventh century assigned a
penance of three years considerably less than that assigned to men or
for bestiality to a woman fornicating with a woman among the women of
savages in all parts of the world homosexuality is found though it is
less frequently recorded than among men147
in new zealand it is stated on the authority of moerenhout though i have
not been able to find the reference that the women practised lesbianism
in south america where inversion is common among men we find similar
phenomena in women among brazilian tribes gandavo148 wrote
    there are certain women among these indians who determine to be
    chaste and know no man these leave every womanly occupation and
    imitate the men they wear their hair the same way as the men
    they go to war with them or hunting bearing their bows they
    continue always in the company of men and each has a woman who
    serves her and with whom she lives
this has some analogy with the phenomena seen among north american men
dr holder who has carefully studied the bot tells me that he has met
no corresponding phenomena in women
there is no doubt however that homosexuality among women is well known
to the american indians in various regions thus the salish indians of
british columbia have a myth of an old woman who had intercourse with a
young woman by means of a horn used as a penis149 in the mythology of
the assiniboine indians of canada and montana and the fox indians of
iowa there are also legends of feminine homosexuality supposed to have
been derived from the algonkin cree indians who were closely connected
with both150
    according to the assiniboine legend a mans wife fell in love
    with his sister and eloped with her a boneless child being the
    result of the union the husband pursued the couple and killed
    his wife as well as the child no one cared to avenge her death
    the fox legend entitled two maidens who played the harlot with
    each other runs as follows it is said that once on a time
    long ago there were two young women who were friends together it
    is told that there were also two youths who tried to woo the two
    maidens but they were not able even so much as to talk with
    them after awhile the youths began to suspect something wrong
    so once during the summer when the two maidens started away to
    peel off bark the youths followed staying just far enough
    behind to keep them in sight while the girls were peeling the
    bark the youths kept themselves hidden after awhile they no
    longer heard the sound of the maidens at work whereupon they
    began to creep up to where they were when they drew nigh
    behold the maidens were in the act of taking off their clothes
    the first to disrobe flung herself down on the ground and lay
    there pray what are these girls going to do was the feeling
    in the hearts of the youths and to their amazement the girls
    began to lie with each other thereupon the youths ran to where
    the girls were she who was lying on top instantly fell over
    backward her clitoris was standing out and had a queer shape it
    was like a turtles penis thereupon the maidens began to plead
    with the youths oh dont tell on us they said truly it is
    not of our own free desire that we have done this thing we have
    done it under the influence of some unknown being it is said
    that afterward one of the maidens became big with child in the
    course of time she gave birth and the child was like a
    softshell turtle
in bali according to jacobs as quoted by ploss and bartels
homosexuality is almost as common among women as among men though it is
more secretly exercised the methods of gratification adopted are either
digital or lingual or else by bringing the parts together tribadism
baumann who noted inversion among the male negro population of zanzibar
finds that it is also not rare among women although oriental manners
render it impossible for such women to wear mens clothes openly they do
so in private and are recognized by other women by their manlike
bearing as also by the fact that womens garments do not suit them they
show a preference for masculine occupations and seek sexual satisfaction
among women who have the same inclinations or else among normal women
who are won over by presents or other means in addition to tribadism or
cunnilinctus they sometimes use an ebony or ivory phallus with a kind of
glans at one end or sometimes at both ends in the latter case it can be
used by two women at once and sometimes it has a hole bored through it by
which warm water can be injected it is regarded as an arab invention and
is sometimes used by normal women shut up in harems and practically
deprived of sexual satisfaction151
among the arab women according to kocher homosexual practices are rare
though very common among arab men in egypt however according to godard
kocher and others it is almost fashionable and every woman in the harem
has a friend in turkey homosexuality is sometimes said to be rare among
women but it would appear to be found in the harems and womens baths of
turkey as well as of islam generally brantme in the sixteenth century
referred to the lesbianism of turkish women at the baths and leo
africanus in the same century mentioned the tribadism of moorish women and
the formal organization of tribadic prostitution in fez there was an
osmanli sapphic poetess mihiri whose grave is at amasia and vambery and
achestorides agree as to the prevalence of feminine homosexuality in
turkey152 among the negroes and mulattoes of french creole countries
according to corre homosexuality is very common i know a lady of great
beauty he remarks a stranger in guadalupe and the mother of a family
who is obliged to stay away from the markets and certain shops because of
the excessive admiration of mulatto women and negresses and the impudent
invitations which they dare to address to her153 he refers to several
cases of more or less violent sexual attempts by women on young colored
girls of 12 or 14 and observes that such attempts by men on children of
their own sex are much rarer
in china according to matignon and in cochin china according to
lorion homosexuality does not appear to be common among women in india
however it is probably as prevalent among women as it certainly is among
men
    in the first edition of this study i quoted the opinion of dr
    buchanan then superintendant of the central gaol of bengal at
    bhagalpur who informed me that he had never come across a case
    and that his headgaoler had never heard of such a thing in
    twentyfive years experience another officer in the indian
    medical service assures me however that there cannot be the
    least doubt as to the frequency of homosexuality among women in
    india either inside or outside gaols i am indebted to him for
    the following notes on this point
    that homosexual relationships are common enough among indian
    women is evidenced by the fact that the hindustani language has
    five words to denote the tribade 1 dgn 2 zankh
    3 satar 4 chapathi and 5 chapatbz the modus
    operandi is generally what martial calls geminos committere
    cunnos but sometimes a phallus called saburah is employed
    the act itself is called chapat or chapti and the hindustani
    poets nazir rangin jn sheb treat of lesbian love very
    extensively and sometimes very crudely jn sheb a woman poet
    sings to the effect that intercourse with a woman by means of a
    phallus is to be preferred to the satisfaction offered by a male
    lover the common euphemism employed when speaking of two
    tribades who live together is that they live apart so much for
    the literary evidence as to the prevalence of what mirable
    dictu dr buchanans gaoler was ignorant of
    now for facts in the gaol of r the superintendent discovered a
    number of phalli in the females inclosure they were made of
    clay and sundried and bore marks of use in the gaol of s was a
    woman who as is usual with tribades in india wore male attire
    and was well known for her sexual proclivities an examination
    revealed the following face much lined mamm of masculine type
    but nipples elongated and readily erectile gluteal and iliac
    regions quite of masculine type as also the thighs clitoris
    with enlarged glands readily erectile nymph thickened and
    enlarged vulvar orifice patent for she had in early youth been
    a prostitute the voice was almost contralto her partner was of
    low type but eminently feminine in configuration and manner in
    this case i heard that the man went to a local ascetic and
    begged his intercession with the deity so that she might
    impregnate her partner the hindoo medical works mention the
    possibility of a woman uniting with another woman in sexual
    embraces and begetting a boneless fetus short history of aryan
    medical science p 44
    in the town of d there lived apart two women one a brahmin
    the other a grazier their modus operandi was tribadism as an
    eyewitness informed me in s i was called in to treat the widow
    of a wealthy mohammedan i had occasion to examine the pudenda
    and found what martineau would have called the indelible stigmata
    of early masturbation and later sapphism she admitted the
    impeachment and confessed that she was on the best of terms with
    her three remarkably wellformed and goodlooking handmaidens
    this lady said that she began masturbation at an early age just
    like all other women and that sapphism came after the age of
    puberty another mohammedan woman whom i knew and who had a very
    large clitoris told me that she had been initiated into lesbian
    love at 12 by a neighbor and had intermittently practised it ever
    since i might also instance two sisters of the gardener caste
    both widows who lived apart and indulged in simultaneous
    sapphism
    that sometimes the actors in tribadism are most vigorous is
    shown by the fact that in the central gaol of  swelling of
    the vulva was admitted to have been caused by the embraces of two
    female convicts the subordinate who told me this mentioned it
    quite incidentally while relating his experiences as hospital
    assistant at this gaol when i questioned him he stated that the
    woman whom he was called to treat told him that she could never
    satisfy herself with men but only with women he added that
    tribadism was quite common in the gaol
the foregoing sketch may serve to show that homosexual practices
certainly and probably definite sexual inversion are very widespread
among women in very many and various parts of the world though it is
likely that as among men there are variationsgeographical racial
national or socialin the frequency or intensity of its obvious
manifestations thus in the eighteenth century casanova remarked that
the women of provence are specially inclined to lesbianism
in european prisons homosexual practices flourish among the women fully as
much it may probably be said as among the men there is indeed some
reason for supposing that these phenomena are here sometimes even more
decisively marked than among men154 this prevalence of homosexuality
among women in prison is connected with the close relationship between
feminine criminality and prostitution
the frequency of homosexual practices among prostitutes is a fact of some
interest and calls for special explanation for at the first glance it
seems in opposition to all that we know concerning the exciting causes of
homosexuality regarding the fact there can be no question155 it has
been noted by all who are acquainted with the lives of prostitutes though
opinion may differ as to its frequency in berlin moll was told in
wellinformed quarters the proportion of prostitutes with lesbian
tendencies is about 25 per cent this was almost the proportion at paris
many years ago according to parentduchtelet today according to
chevalier it is larger and bourneville believes that 75 per cent of the
inmates of the parisian venereal hospitals have practised homosexuality
hammer in germany has found among 66 prostitutes that 41 were
homosexual156 hirschfeld thinks that inverted women are specially prone
to become prostitutes157 eulenburg believes on the other hand that
the conditions of their life favor homosexuality among prostitutes a
homosexual union seems to them higher purer more innocent and more
ideal158 there is however no fundamental contradiction between these
two views they are probably both right
in london so far as my inquiries extend homosexuality among prostitutes
is very much less prevalent and in a wellmarked form is confined to a
comparatively small section i am indebted to a friend for the following
note from my experience of the parisian prostitute i gather that
lesbianism in paris is extremely prevalent indeed one might almost say
normal in particular most of the chahutdancers of the moulinrouge
casino de paris and the other public balls are notorious for going in
couples and for the most part they prefer not to be separated even in
their most professional moments with the other sex in london the thing
is naturally much less obvious and i think much less prevalent but
it is certainly not infrequent a certain number of wellknown prostitutes
are known for their tendencies in this direction which do not however
interfere in any marked way with the ordinary details of their profession
i do not personally know of a single prostitute who is exclusively
lesbian i have heard vaguely that there are one or two such anomalies
but i have heard a swell cocotte at the corinthian announce to the whole
room that she was going home with a girl and no one doubted the
statement her name indeed was generally coupled with that of a
fifthrate actress another woman of the same kind has a little clientele
of women who buy her photographs in burlington arcade in the lower ranks
of the profession all this is much less common one often finds women who
have simply never heard of such a thing they know of it in regard to men
but not in regard to women and they are for the most part quite
horrified at the notion which they consider part and parcel of french
beastliness of course almost every girl has her friend and when not
separately occupied they often sleep together but while in separate
rare cases this undoubtedly means all that it can mean for the most
part so far as one can judge it means no more than it would mean among
ordinary girls
it is evident that there must be some radical causes for the frequency of
homosexuality among prostitutes one such cause doubtless lies in the
character of the prostitutes relations with men these relations are of a
professional character and as the business element becomes emphasized
the possibility of sexual satisfaction diminishes at the best also
there lacks the sense of social equality the feeling of possession and
scope for the exercise of feminine affection and devotion these the
prostitute must usually be forced to find either in a bully or in
another woman159
apart from this fact it must be borne in mind that in a very large number
of cases prostitutes show in slight or more marked degree many of the
signs of neurotic heredity160 and it would not be surprising if they
present the germs of homosexuality in an unusually high degree the life
of the prostitute may well develop such latent germs and so we have an
undue tendency to homosexuality just as we have it among criminals and
to a much less extent among persons of genius and intellect
homosexuality is specially fostered by those employments which keep women
in constant association not only by day but often at night also without
the company of men this is for instance the case in convents and
formerly at all eventshowever it may be todayhomosexuality was
held to be very prevalent in convents this was especially so in the
eighteenth century when very many young girls without any religious
vocation were put into convents161 the same again is today the case
with the female servants in large hotels among whom homosexual practices
nave been found very common162 laycock many years ago noted the
prevalence of manifestations of this kind which he regarded as
hysterical among seamstresses lacemakers etc confined for hours in
close contact with one another in heated rooms the circumstances under
which numbers of young women are employed during the day in large shops
and factories and sleep in the establishment two in a room or even two
in a bed are favorable to the development of homosexual practices
    in england it is seldom that anyone cares to investigate these
    phenomena though they certainly exist they have been more
    thoroughly studied elsewhere thus in rome niceforo who
    studied various aspects of the lives of the working classes
    succeeded in obtaining much precise information concerning the
    manners and customs of the young girls in dressmaking and
    tailoring workrooms he remarks that few of those who see the
    virtuous daughters of the people often not more than 12 years
    old walking along the streets with the dressmakers box under
    their arm modestly bent head and virginal air realize the
    intense sexual preoccupations often underlying these appearances
    in the workrooms the conversation perpetually revolves around
    sexual subjects in the absence of the mistress or forewoman and
    even in her presence the slang that prevails in the workrooms
    leads to dialogues with a double meaning a state of sexual
    excitement is thus aroused which sometimes relieves itself
    mentally by psychic onanism sometimes by some form of
    masturbation one girl admitted to niceforo that by allowing her
    thoughts to dwell on the subject while at work she sometimes
    produced physical sexual excitement as often as four times a day
    see also vol i of these studies autoerotism sometimes
    however a vague kind of homosexuality is produced the girls
    excited by their own thoughts and their conversation being still
    further excited by contact with each other in summer in one
    workroom some of the girls wear no drawers and they unbutton
    their bodices and work with crossed legs more or less
    uncovered in this position the girls draw near and inspect one
    another some boast of their white legs and then the petticoats
    are raised altogether for more careful comparison many enjoy
    this inspection of nudity and experience real sexual pleasure
    from midday till 2 pm during the hours of greatest heat when
    all are in this condition and the mistress in her chemise and
    sometimes with no shame at the workers presence even without
    it falls asleep on the sofa all the girls without one
    exception masturbate themselves the heat seems to sharpen
    their desires and morbidly arouse all their senses the
    voluptuous emotions restrained during the rest of the day break
    out with irresistible force stimulated by the spectacle of each
    others nakedness some place their legs together and thus
    heighten the spasm by the illusion of contact with a man in
    this way they reach mutual masturbation it is noteworthy
    however niceforo points out that these couples for mutual
    masturbation are never lesbian couples tribadism is altogether
    absent from the factories and workrooms he even believes that
    it does not exist among girls of the working class he further
    describes how in another workroom during the hot hours of the
    day in summer when no work is done some of the girls retire
    into the fittingroom and having fastened their chemises round
    their legs and thighs with pins so as to imitate trousers play
    at being men and pretend to have intercourse with the others
    niceforo il gergo cap vi 1897 turin i have reproduced
    these details from niceforos careful study because although
    they may seem to be trivial at some points they clearly bring
    out the very important distinction between a merely temporary
    homosexuality and true inversion the amusements of these young
    girls may not be considered eminently innocent or wholesome but
    on the other hand they are not radically morbid or vicious they
    are strictly and even consciously play they are dominated by
    the thought that the true sexual ideal is normal relationship
    with a man and they would certainly disappear in the presence of
    a man
    it must be remembered that niceforos observations were made
    among girls who were mostly young in the large factories where
    many adult women are employed the phenomena tend to be rarer
    but of much less trivial and playful character at wolverhampton
    some forty years ago the case was reported of a woman in a
    galvanizing store who after dinner indecently assaulted a
    girl who was a new hand two young women held the victim down
    and this seems to show that homosexual vice was here common and
    recognized no doubt this case is exceptional in its brutality
    it throws however a significant light on the conditions
    prevailing in factories in spain in the large factories where
    many adult women are employed especially in the great tobacco
    factory at seville lesbian relationships seem to be not
    uncommon here the women work in an atmosphere which in summer is
    so hot that they throw off the greater part of their clothing to
    such an extent that a bell is rung whenever a visitor is
    introduced into a workroom in order to warn the workers such
    an environment predisposes to the formation of homosexual
    relationships when i was in spain some years ago an incident
    occurred at the seville fbrica de tabacos which attracted much
    attention in the newspapers and though it was regarded as
    unusual it throws light on the life of the workers one morning
    as the women were entering the workroom and amid the usual scene
    of animation changing their manila shawls for the light costume
    worn during work one drew out a small claspknife and attacking
    another rapidly inflicted six or seven wounds on her face and
    neck threatening to kill anyone who approached both these
    cigarreras were superior workers engaged in the most skilled
    kind of work and had been at the factory for many years in
    appearance they were described as presenting a striking contrast
    the aggressor who was 48 years of age was of masculine air
    tall and thin with an expression of firm determination on her
    wrinkled face the victim on the other hand whose age was 30
    was plump and goodlooking and of pleasing disposition the
    reason at first assigned for the attack on the younger woman was
    that her mother had insulted the elder womans son it appeared
    however that a close friendship had existed between the two
    women that latterly the younger woman had formed a friendship
    with the forewoman of her workroom and that the elder woman
    animated by jealousy then resolved to murder both this design
    was frustrated by the accidental absence of the forewoman that
    day
in theaters the abnormal sexuality stimulated by such association in work
is complicated by the general tendency for homosexuality to be connected
with dramatic aptitude a point to which i shall have to refer later on i
am indebted to a friend for the following note passionate friendships
among girls from the most innocent to the most elaborate excursions in
the direction of lesbos are extremely common in theaters both among
actresses and even more among chorusand balletgirls here the
pellmell of the dressingrooms the wait of perhaps two hours between the
performances during which all the girls are cooped up in a state of
inaction and of excitement in a few crowded dressingrooms afford every
opportunity for the growth of this particular kind of sentiment in most
of the theaters there is a little circle of girls somewhat avoided by the
others or themselves careless of further acquaintanceship who profess
the most unbounded devotion to one another most of these girls are
equally ready to flirt with the opposite sex but i know certain ones
among them who will scarcely speak to a man and who are never seen
without their particular pal or chum who if she gets moved to
another theater will come around and wait for her friend at the
stagedoor but here again it is but seldom that the experience is
carried very far the fact is that the english girl especially of the
lower and middle classes whether she has lost her virtue or not is
extremely fettered by conventional notions ignorance and habit are two
restraining influences from the carrying out of this particular kind of
perversion to its logical conclusions it is therefore among the upper
ranks alike of society and of prostitution that lesbianism is most
definitely to be met with for here we have much greater liberty of
action and much greater freedom from prejudices
with girls as with boys it is in the school at the evolution of
puberty that homosexuality usually first shows itself it may originate
in a way mainly peripheral or mainly central in the first case two
children perhaps when close to each other in bed more or less
unintentionally generate in each other a certain amount of sexual
irritation which they foster by mutual touching and kissing this is a
spurious kind of homosexuality the often precocious play of the normal
instinct in the girl who is congenitally predisposed to homosexuality it
will continue and develop in the majority it will be forgotten as quickly
as possible not without shame in the presence of the normal object of
sexual love
    i may quote as fairly typical the following observation supplied
    by a lady who cannot be called inverted like so many other
    children and girls i was first taught selfindulgence by a girl
    at school and i passed on my knowledge to one or two others
    with one of whom i remember once when we were just 16 spending
    the night sensually we were horribly ashamed after and that was
    the only time when i was only 8 there was a girl of 13 who liked
    to play with my body and taught me to play with hers though i
    rather disliked doing so we slept together and this went on at
    intervals for six months these things for the sake of getting
    enjoyment and not with any passion are not uncommon with
    children but less common i think than people sometimes
    imagine i believe i could recall without much difficulty the
    number of times such things happened with me in the case i
    mentioned when i did for one night feelor try to excite in
    myself and my girlcompanion of 16sensual passion we had as
    little children slept together a few times and done these things
    and meeting after an absence just at that age recalled our
    childish memories and were carried away by sexual impulse but i
    never felt any peculiar affection or passion for her even at the
    time nor she for me we only felt that our sensual nature was
    strong at the time and had betrayed us into something we were
    ashamed of and therefore we avoided letting ourselves sleep
    too close after that day i think we disliked each other and
    were revolted whenever we thought of that night feeling that
    each had degraded the other and herself
the cases in which the source is mainly central rather than peripheral
nevertheless merge into the foregoing with no clear line of demarcation
in such cases a girl forms an ardent attachment for another girl probably
somewhat older than herself often a schoolfellow sometimes her
schoolmistress upon whom she will lavish an astonishing amount of
affection and devotion there may or not be any return usually the return
consists of a gracious acceptance of the affectionate services the girl
who expends this wealth of devotion is surcharged with emotion but she is
often unconscious or ignorant of the sexual impulse and she seeks for no
form of sexual satisfaction kissing and the privilege of sleeping with
the friend are however sought and at such times it often happens that
even the comparatively unresponsive friend feels more or less definite
sexual emotion pudendal turgescence with secretion of mucus and
involuntary twitching of the neighboring muscles though little or no
attention may be paid to this phenomenon and in the common ignorance of
girls concerning sex matters it may not be understood in some cases there
is an attempt either instinctive or intentional to develop the sexual
feeling by close embraces and kissing this rudimentary kind of homosexual
relationship is i believe more common among girls than among boys and
for this there are several reasons 1 a boy more often has some
acquaintance with sexual phenomena and would frequently regard such a
relationship as unmanly 2 the girl has a stronger need of affection
and selfdevotion to another person than a boy has 3 she has not under
our existing social conditions which compel young women to hold the
opposite sex at arms length the same opportunities of finding an outlet
for her sexual emotions while 4 conventional propriety recognizes a
considerable degree of physical intimacy between girls thus at once
encouraging and cloaking the manifestations of homosexuality
the ardent attachments which girls in schools and colleges form to each
other and to their teachers constitute a subject which is of considerable
psychological interest and of no little practical importance163 these
girlish devotions on the borderland between friendship and sexual
passion are found in all countries where girls are segregated for
educational purposes and their symptoms are on the whole singularly
uniform though they vary in intensity and character to some extent from
time to time and from place to place sometimes assuming an epidemic form
they have been most carefully studied in italy where obici and
marchesinian alienist and a psychologist working in conjunctionhave
analyzed the phenomena with remarkable insight and delicacy and much
wealth of illustrative material164 but exactly the same phenomena are
everywhere found in english girls schools even of the most modern type
and in some of the large american womens colleges they have sometimes
become so acute as to cause much anxiety165 on the whole however it
is probable that such manifestations are regarded more indulgently in
girls than in boys schools and in view of the fact that the
manifestations of affection are normally more pronounced between girls
than between boys this seems reasonable the head mistress of an english
training college writes
my own assumption on such matters has been that affection does naturally
belong to the body as well as the mind and between two women is naturally
and innocently expressed by caresses i have never therefore felt that i
ought to warn any girl against the physical element in friendship as
such the test i should probably suggest to them would be the same as one
would use for any other relationwas the friendship helping life as a
whole making them keener kinder more industrious etc or was it
hindering it
passionate friendships of a more or less unconsciously sexual character
are common even outside and beyond schoollife it frequently happens that
a period during which a young woman falls in love at a distance with some
young man of her acquaintance alternates with periods of intimate
attachment to a friend of her own sex no congenital inversion is usually
involved it generally happens in the end either that relationship with
a man brings the normal impulse into permanent play or the steadying of
the emotions in the stress of practical life leads to a knowledge of the
real nature of such feelings and a consequent distaste for them in some
cases on the other hand such relationships especially when formed after
schoollife are fairly permanent an energetic emotional woman not
usually beautiful will perhaps be devoted to another who may have found
some rather specialized lifework but who may be very unpractical and who
has probably a very feeble sexual instinct she is grateful for her
friendss devotion but may not actively reciprocate it the actual
specific sexual phenomena generated in such cases vary very greatly the
emotion may be latent or unconscious it may be all on one side it is
often more or less recognized and shared such cases are on the borderland
of true sexual inversion but they cannot be included within its region
sex in these relationships is scarcely the essential and fundamental
element it is more or less subordinate and parasitic there is often a
semblance of a sexrelationship from the marked divergence of the friends
in physical and psychic qualities and the nervous development of one or
both the friends is sometimes slightly abnormal we have to regard such
relationships as hypertrophied friendships the hypertrophy being due to
unemployed sexual instinct
    the following narrative is written by a lady who holds a
    responsible educational position a friend of mine two or three
    years older than myself i am 31 and living in the same house
    with me has been passing through a very unhappy time long
    nervous strain connected with this has made her sleep badly and
    apt to wake in terrible depression about 3 oclock in the
    morning in the early days of our friendship about eight months
    ago she occasionally at these times took refuge with me after a
    while i insisted on her consulting a doctor who advised her
    amongst other things not to sleep alone thenceforth for two or
    three months i induced her to share my room after a week or two
    she generally shared my bed for a time at the beginning of the
    night as it seemed to help her to sleep
    before this about the second or third time that she came to me
    in the early morning i had been surprised and a little
    frightened to find how pleasant it was to me to have her and how
    reluctant i was that she should go away when we began regularly
    to sleep in the same room the physical part of our affection
    grew rapidly very strong it is natural for me generally to
    caress my friends but i soon could not be alone in a room with
    this one without wanting to have my arms round her it would have
    been intolerable to me to live with her without being able to
    touch her we did not discuss it but it was evident that the
    desire was even stronger in her than in me
    for some time it satisfied us fully to be in bed together one
    night however when she had had a cruelly trying day and i
    wanted to find all ways of comforting her i bared by breast for
    her to lie on afterward it was clear that neither of us could be
    satisfied without this she groped for it like a child and it
    excited me much more to feel that than to uncover my breast and
    arms altogether at once
    much of this excitement was sexually localized and i was
    haunted in the daytime by images of holding this woman in my
    arms i noticed also that my inclination to caress my other women
    friends was not diminished but increased all this disturbed me
    a good deal the homosexual practices of which i had read lately
    struck me as merely nasty i could not imagines myself tempted to
    themat the same time the whole matter was new to me for i had
    never wanted anyone even to share my bed before i had read that
    sex instinct was mysterious and unexpected and i felt that i did
    not know what might come next
    i knew only one elder person whom for widemindedness
    gentleness and saintliness i could bear to consult and to this
    person a middleaged man i wrote for advice he replied by a
    long letter of the most tender warning i had better not weaken
    my influence with my friend he wrote by going back suddenly or
    without her consent but i was to be very wary of going further
    there was fire about i tried to put this into practice by
    restraining myself constantly in our intercourse by refraining
    from caressing her for instance when i wanted to caress her and
    knew that she wanted it the only result seemed to be that the
    desire was more tormenting and constant than ever
    if at this point my friend had happened to die or go away and
    the incident had come to an end i should probably have been left
    nervous in these matters for years to come i should have
    faltered in the opinion i had always held that bodily
    expressions of love between women were as innocent as they were
    natural and i might have come nearer than i ever expected to the
    doctrine of those convent teachers who forbid their girls to
    embrace one another for fear an incalculable instinct should
    carry them to the edge of an abyss
    as it was after a while i said a little on the subject to my
    friend herself i had been inclined to think that she might share
    my anxiety but she did not share it at all she said to me that
    she did not like these thoughts that she cared for me more than
    she had ever done for any person except one now causing most of
    her unhappiness and wanted me in all possible ways and that it
    would make her sad to feel that i was trying not to want her in
    one way because i thought it was wrong
    on my part i knew very well how much she did need and want me
    i knew that in relations with others she was spending the
    greatest effort in following a course that i urged on her and
    was doing what i thought right in spite of the most painful
    pressure on her to do wrong and that she needed all the support
    and comfort i could give her it seemed to me after our
    conversation that the right path for me lay not in giving way to
    fears and scruples but in giving my friend straightforwardly all
    the love i could and all the kinds of love i could i decided to
    keep my eyes open for danger but meanwhile to go on
    we were living alone together at the time and thenceforward we
    did as we liked doing as soon as we could we moved to a bed
    where we could sleep together all night in the day when no one
    was there we sat as close together as we wished which was very
    close we kissed each other as often as we wanted to kiss each
    other which was very many times a day
    the results of this so far as i can see have been wholly good
    we love each other warmly but no temptation to nastiness has
    ever come and i cannot see now that it is at all likely to come
    with custom the localized physical excitement has practically
    disappeared and i am no longer obsessed by imagined embraces
    the spiritual side of our affection seems to have grown steadily
    stronger and more profitable since the physical side has been
    allowed to take its natural place
a class in which homosexuality while fairly distinct is only slightly
marked is formed by the women to whom the actively inverted woman is most
attracted these women differ in the first place from the normal or
average woman in that they are not repelled or disgusted by loverlike
advances from persons of their own sex they are not usually attractive to
the average man though to this rule there are many exceptions their
faces may be plain or illmade but not seldom they possess good figures
a point which is apt to carry more weight with the inverted woman than
beauty of face their sexual impulses are seldom well marked but they are
of strongly affectionate nature on the whole they are women who are not
very robust and well developed physically or nervously and who are not
well adapted for childbearing but who still possess many excellent
qualities and they are always womanly one may perhaps say that they
are the pick of the women whom the average man would pass by no doubt
this is often the reason why they are open to homosexual advances but i
do not think it is the sole reason so far as they may be said to
constitute a class they seem to possess a genuine though not precisely
sexual preference for women over men and it is this coldness rather
than lack of charm which often renders men rather indifferent to them
the actively inverted woman usually differs from the woman of the class
just mentioned in one fairly essential character a more or less distinct
trace of masculinity she may not be and frequently is not what would be
called a mannish woman for the latter may imitate men on grounds of
taste and habit unconnected with sexual perversion while in the inverted
woman the masculine traits are part of an organic instinct which she by no
means always wishes to accentuate the inverted womans masculine element
may in the least degree consist only in the fact that she makes advances
to the woman to whom she is attracted and treats all men in a cool
direct manner which may not exclude comradeship but which excludes every
sexual relationship whether of passion or merely of coquetry usually the
inverted woman feels absolute indifference toward men and not seldom
repulsion and this feeling as a rule is instinctively reciprocated by
men at the same time bisexual women are at least as common as bisexual
men
    history xxxivmiss s aged 38 living in a city of the united
    states a business woman of fine intelligence prominent in
    professional and literary circles her general health is good
    but she belongs to a family in which there is a marked
    neuropathic element she is of rather phlegmatic temperament
    well poised always perfectly calm and selfpossessed rather
    retiring in disposition with gentle dignified bearing
    she says she cannot care for men but that all her life has been
    glorified and made beautiful by friendship with women whom she
    loves as a man loves women her character is however well
    disciplined and her friends are not aware of the nature of her
    affections she tries not to give all her love to one person and
    endeavors as she herself expresses it to use this gift of
    loving as a steppingstone to high mental and spiritual
    attainments she is described by one who has known her for
    several years as having a high nature and instincts unerringly
    toward high things
    history xxxvmiss b artist of german ancestry on the
    paternal side among her brothers and sisters one is of neurotic
    temperament and another is inverted she is herself healthy she
    has no repugnance to men and would even like to try marriage if
    the union were not permanent but she has seldom felt any sexual
    attraction to a man in one exceptional instance early in life
    realizing that she was not adapted for heterosexual
    relationships she broke off the engagement she had formed much
    later in life she formed a more permanent relationship with a
    man of congenial tastes
    she is attracted to women of various kinds though she recognizes
    that there are some women to whom only men are attracted many
    years since she had a friend to whom she was very strongly
    attached but the physical manifestations do not appear to have
    become pronounced after that her thoughts were much occupied by
    several women to whom she made advances which were not
    encouraged to pass beyond ordinary friendship in one case
    however she formed an intimate relationship with a girl somewhat
    younger than herself and a very feminine personality who
    accepted miss bs ardent love with pleasure but in a passive
    manner and did not consider that the relationship would stand in
    the way of her marrying though she would on no account tell her
    husband the relationship for the first time aroused miss bs

    history xxxvimiss h aged 30 among her paternal relatives
    there is a tendency to eccentricity and to nervous disease her
    grandfather drank her father was eccentric and hypochondriacal
    and suffered from obsessions her mother and mothers relatives
    are entirely healthy and normal in disposition
    at the age of 4 she liked to see the nates of a little girl who
    lived near when she was about 6 the nursemaid sitting in the
    fields used to play with her own parts and told her to do
    likewise saying it would make a baby come she occasionally
    touched herself in consequence but without producing any effect
    of any kind when she was about 8 she used to see various
    nursemaids uncover their childrens sexual parts and show them
    to each other she used to think about this when alone and also
    about whipping she never cared to play with dolls and in her
    games always took the part of a man her first rudimentary
    sexfeelings appeared at the age of 8 or 9 and were associated
    with dreams of whipping and being whipped which were most vivid
    between the ages of 11 and 14 when they died away on the
    appearance of affection for girls she menstruated at 12
    her earliest affection at the age of 13 was for a schoolfellow
    a graceful coquettish girl with long golden hair and blue eyes
    her affection displayed itself in performing all sorts of small
    services for this girl in constantly thinking about her and in
    feeling deliciously grateful for the smallest return at the age
    of 14 she had a similar passion for a girl cousin she used to
    look forward with ecstasy to her visits and especially to the
    rare occasions when the cousin slept with her her excitement was
    then so great that she could not sleep but there was no
    conscious sexual excitement at the age of 15 or 16 she fell in
    love with another cousin her experiences with this girl were
    full of delicious sensations if the cousin only touched her
    neck a thrill went through her body which she now regards as
    sexual again at 17 she had an overwhelming passionate
    fascination for a schoolfellow a pretty commonplace girl whom
    she idealized and etherealized to an extravagant extent this
    passion was so violent that her health was to some extent
    impaired but it was purely unselfish and there was nothing
    sexual in it on leaving school at the age of 19 she met a girl
    of about the same age as herself very womanly but not much
    attracted to men this girl became very much attached to her and
    sought to gain her love after some time miss h was attracted by
    this love partly from the sense of power it gave her and an
    intimate relation grew up this relation became vaguely physical
    miss h taking the initiative but her friend desiring such
    relations and taking extreme pleasure in them they used to touch
    and kiss each other tenderly especially on the mons veneris
    with equal ardor they each experienced a strong pleasurable
    feeling in doing this and sexual erethism but no orgasm and it
    does not appear that this ever occurred their general behavior
    to each other was that of lovers but they endeavored as far as
    possible to hide this fact from the world this relation lasted
    for several years and would have continued had not miss hs
    friend from religious and moral scruples put an end to the
    physical relationship miss h had been very well and happy
    during this relationship the interference with it seems to have
    exerted a disturbing influence and also to have aroused her
    sexual desires though she was still scarcely conscious of their
    real nature
    soon afterward another girl of exceedingly voluptuous type made
    love to miss h to which the latter yielded giving way to her
    feelings as well as to her love of domination she was afterward
    ashamed of this episode though the physical element in it had
    remained vague and indefinite her remorse was so great that when
    her friend repenting her scruples implored her to let their
    relationship be on the same footing as of old miss h in her
    return resisted every effort to restore the physical relation
    she kept to this resolution for some years and sought to divert
    her thoughts into intellectual channels when she again formed an
    intimate relationship it was with a congenial friend and lasted
    for several years
    she has never masturbated occasionally but very rarely she has
    had dreams of riding accompanied by pleasurable sexual emotions
    she cannot recall any actual experience to suggest this though
    fond of riding she has never had any kind of sexual dreams
    about a man of late years she has occasionally had erotic dreams
    about women
    her feeling toward men is friendly but she has never had sexual
    attraction toward a man she likes them as good comrades as men
    like each other she enjoys the society of men on account of
    their intellectual attraction she is herself very active in
    social and intellectual work her feeling toward marriage has
    always been one of repugnance she can however imagine a man
    whom she could love or marry
    she is attracted to womanly women sincere reserved pure but
    courageous in character she is not attracted to intellectual
    women but at the same time cannot endure silly women the
    physical qualities that attract her most are not so much beauty
    of face as a graceful but not too slender body with beautiful
    curves the women she is drawn to are usually somewhat younger
    than herself women are much attracted to her and without any
    effort on her part she likes to take the active part and
    protecting rle with them she is herself energetic in character
    and with a somewhat neurotic temperament
    she finds sexual satisfaction in tenderly touching caressing
    and kissing the loved ones body there is no cunnilinctus
    which she regards with abhorrence she feels more tenderness
    than passion there is a high degree of sexual erethism when
    kissing but orgasm is rare and is produced by lying on the
    friend or by the friend lying on her without any special
    contact she likes being herself kissed but not so much as
    taking the active part
    she believes that homosexual love is morally right when it is
    really part of a persons nature and provided that the nature of
    homosexual love is always made plain to the object of such
    affection she does not approve of it as a mere makeshift or
    expression of sensuality in normal women she has sometimes
    resisted the sexual expression of her feelings once for years at
    a time but always in vain the effect on her of loving women is
    distinctly good she asserts both spiritually and physically
    while repression leads to morbidity and hysteria she has
    suffered much from neurasthenia at various periods but under
    appropriate treatment it has slowly diminished the inverted
    instinct is too deeply rooted to eradicate but it is well under
    control
    history xxxviimiss m the daughter of english parents both
    musicians who were both of what is described as intense
    temperament and there is a neurotic element in the family
    though no history of insanity or alcoholism and she is herself
    free from nervous disease at birth she was very small in a
    portrait taken at the age of 4 the nose mouth and ears are
    abnormally large and she wears a little boys hat as a child
    she did not care for dolls or for pretty clothes and often
    wondered why other children found so much pleasure in them as
    far back as my memory goes she writes i cannot recall a time
    when i was not different from other children i felt bored when
    other little girls came to play with me though i was never rough
    or boisterous in my sports sewing was distasteful to her still
    she cared little more for the pastimes of boys and found her
    favorite amusement in reading especially adventures and
    fairytales she was always quiet timid and selfconscious the
    instinct first made its appearance in the latter part of her
    eighth or the first part of her ninth year she was strongly
    attracted by the face of a teacher who used to appear at a
    sidewindow on the second floor of the schoolbuilding and ring a
    bell to summon the children to their classes the teachers face
    seemed very beautiful but sad and she thought about her
    continually though not coming in personal contact with her a
    year later this teacher was married and left the school and the
    impression gradually faded away there was no consciousness of
    sex at this time she wrote no knowledge of sexual matters or
    practices and the feelings evoked were feelings of pity and
    compassion and tenderness for a person who seemed to be very sad
    and very much depressed it is this quality or combination of
    qualities which has always made the appeal in my own case i may
    go on for years in comparative peace when something may happen
    in spite of my busy practical life to call it all out the next
    feelings were experienced when she was about 11 years of age a
    young lady came to visit a nextdoor neighbor and made so
    profound an impression on the child that she was ridiculed by her
    playmates for preferring to sit in a dark corner on the
    lawnwhere she might watch this young ladyrather than to play
    games being a sensitive child after this experience she was
    careful not to reveal her feelings to anyone she felt
    instinctively that in this she was different from others her
    sense of beauty developed early but there was always an
    indefinable feeling of melancholy associated with it the
    twilight a dark night when the stars shone brightly these had a
    very depressing effect upon her but possessed a strong
    attraction nevertheless and pictures appealed to her at the age
    of 12 she fell in love with a schoolmate two years older than
    herself who was absorbed in the boys and never suspected this
    affection she wept bitterly because they could not be confirmed
    at the same time but feared to appear undignified and
    sentimental by revealing her feelings the face of this friend
    reminded her of one of dolces madonnas which she loved later
    on at the age of 16 she loved another friend very dearly and
    devoted herself to her care there was a tinge of masculinity
    among the women of this friends family but it is not clear if
    she can be termed inverted this was the happiest period of miss
    ms life upon the death of this friend who had long been in
    ill health eight years afterward she resolved never to let her
    heart go out to anyone again
    specific physical gratification plays no part in these
    relationships the physical sexual feelings began to assert
    themselves at puberty but not in association with her ideal
    emotions in that connection she writes i would have
    considered such things a sacrilege i fought them and in a
    measure successfully the practice of selfindulgence which might
    have become a daily habit was only occasional her image evoked
    at such times drove away such feelings for which i felt a
    repugnance much preferring the romantic ideal feelings in this
    way quite unconscious of the fact that i was at all different
    from any other person i contrived to train myself to suppress
    or at least to dominate my physical sensations when they arose
    that is the reason why friendship and love have always seemed
    such holy and beautiful things to me i have never connected the
    two sets of feelings i think i am as strongly sexed as anyone
    but i am able to hold a friend in my arms and experience deep
    comfort and peace without having even a hint of physical sexual
    feeling sexual expression may be quite necessary at certain
    times and right under certain conditions but i am convinced that
    free expression of affection along sentimental channels will do
    much to minimize the necessity for it along specifically sexual
    channels i have gone three months without the physical outlet
    the only time i was ever on the verge of nervous prostration was
    after having suppressed the instinct for ten months the other
    feelings which i do not consider as sexual feelings at all so
    fill my life in every departmentlove literature poetry
    music professional and philanthropic activitiesthat i am able
    to let the physical take care of itself when the physical
    sensations come it is usually when i am not thinking of a loved
    one at all i could dissipate them by raising my thought to that
    spiritual friendship i do not know if this was right and wise i
    know it is what occurred it seems a good thing to practise some
    sort of inhibition of the centers and acquire this kind of
    domination one bad result however was that i suffered much at
    times from the physical sensations and felt horribly depressed
    and wretched whenever they seemed to get the better of me
    i have been able she writes successfully to master the
    desire for a more perfect and complete expression of my feelings
    and i have done so without serious detriment to my health i
    love few people she writes again but in these instances when
    i have permitted my heart to go out to a friend i have always
    experienced most exalted feelings and have been made better by
    them morally mentally and spiritually love is with me a
    religion
    with regard to her attitude toward the other sex she writes i
    have never felt a dislike for men but have good comrades among
    them during my childhood i associated with both girls and boys
    enjoying them all but wondering why the girls cared to flirt
    with boys later in life i have had other friendships with men
    some of whom cared for me much to my regret for naturally i
    do not care to marry

    miss m can see nothing wrong in her feelings and until at the
    age of 28 she came across the translation of krafftebings
    book she had no idea that feelings like mine were under the
    ban of society as he puts it or were considered unnatural and
    depraved she would like to help to bring light on the subject
    and to lift the shadow from other lives i emphatically
    protest she says against the uselessness and the inhumanity
    of attempts to cure inverts i am quite sure they have perfect
    right to live in freedom and happiness as long as they live

    history xxxviiimiss v aged 35 throughout early life up to
    adult age she was a mystery to herself and morbidly conscious of
    some fundamental difference between herself and other people
    there was no one she could speak to about this peculiarity in
    the effort to conquer it or to ignore it she became a hard
    student and has attained success in the profession she adopted a
    few years ago she came across a book on sexual inversion which
    proved to be a complete revelation to her of her own nature and
    by showing her that she was not an anomaly to be regarded with
    repulsion brought her comfort and peace she is willing that her
    experiences should be published for the sake of other women who
    may be suffering as in the past she has suffered
    i am a teacher in a college for women i am 34 years old and of
    medium size up to the age of 30 i looked much younger and since
    older than my age until 21 i had a strikingly childlike
    appearance my physique has nothing masculine in it that i am
    aware of but i am conscious that my walk is mannish and i have
    very frequently been told that i do thingssuch as
    sewingjust like a man my voice is quite low but not coarse
    i dislike household work but am fond of sports gardening etc
    when so young that i cannot remember it i learned to whistle a
    practice at which i am still expert when a young girl i learned
    to smoke and should still enjoy it
    several men have been good friends of mine but very few
    suitors i scarcely ever feel at ease with a man but women i
    understand and can nearly always make my friends
    i am of scotchirish descent my fathers family were
    respectable prosperous religious people my mothers family
    only semirespectable hard livers shrewd but not intelligent
    industrious and moneygetting but fond of drinking and
    carousing there were many illegitimates among them both
    grandmothers though of little education were unusual women of
    my four maternal uncles three drank heavily
    when 43 my mother gave birth to me the youngest of 8 children
    of those who grew to adult years 2 seem quite normal sexually 1
    is exceedingly erratic entirely unprincipled has been a thief
    and a forger is a probable bigamist and has betrayed several
    respectable women aside from his having inordinate desire i
    know of no sexual abnormality another brother married and a
    father as a boy was much given to infatuations for men i fancy
    this never went beyond infatuation and of late years has not been
    noticeable a third brother single though much courted by women
    on account of his good looks and personal charm is wholly
    unresponsive has no gallantry nor was ever to my knowledge a
    suitor he is however fond of the society of women especially
    those older than he he has a somewhat effeminate voice and walk
    though he has begun of late years to smoke and drink a little
    these habits sit rather oddly upon him when a child one of his
    favorite makebelieve games was to pretend that he was a famous
    woman singer at school he was always found hanging around the
    older girls
    as a child i loved to stay in the fields refused to wear a
    sunbonnet used to pretend i was a boy climbed trees and played
    ball i liked to play with dolls but i did not fondle them or
    even make them dresses when my hair was clipped i was delighted
    and made everyone call me john i used to like to wear a mans
    broadbrimmed hat and make corncob pipes i was very fond of my
    father and tried to imitate him as much as possible where
    animals were concerned i was entirely fearless
    i think i was not a sexually precocious child though i seem to
    have always known in a dim way that there were two sexes very
    early i had a sense of shame at having my body exposed i
    remember on one occasion i could not be persuaded to undress
    before a young girl visitor at that time i must have been about
    3 when i was 4 a neighbor who had often petted me took me on his
    lap and clasped my hand around his penis though he was
    interrupted in a moment this made a lasting impression on me i
    had no physical sensation nor did i have any conception of the
    significance of the act yet i had a slight feeling of repulsion
    and i must have dimly felt that it was wrong for i did not tell
    my mother i was not accustomed to confide in her for though
    truthful i was secretive
    at the age of 5 i commenced to attend a district school i
    remember that on my first day i was greatly attracted by a little
    girl who wore a brightred dress
    my first definite knowledge of sex came in this way i was
    attending sabbath school and had become ambitious to read the
    bible through i had gotten as far as the account of the birth of
    esau and jacob which aroused my curiosity so i asked my mother
    the meaning of some word in the passage she seemed embarrassed
    and evaded my question this attitude stimulated my curiosity
    further and i reread the chapter until i understood it pretty
    well later i was further enlightened by girl playmates i fancy
    i enjoyed listening to their talk and repeating what i knew on
    account of the mystery and secrecy with which sex subjects are
    surrounded rather than any sensual delight
    i cannot recall any act of mine growing directly from sexual
    feeling until i was 10 years old several other little girls and
    myself two or three times exposed private parts of our bodies to
    each other in one instance at least i was the instigator this
    act gave me some pleasure though no distinct physical sensation
    one incident i recall that happened when i was about 10 a girl
    cousin and myself had been playing house together i do not
    recall what immediately led to it but we began to address each
    other as boys and tried to urinate through long tubes of some
    sort i also recall feeling a vague interest in this process in
    animals and observing them closely in the act
    from this time until i was about 14 i grew ruder more
    boisterous and uncontrollable prior to this i had been a quite
    tractable child when 12 i became interested in a boy in my grade
    at school and tried to attract him but failed once at a
    childrens party where we were playing kissing games i tried to
    get him to kiss me but he was unresponsive i do not recall
    bothering myself about him after that a year later i had a boy
    chum about whom my schoolmaster teased me i thought this
    ridiculous at the age of 13 i menstruated a fact that caused me
    shame and anger gradually i grew to feel myself peculiar why i
    cannot explain i did not seem to myself to be like other girls
    of my acquaintance i adopted as a defense a brusque and
    defiant air i spent a good deal of time playing alone in our
    backyard where i made a pair of stilts practised ropewalking
    and such things at school i felt i was not liked by the nicer
    girls and began to associate with girls whom i now believe were
    immoral but whom i then supposed did nothing worse than talk in
    an obscene manner i copied their conversation and grew more
    reckless and uncontrollable the principal of the high school i
    was attending i learned afterward said i was the hardest pupil
    to control she had ever had about this time i read a book where
    a girl was represented as saying she had a boys soul in a
    girls body the applicability of this to myself struck me at
    once and i read the sentence to my mother who disgusted me by
    appearing shocked
    during this period i began to fall in lovea practice which
    clung to me until i was nearly 30 years old i recall various
    older women with whom i became much enamored and one man of
    these there was only one with whom i became acquainted well
    enough to show any affection another was a teacher and another
    was a young married woman at whom i used to gaze ardently during
    an entire church service toward all my women teachers i had a
    somewhat sentimental attitude they stimulated me while the men
    gave me a wholly impersonal feeling this abnormal sentimentality
    may have been caused or at least was increased by the reading
    of novels some of a highly voluptuous nature i began to read
    novels at 7 and from 11 to 14 i absorbed a great many
    undesirable ones this lead to my picturing my future with a
    lover fancying myself in romantic scenes and being caressed and
    embraced i had always supposed i should marry when about 5 i
    decided that when i grew up i would marry a certain young man who
    used to come to our house several years later he married to my
    real disappointment i had no affection for him but merely
    thought he would make a desirable husband
    during my unhappy adolescence i heard that a former playmate was
    going to visit at my home i began to look forward to the visit
    with much eagerness and at her arrival was much excited i wished
    to stay alone with her and to caress her and when we slept
    together i pressed my body against her in a sensual manner which
    act she permitted but without passion i was greatly excited and
    could scarcely sleep this was the first time i had acted in such
    a way and after she left i felt shame and dislike for her at
    future meetings there was never the least sensuality we never
    referred to the first visit and are still friends though not
    intimate
    a diary which i kept during my fourteenth and fifteenth years is
    filled with romantic sentiments and endearing terms applied
    successively to three girls of my own age i had but a speaking
    acquaintance with them but i was strongly infatuated with all
    one boy was also the object of adoration
    during my thirteenth year i became for a time very religious and
    devoted to religious exercises this passed and by my fourteenth
    year i had become heretical but was still keenly sensitive to
    religious influences
    when barely 16 i slept one night with a woman of low morals she
    acted toward me in a sensual manner and aroused my sexual
    feelings i felt at the time that this was a sin but i was
    carried away by passion afterward i hated this woman and
    despised myself
    i then went away to a coeducational boarding school here for
    the first time i became happy a girl of my own age of fine
    character and noticeable refinement fell in love with me and
    caused me to reciprocate on retrospection i believe this to have
    been a genuine and beautiful love on both sides after a few
    months however our relation at my initiative and against my
    friends will became a physical one we expressed our affection
    by mutual caresses close embraces and lying on each others
    bodies i sometimes touched her sexual organs sensually all this
    contact gave me exquisite thrills after three years we had a
    misunderstanding and separated i was greatly grieved and
    troubled for many years and came to regret greatly the physical
    relationship that had existed between us my friend at length
    fell in love and married i had several other slighter
    infatuations for women was courted by several men to whom i
    remained cold and bored except in one instance where i was
    somewhat touched and finally found a lasting friendship with a
    woman who had fallen deeply in love with me in her school days
    and had never been able to care for any one else she is a woman
    of considerable literary talent and of good general ability and
    high ideals she is usually much liked by men her love for me is
    the most real thing in the world for me and seems the most
    permanent at first my feeling for her was almost purely
    physical although there were no sexual relations i hated this
    feeling and have succeeded in overcoming it pretty largely at
    times after long separations we have embraced with great passion
    at least on my part this has always had a bad physical effect on
    me at present however it very rarely occurs we both consider
    sexual feelings degrading and deleterious to real love whether
    at any time we have had complete physical satisfaction or
    gratification i hardly know i have experienced very keen
    physical pleasure mingled with what i took to be great mental
    exaltation and quickening of the emotions this condition was
    brought about by close contact with the body of my friend
    usually by lying upon it but if by gratification it is meant
    that desire having been completely satisfied ceases
    temporarily i think i have never had that experience if i did
    it was when i was about 18 when i lived with a girl friend in
    intimate relations of late years at any rate it has never
    happened to me and an embrace however close always leaves me
    with a desire for a closer union both physical and spiritual so
    a few years since i came to the conclusion that it was
    impossible to obtain physical satisfaction through the woman i
    loved i came to this conclusion because of the bad physical
    effects of contact my sexual organs became highly sensitive and
    inflamed and i suffered pain from the inflammation and resulting
    leucorrhea should i allow myself to indulge in caresses this
    condition would return my friend fortunately though very
    affectionate and demonstrative toward me has very little sexual
    passion the idea that our relationship is based upon it is very
    repugnant to her i was at one time a few years since much
    discouraged and almost hopeless of being able to overcome my
    appetite and i decided that we could not associate unless i
    succeeded at present with help i have very largely succeeded
    in living with my friend on a basis of normal though
    affectionate and tender companionship i have been helped more
    and have learned more through this companionship than through
    anything else the keen pleasure that i have felt when in
    responsive contact i never experienced in masturbation so far as
    i remember it never took place till i was well along in my teens
    and was never an habitual practice except the first summer i was
    separated from a school friend whom i loved thoughts of her
    aroused feelings which i attempted to satisfy in this way but
    the entire sensuality of the act soon led me to refrain and to
    see that that was not what i wanted
    a peculiar incident that might have some significance occurred
    to me about five years ago i was sitting in a small room where a
    seminar was being conducted the leader of the discussion was a
    man about 50 whom i looked up to on account of his attainments
    and respected as a man though i knew him socially very slightly
    i had lost a nights sleep from toothache and was feeling
    nervous i was giving my entire attention to the subject in hand
    when suddenly i felt a very strong physical compulsion toward
    that man i did not know what i was going to do but i felt on
    the point of losing all control of myself i was afraid to leave
    for fear the slightest movement would throw me into a panic the
    attraction was entirely physical and like nothing i had felt
    before and i had a strange feeling that its cause was in the man
    himself that he was willing it i was like a spectator it was
    some moments before the assemblage broke up when my possession
    completely disappeared and never recurred
    regarding dreams i will say that not until the past year or two
    have i been conscious of having clearcut dreams with definite
    happenings they seemed usually to leave only vague impressions
    such as a feeling that i had been riding horseback or trying to
    perform some hard task sexual dreams i do not recall having had
    for several years except that occasionally i am awakened by a
    feeling of uncomfortable sexual desire which seems usually
    caused by a need to urinate between the ages of 17 and 22
    approximately i frequently perhaps several times a month would
    have vague sexual dreams these always i think occurred when i
    happened to be sleeping with someone whom in my dream i would
    mistake for my intimate friend and would awaken myself by
    embracing my bedfellow with sometimes a slight sometimes
    considerable degree of passion i have finally arrived at some
    understanding of my own temperament and am no longer miserable
    and melancholy i regret that i am not a man because i could
    then have a home and children

    ever since i can remember anything at all i could never think of
    myself as a girl and i was in perpetual trouble with this as the
    real reason when i was 5 or 6 years old i began to say to myself
    that whatever anyone said if i was not a boy at any rate i was
    not a girl this has been my unchanged conviction all through my
    life
    when i was little nothing ever made me doubt it in spite of
    external appearance i regarded the conformation of my body as a
    mysterious accident i could not see why it should have anything
    to do with the matter the things that really affected the
    question were my own likes and dislikes and the fact that i was
    not allowed to follow them i was to like the things which
    belonged to me as a girlfrocks and toys and games which i did
    not like at all i fancy i was more strongly boyish than the
    ordinary little boy when i could only crawl my absorbing
    interest was hammers and carpetnails before i could walk i
    begged to be put on horses backs so that i seem to have been
    born with the love of tools and animals which has never left me
    i did not play with dolls though my little sister did i was
    often reproached for not playing her games i always chose boys
    toystops and guns and horses i hated being kept indoors and
    was always longing to go out by the time i was 7 it seemed to me
    that everything i liked was called wrong for a girl i left off
    telling my elders what i did like they confused and wearied me
    by their talk of boys and girls i did not believe them and could
    hardly imagine that they believed themselves by the time i was 8
    or 9 i used to wonder whether they were dupes or liars or
    hypocrites or all three i never believed or trusted a grown
    person in consequence i led my younger brothers in everything i
    was not at all a happy little child and often cried and was made
    irritable i was so confused by the talk about boys and girls i
    was held up as an evil example to other little girls who
    virtuously despised me
    when i was about 9 years old i went to a day school and began to
    have a better time from 9 to 13 i practically shaped my own
    life i learned very little at school and openly hated it but i
    read a great deal at home and got plenty of ideas i lived
    however mainly out of doors whenever i could get out i spent
    all my pocket money on tools rabbits pigeons and many other
    animals i became an ardent pigeoncatcher not to say thief
    though i did not knowingly steal
    my brothers were as devoted to the animals as i was the men
    were supposed to look after them but we alone did so we
    observed mated separated and bred them with considerable
    skill we had no language to express ourselves but one of our
    own we were absolutely innocent and sweetly sympathetic with
    every beast i dont think we ever connected their affairs with
    those of human beings but as i do not remember the time when i
    did not know all about the actual facts of sex and reproduction
    i presume i learned it all in that way and life never had any
    surprises for me in that direction though i saw many sights that
    a child should not have seen while running about wild i never
    gave them a thought all animals great and small from rabbits to
    men had the same customs all natural and right my initiation
    here was in my eyes as nearly perfect as a childs should be i
    never asked grown people questions i thought all those in charge
    of me coarse and untruthful and i disliked all ugly things and
    suggestions
    every halfholiday i went out with the boys from my brothers
    school they always liked me to play with them and though not
    pleasanttongued boys were always civil and polite to me i
    organized games and fortifications that they would never have
    imagined for themselves led storming parties and instituted
    some rather dangerous games of a fighting kind i taught my
    brothers to throw stones sometimes i led adventures such as
    breaking into empty houses i liked being out after dark
    in the winter i made and rigged boats and went sailing them and
    i went rafting and poleleaping i became a very good jumper and
    climber could go up a rope bowl overhand throw like a boy and
    whistle three different ways i collected beetles and butterflies
    and went shrimping and learned to fish i had very little money
    to spend but i picked things up and i made all traps nets
    cages etc myself i learned from every workingman i could
    get hold of the use of all ordinary carpenters tools and how to
    weld hot iron pave lay bricks and turf and so on
    when i was about 11 my parents got more mortified at my behavior
    and perpetually threatened me with a boardingschool i was told
    for months how it would take the nonsense out of meshape me
    turn me into a young lady my going was finally announced to me
    as a punishment to me for being what i was
    certainly the horror of going to this school and the cruel and
    unsympathetic way that i was sent there gave me a shock that i
    never got over the only thing that reconciled me to going was my
    intense indignation with those who sent me i appealed to be
    allowed to learn latin and boys subjects but was laughed at
    i was so helpless that i knew i could not run away without being
    caught or i would have run away anywhere from home and school i
    never cried or fretted but burnt with anger and went like a
    trapped rabbit
    in no words can i describe the severity of the nervous shock or
    the suffering of my first year at school the school was noted
    for its severity and i heard that at one period the elder girls
    ran away so often that they wore a uniform dress i knew two who
    had run away the teachers in my time were ignorant
    selfindulgent women who cared nothing for the girls or their
    education and made much money out of them there was a suspicious
    reformatory atmosphere and my money was taken from me and my
    letters read
    i was intensely shy i hated the other girls there were no
    refinements anywhere i had no privacy in my room which was
    always overcrowded we had no hot water no baths improper food
    and no education we were not allowed to wear enough clean linen
    and for five years i never felt clean
    i never had one moment to myself was not allowed to read
    anything had even not enough lesson books was taught nothing to
    speak of except a little inferior music and drawing i never got
    enough exercise and was always tired and dull and could not
    keep my digestion in order my pride and selfrespect were
    degraded in innumerable ways i suffered agonies of disgust and
    the whole thing was a dreary penal servitude
    i did not complain i made friends with a few of the girls some
    of the older girls were attracted to me some talked of men and
    love affairs to me but i was not greatly interested no one ever
    spoke of any other matters of sex to me or in my hearing but
    most of the girls were shy with me and i with them
    in about two years time the teachers got to like me and thought
    me one of their nicest girls i certainly influenced them and got
    them to allow the girls more privileges
    i lay great stress upon the physical privations and disgust that
    i felt during these years the mental starvation was not quite so
    great because it was impossible for them to crush my mind as they
    did my body that it all materially aided to arrest the
    development of my body i am certain
    it is difficult to estimate sexual influences of which as a
    child i was practically unaware i certainly admired the
    liveliest and cleverest girls and made friends with them and
    disliked the common lumpy uneducated type that made twothirds
    of my companions the lively girls liked me and i made several
    nice friends whom i have kept ever since one girl of about 15
    took a violent liking for me and figuratively speaking licked the
    dust from my shoes i would never take any notice of her when i
    was nearly 16 one of my teachers began to notice me and be very
    kind to me she was twenty years older than i was she seemed to
    pity my loneliness and took me out for walks and sketching and
    encouraged me to talk and think it was the first time in my life
    that anyone had ever sympathized with me or tried to understand
    me and it was a most beautiful thing to me i felt like an orphan
    child who had suddenly acquired a mother and through her i began
    to feel less antagonistic to grown people and to feel the first
    respect i had ever felt for what they said she petted me into a
    state of comparative docility and made the other teachers like
    and trust me my love for her was perfectly pure and i thought
    of hers as simply maternal she never roused the least feeling
    in me that i can think of as sexual i liked her to touch me and
    she sometimes held me in her arms or let me sit on her lap at
    bedtime she used to come and say goodnight and kiss me upon the
    mouth i think now that what she did was injudicious to a degree
    and i wish i could believe it was as purely unselfish and kind as
    it seemed to me then after i had left school i wrote to her and
    visited her during a few years once she wrote to me that if i
    could give her employment she would come and live with me once
    when she was ill with neurasthenia her friends asked me to go to
    the seaside with her which i did here she behaved in an
    extraordinary way becoming violently jealous over me with
    another elderly friend of mine who was there i could hardly
    believe my senses and was so astonished and disgusted that i
    never went near her again she also accused me of not being
    loyal to her to this day i have no idea what she meant she
    then wrote and asked me what was wrong between us and i replied
    that after the words she had had with me my confidence in her was
    at an end it gave me no particular pang as i had by this time
    outgrown the simple gratitude of my childish days and not
    replaced it by any stronger feeling all my life i have had the
    profoundest repugnance to having any words with other women
    i was much less interested in sex matters than other children of
    my age i was altogether less precocious though i knew more i
    imagine than other girls nevertheless by the time i was 15
    social matters had begun to interest me greatly it is difficult
    to say how this happened as i was forbidden all books and
    newspapers except in my holidays when i had generally a reading
    orgy though not the books i needed or wanted i had abundant
    opportunities for speculation but no materials for any
    profitable thinking
    dreaming was forced upon me i dreamed fairytales by night and
    social dreams by day in the nightdreams sometimes in the
    daydreams i was always the prince or the pirate rescuing
    beauty in distress or killing the unworthy i had one dream
    which i dreamed over and over again and enjoyed and still
    sometimes dream in this i was always hunting and fighting often
    in the dark there was usually a woman or a princess whom i
    admired somewhere in the background but i have never really
    seen her sometimes i was a stowaway on board ship or an indian
    hunter or a backwoodsman making a logcabin for my wife or rather
    some companion my daythoughts were not about the women round
    about me or even about the one who was so kind to me they were
    almost impersonal i went on at any rate from myself to what i
    thought the really ideal and built up a very beautiful vision of
    solid human friendship in which there was everything that was
    strong and wholesome on either side but very little of sex to
    imagine this in its fullness i had to imagine all social family
    and educational conditions vastly different from anything i had
    come across from this my thoughts ran largely on social matters
    in whatever direction my thoughts ran i always surveyed them from
    the point of view of a boy i was trying to wait patiently till i
    could escape from slavery and starvation and trying to keep the
    open mind i have spoken of though i never opened a book of
    poetry or a novel or a history but i slipped naturally back
    into my nongirls attitude and read it through my own eyes all
    my surfacelife was a sham and only through books which were
    few did i ever see the world naturally a consideration of
    social matters led me to feel very sorry for women whom i
    regarded as made by a deliberate process of manufacture into the
    fools i thought they were and by the same process that i myself
    was being made one i felt more and more that men were to be
    envied and women pitied i lay stress on this for it started in
    me a deliberate interest in women as women i began to feel
    protective and kindly toward women and children and to excuse
    women from their responsibility for calamities such as my
    schoolcareer i never imagined that men required or would have
    thanked me for any sort of sympathy but it came about in these
    ways and without the least help that i can trace that by the
    time i was 19 years of age i was keenly interested in all kinds
    of questions pity for downtrodden women suffrage questions
    marriage laws questions of liberty freedom of thought care of
    the poor views of nature and man and god all these things
    filled my mind to the exclusion of individual men and women as
    soon as i left school i made a headlong plunge into books where
    these things were treated i had the answers to everything to
    find after a long period of enforced starvation i had to work
    for my knowledge no books or ideas came near me but what i went
    in search of another thing that helped me to take an expansive
    view of life at this time was my intense love of nature all
    birds and animals affected me by their beauty and grace and i
    have always kept a profound sympathy with them as well as some
    subtle understanding which enables me to tame them at times
    remarkably i not only loved all other creatures but i believed
    that men and women were the most beautiful things in the universe
    and i would rather look at them unclothed than on any other
    thing as my greatest pleasure i was prepared to like them
    because they were beautiful when the time came for me to leave
    school i rather dreaded it chiefly because i dreaded my life at
    home i had a great longing at this time to run away and try my
    fortune anywhere possibly if i had been stronger i might have
    done so but i was in very poor health through the physical
    crushing i had had and in very poor spirits through this and my
    mental repression i still knew myself a prisoner and i was
    bitterly disappointed and ashamed at having no education i
    afterward had myself taught arithmetic and other things
    the next period of my life which covered about six years was not
    less important to my development and was a time of extreme
    misery to me it found me on leaving school almost a child
    this time between 18 and 24 should i think count as my proper
    period of puberty which probably in most children occupies the
    end years of their schoollife
    it was at this time that i began to make a good many friends of
    my own and to become aware of psychical and sexual attractions i
    had never come across any theories on the subject but i decided
    that i must belong to a third sex of some kind i used to wonder
    if i was like the neuter bees i knew physical and psychical sex
    feeling and yet i seemed to know it quite otherwise from other
    men and women i asked myself if i could endure living a womans
    life bearing children and doing my duty by them i asked myself
    what hiatus there could be between my bodily structure and my
    feelings and also what was the meaning of the strong physical
    feelings which had me in their grip without choice of my own
    experience of physical sex sensations first began about 16 in
    sleep masturbation was accidentally discovered at the age of 19
    abandoned at 28 and then at 34 deliberately resumed as a method
    of purely physical relief these three things simply would not
    be reconciled and i said to myself that i must find a way of
    living in which there was as little sex of any kind as possible
    there was something that i simply lacked that i never doubted
    curiously enough i thought that the ultimate explanation might
    be that there were mens minds in womens bodies but i was more
    concerned in finding a way of life than in asking riddles without
    answers
    i thought that one day when i had money and opportunity i would
    dress in mens clothes and go to another country in order that i
    might be unhampered by sex considerations and conventions i
    determined to live an honorable upright but simple life
    i had no idea at first that homosexual attractions in women
    existed afterward observations on the lower animals put the idea
    into my head i made no preparation in my mind for any sexual
    life though i thought it would be a dreary business repressing
    my body all my days
    my relations with other women were entirely pure my attitude
    toward my sexual physical feelings was one of reserve and
    repression and i think the growing conviction of my radical
    deficiency somewhere would have made intimate affection for
    anyone with any demonstration in it a kind of impropriety for
    which i had no taste
    however between 21 and 24 other things happened to me
    during these few years i saw plenty of men and plenty of women
    as regards the men i liked them very well but i never thought
    the man would turn up with whom i should care to live several
    men were very friendly with me and three in particular used to
    write me letters and give me much of their confidence i invited
    two of them to visit at my house all these men talked to me with
    freedom and even told me about their sexual ideas and doings one
    asked me to believe that he was leading a good life the other
    two owned that they were not one discussed the question of
    homosexuality with me he has never married i liked one of them
    a good deal being attracted by his softness and gentleness and
    almost feminine voice it was hoped that i would take to him and
    he very cautiously made love to me i allowed him to kiss me a
    few times and wrote him a few responsive letters wondering what
    i liked in him someone then commented on the acquaintance and
    said marriage and i woke up to the fact that i did not really
    want him at all i think he found the friendship too insipid and
    was glad to be out of it all these men were a trifle feminine in
    characteristics and two played no games i thought it odd that
    they should all express admiration for the very boyish qualities
    in me that other people disliked a fourth man something of the
    same type told another friend that he always felt surprised at
    how freely he was able to talk to me but that he never could
    feel that i was a woman two of these were brilliantly clever
    men two were artists
    at the same period or earlier i made a number of women
    friends and of course saw more of them i chose out some and
    some chose me i think i attracted them as much as or even more
    than they attracted me i do not quite remember if this was so
    though i can say for certain that it was so at school there were
    three or four bright clever young women whom i got to know then
    with whom i was great friends we were interested in books
    social theories politics art sometimes i visited them or we
    went on exploring expeditions to many country places or towns
    they all in the end either had love affairs or married i know
    that in spite of all our free conversations they never talked to
    me as they did to each other we were always a little shy with
    each other but i got very fond of at least four of them i
    admired them and when i was tired and worried i often thought how
    easily if i had been a man i could have married and settled
    down with one or the other i used to think it would be
    delightful to have a woman to work for and take care of my
    attraction to these women was very strong but i dont think they
    knew it i seldom even kissed them but i should often have
    cheerfully given them a good hugging and kissing if i had thought
    it a right or proper thing to do i never wanted them to kiss me
    half so much as i wanted to kiss them in these years i felt this
    with every woman i admired
    occasionally i experienced slight erections when close to other
    women i am sure that no deliberate thought of mine caused them
    and as i had them at other times too when i was not expecting
    them i think it may have been accidental what i felt with my
    mind and what i felt with my body always at this time seemed
    apart i cannot accurately describe the interest and attraction
    that women then were to me i only know i never felt anything
    like it for men all my feelings of desire to do kindnesses to
    give presents to be liked and respected and all such natural
    small matters referred to women not to men and at this time
    both openly and to myself i said unhesitatingly that i liked
    women best it must be remembered that at this time a dislike for
    men was being fostered in me by those who wanted me to marry and
    this must have counted for more than i now remember
    as regards my physical sexual feelings which were well
    established during these few years i dont think i often
    indulged in any erotic imaginations worth estimating but so far
    as i did at all i always imagined myself as a man loving a
    woman i cannot recall ever imagining the opposite but i seldom
    imagined anything at all and i suppose ultimate sex sensations
    know no sex
    but as time went on and my physical and psychical feelings met
    at any rate in my own mind i became fully aware of the meaning
    of love and even of homosexual possibilities
    i should probably have thought more of this side of things
    except that during this time i was so worried by the difficulty
    of living in my home under the perpetual friction of comparison
    with other people my life was a sham i was an actor never off
    the boards i had to play at being a something i was not from
    morning till night and i had no cessation of the long fatigue i
    had had at school in addition i had sex to deal with actively
    and consciously
    looking back on these twentyfour years of my life i only look
    back on a round of misery the nervous strain was enormous and so
    was the moral strain instead of a child i felt myself whenever
    i desired to please anyone else a performing monkey my
    pleasures were stolen or i was snubbed for taking them i was not
    taught and was called a fool my hand was against everybodys
    how it was that with my high spirits and vivid imagination i did
    not grow up a moral imbecile full of perverted instincts i do not
    know i describe myself as a docile child but i was full of
    temptations to be otherwise there were times when i was silent
    before people but if i had had a knife in my hand i could have
    stuck it into them if it had been desired to make me a
    thoroughly perverted being i can imagine no better way than the
    attempt to mould me by force into a particular pattern of girl
    looking at my instincts in my first childhood and my mental
    confusion over myself i do not believe the most sympathetic and
    scientific treatment would have turned me into an average girl
    but i see no reason why proper physical conditions should not
    have induced a better physical development and that in its turn
    have led to tastes more approximate to those of the normal woman
    that i do not even now desire to be a normal woman is not to the
    point
    instead of any such help i suffered during the time that should
    have been puberty from a profound mental and physical shock which
    was extended over several years and in addition i suffered from
    the outrage of every fine and wholesome feeling i had these
    things by checking my physical development gave i am perfectly
    convinced a traumatic impetus to my general abnormality and
    this was further kept up by demanding of me at the dawn of my
    real sexual activity and when still practically a child an
    interest in men and marriage which i was no more capable of
    feeling than any ordinary boy or girl of 15 if you had taken a
    boy of 13 and given him all my conditions bound him hand and
    foot when you became afraid of him petted him into docility and
    then placed him in the world and while urging normal sexuality
    upon him on the one hand made him disgusted with it on the
    other what would have been the probable result
    looking back i can only say i think the results in my own case
    were marvellously good and that i was saved from worse by my own
    innocence and by the physical backwardness which nature probably
    in mercy bestowed upon me
    i find it difficult to sum up the way in which i affect other
    women and they me i can only record my conviction that i do
    affect a large number whether abnormally or not i dont know
    but i attract them and it would be easy for some of them to
    become very fond of me if i gave them a chance they are also i
    am certain more shy with me than they are with other women
    i find it difficult also to sum up their effect on me i only
    know that some women attract me and some tempt me physically and
    have done ever since i was about 22 or 23 i know that
    psychically i have always been more interested in women than in
    men but have not considered them the best companions or
    confidants i feel protective towards them never feel jealous of
    them and hate having differences with them and i feel always
    that i am not one of them if there had been any period in my
    life when health and temptation and money and opportunity had
    made homosexual relations easy i cannot say how i should have
    resisted i think that i have never had any such relations simply
    because i have in a way been safeguarded from them for a long
    time i thought i must do without all actual sexual relations and
    acted up to that if i had thought any relations right and
    possible i think i should have striven for heterosexual
    experiences because of the respect that i had cultivated indeed
    i think always had for the normal and natural if i had thought
    it right to indulge any sort of gratification which was within my
    reach i think i might probably have chosen the homosexual as
    being perhaps more satisfying and more convenient i always
    wanted love and friendship first later i should have been glad
    of something to satisfy my sex hunger too but by that time i
    could have done without it or i thought so
    at a period rather later than that dealt with in this narrative
    the subject of it became strongly attracted to a man who was of
    somewhat feminine and abnormal disposition but on consideration
    she decided that it would not be wise to marry him
the commonest characteristic of the sexually inverted woman is a certain
degree of masculinity or boyishness as i have already pointed out
transvestism in either women or men by no means necessarily involves
inversion in the volume of women adventurers edited by mrs norman for
the adventure series there is no trace of inversion in most of these
cases indeed love for a man was precisely the motive for adopting male
garments and manners again colley cibbers daughter charlotte charke a
boyish and vivacious woman who spent much of her life in mens clothes
and ultimately wrote a lively volume of memoirs appears never to have
been attracted to women though women were often attracted to her
believing her to be a man it is indeed noteworthy that women seem with
special frequency to fall in love with disguised persons of their own
sex166 there is however a very pronounced tendency among sexually
inverted women to adopt male attire when practicable in such cases male
garments are not usually regarded as desirable chiefly on account of
practical convenience nor even in order to make an impression on other
women but because the wearer feels more at home in them thus moll
mentions the case of a young governess of 16 who while still unconscious
of her sexual perversion used to find pleasure when everyone was out of
the house in putting on the clothes of a youth belonging to the family
    cases have been recorded of inverted women who spent the greater
    part of their lives in mens clothing and been generally regarded
    as men i may cite the case of lucy ann slater alias the rev
    joseph lobdell recorded by wise alienist and neurologist
    1883 she was masculine in character features and attire in
    early life she married and had a child but had no affection for
    her husband who eventually left her as usual in such cases her
    masculine habits appeared in early childhood she was expert with
    the rifle lived the life of a trapper and hunter among the
    indians and was known as the female hunter of long eddy she
    published a book regarding those experiences i have not been
    able to see it but it is said to be quaint and well written she
    regarded herself as practically a man and became attached to a
    young woman of good education who had also been deserted by her
    husband the affection was strong and emotional and of course
    without deception it was interrupted by her recognition and
    imprisonment as a vagabond but on the petition of her wife she
    was released i may be a woman in one sense she said but i
    have peculiar organs which make me more a man than a woman she
    alluded to an enlarged clitoris which she could erect she said
    as a turtle protrudes its head but there was no question of its
    use in coitus she was ultimately brought to the asylum with
    paroxysmal attacks of exaltation and erotomania without
    selfabuse apparently and corresponding periods of depression
    and she died with progressive dementia i may also mention the
    case briefly recorded in the lancet february 22 1884 of a
    person called john coulter who was employed for twelve years as
    a laborer by the belfast harbor commissioners when death
    resulted from injuries caused in falling down stairs it was
    found that this person was a woman she was fifty years of age
    and had apparently spent the greater part of her life as a man
    when employed in early life as a manservant on a farm she had
    married her mistresss daughter the pair were married for
    twentynine years but during the last six years lived apart
    owing to the husbands dissipated habits no one ever suspected
    her sex she was of masculine appearance and good muscular
    development the wife took charge of the body and buried it
    a more recent case of the same kind is that of murray hall who
    died in new york in 1901 her real name was mary anderson and
    she was born at govan in scotland early left an orphan on the
    death of her only brother she put on his clothes and went to
    edinburgh working as a man her secret was discovered during an
    illness and she finally went to america where she lived as a
    man for thirty years making money and becoming somewhat
    notorious as a tammany politician a rather riotous man about
    town the secret was not discovered till her death when it was
    a complete revelation even to her adopted daughter she married
    twice the first marriage ended in separation but the second
    marriage seemed to have been happy for it lasted twenty years
    when the wife died she associated much with pretty girls and
    was very jealous of them she seems to have been slight and not
    very masculine in general build with a squeaky voice but her
    ways attitude and habits were all essentially masculine she
    associated with politicians drank somewhat to excess though not
    heavily swore a great deal smoked and chewed tobacco sang
    ribald songs could run dance and fight like a man and had
    divested herself of every trace of feminine daintiness she wore
    clothes that were always rather too large in order to hide her
    form baggy trousers and an overcoat even in summer she is said
    to have died of cancer of the breast i quote from an account
    which appears to be reliable contained in the weekly
    scotsman february 9 1901
    another case described in the london papers is that of
    catharine coome who for forty years successfully personated a
    man and adopted masculine habits generally she married a ladys
    maid with whom she lived for fourteen years having latterly
    adopted a life of fraud her case gained publicity as that of the
    manwoman
    in 1901 the death on board ship was recorded of miss caroline
    hall of boston a watercolor painter who had long resided in
    milan three years previously she discarded female dress and
    lived as husband to a young italian lady also an artist whom
    she had already known for seven years she called herself mr
    hall and appeared to be a thoroughly normal young man able to
    shoot with a rifle and fond of manly sports the officers of the
    ship stated that she smoked and drank heartily joked with the
    other male passengers and was hailfellowwellmet with
    everyone death was due to advanced tuberculosis of the lungs
    hastened by excessive drinking and smoking
    ellen glenn alias ellis glenn a notorious swindler who came
    prominently before the public in chicago during 1905 was another
    manwoman of large and masculine type she preferred to dress
    as a man and had many love escapades with women she can fiddle
    as well as anyone in the state said a man who knew her can
    box like a pugilist and can dance and play cards
    in seville a few years ago an elderly policeman who had been
    in attendance on successive governors of that city for thirty
    years was badly injured in a street accident he was taken to
    the hospital and the doctor there discovered that the policeman
    was a woman she went by the name of fernando mackenzie and
    during the whole of her long service no suspicion whatever was
    aroused as to her sex she was french by birth born in paris in
    1836 but her father was english and her mother spanish she
    assumed her male disguise when she was a girl and served her
    time in the french army then emigrated to spain at the age of
    35 and contrived to enter the madrid police force disguised as a
    man she married there and pretended that her wifes child was
    her own son she removed to seville still serving as a
    policeman and was engaged there as cook and orderly at the
    governors palace she served seven successive governors in
    consequence of the discovery of her sex she has been discharged
    from the police without the pension due to her her wife had died
    two years previously and fernando spent all she possessed on
    the womans funeral mackenzie had a soft voice a refined face
    with delicate features and was neatly dressed in male attire
    when asked how she escaped detection so long she replied that
    she always lived quietly in her own house with her wife and did
    her duty by her employers so that no one meddled with her
    in chicago in 1906 much attention was attracted to the case of
    nicholai de raylan confidential secretary to the russian
    consul who at death of tuberculosis at the age of 33 was found
    to be a woman she was born in russia and was in many respects
    very feminine small and slight in build but was regarded as a
    man and even as very manly by both men and women who knew her
    intimately she was always very neat in dress fastidious in
    regard to shirts and ties and wore a longwaisted coat to
    disguise the lines of her figure she was married twice in
    america being divorced by the first wife after a union lasting
    ten years on the ground of cruelty and misconduct with chorus
    girls the second wife a chorus girl who had been previously
    married and had a child was devoted to her husband both wives
    were firmly convinced that their husband was a man and ridiculed
    the idea that he could be a woman i am informed that de raylan
    wore a very elaborately constructed artificial penis in her will
    she made careful arrangements to prevent detection of sex after
    death but these were frustrated as she died in a hospital
    in st louis in 1909 the case was brought forward of a young
    woman of 22 who had posed as a man for nine years her masculine
    career began at the age of 13 after the galveston flood which
    swept away all her family she was saved and left texas dressed
    as a boy she worked in livery stables in a plough factory and
    as a billposter at one time she was the adopted son of the
    family in which she lived and had no difficulty in deceiving her
    sisters by adoption as to her sex on coming to st louis in 1902
    she made chairs and baskets at the american rattan works
    associating with fellowworkmen on a footing of masculine
    equality one day a workman noticed the extreme smallness and
    dexterity of her hands gee bill you should have been a girl
    how do you know im not she retorted in such ways her ready
    wit and good humor always disarmed suspicion as to her sex she
    shunned no difficulties in her work or in her sports we are
    told and never avoided the severest tests she drank she
    swore she courted girls she worked as hard as her fellows she
    fished and camped she told stories with the best of them and
    she did not flinch when the talk grew strong she even chewed
    tobacco girls began to fall in love with the goodlooking boy
    at an early period and she frequently boasted of her feminine
    conquests with one girl who worshipped her there was a question
    of marriage on account of lack of education she was restricted
    to manual labor and she often chose hard work at one time she
    became a boilermakers apprentice wielding a hammer and driving
    in hot rivets here she was very popular and became local
    secretary of the international brotherhood of boilermakers in
    physical development she was now somewhat of an athlete she
    could outrun any of her friends on a sprint she could kick
    higher play baseball and throw the ball overhand like a man
    and she was fond of football as a wrestler she could throw most
    of the club members the physician who examined her for an
    insurance policy remarked you are a fine specimen of physical
    manhood young fellow take good care of yourself finally in a
    moment of weakness she admitted her sex and returned to the
    garments of womanhood
    in london in 1912 a servantgirl of 23 was charged in the acton
    police court with being disorderly and masquerading having
    assumed mans clothes and living with another girl taller and
    more handsome than herself as husband and wife she had had
    slight brain trouble as a child and was very intelligent with a
    too active brain in her spare time she had written stories for
    magazines the two girls became attached through doing christian
    social work together in their spare time and resolved to live as
    husband and wife to prevent any young man from coming forward
    the husband became a plumbers mate and displayed some skill
    at fisticuffs when at length discovered by the wifes brother
    hence her appearance in the police court both girls were sent
    back to their friends and situations found for them as
    dayservants but as they remained devoted to each other
    arrangements were made for them to live together
    another case that may be mentioned is that of cora anderson the
    manwoman of milwaukee who posed for thirteen years as a man
    and during that period lived with two women as her wives without
    her disguise being penetrated her confessions were published
    in the day book of chicago during may 1914
    it would be easy to bring forward other cases a few instances of
    marriage between women will be found in the alienist and
    neurologist nov 1902 p 497 in all such cases more or less
    fraud has been exercised i know of one case probably unique in
    which the ceremony was gone through without any deception on any
    side a congenitally inverted englishwoman of distinguished
    intellectual ability now dead was attached to the wife of a
    clergyman who in full cognizance of all the facts of the case
    privately married the two ladies in his own church
when they still retain female garments these usually show some traits of
masculine simplicity and there is nearly always a disdain for the petty
feminine artifices of the toilet even when this is not obvious there are
all sorts of instinctive gestures and habits which may suggest to female
acquaintances the remark that such a person ought to have been a man
the brusque energetic movements the attitude of the arms the direct
speech the inflexions of the voice the masculine straightforwardness and
sense of honor and especially the attitude toward men free from any
suggestion either of shyness or audacity will often suggest the
underlying psychic abnormality to a keen observer
in the habits not only is there frequently a pronounced taste for smoking
cigarettes often found in quite feminine women but also a decided taste
and toleration for cigars there is also a dislike and sometimes
incapacity for needlework and other domestic occupations while there is
often some capacity for athletics
    as regards the general bearing of the inverted woman in its most
    marked and undisguised form i may quote an admirable description
    by prof zuccarelli of naples of an unmarried middleclass
    woman of 35 while retaining feminine garments her bearing is
    as nearly as possible a mans she wears her thin hair thrown
    carelessly back alla umberto and fastened in a simple knot at
    the back of her head the breasts are little developed and
    compressed beneath a high corset her gown is narrow without the
    expansion demanded by fashion her straw hat with broad plaits is
    perhaps adorned by a feather or she wears a small hat like a
    boys she does not carry an umbrella or sunshade and walks out
    alone refusing the company of men or she is accompanied by a
    woman as she prefers offering her arm and carrying the other
    hand at her waist with the air of a fine gentleman in a
    carriage her bearing is peculiar and unlike that habitual with
    women seated in the middle of the double seat her knees being
    crossed or else the legs well separated with a virile air and
    careless easy movements she turns her head in every direction
    finding an acquaintance here and there with her eye saluting men
    and women with a large gesture of the hand as a business man
    would in conversation her pose is similar she gesticulates
    much is vivacious in speech with much power of mimicry and
    while talking she arches the inner angles of her eyebrow making
    vertical wrinkles at the center of her forehead her laugh is
    open and explosive and uncovers her white rows of teeth with men
    she is on terms of careless equality inversione congenita

    the inverted woman hirschfeld truly remarks die
    homosexualitt p 158 is more full of life of enterprise
    of practical energy more aggressive more heroic more apt for
    adventure than either the heterosexual woman or the homosexual
    man sometimes he adds her mannishness may approach reckless
    brutality and her courage becomes rashness this author
    observes however in another place p 272 that in addition to
    this group of inverted women with masculine traits there is
    another group not less large of equally inverted women who
    are outwardly as thoroughly feminine as are normal women this is
    not an observation which i am able to confirm it appears to me
    that the great majority of inverted women possess some masculine
    or boyish traits even though only as slight as those which may
    occasionally be revealed by normal women extreme femininity in
    my observation is much more likely to be found in bisexual than
    in homosexual women just as extreme masculinity is much more
    likely to be found in bisexual than in homosexual men
while inverted women frequently though not always convey an impression
of mannishness or boyishness there are no invariable anatomical
characteristics associated with this impression there is for instance
no uniform tendency to a masculine distribution of hair nor must it be
supposed that the presence of a beard in a woman indicates a homosexual
tendency bearded women as hirschfeld remarks are scarcely ever
inverted and it would seem that the strongest reversals of secondary
sexual characters less often accompany homosexuality than slighter
modifications of these characters167 a faint moustache and other slight
manifestations of hypertrichosis also by no means necessarily indicate
homosexuality to some extent it is a matter of race thus in the pera
district of constantinople weissenberg among nearly seven hundred women
between about 18 and 50 years of age noted that 10 per cent showed hair
on the upper lip they were most often armenians the greeks coming
next168
    there has been some dispute as to whether apart from
    homosexuality hypertrichosis in a woman can be regarded as an
    indication of a general masculinity this is denied by max
    bartels in his elaborate study ueber abnorme behaarung beim
    menschen zeitschrift fr ethnologie 1876 p 127 1881 p
    219 and as regards insanity by l harrisliston cases of
    bearded women british medical journal june 2 1894 on the
    other hand jh claiborne hypertrichosis in women new york
    medical journal june 13 1914 believes that hair on the face
    and body in a woman is a sign of masculinity women with
    hypertrichosis possess masculine traits
    there seems to be very little doubt that fully developed bearded
    women are in most possibly not all cases decidedly feminine in
    all other respects a typical instance is furnished by annie
    jones the esau lady of virginia she belonged to a large and
    entirely normal family but herself possessed a full beard with
    thick whiskers and moustache of an entirely masculine type she
    also showed short dark hair on arms and hands resembling a man
    apart from this heterogeny she was entirely normal and feminine
    at the age of 26 when examined in berlin the hair of the head
    was very long the expression of the face entirely feminine the
    voice also feminine the figure elegant the hands and feet
    entirely of feminine type the external and internal genitalia
    altogether feminine annie jones was married max bartels who
    studied annie jones and published her portrait zeitschrift fr
    ethnologie 1891 heft 3 p 243 remarks that in these
    respects annie jones resembles other bearded women they marry
    have children and are able to suckle them a beard in women
    seems as dupr and duflos believe revue neurologique aug
    30 1901 to be more closely correlated with neuropathy than
    with masculinity comparing a thousand sane women with a thousand
    insane women in paris they found unusual degree of hair or down
    on the face in 23 per cent of the former and 50 per cent of the
    latter but even the sane bearded women frequently belonged to
    neuropathic families
    a tendency to slight widely diffused hypertrichosis of the body
    generally not localized or highly developed on the face seems
    much more likely than a beard to be associated with masculinity
    even when it occurs in little girls thus virchow once presented
    to the berlin anthropological society a little girl of 5 of this
    type who also possessed a deep and rough voice zeitschrift fr
    ethnologie 1891 heft 4 p 469 a typical example of slight
    hypertrichosis in a woman associated with general masculine
    traits is furnished by a description and figure of the body of a
    woman of 56 in an anatomical institute furnished by c strauch
    zeitschrift fr ethnologie 1901 heft 6 p 534 in this
    case there was a growth of hair around both nipples and a line of
    hair extended from the pubes to the navel both these two
    dispositions of hair are very rare in women in vienna among
    nearly 700 women coe only found a tendency to hair distribution
    toward the navel in about 1 per cent while the hair in this
    subject was otherwise fairly normal there were many
    approximations to the masculine type in other respects the
    muscles were strongly developed the bones massive the limbs
    long the joints powerful the hands and feet large the thorax
    well developed the lower jaw massive there was an absence of
    feminine curves on the body and the breasts were scarcely
    perceptible at the same time the genital organs were normal and
    there had been childbirth it was further notable that this woman
    had committed suicide by selfstrangulation a rare method which
    requires great resolution and strength of will as at any moment
    of the process the pressure can be removed
there seems little doubt that inverted women frequently tend to show minor
anomalies of the piliferous system and especially slight hypertrichosis
and a masculine distribution of hair thus in a very typical case of
inversion in an italian girl of 19 who dressed as a man and ran away from
home the down on the arms and legs was marked to an unusual extent and
there was very abundant hair in the armpits and on the pubes with a
tendency to the masculine distribution169 of the three cases described
in this chapter which i am best acquainted with one possesses an
unusually small amount of hair on the pubes and in the axill
oligotrichosis terminalis approximating to the infantile type while
another presents a complex and very rare piliferous heterogeny there is
marked dark down on the upper lip the pubic hair is thick and there is
hair on toes and feet and legs to umbilicus there are also a few hairs
around the nipples a woman physician in the united states who knows many
female inverts similarly tells me that she has observed the tendency to
growth of hair on the legs if as is not improbable inversion is
associated with some abnormal balance in the internal secretions it is
not difficult to understand this tendency to piliferous anomalies and we
know that the thyroid secretion for instance and much more the
testicular and ovarian secretions have a powerful influence on the hair
    ballantyne some years ago in discussing congenital
    hypertrichosis manual of antenatal pathology 1902 pp 3216
    concluded that the theory of arrested development is best
    supported by the facts persistence of lanugo is such an arrest
    and hypertrichosis may largely be considered a persistence of
    lanugo such a conclusion is still tenablethough it encounters
    some difficulties and inconsistenciesand it largely agrees
    with what we know of the condition as associated with inversion
    in women but we are now beginning to see that this arrested
    development may be definitely associated with anomalies in the
    internal secretions and even with special chemical defects in
    these secretions virile strength has always been associated with
    hair as the story of samson bears witness ammon found among
    baden conscripts lanthropologie 1896 p 285 that when the
    men were divided into classes according to the amount of hair on
    body the first class with least hair have the smallest
    circumference of testicle the fewest number of men with glans
    penis uncovered the largest number of infantile voices the
    largest proportion of blue eyes and fair hair the smallest
    average height weight and chest circumference while in all
    these respects the men with hairy bodies were at the other
    extreme it has been known from antiquity that in men early
    castration affects the growth of hair it is now known that in
    women the presence or absence of the ovary and other glands
    affects the hair as well as sexual development thus hegar
    beitrge zur geburtshlfe und gynkologie vol i p 111
    1898 described a girl with pelvis of infantile type and uterine
    malformation who had been unusually hairy on face and body from
    infancy with masculine arrangement of hair on pubes and abdomen
    menstruation was scanty breasts atrophic the hair was of lanugo
    type we see here how in women infantile and masculine
    characteristics are associated with and both probably dependent
    on defects in the sexual glands plant centralblatt fr
    gynkologie no 9 1896 described another girl with very small
    ovaries rudimentary uterus small vagina and prominent nymph
    in whom menstruation was absent hair on head long and strong
    but hair absent in armpits and scanty on mons veneris these two
    cases seem inconsistent as regards hair and we should now wish
    to know the condition of the other internal glands the thyroid
    for instance it is now known controls the hair as well as do
    the sexual glands and the thyroid as gautier has shown
    acadmie de mdecine july 24 1900 elaborates arsenic and
    iodine which nourish the skin and hair he found that the
    administration of sodium cacodylate to young women produced
    abundant growth of hair on head again the kidneys and
    especially the adrenal glands influence the hair it has long
    been known that in girls with congenital renal tumors there is an
    abnormally early growth of axillary and pubic hair goldschwend
    prger medizinische wochenschrift nos 37 and 38 1910 has
    described the case of a woman of 39 with small ovaries and
    adrenal tumor in whom hair began to grow on chin and cheeks
    see also ct ewart lancet may 19 1915 once more the
    glans hypophysis also affects hair growth and it has been found
    by lvi quoted in archives danthropologie criminelle
    augustseptember 1912 p 711 that the administration of
    hypophysis extract to an infantile hairless woman of 27 without
    sexual feeling produced a general tendency to growth of hair
    such facts not only help to explain the anomalies of hair
    development but also indicate the direction in which we may find
    an explanation of the anomalies of the sexual impulse
apart from the complicated problem presented by the hair there are
genuine approximations to the masculine type the muscles tend to be
everywhere firm with a comparative absence of soft connective tissue so
that an inverted woman may give an unfeminine impression to the sense of
touch a certain tonicity of the muscles has indeed often been observed in
homosexual women hirschfeld found that twothirds of inverted women are
more muscular than normal women while on the other hand he found that
among inverted men the musculature was often weak
not only is the tone of the voice often different but there is reason to
suppose that this rests on a basis of anatomical modification at molls
suggestion flatau examined the larynx in a large number of inverted
women and found in several a very decidedly masculine type of larynx or
an approach to it especially in cases of distinctly congenital origin
hirschfeld has confirmed flataus observations on this point it may be
added that inverted women are very often good whistlers hirschfeld even
knows two who are public performers in whistling it is scarcely necessary
to remark that while the old proverb associates whistling in a woman with
crowing in a hen whistling in a woman is no evidence of any general
physical or psychic inversion
as regards the sexual organs it seems possible so far as my observations
go to speak more definitely of inverted women than of inverted men in
all three of the cases concerning whom i have precise information among
those whose histories are recorded in the present chapter there is more
or less arrested development and infantilism in one a somewhat small
vagina and prominent nymph with local sensitiveness are associated with
oligotrichosis in another the sexual parts are in some respects rather
small while there is no trace of ovary on one side in the third case
together with hypertrichosis the nates are small the nymph large the
clitoris deeply hooded the hymen thick and the vagina probably small
these observations though few are significant and they accord with
those of other observers170 krafftebing well described a case which i
should be inclined to regard as typical of many sexual organs feminine in
character but remaining at the infantile stage of a girl of 10 small
clitoris prominent cockscomblike nymph small vagina scarcely
permitting normal intercourse and very sensitive hirschfeld agrees in
finding common an approach to the type described by krafftebing atrophic
anomalies he regards as more common than hypertrophic and he refers to
thickness of hymen and a tendency to notably small uterus and ovaries the
clitoris is more usually small than large women with a large clitoris as
parentduchtelet long since remarked seem rarely to be of masculine
type
notwithstanding these tendencies however sexual inversion in a woman is
as a rule not more obvious than in a man at the same time the inverted
woman is not usually attractive to men she herself generally feels the
greatest indifference to men and often cannot understand why a woman
should love a man though she easily understands why a man should love a
woman she shows therefore nothing of that sexual shyness and engaging
air of weakness and dependence which are an invitation to men the man who
is passionately attracted to an inverted woman is usually of rather a
feminine type for instance in one case present to my mind he was of
somewhat neurotic heredity of slight physical development not sexually
attractive to women and very domesticated in his manner of living in
short a man who might easily have been passionately attracted to his own
sex
while the inverted woman is cold or at most comradely in her bearing
toward men she may become shy and confused in the presence of attractive
persons of her own sex even unable to undress in their presence and full
of tender ardor for the woman whom she loves171
homosexual passion in women finds more or less complete expression in
kissing sleeping together and close embraces as in what is sometimes
called lying spoons when one woman lies on her side with her back
turned to her friend and embraces her from behind fitting her thighs into
the bend of her companions legs so that her mons veneris is in dose
contact with the others buttocks and slight movement then produces mild
erethism one may also lie on the others body or there may be mutual
masturbation mutual contact and friction of the sexual parts seem to be
comparatively rare but it seems to have been common in antiquity for we
owe to it the term tribadism which is sometimes used as a synonym of
feminine homosexuality and this method is said to be practised today by
the southern slav women of the balkans172 the extreme gratification is
cunnilinctus or oral stimulation of the feminine sexual organs not
usually mutual but practised by the more active and masculine partner
this act is sometimes termed by no means satisfactorily sapphism and
lesbianism173
an enlarged clitoris is but rarely found in inversion and plays a very
small part in the gratification of feminine homosexuality kiernan refers
to a case occurring in america in which an inverted woman married and a
mother possessed a clitoris which measured 2 inches when erect casanova
described an inverted swiss woman otherwise feminine in development
whose clitoris in excitement was longer than his little finger and
capable of penetration174 the older literature contains many similar
cases in most such cases however we are probably concerned with some
form of pseudohermaphroditism and the clitoris may more properly be
regarded as a penis there is thus no inversion involved175
while the use of the clitoris is rare in homosexuality the use of an
artificial penis is by no means uncommon and very widespread in several
of the modern cases in which inverted women have married women such as
those of sarolta vay and de raylan the belief of the wife in the
masculinity of the husband has been due to an appliance of this kind
used in intercourse the artificial penis the olisbos or baubon was
well known to the greeks and is described by herondas its invention was
ascribed by suidas to the milesian women and miletus according to
aristophanes in the lysistrata was the chief place of its
manufacture176 it was still known in medieval times and in the twelfth
century bishop burchard of worms speaks of its use as a thing which
some women are accustomed to do in the early eighteenth century
margaretha lincken again in germany married another woman with the aid
of an artificial male organ177 the artificial penis is also used by
homosexual women in various parts of the world thus we find it mentioned
in legends of the north american indians and it is employed in zanzibar
and madagascar178
    the various phenomena of sadism masochism and fetichism which
    are liable to arise spontaneously or by suggestion in the
    relationships of normal lovers as well as of male inverts may
    also arise in the same way among inverted women though
    probably not often in a very pronounced form moll however
    narrates a case kontrre sexualempfindung 1899 pp 56570
    in which various minor but very definite perversions were
    combined with inversion a young lady of 26 of good heredity
    from the age of 6 had only been attracted to her own sex and
    even in childhood had practised mutual cunnilinctus she was
    extremely intelligent and of generous and goodnatured
    disposition with various masculine tastes but on the whole of
    feminine build and with completely feminine larynx during seven
    years she lived exclusively with one woman she found complete
    satisfaction in active cunnilinctus during the course of this
    relationship various other methods of excitement and
    gratification aroseit seems for the most part spontaneously
    she found much pleasure in urolagnic and coprolagnic practices
    in addition to these and similar perversions the subject liked
    being bitten especially in the lobule of the ear and she was
    highly excited when whipped by her friend who should if
    possible be naked at the time only the nates must be whipped
    and only a birch rod be used or the effect would not be
    obtained these practices would not be possible to her in the
    absence of extreme intimacy and mutual understanding and they
    only took place with the one friend in this case the perverse
    phenomena were masochistic rather than sadistic many homosexual
    women however display sadistic tendencies in a more or less
    degree thus dr kiernan tells me of an american case with which
    he was professionally concerned with dr moyer see also paper by
    kiernan and moyer in alienist and neurologist may 1907 of a
    sadistic inverted woman in a small illinois city married and
    with two young children she was of undoubted neuropathic stock
    and there was a history of premarital masturbation and
    bestiality with a dog she was a prominent club woman in her city
    and a leader in religious and social matters as is often the
    case with sadists she was pruriently prudish and there was
    strong testimony to her chaste and modest character by clergymen
    club women and local magnates the victim of her sadistic
    passion was a girl she had adopted from a home but whom she half
    starved on this girl she inflicted over three hundred wounds
    many of these wounds were stabs with forks and scissors which
    merely penetrated the skin this was especially the case with
    those inflicted on the breasts labia and clitoris during the
    infliction of these she experienced intense excitement but this
    excitement was under control and when she heard anyone
    approaching she instantly desisted she was found sane and
    responsible at the time of these actions but the jury also found
    that she had since become insane and she was sent to an insane
    hospital after recovery to serve a sentence of two years in
    prison the alleged insanity dr kiernan adds was of the
    dubious manic and depressive variety and perhaps chiefly due to
    wounded pride
the inverted woman is an enthusiastic admirer of feminine beauty
especially of the statuesque beauty of the body unlike in this the
normal woman whose sexual emotion is but faintly tinged by esthetic
feeling in her sexual habits we perhaps less often find the degree of
promiscuity which is not uncommon among inverted men and we may perhaps
agree with moll that homosexual women are more often apt to love
faithfully and lastingly than homosexual men hirschfeld remarks that
inverted women are not usually attracted in girlhood by the autoerotic and
homosexual vices of schoollife179 and nearly all the women whose
histories i have recorded in this chapter felt a pronounced repugnance to
such manifestations and cherished lofty ideals of love
inverted women are not rarely married moll from various confidences
which he has received believes that inverted women have not the same
horror of normal coitus as inverted men this is probably due to the fact
that the woman under such circumstances can retain a certain passivity in
other cases there is some degree of bisexuality although as among
inverted men the homosexual instinct seems usually to give the greater
relief and gratification
it has been stated by many observersin america in france in germany
and in englandthat homosexuality is increasing among women180 there
are many influences in our civilization today which encourage such
manifestations181 the modern movement of emancipationthe movement to
obtain the same rights and duties as men the same freedom and
responsibility the same education and the same workmust be regarded as
on the whole a wholesome and inevitable movement but it carries with it
certain disadvantages182 women are very justly coming to look upon
knowledge and experience generally as their right as much as their
brothers right but when this doctrine is applied to the sexual sphere it
finds certain limitations intimacies of any kind between young men and
young women are as much discouraged socially now as ever they were as
regards higher education the mere association of the sexes in the
lectureroom or the laboratory or the hospital is discouraged in england
and in america while men are allowed freedom the sexual field of women
is becoming restricted to trivial flirtation with the opposite sex and to
intimacy with their own sex having been taught independence of men and
disdain for the old theory which placed women in the moated grange of the
home to sigh for a man who never comes a tendency develops for women to
carry this independence still farther and to find love where they find
work these unquestionable influences of modern movements cannot directly
cause sexual inversion but they develop the germs of it and they
probably cause a spurious imitation this spurious imitation is due to the
fact that the congenital anomaly occurs with special frequency in women of
high intelligence who voluntarily or involuntarily influence others

somewhat idealizing her however she seems to have belonged to a neurotic
and eccentric stock each of the family her biographer says had his
peculiar freak as a child she only cared for boys games and could
never adapt herself to any womans avocations she had a natural
abhorrence to the tending of children her disposition was altogether
masculine she was not for mincing obscenity but would talk freely
whatever came uppermost she never had any children and was not taxed
with debauchery no man can say or affirm that ever she had a sweetheart
or any such fond thing to dally with her a mastiff was the only living
thing she cared for her life was not altogether honest but not so much
from any organic tendency to crime it seems as because her abnormal
nature and restlessness made her an outcast she was too fond of drink
and is said to have been the first woman who smoked tobacco nothing is
said or suggested of any homosexual practices but we see clearly here

history of the past in charles the seconds court the mmoires de

soon the rumor true or false of this singularity spread through the
court they were gross enough there never to have heard of that refinement
of ancient greece in the tastes of tenderness and the idea came into
their heads that the illustrious hobart who seemed so affectionate to
pretty women must be different from what she appeared this passage is
interesting because it shows us how rare was the exception a century
later however homosexuality among english women seems to have been
regarded by the french as common and bacchaumont on january 1 1773

181 i believe writes a wellinformed american correspondent that
sexual inversion is increasing among americansboth men and womenand
the obvious reasons are first the growing independence of the women
their lessening need for marriage secondly the nervous strain that
business competition has brought upon the whole nation in a word the
rapidly increasing masculinity in women and the unhealthy nervous systems
of the men offer the ideal factors for the production of sexual inversion
in their children

attractionphysical sexual abnormalitiesartistic and other
aptitudesmoral attitude of the invert
before stating briefly my own conclusions as to the nature of sexual
inversion i propose to analyze the facts brought out in the histories
which i have been able to study183
raceall my cases 80 in number are british and american 20 living in
the united states and the rest being british ancestry from the point of
view of race was not made a matter of special investigation it appears
however that at least 44 are english or mainly english at least 10 are
scotch or of scotch extraction 2 are irish and 4 others largely irish 4
have german fathers or mothers another is of german descent on both
sides while 2 others are of remote german extraction 2 are partly and 1
entirely french 2 have a portuguese strain and at least 2 are more or
less jewish except the apparently frequent presence of the german
element there is nothing remarkable in this ancestry
heredityit is always difficult to deal securely with the significance
of heredity or even to establish a definite basis of facts i have by no
means escaped this difficulty for in some cases i have not even had an
opportunity of crossexamining the subjects whose histories i have
obtained still the facts so far as they emerge have some interest i
possess some record of heredity in 62 of my cases of these not less than
24 or in the proportion of nearly 39 per cent assert that they have
reason to believe that other cases of inversion have occurred in their
families and while in some it is only a strong suspicion in others
there is no doubt whatever in one case there is reason to suspect
inversion on both sides usually the inverted relatives have been
brothers sisters cousins or uncles in one case a bisexual son seems to
have had a bisexual father
    this hereditary character of inversion which was denied by
    ncke is a fact of great significance and as it occurs in
    cases with which i am well acquainted i can have no doubt
    concerning the existence of the tendency the influence of
    suggestion may often be entirely excluded especially when the
    persons are of different sex both krafftebing and moll noted a
    similar tendency von rmer states that in onethird of his cases
    there was inversion in other members of the family hirschfeld
    also found that there is a relatively high proportion of cases of
    family inversion
twentysix so far as can be ascertained belong to reasonably healthy
families minute investigation would probably reduce the number of these
and it is noteworthy that even in some of the healthy families there was
only one child born of the parents marriage in 28 cases there is more or
less frequency of morbidity or abnormalityeccentricity alcoholism
neurasthenia insanity or nervous diseaseon one or both sides in
addition to inversion or apart from it in some of these cases the
inverted offspring is the outcome of the union of a very healthy with a
thoroughly morbid stock in some others there is a minor degree of
abnormality on both sides
general healthit is possible to speak with more certainty of the health
of the individual than of that of his family of the 80 cases 53or
about twothirdsmay be said to enjoy good and sometimes even very good
health though occasionally there is some slight qualification to be made
in 22 cases the health is delicate or at best only fair in these cases
there is sometimes a tendency to consumption and often marked
neurasthenia and a more or less unbalanced temperament four cases are
morbid to a considerable degree the remaining case has had insane
delusions which required treatment in an asylum a considerable
proportion included among those as having either good or fair health may
be described as of extremely nervous temperament and in most cases they
so describe themselves a certain proportion of these combine great
physical and especially mental energy with this nervousness all these
are doubtless of neurotic temperament184 very few can be said to be
conspicuously lacking in energy on the whole therefore a large
proportion of these inverted individuals are passing through life in an
unimpaired state of health which enables them to do at least their fair
share of work in the world in a considerable proportion of my cases that
work is of high intellectual value only in 5 cases it will be seen or
at most 6 can the general health be said to be distinctly bad
this result may perhaps seem surprising it must however be remembered
that my cases do not on the whole represent the class which alone the
physician is usually able to bring forward ie the sexual inverts who
are suffering from a more or less severe degree of complete nervous
breakdown
    there is no frequent relationship between homosexuality and
    insanity and such homosexuality as is found in asylums is mostly
    of a spurious character this point was specially emphasized by
    ncke eg homosexualitt und psychose zeitschrift fr
    psichiatrie vol lxviii no 3 1911 he quoted the opinions
    of various distinguished alienists as to the rarity with which
    they had met genuine inverts and recorded his own experiences
    he had never met a genuine invert in the asylum throughout his
    extensive experience although he was quite willing to admit that
    there may be unrecognized inverts in asylums and one patient
    informed him after leaving that he was inverted and had
    attracted the attention of the police both before and afterward
    though nothing happened in the asylum among 1500 patients in the
    asylum during one year active pedicatio occurred in about 1
    per cent of cases these patients being frequently idiots or
    imbeciles and at the same time masturbators solitary or mutual
    hirschfeld informed ncke that among homosexual persons
    hysterical conditions not usually on hereditary basis are
    fairly common and neurasthenia of high degree decidedly
    frequent but though stages of depression are common he had never
    seen pure melancholia and very seldom mania but paranoiac
    delusional ideas frequently and he agreed with bryan of
    broadmoor that religious delusions are not uncommon general
    paralysis occurs but is comparatively rare and the same may be
    said of dementia prcox on the whole although hirschfeld was
    unable to give precise figures there was no reason whatever to
    suppose an abnormal prevalence of insanity this was nckes own
    view it is quite true ncke concluded that homosexual actions
    occur in every form of psychosis especially in congenital and
    secondary dements and at periods of excitement but we are here
    more concerned with pseudohomosexuality than with true
    inversion hirschfeld finds that 75 per cent inverts are of
    sound heredity this seems too large a proportion in any case
    allowance must be made for differences in method and minuteness
    of investigation
i am fairly certain that thorough investigation would very considerably
enlarge the proportion of cases with morbid heredity at the same time
this enlargement would be chiefly obtained by bringing minor abnormalities
to the front and it would then have to be shown how far the families of
average or normal persons are free from such abnormalities the question
is sometimes asked what family is free from neuropathic taint at present
it is difficult to answer this question precisely there is good ground to
believe that a fairly large proportion of families are free from such
taint in any case it seems probable that the families to which the
inverted belong do not usually present such profound signs of nervous
degeneration as we were formerly led to suppose what we vaguely call
eccentricity is common among them insanity is much rarer
first appearance of homosexual instinctout of 72 cases in 8 the
instinct veered round to the same sex in adult age or at all events after
puberty in 3 of these there had been a lovedisappointment with a woman
no other cause than this can be assigned for the transition but it is
noteworthy that in at least 2 of these cases the sexual instinct is
undeveloped or morbidly weak while a third individual is of somewhat
weak physique and another has long been in delicate health in a
further case also somewhat morbid the development was rather more
complicated
in 64 cases or in a proportion of 88 per cent the abnormal instinct
began in early life without previous attraction to the opposite sex185
in 27 of these it dates from about puberty usually beginning at school
in 39 cases the tendency began before puberty between the ages of 5 and
11 usually between 7 and 9 sometimes as early as the subject can
remember it must not be supposed that in these numerous cases of the
early appearance of homosexuality the manifestations were of a
specifically physical character although erections are noted in a few
cases for the most part sexual manifestations at this early age whether
homosexual or heterosexual are purely psychic186
sexual precocity and hyperesthesiait is a fact of considerable interest
and significance that in so large a number of my cases there was distinct
precocity of the sexual emotions both on the physical and psychic sides
there can be little doubt that as many previous observers have found
inversion tends strongly to be associated with sexual precocity i think
it may further be said that sexual precocity tends to encourage the
inverted habit where it exists why this should be so is obvious if we
believeas there is some reason for believingthat at an early age the
sexual instinct is comparatively undifferentiated in its manifestations
the precocious accentuation of the sexual impulse leads to definite
crystallization of the emotions at a premature stage it must be added
that precocious sexual energy is likely to remain feeble and that a
feeble sexual energy adapts itself more easily to homosexual
relationships in which there is no definite act to be accomplished than
to normal relationships it is difficult to say how many of my cases
exhibit sexual weakness in 6 or 7 it is evident and it may be suspected
in many others especially in those who are and often describe themselves
as sensitive or nervous as well as in those whose sexual development
was very late in many cases there is marked hyperesthesia or irritable
weakness hyperesthesia simulates strength and while there can be little
doubt that some sexual inverts and more especially bisexuals do possess
unusual sexual energy in others it is but apparent the frequent
repetition of seminal emissions for example may be the result of
weakness as well as of strength it must be added that this irritability
of the sexual centers is in a considerable proportion of inverts
associated with marked emotional tendencies to affection and
selfsacrifice in the extravagance of his affection and devotion it has
been frequently observed the male invert resembles many normal women
suggestion and other exciting causes of inversionin 18 of my cases it
is possible that some event or special environment in early life had
more or less influence in turning the sexual instinct into homosexual
channels or in calling out a latent inversion in 3 cases a
disappointment in normal love seems to have produced a profound nervous
and emotional shock acting as we seem bound to admit on a predisposed
organism and developing a fairly permanent tendency to inversion in 8
cases there was seduction by an older person but in at least 4 or 5 of
these there was already a wellmarked predisposition in at least 8 other
cases example usually at school may probably be regarded as having
exerted some influence it is noteworthy that in very few of my cases can
we trace the influence of any definite suggestion as asserted by
schrencknotzing who believes that in the causation of sexual inversion
as undoubtedly in the causation of erotic fetichism we must give the
first place to accidental factors of education and external influence
he records the case of a little boy who innocently gazed in curiosity at
the penis of his father who was urinating and had his ears boxed whence
arose a train of thought and feeling which resulted in complete sexual
inversion in two of the cases i have reported we have parallel incidents
and here we see clearly that the homosexual tendency already existed i do
not question the occurrence of such incidents but i refuse to accept them
as supplying the causation of inversion and in so doing i am supported by
all the evidence i am able to obtain i am in agreement with a
correspondent who wrote
    considering that all boys are exposed to the same order of
    suggestions sight of a mans naked organs sleeping with a man
    being handled by a man and that only a few of them become
    sexually perverted i think it reasonable to conclude that those
    few were previously constituted to receive the suggestion in
    fact suggestion seems to play exactly the same part in the
    normal and abnormal awakening of sex
i would go so far as to assert that for normal boys and girls the
developed sexual organs of the adult man or womanfrom their size
hairiness and the mystery which envelops themnearly always exert a
certain fascination whether of attraction or horror187 but this has no
connection with homosexuality and scarcely with sexuality at all thus
in one case known to me a boy of 6 or 7 took pleasure in caressing the
organs of another boy twice his own age who remained passive and
indifferent yet this child grew up without ever manifesting any
homosexual instinct the seed of suggestion can only develop when it falls
on a suitable soil if it is to act on a fairly normal nature the
perverted suggestion must be very powerful or iterated and even then its
influence will probably only be temporary disappearing in the presence of
the normal stimulus188
not only is suggestion unnecessary to develop a sexual impulse already
rooted in the organism but when exerted in an opposite direction it is
powerless to divert that impulse we see this illustrated in several of
the cases whose histories i have presented thus in one case a boy was
seduced by the housemaid at the age of 14 and even derived pleasure from
the girl yet none the less the native homosexual instinct asserted itself
a year later in another case heterosexual suggestions were offered and
accepted in early life yet notwithstanding the homosexual attraction
was slowly evolved from within
i have therefore but little to say of the influence of suggestion which
was formerly exalted to a position of the first importance in books on
sexual inversion this is not because i underestimate the great part
played by suggestion in many fields of normal and abnormal life it is
because i have been able to find but few decided traces of it in sexual
inversion in many cases doubtless there may be some slight elements of
suggestion in developing the inversion though they cannot be traced189
their importance seems usually questionable even when they are
discovered take schrencknotzings case of the little boy whose ears were
boxed for what his father considered improper curiosity i find it
difficult to realize that a mighty suggestion can thereby be generated
unless a strong emotion exists for it to unite with in that case the seed
falls on prepared soil is the wide prevalence of normal sexuality due to
the fact that so many little boys have had their ears boxed for taking
naughty liberties with women if so i am quite prepared to accept
schrencknotzings explanation as a complete account of the matter i know
of one case indeed in which an element of what may fairly be called
suggestion can be detected it is that of a physician who had always been
on very friendly terms with men but had sexual relations exclusively with
women finding fair satisfaction until the confessions of an inverted
patient one day came to him as a revelation thereafter he adopted
inverted practices and ceased to find any attraction in women but even in
this case as i understand the matter suggestion merely served to reveal
his own nature to the man for a physician to adopt the perverted habits
which the visit of a chance patient suggests to him can scarcely be a
phenomenon of pure suggestion we have no reason to suppose that this
physician practised every perversion he heard of from patients he adopted
that which fitted his own nature190 in another case homosexual advances
were made to a youth and accepted but he had already been attracted to
men in childhood again in another case there were homosexual
influences in the boyhood of a subject who became bisexual but as the
subjects father was of similar bisexual temperament we can attach no
potency to the mere suggestions in another case we find homosexual
influence in childhood but the child was already delicate shy nervous
and feminine clearly possessing a temperament predestined to develop in a
homosexual direction
    the irresistible potency of the inner impulse is well illustrated
    in a case presented by hirschfeld and burchard my daughter
    erna said the subjects mother showed boyish inclinations at
    the age of 3 and they increased from year to year she never
    played with dolls only with tin soldiers guns and castles she
    would climb trees and jump ditches she made friends with the
    drivers of all the carts that came to our house and they would
    place her on the horses back the annual circus was a joy to her
    for all the year even as a child of 4 she was so fearless on
    horseback that lookerson shouted bravo and all declared she was
    a born horsewoman it was her greatest wish to be a boy she
    would wear her elder brothers clothes all day notwithstanding
    her grandmothers indignation cycling gymnastics boating
    swimming were her passion and she showed skill in them as she
    grew older she hated prettily adorned hats and clothes i had
    much trouble with her for she would not wear pretty things the
    older she grew the more her masculine and decided ways developed
    this excited much outcry and offence people found my daughter
    unfeminine and disagreeable but all my trouble and exhortations
    availed nothing to change her now this young woman whom all the
    influences of a normal feminine environment failed to render
    feminine was not physiologically a woman at all the case proved
    to be the unique instance of an individual possessing all the
    external characteristics of a woman combined with internal
    testicular tissue capable of emitting true masculine semen

i may here quote three american cases not previously published for
which i am indebted to prof g frank lydston of chicago they seem to me
to illustrate the only kind of suggestions which play much part in the
evolution of inversion i give them in dr lydstons words
    case ia man 45 years of age attracted by the allusion to my
    essay on social perversion contained in the english translation
    of krafftebings psychopathia sexualis consulted me regarding
    the possible cure of his condition this individual was a finely
    educated very intelligent man who was an excellent linguist
    had considerable musical ability and was in the employ of a firm
    whose business was such as to demand on the part of its employs
    considerable legal acumen clerical ability and knowledge of
    realestate transactions this man stated that at the age of
    puberty without any knowledge of perversity of sexual feeling
    he was thrown intimately in contact with males of more advanced
    years who took various means to excite his sexual passions the
    result being that perverted sexual practices were developed
    which were continued for a number of years he thereafter noticed
    an aversion to women at the solicitations of his family he
    finally married without any very intelligent idea as to what if
    anything might be expected of him in the marital relation
    absolute impotenceindeed repugnance for association with his
    wifewas the lamentable sequence a divorce was in contemplation
    when fortunately for all parties concerned the wife suddenly
    died being a man of more than ordinary intelligence this
    individual prior to seeking my aid had sought vainly for some
    remedy for his unfortunate condition he stated that he believed
    there was an element of heredity in his case his father having
    been a dipsomaniac and one brother having died insane he
    nevertheless stated it to be his opinion that notwithstanding
    the hereditary taint he would have been perfectly normal from a
    sexual standpoint had it not been for acquired impressions at or
    about the period of puberty this man presented a typically
    neurotic type of physique complained of being intensely
    nervous was prematurely gray of only fair stature and had an
    uncontrollable nystagmus which he said had existed for some
    fifteen years as might be expected treatment in this case was
    of no avail i began the use of hypnotic suggestion at the hands
    of an expert professional hypnotist the patient being called
    out of the state finally gave up treatment and i have no means
    of knowing what his present condition is
    case iia lady patient of mine who happened to be an actress
    and consequently a woman of the world brought to me for an
    opinion some correspondence which had passed between her younger
    brother and a man living in another state with whom he was on
    quite intimate terms in one of these letters various flying
    trips to chicago for the purpose of meeting the lad who by the
    way was only 17 years of age were alluded to it transpired
    also as evidenced by the letters that on several occasions the
    young lad had been taken on trips in pullman cars by his friend
    who was a prominent railroad official the character of the
    correspondence was such as the average healthy man would address
    to a woman with whom he was enamored it seemed that the author
    of the correspondence had applied to his boy affinity the name
    cinderella and the protestations of passionate affection that
    were made toward cinderella certainly would have satisfied the
    most exacting woman the young lad subsequently made a confession
    to me and i put myself in correspondence with his male friend
    with the result that he called upon me and i obtained a full
    history of the case the method of indulgence in this case was
    the usual one of oral masturbation in which the lad was the
    passive party i was unable to obtain any definite data regarding
    the family history of the elder individual in this case but
    understand that there was a taint of insanity in his family he
    himself was a robust finelooking man above middle age who was
    well educated and very intelligent as he necessarily must have
    been because of the prominent position he held with an important
    railway company i will state as a matter of interest that the
    lad in this case who is now 23 years of age has recently
    consulted me for impotentia coundi manifesting a frigidity
    for women and from the young mans statements i am convinced
    that he is well on the road to confirmed sexual perversion
    an interesting point in this connection is that the young mans
    sister the actress already alluded to has recently had an
    attack of acute mania
    i have had other unpublished cases that might be of interest but
    these two are somewhat classical and typify to a greater or less
    degree the majority of other cases i will however mention one
    other case occurring in a woman
    case iiia married woman 40 years of age has been deserted by
    her husband because of her perverted sexuality neurotic history
    on both sides of the family and several cases of insanity on
    mothers side in this case affinity for the same sex and
    perverted desire for the opposite sex existed a combination by
    no means infrequent hypnotic suggestion tried but without
    success cause was evidently suggestion and example on the part
    of another female pervert with whom she associated before her
    marriage marriage was late at age of 35 in all these cases
    there was an element of what may be called suggestion but it was
    really much more than this it was probably in each case active
    seduction by an elder person of a predisposed younger person it
    will be observed that in each case there was at the least an
    organic neurotic basis for suggestion and seduction to work on i
    cannot regard these cases as entitled to modify our attitude
    toward suggestion
masturbationmoreau believed that masturbation was a cause of sexual
inversion and krafftebing looked upon it as leading to all sorts of
sexual perversions the same opinion was currently repeated by many
writers it is not now accepted moll emphatically rejected the idea that
masturbation can be the cause of inversion ncke repeatedly denies that
masturbation any more than seduction can ever produce true inversion
hirschfeld attaches to it no etiological significance many years ago i
gave special attention to this point and reached a similar conclusion
that masturbation especially at an early age may sometimes enfeeble the
sexual activities and aid the manifestations of inversion i certainly
believe but beyond this there is little in the history of my male cases
to indicate masturbation as a cause of inversion it is true that 44 out
of 51 admit that they have practised masturbationat all events
occasionally or at some period in their livesand it is possible that
this proportion is larger than that found among normal people even if so
however it is not difficult to account for bearing in mind the fact that
the homosexual person has not the same opportunities as has the
heterosexual person to gratify his instincts and that masturbation may
sometimes legitimately appear to him as the lesser of two evils191 not
only has masturbation been practised at no period in at least 7 of the
cases for concerning several i have no information but in several
others it was never practised until long after the homosexual instinct had
appeared in 1 case not till the age of 40 and then only occasionally in
at least 8 it was only practised at puberty in at least 8 however it
began before the age of puberty at least 9 left off before about the age
of 20 unfortunately as yet we have little definite evidence as to the
prevalence and extent of masturbation among normal individuals
among the women masturbation is found in at least 5 cases out of 7 in 1
case there was no masturbation until comparatively late in life and then
only at rare intervals and under exceptional circumstances in another
case some years after the homosexual attraction had been experienced it
was practised though not in excess from the age of puberty for about
four years and then abandoned during these years the physical sexual
feelings were more imperative than they were afterward felt to be in 2
cases masturbation was learned spontaneously soon after puberty and in 1
of these practised in excess before the manifestations of inversion became
definite in all cases the subjects are emphatic in asserting that this
practice neither led to nor was caused by the homosexual attraction
which they regard as a much higher feeling and it must be added that the
occasional practice of masturbation is very far from rare among fairly
normal women192
while this is so i am certainly inclined to believe that an early and
excessive indulgence in masturbation though not an adequate cause is a
favoring condition for the development of inversion and that this is
especially so in women the sexual precocity indicated by early and
excessive masturbation doubtless sometimes reveals an organism already
predisposed to homosexuality but apart from this when masturbation
arises spontaneously at an early age on a purely physical basis it seems
to tend to produce a divorce between the physical and the psychic aspects
of sexual love the sexual manifestations are all diverted into this
physical direction and the child is ignorant that such phenomena are
normally allied to love then when a more spiritual attraction appears
with adolescent development this divorce is perpetuated instead of the
physical and psychic feelings appearing together when the age for sexual
attraction comes the physical feelings are prematurely twisted from their
natural end and it becomes abnormally easy for a person of the same sex
to step in and take the place rightfully belonging to a person of the
opposite sex this has certainly seemed to me the course of events in some
cases i have observed
attitude toward the opposite sexin 17 cases of whom 5 are married and
others purposing to marry there is sexual attraction to both sexes a
condition formerly called psychosexual hermaphroditism but now more
usually bisexuality in such cases although there is pleasure and
satisfaction in relationships with both sexes there is usually a greater
degree of satisfaction in connection with one sex most of the bisexual
prefer their own sex it is curiously rare to find a person whether man
or woman who by choice exercises relationships with both sexes and
prefers the opposite sex this would seem to indicate that the bisexual
may really be inverts
in any case bisexuality merges imperceptibly into simple inversion in at
least 16 of 52 cases of simple inversion in men there has been connection
with women in some instances only once or twice in others during several
years but it was always with an effort or from a sense of duty and
anxiety to be normal they never experienced any real pleasure in the act
or sense of satisfaction after it four of these cases are married but
martial relationships usually ceased after a few years at least four
others were attracted to women when younger but are not now another once
felt sexually attracted to a boyish woman but never made any attempt to
obtain any relationships with her 3 or 4 others again have tried to
have connection with women but failed the largest proportion of my cases
have never had any sexual intimacy with the opposite sex193 and some of
these experience what in the case of the male invert is sometimes
called horror femin but while woman as an object of sexual desire is
in such cases disgusting to them and it is usually difficult for a
genuine invert to have connection with a woman except by setting up images
of his own sex for the most part inverts are capable of genuine
friendships irrespective of sex
it is perhaps not difficult to account for the horrormuch stronger
than that normally felt toward a person of the same sexwith which the
invert often regards the sexual organs of persons of the opposite sex it
cannot be said that the sexual organs of either sex under the influence of
sexual excitement are esthetically pleasing they only become emotionally
desirable through the parallel excitement of the beholder when the
absence of parallel excitement is accompanied in the beholder by the sense
of unfamiliarity as in childhood or by a neurotic hypersensitiveness the
conditions are present for the production of intense horror femin or
horror masculis as the case may be it is possible that as otto rank
argues in his interesting study die naktheit im sage und dichtung this
horror of the sexual organs of the opposite sex to some extent felt even
by normal people is embodied in the melusine type of legend194
erotic dreamsour dreams follow as a general rule the impulses that
stir our waking psychic life the normal man or woman in sexual vigor
dreams of loving a person of the opposite sex the inverted man dreams of
loving a man the inverted woman of loving a woman195 dreams thus have
a certain value in diagnosis more especially since there is less
unwillingness to confess to a perverted dream than to a perverted action
ulrichs first referred to the significance of the dreams of inverts at a
later period moll pointed out that they have some value in diagnosis when
we are not sure how far the inverted tendency is radical then ncke
repeatedly emphasized the importance of dreams as constituting he
believed the most delicate test we possess in the diagnosis of
homosexuality196 this was an exaggerated view which failed to take into
account the various influences which may deflect dreams hirschfeld has
made the most extensive investigation on this point and found that among
100 inverts 87 had exclusively homosexual dreams while most of the rest
had no dreams at all197 among my cases only 4 definitely state that
there are no erotic dreams while 31 acknowledge that the dreams are
concerned more or less with persons of the same sex of these at least 16
assert or imply that their dreams are exclusively of the same sex two
though apparently inverted congenitally have had erotic dreams of women
in one case more frequently than of men these two exceptions have no
apparent explanation another appears to have sexual dreams of a nightmare
character in which women appear in another case there were always at
first dreams of women but this subject had sometimes had connection with
prostitutes and is not absolutely indifferent to women while another
whose dreams remain heterosexual had in early life some attraction to
girls in the cases of distinct bisexuality there is no unanimity 2 dream
of their own sex 2 dream of both sexes 1 usually dreams of the opposite
sex and 1 man while dreaming of both dislikes those dreams in which
women figure in at least 3 cases dreams of a sexual character began at
the age of 8 or earlier
    the phenomena presented by erotic dreams alike in normal and
    abnormal persons are somewhat complex and dreams are by no
    means a sure guide to the dreamers real sexual attitude the
    fluctuations of dream imagery may be illustrated by the
    experiences of one of my subjects who thus indirectly summarises
    his own experiences when he was quite a child he used to be
    haunted by gross and grotesque dreams of naked adult men which
    must have been erotic at the age of puberty he dreamed in two
    ways but always about males one species of vision was highly
    idealistic a radiant and lovely young mans face with floating
    hair appeared to him on a background of dim shadows the other
    was obscene being generally the sight of a grooms or carters
    genitals in a state of violent erection he never dreamed
    erotically or sentimentally about women but when the dream was
    frightful the terrormaking personage was invariably female in
    ordinary dreams women of his family or acquaintance played a
    trivial part at the age of 24 having determined to conquer his
    homosexual passions he married found no difficulty in
    cohabiting with his wife and begat several children although he
    took but little passionate delight in the sexual act he still
    continued to dream exclusively of men for several years and the
    obscene visions became more frequent than the idealistic
    gradually coarse and uninteresting erotic dreams of women began
    to haunt his mind in sleep a curious particular regarding the
    new type of vision was that he never dreamed of whole females
    only of their sexual parts seen in a blur and the seminal
    emissions which attended the mental pictures left a feeling of
    fatigue and disgust in course of time his wife and he agreed to
    live separately so far as sexual relations are concerned he then
    indulged his passion for males and wholly lost those rudimentary
    female dreams which had been developed during the period of
    nuptial cohabitation
    not only is it possible for the genuine invert to be trained into
    heterosexual erotic dreams but homosexual dreams may
    occasionally be experienced by persons who are and always have
    been exclusively heterosexual i could bring forward much
    evidence on this point cf autoerotism in vol i of these
    studies both men and women who have always been of pronounced
    heterosexual tendency without a trace of inversion are liable
    to rare homosexual dreams not necessarily involving orgasm or
    even definite sexual excitement and sometimes accompanied by a
    feeling of repugnance as an example i may present a dream which
    had no known origin of an exclusively heterosexual lady aged 42
    she dreamed she was in bed with another woman unknown to her
    and lying on her own stomach while with her right hand stretched
    out she was feeling the others sexual parts she could
    distinctly perceive the clitoris vagina etc she felt a sort
    of disgust with herself for what she was doing but continued
    until she awoke she then found herself lying on her stomach as
    in the dream and at first thought she must have been touching
    herself but realized that this could not have been the case
    niceforo who believes that inversion may develop out of
    masturbation considers that dreams of masturbation by
    association of ideas may take on an inverted character le
    psicopatie sessuale 1897 pp 35 69 this however must be
    rare and will not account for most of the dreams in question
    ncke and colin scott some years ago independently referred to
    cases in which normal persons were liable to homosexual dreams
    and fr revue de mdecine dec 1898 referred to a man who
    had a horror of women but appeared only to manifest
    homosexuality in his dreams ncke archiv fr
    kriminalanthropologie 1907 heft i 2 calls dreams which
    represent a reaction of opposition to the dreamers ordinary life
    contrast dreams hirschfeld who accepts nckes contrast
    dreams in relation to homosexuality considers that they
    indicate a latent bisexuality we may admit this is so in the
    same sense in which a complementary color image called up by
    another color indicates the possibility of perceiving that color
    in most cases however it seems to me that homosexual dreams in
    normal persons may be simply explained as due to the ordinary
    confusion and transition of dream imagery see ellis the world
    of dreams especially ch ii
methods of sexual relationshipthe exact mode in which an inverted
instinct finds satisfaction is frequently of importance from the
medicolegal standpoint198 from a psychological standpoint it is of
minor significance being chiefly of interest as showing the degree to
which the individual has departed from the instinctive feelings of his
normal fellowbeings
taking 57 inverted men of whom i have definite knowledge i find that 12
restrained by moral or other considerations have never had any physical
relationship with their own sex in some 22 cases the sexual relationship
rarely goes beyond close physical contact and fondling or at most mutual
masturbation and intercrural intercourse in 10 or 11 cases fellatio
oral excitationfrequently in addition to some form of mutual
masturbation and usually though not always as the active agencyis the
form preferred in 14 cases actual pedicatio199usually active not
passivehas been exercised in these cases however pedicatio is by no
means always the habitual or even the preferred method of gratification
it seems to be the preferred method in about 7 cases several who have
never experienced it including some who have never practised any form of
physical relationship state that they feel no objection to pedicatio
some have this feeling in regard to active others in regard to passive
pedicatio the proportion of inverts who practise or have at some time
experienced pedicatio thus revealed nearly 25 per cent is large in
germany hirschfeld finds it to be only 8 per cent and merzbach only 6 i
believe however that a wider induction from a larger number of english
and american cases would yield a proportion much nearer to that found in
germany200
pseudosexual attractionit is sometimes supposed that in homosexual
relationships one person is always active physically and emotionally the
other passive between men at all events this is very frequently not the
case and the invert cannot tell if he feels like a man or like a woman
thus one writes
    in bed with my friend i feel as he feels and he feels as i
    feel the result is masturbation and nothing more or desire for
    more on my part i get it over too as soon as possible in
    order to come to the bestsleeping arms round each other or
    talking so
it remains true however that there may usually be traced what it is
possible to call pseudosexual attraction by which i mean a tendency for
the invert to be attracted toward persons unlike himself so that in his
sexual relationships there is a certain semblance of sexual opposition
numa praetorius considers that in homosexuality the attraction of
oppositesthe attraction for soldiers and other primitive vigorous
typesplays a greater part than among normal lovers201 this
pseudosexual attraction is however as hirschfeld points out202 and as
we see by the histories here presented by no means invariable
    mn writes to me it appears that the female element must of
    necessity exist in the body that desires the male and that
    nature keeps her law in the spirit though she breaks it in the
    form the rest is all a matter of individual temperament and
    environment the female nature of the invert hampered though it
    is by its disguise of flesh is still able to exert an
    extraordinary influence and calls insistently upon the male
    this influence seems called into action most violently in the
    presence of males possessed of strong sexual magnetism of their
    own such men are generally more or less conscious of the
    influence and the result is either a vague appreciation which
    will make the male wonder why he gets on so well with the invert
    or else the influence will be realized to be something
    incongruous and unnatural and will be resented accordingly
    sometimes indeed the reciprocated feeling circumstance and
    opportunity permitting will prove strong enough to induce sexual
    relations reason will then generally overpower instinct and the
    feeling aroused unaware will probably be changed into
    repulsion further the influence reacts in the same way on
    women who particularly if they are strongly sexual experience
    involuntary sensations of dislike or antagonism on association
    with inverts there is however one terrible reality for the
    invert to face no matter how much he may wish to avoid it and
    seek to deceive himself there exists for him an almost absolute
    lack of any genuine satisfaction either in the way of the
    affections or desires his whole life is passed in vainly seeking
    and desiring the male the antithesis of his nature and in
    consorting with inverts he must perforce be content with the male
    in form only the shadow without the substance indeed one
    invert necessarily regards another as being of the same undesired
    female sex as himself and for this reason it will be found that
    while friendships between inverts frequently exist and these are
    characteristically feminine unstable and liable to betrayal
    loveattachments are less common and when they occur must
    naturally be based upon considerable selfdeception venal
    gratifications are always of course as possible as they are
    unsatisfactory and here perhaps some of the peculiarities of
    taste accompanying inversion may admit of elucidation in
    considering the peculiar predilection shown by inverts for youths
    of inferior social position for the wearers of uniforms and for
    extreme physical development and virility not necessarily
    accompanied by intellectuality regard must be had to the
    probable conduct of women placed in a position of complete
    irresponsibility combined with absolute freedom of action and
    every opportunity for promiscuity it seems to me that the
    importance of recognizing the underlying female element in
    inversion cannot be too strongly insisted upon
    the majority of inverts writes z differ in no detail of
    their outward appearance their physique or their dress from
    normal men they are athletic masculine in habit frank in
    manner passing through society year after year without arousing
    a suspicion of their inner temperament were it not so society
    would long ago have had its eyes opened to the amount of
    perverted sexuality it harbors these lines were written not in
    opposition to the more subtle distinctions pointed out above but
    in refutation of the vulgar error which confuses the typical
    invert with the painted and petticoated creatures who appear in
    policecourts from time to time and whose portraits are
    presented by lombroso legludic etc on another occasion the
    same writer remarked while expressing general agreement with the
    idea of a pseudosexual attraction the liaison is by no means
    always sought and begun by the person who is abnormally
    constituted i mean that i can cite cases of decided males who
    have made up to inverts and have found their happiness in the
    reciprocated passion one pronounced male of this sort again
    once said to me men are so much more affectionate than women
    precisely the same words were used by one of my subjects also
    the liaison springs up now and then quite accidentally through
    juxtaposition when it is difficult to say whether either at the
    outset had an inverted tendency of any marked quality in these
    cases the sexual relation seems to come on as a heightening of
    comradely affection and is found to be pleasurablesometimes i
    think discovered to be safe as well as satisfying on the other
    hand so far as i know it is extremely rare to observe a
    permanent liaison between two pronounced inverts
    the tendency to pseudosexual attraction in the homosexual would
    thus seem to involve a preference for normal persons how far
    this is the case it seems difficult to state positively usually
    one may say an invert falls in love exactly as in the case of a
    normal person without any intellectual calculation as to the
    temperamental ability to return the affection which the object of
    his love may possess naturally however there cannot be any
    adequate return of the affection in the absence of an actual or
    latent homosexual disposition on this point an american
    correspondent hc with a wide knowledge of inversion in many
    lands writes one of your correspondents declares that inverts
    long for sexual relations with normal men rather than with one
    another if this be true i have never once found it exemplified
    in all my wide experience of inverts and i have submitted his
    assertion to more than 50 these have replied invariably that
    unless a man is himself homosexual nearly all the pleasure of
    fellatio is absent the fact is the majority of inverts flock
    together not from exigency but from choice the mere sexual act
    is if anything far less the sole object between inverts than it
    is between normal men and women why should the invert sigh for
    intercourse with normal men where mutual confidences and
    sympathies and love would be out of the question personally i
    decline to commit fellatio with a man who is given to women
    the thought of it is repugnant to me and this is the attitude
    with every invert i have questioned the nearest approach to
    confirmation of your correspondents theory has been when an
    extremely feminine invert here and there has admitted the wish
    that a certain normal man were inverted indeed the
    temperamental gamut of inversion is itself broad enough to
    embrace the most widely divergent ideals as my furthestreaching
    demands attain fruition in the gentle and pretty boy so his own
    robuster affinity resides in me if inverts were actually women
    then indeed the normal male would be their ideal but inverts are
    not women inverts are males capable of passionate friendship
    and their ideal is the male who will give them passionate
    friendship in return
in at least 24 probably many more of my male cases there is a marked
contrast and in a still larger number a lessmarked contrast between the
subject and the individuals he is attracted to either he is of somewhat
feminine and sensitive nature and admires more simple and virile natures
or he is fairly vigorous and admires boys who are often of lower social
class inverted women also are attracted to more clinging feminine
persons203 a sexual attraction for boys is no doubt as moll points
out that form of inversion which comes nearest to normal sexuality for
the subject of it usually approaches nearer to the average man in physical
and mental disposition the reason of this is obvious boys resemble
women and therefore it requires a less profound organic twist to become
sexually attracted to them anyone who has watched private theatricals in
boys schools will have observed how easy it is for boys to personate
women successfully and it is well known that until the middle of the
seventeenth century womens parts on the stage were always taken by boys
whether or not with injury to their own or other peoples morals204 it
is also worthy of note that in greece where homosexuality flourished so
extensively and apparently with so little accompaniment of neurotic
degeneration it was often held that only boys under 18 should be loved
so that the love of boys merged into love of women about 18 of my cases
are most strongly attracted to youthspreferably of about the age of 18
to 20and they are for the most part among the more normal and healthy
of the cases a preference for older men or else a considerable degree of
indifference to age alone is more common and perhaps indicates a deeper
degree of perversion
putting aside the age of the object desired it must be said that there is
a distinctly general though not universal tendency for sexual inverts to
approach the feminine type either in psychic disposition or physical
constitution or both205 i cannot say how far this is explained by the
irritable nervous system and delicate health which are so often associated
with inversion though this is certainly an important factor although the
invert himself may stoutly affirm his masculinity and although this
femininity may not be very obvious its wide prevalence may be asserted
with considerable assurance and by no means only among the small minority
of inverts who take an exclusively passive rle though in these it is
usually most marked in this i am confirmed by q who writes in all or
certainly almost all the cases of congenital male inverts excluding
psychosexual hermaphrodites that i know there has been a remarkable
sensitiveness and delicacy of sentiment sympathy and an intuitive habit
of mind such as we generally associate with the feminine sex even though
the body might be quite masculine in its form and habit206 when
however a distinguished invert said to moll we are all women that we
do not deny he put the matter in too extreme a form the feminine traits
of the homosexual are not usually of a conspicuous character i believe
that inverts of plainly feminine nature are rare exceptions wrote
ncke207 and that statement may be accepted even by those who emphasize
the prevalence of feminine traits among inverts
in inverted women some degree of masculinity or boyishness is equally
prevalent and it is not usually found in the women to whom they are
attracted even in inversion the need for a certain sexual oppositionthe
longing for something which the lover himself does not possessstill
prevails it expresses itself sometimes in an attraction between persons
of different race and color i am told that in american prisons for women
lesbian relationships are specially frequent between white and black
women208 a similar affinity is found among the arabs says kocher and
if an arab woman has a lesbian friend the latter is usually european in
cochin china too according to lorion while the chinese are chiefly
active pederasts the annamites are chiefly passive
it must however be remembered that in normal love homogamy the
attraction of the like prevails over heterogamy the attraction of the
unlike which is chiefly confined to those features which belong to the
sphere of the secondary sexual characters209 the same appears to be
true in inversion and the homosexual are probably on the whole more
attracted by the traits which they seem to themselves to possess than by
those which are foreign to themselves210
physical abnormalitiesthe circumstances under which many of my cases
were investigated often made information under this head difficult to
obtain or to verify in at least 4 cases the penis is very large while
in at least 3 it is small and undeveloped with small and flabby testes
it seems probable that variations in these two directions are both common
but it is doubtful whether they possess as much significance as the
tendency to infantilism of the sexual organs in inverted women seems to
possess hirschfeld considers that the genital organs of inverts resemble
those of normal people he finds however that phimosis is rather
common211
more significant perhaps than specifically genital peculiarities are the
deviations found in the general conformation of the body212 in at
least 2 cases there are welldeveloped breasts in 1 the breasts swelling
and becoming red213 in 1 case there are menstrual phenomena physical
and psychic recurring every four weeks in several cases the hips are
broad and the arms rounded while some are skillful in throwing a ball
one was born with a double squint at least 2 were 7 months children in
the previous chapter i have referred to the tendency to hypertrichosis and
occasionally oligotrichosis among inverted women among the men it is the
latter condition which seems more common and in several cases the bodies
are hairless or with but scanty hair a few are lefthanded though not
perhaps an abnormal proportion214 the sexual characters of the
handwriting are in some cases clearly inverted the men writing a feminine
hand and the women a masculine hand215 a high feminine voice is
sometimes found216
a marked characteristic of many inverts though one not easy of precise
definition is their youthfulness of appearance and frequently childlike
faces equally in both sexes this has often been remarked217 and is
pronounced among many of my subjects
the frequent inability of male inverts to whistle was first pointed out by
ulrichs and hirschfeld has found it in 23 per cent many of my cases
confess to this inability while some of the women inverts can whistle
admirably although this inability of male inverts is only found among a
minority i am quite satisfied that it is well marked among a considerable
minority one of my correspondents mn writes to me with regard to
the general inability of inverts to whistle i am not able to do so
myself their fondness for green my favorite color their feminine
caligraphy skill at female occupations etc these all seem to me but
indications of the one principle to go still farther and include trivial
things few inverts even smoke in the same manner and with the same
enjoyment as a man they have seldom the male facility at games cannot
throw at a mark with precision or even spit
nearly all these peculiarities indicate a minor degree of nervous
disturbance and lead to modification as my correspondent points out in a
feminine direction it is scarcely necessary to add that they by no means
necessarily imply inversion shelley for instance was unable to whistle
though he never gave an indication of inversion but he was a person of
somewhat abnormal and feminine organization and he illustrates the
tendency of these apparently very insignificant functional anomalies to be
correlated with other and more important psychic anomalies
the greater part of these various anatomical peculiarities and functional
anomalies point more or less clearly to the prevalence among inverts of
a tendency to infantilism combined with feminism in men and masculinism
in women218 this tendency is denied by hirschfeld but it is often
well indicated among the subjects whose histories i have been able to
present and is indeed suggested by hirschfelds own elaborate results so
that it can scarcely be passed over i regard it as highly significant
and it is in harmony with all that we are learning to know regarding the
important part played by the internal secretions alike in inversion and
the general bodily modifications in an infantile feminine and masculine
direction
if we are justified in believing that there is a tendency for inverted
persons to be somewhat arrested in development approaching the child
type we may connect this fact with the sexual precocity sometimes marked
in inverts for precocity is commonly accompanied by rapid arrest of
development
    a correspondent who is himself inverted furnishes the following
    notes of cases he is well acquainted with i quote them here as
    they illustrate the anomalies commonly found
    1 a male eldest child of typically neurotic family three
    children in all 2 male and 1 female the other 2 are somewhat
    eccentric unsocial and sexually frigid 1 in a marked degree
    the curious point about this case is that a the only one of the
    family possessed of mental ability and social qualifications
    should be inverted parents marriage was very illassorted and
    inharmonious the father being of great stature and the mother
    abnormally small and of highly nervous temperament both of
    feeble health ancestry unfortunate especially on mothers side
    2 b male invert younger of 2 sons no other children has
    extremely feminine disposition and appearance of considerable
    personal attraction and has great musical talent penis very
    small and marked breastdevelopment
    3 c male invert younger of 2 sons no other children
    interval of six years between first and second son parents
    marriage one of great affection but degenerate ancestry on
    mothers side cancer and scrofula in family
    4 d male invert second child of 6 remainder girls of
    humble social position considerable depravity evinced by all the
    members of this family with the exception of d who alone
    proved steady honest and industrious
    5 e male invert second son of family of 3 the youngest
    child being a girl stillborn of extreme neurotic temperament
    fostered by upbringing effeminate in build and disposition
    musically gifted
    6 f male invert second child of family of 5 eldest child a
    girl died in youth after f a boy g a girl h and another
    girl stillborn parents badly matched mother of considerable
    mental and physical strength father last representative of
    moribund stock the result of intermarriage children all
    resembling father in appearance and mother in disposition
    drinktendency in both boys to which fs death at the age of 30
    was mainly due g committed suicide some years later the girl
    h married into a family with worse ancestry than her own has
    two children
    7 i and j boy and girl both inverted as far as i am able to
    judge the boy was born with some deformity of the feet and
    ankles is of effeminate tastes and appearance boy resembles
    mother and girl who is of great physical development resembles
    father
    the same correspondent adds
    i have noticed little abnormal with regard to the genital
    formation of inverts there are however frequent abnormalities
    of proportion in their figures the hands and feet being
    noticeably smaller and more shapely the waist more marked the
    body softer and less muscular almost invariably there is either
    cranial malformation or the head approaches the feminine in type
    and shape
artistic and other aptitudesall avocations are represented among
inverts among the subjects here dealt with are found at one end of the
scale numerous manual workers and at the other end an equal number
sometimes of aristocratic family who exercise no profession at all there
are 12 physicians 9 men of letters at least 7 are engaged in commercial
life 6 are artists architects or composers 4 are or have been actors
these figures cannot give any clue to the relative extent of inversion in
various occupations but they indicate that no class of occupation
furnishes a safeguard against inversion
there are however certain avocations to which inverts seem especially
called219 one of the chief of these is literature the apparent
predominance of physicians is easily explicable the frequency with which
literature is represented is probably more genuine here indeed inverts
seem to find the highest degree of success and reputation at least half a
dozen of my subjects are successful men of letters and i could easily
add others by going outside the group of histories included in this study
they especially cultivate those regions of belleslettres which lie on
the borderland between prose and verse though they do not usually attain
much eminence in poetry they are often very accomplished writers of
verse they may be attracted to history but rarely attempt tasks of great
magnitude involving much patient labor though to this rule there are
exceptions pure science seems to have relatively little attraction for
the homosexual220
an examination of my histories reveals the interesting fact that 45 of the
subjects or in the proportion of 56 per cent possess artistic aptitudes
of varying degree galton found from the investigation of nearly 1000
persons that the average showing artistic tastes in england was only
about 30 per cent it must also be said that my figures are probably below
the truth as no special point was made of investigating the matter and
also that in some cases the artistic ability is of high order
    it is suggested that adlers theory of
    minderwertigkeitaccording to which we react strenuously
    against our congenital organic defects and fortify them into
    virtuesmay be applied to the inverts acquirement of artistic
    abilities g rosenstein die theorien der organminderwertigkeit
    und die bisexualitt jahrbuch fr psychoanalytische
    forschungen vol ii 1910 p 398 this theory is in some
    cases of valuable application but it seems doubtful to me
    whether it is very profitable in the present connection the
    artistic aptitudes of inverts may better be regarded as part of
    their organic tendencies than as a reaction against those
    tendencies in this connection i may quote the remarks of an
    american correspondent himself homosexual regarding the
    connection between inversion and artistic capacity so far as i
    can see the temperament of every invert seems to strive to find
    artistic expressioncrudely or otherwise inverts as a rule
    seek the paths of life that lie in pleasant places their
    resistance to opposing obstacles is elastic their work is never
    strenuous if they can help it and their accomplishments hardly
    ever of practical use this is all true of the born artist as
    well both inverts and artists are inordinately fond of praise
    both yearn for a life where admiration is the reward for little
    energy in a word they seem to be born tired begotten by
    parents who were tired too
    hirschfeld die homosexualitt p 66 gives a list of pictures
    and sculptures which specially appeal to the homosexual
    prominent among them are representations of st sebastian
    gainsboroughs blue boy vandycks youthful men the hermes of
    praxiteles michelangelos slave rodins and meuniers
    workingmen types
    as regards music my cases reveal the aptitude which has been
    remarked by others as peculiarly common among inverts it has
    been extravagantly said that all musicians are inverts it is
    certain that various famous musicians among the dead and the
    living have been homosexual ingegnieros speaks of a
    genitomusical synsthesia analogous to colorhearing in this
    connection calesia states archivio di psichiatria 1900 p
    209 that 60 per cent inverts are musicians hirschfeld die
    homosexualitt p 500 regards this estimate as excessive but
    he himself elsewhere states p 175 that 98 per cent of male
    inverts are greatly attracted to music the women being decidedly
    less attracted oppenheim in a paper summarized in the
    neurologische centralblatt for june 1 1910 and the alienist
    and neurologist for nov 1910 well remarks that the musical
    disposition is marked by a great emotional instability and this
    instability is a disposition to nervousness it is thus that
    neurasthenia is so common among musicians the musician has not
    been rendered nervous by the music but he owes his nervousness
    as also it may be added his disposition to homosexuality to
    the same disposition to which he owes his musical aptitude
    moreover the musician is frequently onesided in his gifts and
    the possession of a single hypertrophied aptitude is itself
    closely related to the neuropathic and psychopathic diathesis
the tendency to dramatic aptitudefound among a large proportion of my
subjects who have never been professional actorshas attracted the
attention of previous investigators in this field221 thus moll refers
to the frequency of artistic and especially dramatic talent among
inverts and remarks that the cause is doubtful after pointing out that
the lie which they have to be perpetually living renders inverts always
actors he goes on to say
    apart from this it seems to me that the capacity and the
    inclination to conceive situations and to represent them in a
    masterly manner corresponds to an abnormal predisposition of the
    nervous system just as does sexual inversion so that both
    phenomena are due to the same source
i am in agreement with this statement the congenitally inverted may i
believe be looked upon as a class of individuals exhibiting nervous
characters which to some extent approximate them to persons of artistic
genius the dramatic and artistic aptitudes of inverts are therefore
partly due to the circumstances of the inverts life which render him
necessarily an actorand in some few cases lead him into a love of
deception comparable with that of a hysterical womanand partly it is
probable to a congenital nervous predisposition allied to the
predisposition to dramatic aptitude
    one of my correspondents has long been interested in the
    frequency of inversion among actors and actresses he knew an
    inverted actor who told him he adopted the profession because it
    would enable him to indulge his proclivity but on the whole he
    regards this tendency as due to hitherto unconsidered
    imaginative flexibilities and curiosities in the individual the
    actor ex hypothesi is one who works himself by sympathy
    intellectual and emotional into states of psychological being
    that are not his own he learns to comprehendnay to live
    himself intorelations which were originally alien to his
    nature the capacity for doing thiswhat makes a born
    actorimplies a faculty for extending his artistically acquired
    experience into life in the process of his trade therefore he
    becomes at all points sensitive to human emotions and sexuality
    being the most intellectually undetermined of the appetites after
    hunger the actor might discover in himself a sort of sexual
    indifference out of which a sexual aberration could easily
    arise a man devoid of this imaginative flexibility could not be
    a successful actor the man who possesses it would be exposed to
    divagations of the sexual instinct under esthetical or merely
    wanton influences something of the same kind is applicable to
    musicians and artists in whom sexual inversion prevails beyond
    the average they are conditioned by their esthetical faculty
    and encouraged by the circumstances of their life to feel and
    express the whole gamut of emotional experience thus they get an
    environment which unless they are sharply otherwise
    differentiated leads easily to experiments in passion all this
    joins on to what you call the variational diathesis of men of
    genius but i should seek the explanation of the phenomenon less
    in the original sexual constitution than in the exercise of
    sympathetic assimilative emotional qualities powerfully
    stimulated and acted on by the conditions of the individuals
    life the artist the singer the actor the painter are more
    exposed to the influences out of which sexual differentiation in
    an abnormal direction may arise some persons are certainly made
    abnormal by nature others of this sympathetic artistic
    temperament may become so through their sympathies plus their
    conditions of life it is possible there may be some element of
    truth in this view which my correspondent regarded as purely
    hypothetical
in this connection i may perhaps mention a moral quality which is very
often associated with dramatic aptitude and also with minor degrees of
nervous degeneration and that is vanity and the love of applause while
among a considerable section of inverts it is not more marked than among
the noninverted if not indeed less marked among another section it is
found in an exaggerated degree in at least one of my cases vanity and
delight in admiration both as regards personal qualities and artistic
productions reach an almost morbid extent and the quotations from
letters written by various others of my subjects show a curious
complacency in the description of their personal physical characters
markedly absent in other cases it is suggested by alexander schmid on
the basis of adlers views that this vanity which sometimes in the
inverted artist becomes an exalted pride as of a guardian of sacred
mysteries may be regarded as an effort to secure a compensation for the
consciousness of feminine defect222
    the extreme type of this preoccupation with personal beauty is
    represented by the history of himself sent by a young italian of
    good family to zola in the hopeitself a sign of vanitythat
    the distinguished novelist would make it the subject of one of
    his works the history is reproduced in the archives
    danthropologie criminelle 1894 and in lhomosexualit et les
    types homosexuels 1910 by dr laupts g saintpaul i
    quote the following passage at the age of 18 i was with few
    differences what i am now at 23 i am rather below the medium
    height 165 metres well proportioned slender but not lean
    my torso is superb a sculptor could find nothing against it and
    would not find it very different from that of antinotis my back
    is very arched perhaps too much so and my hips are very
    developed my pelvis is broad like a womans my knees slightly
    approximate my feet are small my hands superb the fingers
    curved back and with glistening nails rosy and polished cut
    squarely like those of ancient statues my neck is long and
    round the nape charmingly adorned with downy hairs my head is
    charming and at 18 was more so the oval of it is perfect and
    strikes all by its infantine form at 23 i am to be taken for 17
    at most my complexion is white and rosy deepening at the
    faintest emotion the forehead is not beautiful it recedes
    slightly and is hollow at the temples but fortunately it is
    halfcovered by long hair of a dark blonde which curls
    naturally the head is perfect in form because of the curly
    hair but on examination there is an enormous protuberance at the
    occiput my eyes are oval of a gray blue with dark chestnut
    eyelashes and thick arched eyebrows my eyes are very liquid
    but with dark circles and bistered and they are subject to
    slight temporary inflammation my mouth is fairly large with
    thick red lips the lower pendent they tell me i have the
    austrian mouth my teeth are dazzling though three are decayed
    and stopped fortunately they cannot be seen my ears are small
    and with very colored lobes my chin is very fat and at 18 it
    was smooth and velvety as a womans at present there is a slight
    beard always shaved two beauty spots black and velvety on my
    left cheek contrast with my blue eyes my nose is thin and
    straight with delicate nostrils and a slight almost insensible
    curve my voice is gentle and people always regret that i have
    not learned to sing this description is noteworthy as a
    detailed portrait of a sexual invert of a certain type the
    whole history is interesting and instructive
certain peculiarities in taste as regards costume have rightly or wrongly
been attributed to invertsapart from the tendency of a certain group to
adopt feminine habitsand may here be mentioned tardieu many years ago
referred to the taste for keeping the neck uncovered this peculiarity may
occasionally be observed among inverts especially the more artistic among
them the cause does not appear to be precisely vanity so much as that
physical consciousness which is so curiously marked in inverts and
induces the more feminine among them to cultivate feminine grace of form
and the more masculine to emphasize the masculine athletic habit
it has also been remarked that inverts exhibit a preference for green
garments in rome cindi were for this reason called galbanati
chevalier remarks that some years ago a band of pederasts at paris wore
green cravats as a badge this decided preference for green is well marked
in several of my cases of both sexes and in some at least the preference
certainly arose spontaneously green as jastrow and others have shown is
very rarely the favorite color of adults of the anglosaxon race though
some inquirers have found it to be more commonly a preferred color among
children especially girls and it is more often preferred by women than
by men223 the favorite color among normal women and indeed very often
among normal men though here not so often as blue is red and it is
notable that of recent years there has been a fashion for a red tie to be
adopted by inverts as their badge this is especially marked among the
fairies as a fellator is there termed in new york it is red
writes an american correspondent himself inverted that has become
almost a synonym for sexual inversion not only in the minds of inverts
themselves but in the popular mind to wear a red necktie on the street
is to invite remarks from newsboys and othersremarks that have the
practices of inverts for their theme a friend told me once that when a
group of streetboys caught sight of the red necktie he was wearing they
sucked their fingers in imitation of fellatio male prostitutes who walk
the streets of philadelphia and new york almost invariably wear red
neckties it is the badge of all their tribe the rooms of many of my
inverted friends have red as the prevailing color in decorations among my
classmates at the medical school few ever had the courage to wear a red
tie those who did never repeated the experiment
moral attitude of the invertthere is some interest in tracing the
inverts own attitude toward his anomaly and his estimate of its
morality as my cases are not patients seeking to be cured of their
perversion this attitude cannot be taken for granted i have noted the
moral attitude in 57 cases in 8 the subjects loathe themselves and have
fought in vain against their perversion which they often regard as a sin
nine or ten are doubtful and have little to say in justification of their
condition which they regard as perhaps morbid a moral disease one
while thinking it right to gratify his natural instincts admits that they
may be vices the remainder a large majority including all the women
are on the other hand emphatic in their assertion that their moral
position is precisely the same as that of the normally constituted
individual on the lowest ground a matter of taste and at least two state
that a homosexual relationship should be regarded as sacramental a holy
matrimony two or three even regard inverted love as nobler than ordinary
sexual love several add the proviso that there should be consent and
understanding on both sides and no attempt at seduction the chief regret
of 2 or 3 is the double life they are obliged to lead
when inverts have clearly faced and realized their own nature it is not so
much it seems their conscience that worries them or even the fear of
the police as the attitude of the world an american correspondent
writes it is the fear of public opinion that hangs above them like the
sword of damocles this fear is the heritage of all of us it is not the
fear of conscience and is not engendered by a feeling of wrongdoing
rather it is a silent submission to prejudices that meet us on every
side the true normal attitude of the sexual invert and i have known
hundreds with regard to his particular passion is not essentially
different from that of the normal man with regard to his
it is noteworthy that even when the condition is regarded as morbid and
even when a life of chastity has on this account been deliberately
chosen it is very rare to find an invert expressing any wish to change
his sexual ideals the male invert cannot find and has no desire to find
any sexual charm in a woman for he finds all possible charms united in a
man and a woman invert writes i cannot conceive a sadder fate than to
be a womanan average woman reduced to the necessity of loving a man
it will be seen that my conclusions under this head are in striking
contrast to those of westphal who believed that every invert regarded
himself as morbid and probably show a much higher proportion of
selfapproving inverts than any previous series224 this is largely due
to the fact that the cases were not obtained from the consultingroom and
that they represent in some degree the intellectual aristocracy of
inversion including individuals who often not without severe struggles
have found consolation in the example of the greeks or elsewhere and
have succeeded in attaining a modus vivendi with the moral world as
they have come to conceive it
footnotes
183 the following analysis is based on somewhat fuller versions of my
histories than it was necessary to publish in the preceding chapters as
well as on various other histories which are not here published at all
numerous apparent discrepancies may thus be explained
184 this frequency of nervous symptoms is in accordance with the most
reliable observation everywhere thus hirschfeld die homosexualitt
p 177 states that of 500 inverts 62 per cent showed nervous symptoms
of one kind or another sleeplessness sleepiness tremors stammering
etc
185 hirschfeld finds that 54 per cent of inverts become conscious of
their anomaly under the age of 14 the anomaly may however be present at
this early age but not consciously until later hence the larger
percentage recorded above
186 in this connection i may quote an observation by raffalovich it is
natural that the invert should very clearly recall the precocity of his
inclinations in the existence of every invert a moment arrives when he
discovers the enigma of his homosexual tastes he then classes all his
recollections and to justify himself in his own eyes he remembers that he
has been what he is from his earliest childhood homosexuality has colored
all his young life he has thought over it dreamed over it reflected
over itvery often in perfect innocence when he was quite small he
imagined that he had been carried off by brigands by savages at 5 or 6
he dreamed of the warmth of their chests and of their naked arms he
dreamed that he was their slave and he loved his slavery and his masters
he has had not the least thought that is crudely sexual but he has
discovered his sentimental vocation
187 leppmann mentions a case certainly extreme and abnormal of a
little girl of 8 who spent the night hidden on the roof merely in order
to be able to observe in the morning the sexual organs of an adult male
cousin bulletin de lunion internationale de droit pnal 1896 p
118
188 i fully admit as all investigators must the difficulty of tracing
the influence of early suggestions especially in dealing with persons who
are unaccustomed to selfanalysis sometimes it happens especially in
regard to erotic fetichism that while direct questioning fails to reach
any early formative suggestion such influence is casually elicited on a
subsequent occasion
189 i may add that i see no fundamental irreconcilability between the
point of view here adopted and the facts brought forward and wrongly
interpreted by schrencknotzing in his beitrge zur tiologie der
contrrer sexualempfindung vienna 1895 this writer states the
neuropathic disposition is congenital as is the tendency to precocious
appearance of the appetites the lack of psychic resistance and the
tendency to imperative associations but that heredity can extend to the
object of the appetite and influence the contents of these characters is
not shown psychological experiences are against it and the possibility
which i have shown of changing these impulses by experiment and so
removing their danger to the character of the individual it need not be
asserted that heredity extends to the object of the appetite but simply
that heredity culminates in an organism which is sexually best satisfied
by that object it is also a mistake to suppose that congenital characters
cannot be in some cases largely modified by such patient and laborious
processes as those carried on by schrencknotzing in the same pamphlet
this writer refers to moral insanity and idiocy as supporting his point of
view it is curious that both these congenital manifestations had
independently occurred to me as arguments against his position the
experiences of elmira reformatory and bictrenot to mention institutions
of more recent establishmentlong since showed that both the morally
insane and the idiotic can be greatly improved by appropriate treatment
schrencknotzing seems to be unduly biased by his interest in hypnotism
and suggestion
190 if an invert acquires under the influence of external conditions
fr wrote with truth linstinct sexuel p 238 it is because he was
born with an aptitude for such acquisition an aptitude lacking in those
who have been subjected to the same conditions without making the same
acquisitions
191 one of my subjects writes inverts are i think naturally more
liable to indulge in selfgratification than normal people partly because
of the perpetual suppression and disappointment of their desires and also
because of the fact that they actually possess in themselves the desired
form of the male this idea is a little difficult of explanation but you
can readily imagine to what frenzies of selfabuse a normal man would be
impelled supposing that he included in his own the form of the female
192 i do not here enter upon the consideration of the normal prevalence
and significance of masturbation and allied phenomena as i have dealt
with this subject in the study of autoerotism in volume i of these
studies
193 hirschfeld also finds among german inverts die homosexualitt
ch iii that the majority though a smaller majority than i find in
england and the united states have not had intercourse with women 53 per
cent he states including a few married men have never even attempted
coitus and over 50 per cent are presumably impotent the number of
inverted women who have never had intercourse with men is still larger

197 hirschfeld die homosexualitt p 71 et seq hirschfeld considers
that the dreams of the inverted fall into two groups one in which the
dreamer imagines he is embracing a person of the same sex and another in
which he imagines that he is himself of the opposite sex the latter class
of dreams constituting a pseudoheterosexual group seems to me to be
rare and they may moreover occur in heterosexual persons

199 pedicatio or pdicatio is the most generally accepted
technical term for the sodomitical intromission of the penis into the
anus it is usually derived from the greek pais boy but some
authorities have derived it from pedex or podex anus the terms
paiderastia and pederast are sometimes used to indicate the same act
and agent this use however is undesirable it is best to confine the
word paiderastia to its proper use as the name of the special
institution of greek boy love it may be added that the greeks themselves
had many names as many as 74 for paiderastia see on this subject of

204 stubbes in his anatomy of abuses affirmed that players and
playhaunters in their secret conclaves play the sodomites and refers to
some recent examples of men who had been desperately enamoured of
playerboys thus clad in womens apparel so far as to solicit them by
words by letters even actually to abuse them later on in 1633 prynne
in his histriomastix part 1 p 208 et seq strongly condemned this
putting on of womans array by actors on the same ground and adds that
he has heard credibly reported of a scholar of balliol college that he was
violently enamoured of a boyplayer in japan again where as in china
womans parts on the stage are taken by men not always youths the
homosexuality of these players became during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries so notorious that they constituted a class requiring
special regulation as joro or prostitutes
205 this was remarked by even the earliest modern writers on
homosexuality like hssli see hirschfeld vom wesen der liebe

be otherwise when we find how constantly homosexual women show masculine
traits

210 hirschfeld die homosexualitt p 283 found that 55 per cent of
inverts are attracted to qualities unlike their own and 45 per cent to
qualities resembling their own without regard to whether these qualities
belonged to the secondary sexual sphere it may be added that as regards
the age of the persons they are attracted to hirschfeld p 281 admits
two main groups each including about 45 per cent of the homosexual
ephebophils attracted to youths between 14 and 21 and androphils
attracted to adults in the prime of life this division as may be seen
from the histories included in the present volume seems to hold good of
british and american inverts

212 krafftebing tells of an inverted physician a man of masculine
development and tastes who had had sexual relations with 600 more or less
inverted men he observed no tendency to sexual malformation among them
but very frequently an approximation to a feminine form of body as well
as insufficient hair delicate complexion and high voice welldeveloped
breasts were not rare and some 10 per cent showed a taste for feminine
occupations

partly so fliess attaches special importance to lefthandedness in
inversion believing that in lefthanded men feminine secondary sexual
characters are marked and in lefthanded women masculine sexual character

highest proportion among actors jger has referred to the frequency of
homosexuality among barbers i have been told that among london
hairdressers homosexuality is so prevalent that there is even a special
attitude which the client may adopt in the chair to make known that he is
an invert dr kiernan informs me that in chicago also inversion is
specially prevalent among barbers and he adds that he is acquainted with
two cases among womenbarbers a relatively large proportion it is not
difficult to understand this bearing in mind the close physical
association between the barber and his client wg was a barbers
assistant writes one of my subjects and i took an immense fancy to him
at firstsight he used to lather me and the touch of his fingers was a
delight later on he shaved me and i always looked forward to going to the

the theory of sexual inversion
what is sexual inversioncauses of diverging viewsthe theory of
suggestion unworkableimportance of the congenital element in
inversionthe freudian theoryembryonic hermaphroditism as a key to
inversioninversion as a variation or sportcomparison with
colorblindness colorhearing and similar abnormalitieswhat is an
abnormalitynot necessarily a diseaserelation of inversion to
degenerationexciting causes of inversionnot operative in the absence
of predisposition
the analysis of these cases leads directly up to a question of the first
importance what is sexual inversion is it as many would have us
believe an abominably acquired vice to be stamped out by the prison or
is it as a few assert a beneficial variety of human emotion which should
be tolerated or even fostered is it a diseased condition which qualifies
its subject for the lunatic asylum or is it a natural monstrosity a
human sport the manifestations of which must be regulated when they
become antisocial there is probably an element of truth in more than one
of these views very widely divergent views of sexual inversion are
largely justified by the position and attitude of the investigator it is
natural that the policeofficial should find that his cases are largely
mere examples of disgusting vice and crime it is natural that the asylum
superintendent should find that we are chiefly dealing with a form of
insanity it is equally natural that the sexual invert himself should find
that he and his inverted friends are not so very unlike ordinary persons
we have to recognize the influence of professional and personal bias and
the influence of environment
there have been two main streams of tendency in the views regarding sexual
inversion one seeking to enlarge the sphere of the acquired represented
by binetwho however recognized predispositionschrencknotzing and
recently the freudians the other seeking to enlarge the sphere of the
congenital represented by krafftebing moll fr and today by the
majority of authorities there is as usually happens truth in both
these views but inasmuch as those who represent the acquired view often
deny any congenital element we are called upon to discuss the question
the view that sexual inversion is entirely explained by the influence of
early association or of suggestion is an attractive one and at first
sight it seems to be supported by what we know of erotic fetichism by
which a womans hair or foot or even clothing becomes the focus of a
mans sexual aspirations but it must be remembered that what we see in
erotic fetichism is merely the exaggeration of a normal impulse every
lover is to some extent excited by his mistresss hair or foot or
clothing even here therefore there is really what may fairly be
regarded as a congenital element and moreover there is reason to
believe that the erotic fetichist usually displays the further congenital
element of hereditary neurosis therefore the analogy with erotic
fetichism does not bring much help to those who argue that inversion is
purely acquired it must also be pointed out that the argument for
acquired or suggested inversion logically involves the assertion that
normal sexuality is also acquired or suggested if a man becomes attracted
to his own sex simply because the fact or the image of such attraction is
brought before him then we are bound to believe that a man becomes
attracted to the opposite sex only because the fact or the image of such
attraction is brought before him such a theory is unworkable in nearly
every country of the world men associate with men and women with women
if association and suggestion were the only influential causes then
inversion instead of being the exception ought to be the rule throughout
the human species if not indeed throughout the whole zological series
we should moreover have to admit that the most fundamental human
instinct is so constituted as to be equally well adapted for sterility as
for that propagation of the race which as a matter of fact we find
dominant throughout the whole of life we must therefore put aside
entirely the notion that the direction of the sexual impulse is merely a
suggested phenomenon such a notion is entirely opposed to observation and
experience and will with difficulty fit into a rational biological
scheme
the freudiansalike of the orthodox and the heterodox schoolshave
sometimes contributed unintentionally or not to revive the now
antiquated conception of homosexuality as an acquired phenomenon and that
by insisting that its mechanism is a purely psychic though unconscious
process which may be readjusted to the normal order by psychoanalytic
methods freud first put forth a comprehensive statement of his view of
homosexuality in the original and pregnant little book drei abhandlungen
zur sexualtheorie 1905 and has elsewhere frequently touched on the
subject as have many other psychoanalysts including alfred adler and
stekel who no longer belong to the orthodox freudian school when inverts
are psychoanalytically studied freud believes it is found that in early
childhood they go through a phase of intense but brief fixation on a
woman usually the mother or perhaps sister then an internal censure
inhibiting this incestuous impulse they overcome it by identifying
themselves with women and taking refuge in narcissism the self becoming
the sexual object finally they look for youthful males resembling
themselves whom they love as their mothers loved them their pursuit of
men is thus determined by their flight from women this view has been set
forth not only by freud but by sadger stekel and many others225 freud
himself however is careful to state that this process only represents
one type of stunted sexual activity and that the problem of inversion is
complex and diversified
    this view may be said to assume a bisexual constitution as
    normal and homosexuality arises by the suppression owing to
    some accident of the heterosexual component and the path
    through an autoerotic process of narcissism to homosexuality on
    this general freudian conception of homosexuality numerous
    variations have been based and separate features specially
    emphasized by individual psychoanalysts thus sadger considers
    that beneath the male individual loved by the invert a female
    is concealed and that this fact may be revealed by
    psychoanalysis which removes the upper layer of the psychic
    palimpsest he believes that this disposition of the invert is
    favored by a frequent mixture of male and female traits in his
    near relatives originally it is not man whom the homosexual
    man loves and desires but man and woman together in one form
    the heterosexual element is later suppressed and then pure
    inversion is left further developing freuds view of the
    importance of anal eroticism freud sammlung kleiner schriften
    zur neurosenlehre vol ii sadger thinks that it is even the
    rule for a passive invert to have experienced anal eroticism in
    childhood and been frequently subjected to enemas which have led
    to the desire for the anal intromission of the penis
    medizinische klinik 1909 no 2 jekels pushes this doctrine
    further and declares that all inverts are really passive the
    invert is in his love he states both subject and object he
    identifies himself with his mother and sees in the object of his
    love his own youthful person and what jekels asks is the aim
    of this mental arrangement it can scarcely by other he replies
    than in the part of the mother to stimulate the anal region of
    the object which has now become himself and to procure the same
    pleasure which in childhood he experienced when his mother
    satisfied his anal eroticism jekels regards this view as the
    continuation and concretization of freuds interpretation and
    the main point in homosexuality even when apparently passive
    becomes the craving for analerotic satisfaction l jekels

    selfassurance in the form of rebellion and defiance and even
    the feminism of the invert may become a method of gaining power
    a adler ueber den neursen charakter 1912 p 21
the mechanism of the genesis of homosexuality put forward by freud need
not be dismissed offhand freud has often manifested the insight of
genius and he refrains from molding his conceptions in those inflexible
shapes which have sometimes been adopted by the more dogmatic
psychoanalysts who have followed him nor need we be unduly shocked by the
incestuous air of the oedipus complex226 as it is commonly called
which figures as a component of the process the word incest though it
has been used by freud himself seems scarcely a proper word to apply to
the vague and elementary feelings of children especially when those
feelings scarcely pass beyond a stage of nonlocalized and therefore
really presexual feelings in the ordinary use of the term sexual which
may be regarded as natural and normal the freudian conception is
misrepresented and prejudiced by the statement that it involves
incest227 when a child loves its mother with an entire love that
love necessarily involves the germs which in later life become separated
and developed into sexual love but it is inaccurate to term this love of
the child incestuous it is quite easily conceivable that the psychic
mechanism of the establishment of homosexuality has in some cases
corresponded to the course described by freud it may also be admitted
that as psychoanalysts claim the pronounced horror femin occasionally
found in male inverts may plausibly be regarded as the reversal of an
early and disappointed feminine attraction but it is impossible to regard
this mechanism as invariable or even frequent it is quite true and i
have found ample evidence of the fact that inverts are often very closely
attached to their mothers even to a greater degree indeed than is the
rule among normal children and often like to be in constant association
with their mothers but this attraction is quite misunderstood if it is
regarded as a peculiarly sexual attraction indeed the whole point of the
attraction is that the inverted boy vaguely feels his own feminine
disposition and so shuns the uncongenial amusements and society of his own
sex for the sympathy and community of tastes which he finds concentrated
in his mother so far from such association being evidence of sexual
attraction it might more reasonably be regarded as evidence of its
absence just as the association of boys among themselves and of girls
among themselves even in coeducational schools is proof of the
prevalence of heterosexual rather than of homosexual feeling confirmation
of this point of view may be found in the factoverlooked and sometimes
even denied by psychoanalyststhat frequently even in early childhood
and simultaneously with this community of feeling with his mother the
homosexual boy is already experiencing the predominant fascination of the
male he feels it long before the age at which narcissism is apt to occur
or at which selfconsciousness has become sufficiently developed to allow
the internal censure on unpermitted emotions to operate or any flight
from them to take place moreover while most authorities have rarely been
able to find any clear evidence of the sexual attraction of male inverts
in childhood to mother or sister228 an attraction of this kind to
father or brother seems less difficult to find and if found it is
incompatible with the typical freudian process in my own observation
among the histories here recorded there are at least two clear examples
of such an attraction in childhood it must further be said that any
theory of the etiology of homosexuality which leaves out of account the
hereditary factor in inversion cannot be admitted the evidence for the
frequency of homosexuality among the near relatives of the inverted is now
indisputable i have traced it in a considerable proportion of cases and
in many of these the evidence is unquestionable and altogether independent
of the statement of the subject himself whose opinion may be held to be
possibly biased or unreliable229 this hereditary factor seems indeed to
be called for by the freudian theory itself on that theory we need to
know how it is that the subject passes through psychic phases and reaches
an emotional disposition so unlike that of normal persona the existence
of a definite hereditary tendency in a homosexual direction removes that
difficulty freud himself recognizes this and clearly asserts congenital
psychosexual constitution which must involve predisposition on a
general survey therefore it would appear that on the psychic side we
may accept the reality of unconscious dynamic processes which in
particular cases may be of the freudian or similar type but while the
study of such mechanisms may illuminate the psychology of homosexuality
they leave untouched the fundamental organic factors now accepted by most
authorities230
the rational way of regarding the normal sexual instinct is as an inborn
organic impulse reaching full development about the time of puberty231
during the period of development suggestion and association may come in to
play a part in defining the object of the emotion the soil is now ready
but the variety of seeds likely to thrive in it is limited that there is
a greater indefiniteness in the aim of the sexual impulse at this period
we may well believe this is shown not only by occasional tentative signs
of sexual emotion directed toward the same sex in childhood but by the
frequently ideal and unlocalized character of the normal passion even at
puberty but the channel of sexual emotion is not thereby turned into an
abnormal path whenever this happens we are bound to believeand we have
many grounds for believingthat we are dealing with an organism which
from the beginning is abnormal the same seed of suggestion is sown in
various soils in the many it dies out in the few it flourishes the
cause can only be a difference in the soil
if then we must postulate a congenital abnormality in order to account
satisfactorily for at least a large proportion of sexual inverts wherein
does that abnormality consist ulrichs explained the matter by saying that
in sexual inverts a male body coexists with a female soul anima
muliebris in corpore virile inclusa even writers of scientific eminence
like magnan and gley have adopted this phrase in a modified form
considering that in inversion a female brain is combined with a male body
or male glands this is however not an explanation it merely
crystallizes into an epigram the superficial impression of the
matter232
we can probably grasp the nature of the abnormality better if we reflect
on the development of the sexes and on the latent organic bisexuality in
each sex at an early stage of development the sexes are
indistinguishable and throughout life the traces of this early community
of sex remain the hen fowl retains in a rudimentary form the spurs which
are so large and formidable in her lord and sometimes she develops a
capacity to crow or puts on male plumage among mammals the male
possesses useless nipples which occasionally even develop into breasts
and the female possesses a clitoris which is merely a rudimentary penis
and may also develop the sexually inverted person does not usually
possess any gross exaggeration of these signs of community with the
opposite sex but as we have seen there are a considerable number of
more subtle approximations to the opposite sex in inverted persons both
on the physical and the psychic side putting the matter in a purely
speculative shape it may be said that at conception the organism is
provided with about 50 per cent of male germs and about 50 per cent of
female germs and that as development proceeds either the male or the
female germs assume the upper hand until in the maturely developed
individual only a few aborted germs of the opposite sex are left in the
homosexual however and in the bisexual we may imagine that the process
has not proceeded normally on account of some peculiarity in the number
or character of either the original male germs or female germs or both
the result being that we have a person who is organically twisted into a
shape that is more fitted for the exercise of the inverted than of the
normal sexual impulse or else equally fitted for both233
    the conception of the latent bisexuality of all males and females
    cannot fail to be fairly obvious to intelligent observers of the
    human body it emerges at an early period in the history of
    philosophic thought and from the first was occasionally used for
    the explanation of homosexuality platos myth in the banquet
    and the hermaphroditic statues of antiquity show how acute minds
    working ahead of science exercised themselves with these
    problems for a fully illustrated study of the ancient

    again from the philosophical side recognized the bisexuality of
    the human individual see juliusburger allgemeine zeitschrift

    adopted a similar doctrine on a platonic basis to explain the
    uranian constitution after this the idea began to be more
    precisely developed from the scientific side though not at first
    with reference to homosexuality and more especially by the great
    pioneers of the doctrine of evolution darwin emphasized the
    significance of the facts on this point as later weismann while
    haeckel who was one of the earliest darwinians has in recent
    years clearly recognized the bearing on the interpretation of
    homosexuality of the fact that the ancestors of the vertebrates
    were hermaphrodites as vertebrates themselves still are in their
    embryonic disposition haeckel in jahrbuch fr sexuelle

    bipolaritywhich involved the existence of latent female germs
    in the male latent male germs in the female which latent germs
    may strive for and sometimes obtain the mastery in february
    1896 the first version of the present chapter setting forth the

    the basis of a latent bisexuality was published in the

    farther adopting the explanation on the lines of original
    bisexuality english translation of tenth edition pp 3367 in
    much the same language as i have used he argued that there has
    been a struggle in the centers homosexuality resulting when the
    center antagonistic to that represented by the sexual gland
    conquers and psychosexual hermaphroditism resulting when both
    centers are too weak to obtain victory in either case such
    disturbance not being a psychic degeneration or disease but
    simply an anomaly comparable to a malformation and quite
    consonant with psychic health this is the view now widely
    accepted by investigators of sexual inversion much material
    bearing on the history of this conception has been brought
    together by hirschfeld in die homosexualitt ch xix and
    previously in vom wesen der liebe jahrbuch fr sexuelle
    zwischenstufen vol viii 1906 pp 111133
    a similar or allied view is now constantly met with in writers of
    scientific authority who are only incidentally concerned with the
    study of sexual inversion thus halban die entstehung des
    geschlechtscharaktere archiv fr gynkologie 1903 regards
    hermaphroditism which he would extend to the psychic sphere as

    ovary cannot account for the appearance in the hen bird of male
    characters which are not retrogressive but progressive argues
    that such birds are really bisexual or hermaphrodite either by
    the single ovary being really bisexual as was the case with a
    fowl they examined or that the sexual glands are paired one
    being male and the other female or else that there is misplaced
    male tissue in a neighboring viscus like the adrenal or kidney
    the male elements asserting themselves when the female elements
    degenerate hermaphroditism they conclude far from being a
    phenomenon altogether abnormal amongst the higher vertebrates
    should be viewed rather as a reversion to the primitive ancestral
    phase in which bisexualism was the normal disposition true
    hermaphroditism in man being established the question arises
    whether lesser grades do not occur remote evidence of
    bisexuality in the human subject may perhaps be afforded by the
    psychical phenomenon of sexual perversion and inversion
    similarly in a case of unilateral secondary male character in an
    otherwise female pheasant cj bond has more recently shown
    section of zology birmingham meeting of british medical
    association british medical journal sept 20 1913 that an
    ovitestis was present with degenerating ovarian tissue and
    developing testicular tissue and such islands of actively
    growing male tissue can frequently be found he states in the
    degenerating ovaries of female birds which have put forth male
    plumage sir john blandsutton referring to the fact that the
    external conformation of the body affords no positive certainty
    as to the nature of the internal sexual glands adds british
    medical journal oct 30 1909 it is a fair presumption that
    some examples of sexual frigidity and sex perversion may be
    explained by the possibility that the individuals concerned may
    possess sexual glands opposite in character to those indicated by
    the external configuration of their bodies looking at the
    matter more broadly and fundamentally in its normal aspects
    heape declares proceedings of the cambridge philosophical
    society vol xiv part ii 1907 that there is no such thing
    as a pure male or female animal but that all contain a dominant
    and recessive sex except those hermaphrodites in which both
    sexes are equally represented there seems to me ample
    evidence for the conclusion that there is no such thing as a pure
    male or female fha marshall again in his standard manual
    the physiology of reproduction 1910 p 655 et seq is
    inclined to accept the same view if it be true he remarks
    that all individuals are potentially bisexual and that changed
    circumstances leading to a changed metabolism may in
    exceptional circumstances even in adult life cause the
    development of the recessive characters it would seem extremely
    probable that the dominance of one set of sexual characters over
    the other may be determined in some cases at an early stage of
    development in response to a stimulus which may be either
    internal or external so also berry hart atypical male and
    female sexensemble a paper read before edinburgh obstetrical
    society british medical journal june 20 1914 p 1355
    regards the normal male or female as embodying a maximum of the
    potent organs of his or her own sex with a minimum of nonpotent
    organs of the other sex with secondary sex traits congruent any
    increase in the minimum gives a diminished maximum and
    noncongruence of the secondary characters
we thus see that the ancient medicophilosophic conception of organic
bisexuality put forth by the greeks as the key to the explanation of
sexual inversion after sinking out of sight for two thousand years was
revived early in the nineteenth century by two amateur philosophers who
were themselves inverted hssli ulrichs as well as by a genuine
philosopher who was not inverted schopenhauer then the conception of
latent bisexuality independently of homosexuality was developed from the
purely scientific side by darwin and evolutionists generally in the
next stage this conception was adopted by the psychiatric and other
scientific authorities on homosexuality krafftebing and the majority of
other students finally embryologists physiologists of sex and
biologists generally not only accept the conception of bisexuality but
admit that it probably helps to account for homosexuality in this way the
idea may be said to have passed into current thought we cannot assert
that it constitutes an adequate explanation of homosexuality but it
enables us in some degree to understand what for many is a mysterious
riddle and it furnishes a useful basis for the classification not only
of homosexuality but of the other mixed or intermediate sexual anomalies
in the same group the chief of these intermediate sexual anomalies are
1 physical hermaphroditism in its various stages 2 gynandromorphism
or eunuchoidism in which men possess characters resembling those of males
who have been early castrated and women possess similarly masculine
characters 3 sexoesthetic inversion or eonism hirschfelds
transvestism or crossdressing in which outside the specifically sexual
emotions men possess the tastes of women and women those of men
    hirschfeld has discussed these intermediate sexual stages in
    various works especially in geschlechtsbergnge 1905 die
    transvestiten 1910 and ch xi of die homosexualitt
    hermaphroditism the reality of which has only of late been
    recognized and is still disputed and pseudohermaphroditism in
    their physical variations are fully dealt with in the great work
    richly illustrated hermaphroditismus beim menschen by fl
    von neugebauer of warsaw neugebauer published an earlier and
    briefer study of the subject in the jahrbuch fr sexuelle
    zwischenstufen vol iv 1902 pp 1176 with a bibliography in
    vol viii 1906 of the same jahrbuch pp 685700 hirschfeld
    emphasizes the fact that neither hermaphroditism nor eunuchoidism
    is commonly associated with homosexuality and that a large
    proportion of the cases of transvestism as defined by him are
    heterosexual true inversion seems however to be not
    infrequently found among pseudohermaphrodites neugebauer records
    numerous cases magnan has published a case in a girl brought up
    as a youth gazette mdical de paris march 31 1911 and
    lapointe a case in a man brought up as a girl revue de
    psychiatrie 1911 p 219 such cases may be accounted for by
    the training and associations involved by the early error in
    recognition of sex and perhaps still more by a really organic
    predisposition to homosexuality although the sexual psychic
    characters are not necessarily bound up with the coexistence of
    corresponding sexual glands halban archiv fr gynkologie
    1903 goes so far as to class the homosexual as real
    pseudohermaphrodites exactly comparable to a man with a female
    breast or a woman with a beard and proposes to term
    homosexuality pseudohermaphroditus masculinus psychicus this
    however is an unnecessary and scarcely satisfactory confusion
to place the group of homosexual phenomena among other intermediate groups
on the organic bisexual basis is a convenient classification it can
scarcely be regarded as a complete explanation it is probable that we may
ultimately find a more fundamental source of these various phenomena in
the stimulating and inhibiting play of the internal secretions234 our
knowledge of the intimate association between the hormones and sexual
phenomena is already sufficient to make such an explanation intelligible
the complex interaction of the glandular internal secretions and their
liability to varying disturbance in balance may well suffice to account
for the complexity of the phenomena it would harmonize with what we know
of the occasional delayed manifestations of homosexuality and would not
clash with their congenital nature for we know that a disordered state of
the thymus for instance may be hereditary and it is held that status
lymphaticus may be either inborn or acquired235 normal sexual
characters seem to depend largely upon the due coordination of the
internal secretions and it is reasonable to suppose that sexual
deviations depend upon their incoordination if a man is a man and a
woman a woman because in blair bells phrase of the totality of their
internal secretions the intermediate stages between the man and the woman
must be due to redistribution of those internal secretions236
we know that various internal secretions possess an influential sexual
effect thus the atrophy of the thymus seems to be connected with sexual
development at puberty the thyroid reinforces the genital glands adrenal
overdevelopment can produce in a female the secondary characteristics of
the male as well as cause precocious development of maleness etc an
alteration in the metabolism as fha marshall suggests even in
comparatively late life may initiate changes in the direction of the
opposite sex metabolic chemical processes may thus be found to furnish a
key to complex and subtle sexual variations alike somatic and psychic
although we must still regard such processes as arising on an inborn
predisposition
whatever its ultimate explanation sexual inversion may thus fairly be
considered a sport or variation one of those organic aberrations which
we see throughout living nature in plants and in animals
it is not here asserted as i would carefully point out that an inverted
sexual instinct or organ for such instinct is developed in early
embryonic life such a notion is rightly rejected as absurd what we may
reasonably regard as formed at an early stage of development is strictly a
predisposition that is to say such a modification of the organism that
it becomes more adapted than the normal or average organism to experience
sexual attraction to the same sex the sexual invert may thus be roughly
compared to the congenital idiot to the instinctive criminal to the man
of genius who are all not strictly concordant with the usual biological
variation because this is of a less subtle character but who become
somewhat more intelligible to us if we bear in mind their affinity to
variations symonds compared inversion to colorblindness and such a
comparison is reasonable just as the ordinary colorblind person is
congenitally insensitive to those redgreen rays which are precisely the
most impressive to the normal eye and gives an extended value to the
other colorsfinding that blood is the same color as grass and a florid
complexion blue as the skyso the invert fails to see emotional values
patent to normal persons transferring those values to emotional
associations which for the rest of the world are utterly distinct or we
may compare inversion to such a phenomenon as colorhearing in which
there is not so much defect as an abnormality of nervous tracks producing
new and involuntary combinations just as the colorhearer instinctively
associates colors with sounds like the young japanese lady who remarked
when listening to singing that boys voice is red so the invert has
his sexual sensations brought into relationship with objects that are
normally without sexual appeal237 and inversion like colorhearing is
found more commonly in young subjects tending to become less marked or
to die out after puberty colorhearing while an abnormal phenomenon it
must be added cannot be called a diseased condition and it is probably
much less frequently associated with other abnormal or degenerative
stigmata than is inversion there is often a congenital element shown by
the tendency to hereditary transmission while the associations are
developed in very early life and are too regular to be the simple result
of suggestion238
all such organic variations are abnormalities it is important that we
should have a clear idea as to what an abnormality is many people imagine
that what is abnormal is necessarily diseased that is not the case
unless we give the word disease an inconveniently and illegitimately wide
extension it is both inconvenient and inexact to speak of
colorblindness criminality and genius as diseases in the same sense as
we speak of scarlet fever or tuberculosis or general paralysis as
diseases every congenital abnormality is doubtless due to a peculiarity
in the sperm or oval elements or in their mingling or to some disturbance
in their early development but the same may doubtless be said of the
normal dissimilarities between brothers and sisters it is quite true that
any of these aberrations may be due to antenatal disease but to call them
abnormal does not beg that question if it is thought that any authority
is needed to support this view we can scarcely find a weightier than that
of virchow who repeatedly insisted on the right use of the word
anomaly and who taught that though an anomaly may constitute a
predisposition to disease the study of anomaliespathology as he called
it teratology as we may perhaps prefer to call itis not the study of
disease which he termed nosology the study of the abnormal is perfectly
distinct from the study of the morbid virchow considers that the region
of the abnormal is the region of pathology and that the study of disease
must be regarded distinctly as nosology whether we adopt this
terminology or whether we consider the study of the abnormal as part of
teratology is a secondary matter not affecting the right understanding
of the term anomaly and its due differentiation from the term disease
    at the innsbruck meeting of the german anthropological society
    in 1894 virchow thus expressed himself in old days an anomaly
    was called pathos and in this sense every departure from the
    norm is for me a pathological event if we have ascertained such
    a pathological event we are further led to investigate what
    pathos was the special cause of it this cause may be for
    example an external force or a chemical substance or a
    physical agent producing in the normal condition of the body a
    change an anomaly pathos this can become hereditary under some
    circumstances and then become the foundation for certain small
    hereditary characters which are propagated in a family in
    themselves they belong to pathology even although they produce
    no injury for i must remark that pathological does not mean
    harmful it does not indicate disease disease in greek is nosos
    and it is nosology that is concerned with disease the
    pathological under some circumstances can be advantageous
    correspondenzblatt deutsch gesellschaft fr anthropologie
    1894 these remarks are of interest when we are attempting to
    find the wider bearings of such an anomaly as sexual inversion
    this same distinction has more recently been emphasized by
    professor aschoff deutsche medizinische wochenschrift
    february 3 1910 of british medical journal april 9 1910
    p 892 as against ribbert and others who would unduly narrow
    the conception of pathos aschoff points out that not merely for
    the sake of precision and uniformity of terminology but of clear
    thinking it is desirable that we should retain a distinction in
    regard to which galen and the ancient physicians were very
    definite they used pathos as the wider term involving affection
    affectio in general not necessarily impairment of vital
    tissue when that was involved there was nosos disease we have
    to recognize the distinction even if we reject the terminology
a word may be said as to the connection between sexual inversion and
degeneration in france especially since the days of morel the stigmata
of degeneration are much spoken of sexual inversion is frequently
regarded as one of them ie as an episodic syndrome of a hereditary
disease taking its place beside other psychic stigmata such as
kleptomania and pyromania krafftebing long so regarded inversion it is
the view of magnan one of the earliest investigators of
homosexuality239 and it was adopted by mbius strictly speaking the
invert is degenerate he has fallen away from the genus so is a
colorblind person but morels conception of degenerescence has
unfortunately been coarsened and vulgarized240 as it now stands we
gain little or no information by being told that a person is a
degenerate it is only as ncke constantly argued when we find a
complexus of wellmarked abnormalities that we are fairly justified in
asserting that we have to deal with a condition of degeneration inversion
is sometimes found in such a condition i have indeed already tried to
suggest that a condition of diffused minor abnormality may be regarded as
a basis of congenital inversion in other words inversion is bound up
with a modification of the secondary sexual characters but these
anomalies and modifications are not invariable241 and are not usually
of a serious character inversion is rare in the profoundly degenerate it
is undesirable to call these modifications stigmata of degeneration a
term which threatens to disappear from scientific terminology to become a
mere term of literary and journalistic abuse so much may be said
concerning a conception or a phrase of which far too much has been made in
popular literature at the best it remains vague and unfitted for
scientific use it is now widely recognized that we gain little by
describing inversion as a degeneration ncke who attached significance
to the stigmata of degeneration when numerous was especially active in
pointing out that inverts are not degenerate and frequently returned to
this point lwenfeld freud hirschfeld bloch rohleder all reject the
conception of sexual inversion as a degeneracy
    moll is still unable to abandon altogether the position that
    since inversion involves a disharmony between psychic disposition
    and physical conformation we must regard it as morbid but he
    recognizes like krafftebing that it is properly viewed as
    being on the level of a deformity that is an abnormality
    comparable to physical hermaphroditism a moll sexuelle
    zwischenstufen zeitschrift fr aerztliche fortbildung no
    24 1904 ncke repeatedly emphasized the view that inversion is
    a congenital nonmorbid abnormality thus in the last year of his
    life he wrote zeitschrift fr die gesamte neurologie und
    psychiatrie vol xv heft 5 1913 we must not conceive of
    homosexuality as a degeneration or a disease but at most as an
    abnormality due to a disturbance of development lwenfeld
    always a cautious and sagacious clinical observer agreeing with
    ncke and hirschfeld regards inversion as certainly an
    abnormality but not therefore morbid it may be associated with
    disease and degeneration but is usually simply a variation from
    the norm not to be regarded as morbid or degenerate and not
    diminishing the value of the individual as a member of society
    lwenfeld ueber die sexuelle konstitution 1911 p 166 also
    zeitschrift fr sexualwissenschaft feb 1908 and
    sexualprobleme april 1908 aletrino of amsterdam pushes the
    view that inversion is a nonmorbid abnormality to an undue
    extreme by asserting that the uranist is a normal variety of the
    species homo sapiens uranisme et dgnrescence archives
    danthropologie criminelle augsept 1908 inversion may be
    regarded as in the correct sense of the word here adopted a
    pathological abnormality but not as an anthropological human
    variety comparable to the negro or the mongolian man for
    further opinions in favor of inversion as an anomaly see
    hirschfeld die homosexualitt p 388 et seq
sexual inversion therefore remains a congenital anomaly to be classed
with other congenital abnormalities which have psychic concomitants at
the very least such congenital abnormality usually exists as a
predisposition to inversion it is probable that many persons go through
the world with a congenital predisposition to inversion which always
remains latent and unroused in others the instinct is so strong that it
forces its own way in spite of all obstacles in others again the
predisposition is weaker and a powerful exciting cause plays the
predominant part
we are thus led to the consideration of the causes that excite the latent
predisposition a great variety of causes has been held to excite to
sexual inversion it is only necessary to mention those which i have found
influential the first to come before us is our schoolsystem with its
segregation of boys and girls apart from each other during the periods of
puberty and adolescence many inverts have not been to school at all and
many who have been pass through schoollife without forming any passionate
or sexual relationship but there remain a large number who date the
development of homosexuality from the influences and examples of
schoollife the impressions received at the time are not less potent
because they are often purely sentimental and without any obvious sensual
admixture whether they are sufficiently potent to generate permanent
inversion alone may be doubtful but if it is true that in early life the
sexual instincts are less definitely determined than when adolescence is
complete it is conceivable though unproved that a very strong
impression acting even on a normal organism may cause arrest of sexual
development on the psychic side
another exciting cause of inversion is seduction by this i mean the
initiation of the young boy or girl by some older and more experienced
person in whom inversion is already developed and who is seeking the
gratification of the abnormal instinct this appears to be a not uncommon
incident in the early history of sexual inverts that such
seductionsometimes an abrupt and inconsiderate act of mere sexual
gratificationcould by itself produce a taste for homosexuality is highly
improbable in individuals not already predisposed it is far more likely
to produce disgust as it did in the case of the youthful rousseau he
only can be seduced as moll puts it who is capable of being seduced
no doubt it frequently happens in these as so often in more normal
seductions that the victim has offered a voluntary or involuntary
invitation
another exciting cause of inversion to which little importance is usually
attached but which i find to have some weight is disappointment in
normal love it happens that a man in whom the homosexual instinct is yet
only latent or at all events held in a state of repression tries to form
a relationship with a woman this relationship may be ardent on one or
both sides butoften doubtless from the latent homosexuality of the
loverit comes to nothing such lovedisappointments in a more or less
acute form occur at some time or another to nearly everyone but in these
persons the disappointment with one woman constitutes motive strong enough
to disgust the lover with the whole sex and to turn his attention toward
his own sex it is evident that the instinct which can thus be turned
round can scarcely be strong and it seems probable that in some of these
cases the episode of normal love simply serves to bring home to the invert
the fact that he is not made for normal love in other cases it
seemsespecially those that are somewhat feebleminded and
unbalanceda lovedisappointment really does poison the normal instinct
and a more or less impotent love for women becomes an equally impotent
love for men the prevalence of homosexuality among prostitutes may be to
a large extent explained by a similar and betterfounded disgust with
normal sexuality242
these three influences thereforeexample at school seduction
disappointment in normal loveall of them drawing the subject away from
the opposite sex and concentrating him on his own sex are exciting causes
of inversion but they require a favorable organic predisposition to act
on while there are a large number of cases in which no exciting cause at
all can be found but in which from earliest childhood the subjects
interest seems to be turned on his own sex and continues to be so turned
throughout life
at this point i conclude the analysis of the psychology of sexual
inversion as it presents itself to me i have sought only to bring out the
more salient points neglecting minor points neglecting also those groups
of inverts who may be regarded as of secondary importance the average
invert moving in ordinary society is a person of average general health
though very frequently with hereditary relationships that are markedly
neurotic he is usually the subject of a congenital predisposing
abnormality or complexus of minor abnormalities making it difficult or
impossible for him to feel sexual attraction to the opposite sex and easy
to feel sexual attraction to his own sex this abnormality either appears
spontaneously from the first by development or arrest of development or
it is called into activity by some accidental circumstance

227 the love of relations may be tinctured by all degrees of sexual
love some of which are so faint and vague that they cannot be considered
unnatural or abnormal it is misleading to term them incestuous the
russian novelist artzibascheff in his sanine described a brothers
affection for his sister as thus touched with a perception of her sexual
charm i refer to the french translation and the book has consequently
been much abused as incestuous though the attitude described is very
pale and conventional compared to the romantic passion sung in shelleys
laon and cythna or the tragic exaltation of the same passion in fords
great play tis pity shes a whore
228 thus numa praetorius a sagacious observer with a very wide and
thorough knowledge of homosexuality finds himself quite unable to accept
the oedipus complex explanation of inversion jahrbuch fr sexuelle
zwischenstufen july 1914 p 362
229 it cannot be maintained that the frequency of inversion among the
near relatives of inverts is a chance coincidence for it must be
remembered that few estimates of the prevalence of inversion yield a
higher proportion than 3 per cent
230 see also a discussion of the freudian view by hirschfeld who
concludes die homosexualitt p 344 that we can only accept the
freudian mechanism as rare and in all cases subordinate to organic
predisposition
231 it has been denied by some meynert ncke etc that there is any
sexual instinct at all i may as well therefore explain in what sense
i use the word see also analysis of the sexual impulse in vol iii of
these studies i mean an inherited aptitude the performance of which
normally demands for its full satisfaction the presence of a person of the
opposite sex it might be asserted that there is no such thing as an
instinct for food that it is all imitation etc in a sense this is true
but the automatic basis remains a chicken from an incubator needs no hen
to teach it to eat it seems to discover eating and drinking as it were
by chance at first eating awkwardly and eating everything until it
learns what will best satisfy its organic mechanism there is no instinct
for food it may be but there is an instinct which is only satisfied by
food it is the same with the sexual instinct the tentative and
omnivorous habits of the newly hatched chicken may be compared to the
uncertainty of the sexual instinct at puberty while the sexual pervert is
like a chicken that should carry on into adult age an appetite for worsted
and paper it may be added here that the question of the hereditary nature
of the sexual instinct has been exhaustively discussed and decisively
affirmed by moll in his untersuchungen ber die libido sexualis 1898
moll attaches importance to the inheritance of the normal aptitudes for
sexual reaction in an abnormally weak degree as a factor in the
development of sexual perversions
232 this view was revived in a modified form by ncke zeitschrift fr
die gesamte neurologie und psychiatrie vol xv heft 5 1913 who
supposed that there may be an anatomical homosexual center in the brain
ie a feminine libidocenter in the inverted man and a masculine
libidocenter in the inverted woman he expressed a hope that in the
future the brains of inverted persons would be more carefully
investigated
233 i do not present this view as more than a picture which helps us to
realize the actual phenomena which we witness in homosexuality although i
may add that so able a teratologist as dr jw ballantyne considers that
it seems a very possible theory
234 this explanation of homosexuality has already been tentatively put
forth thus iwan bloch sexual life of our time ch xix appendix
vaguely suggests a new theory of homosexuality as dependent on chemical
influences hirschfeld also believes die homosexualitt ch xx that

242 alcohol has sometimes been considered an important exciting cause of
homosexuality and alcoholism is certainly not uncommon in the heredity of
inverts according to hirschfeld die homosexualitt p 386 it is well
marked in one of the parents in over 21 per cent of cases but it
probably has no more influence as an exciting cause in the individual
homosexual person than in the individual heterosexual person from the
freudian standpoint indeed abraham believes zeitschrift fr

removes the inhibition from a latent homosexuality and juliusburger from
the same standpoint zentralblatt fr psychoanalyse heft 10 and 11
1912 thinks that the alcoholic tendency is unconsciously aroused by the
homosexual impulse in order to reach its own gratification but we may
accept nckes conclusions allgemeine zeitschrift fr psychiatrie vol

persons not predisposed that 2 it may arouse it in those who are
predisposed that 3 the action of alcohol is the same on the homosexual

having now completed the psychological analysis of the sexual invert so
far as i have been able to study him it only remains to speak briefly of
the attitude of society and the law first however a few words as to the
medical and hygienic aspects of inversion the preliminary question of the
prevention of homosexuality is in too vague a position at present to be
profitably discussed so far as the really congenital invert is concerned
prevention can have but small influence but sound social hygiene should
render difficult the acquisition of homosexual perversity or what has
been termed pseudohomosexuality it is the school which is naturally the
chief theater of immature and temporary homosexual manifestations partly
because school life largely coincides with the period during which the
sexual impulse frequently tends to be undifferentiated and partly because
in the traditions of large and old schools an artificial homosexuality is
often deeply rooted
    homosexuality in english schools has already been briefly
    referred to in chapter iii as a precise and interesting picture
    of the phenomena in french schools i may mention a story by
    albert nortal les adolescents passionns 1913 written
    immediately after the author left college though not published
    until more than twentyfive years later and clearly based on
    personal observation and experience as regards german schools
    see eg moll untersuchungen ber die libido sexualis p
    449 et seq and for sexual manifestations in early life
    generally the same authors sexual life of the child also

    1903 p 47 et seq and for references hirschfeld die
    homosexualitt p 46 et seq
while much may be done by physical hygiene and other means to prevent the
extension of homosexuality in schools243 it is impossible and even
undesirable to repress absolutely the emotional manifestations of sex in
either boys or girls who have reached the age of puberty244 it must
always be remembered that profoundly rooted organic impulses cannot be
effectually combated by direct methods writing of a period two centuries
ago casanova in relating his early life as a seminarist trained to the
priesthood describes the precautions taken to prevent the youths entering
each others beds and points out the folly of such precautions245 as
that master of the human heart remarks such prohibitions intensify the
very evil they are intended to prevent by invoking in its aid the impulse
to disobedience natural to every child of adam and eve and the
observation has often been repeated by teachers since we probably have to
recognize that a way to render such manifestations wholesome as well as
to prepare for the relationships of later life is the adoption so far as
possible of the method of coeducation of the sexes246not of course
necessarily involving identity of education for both sexessince a
certain amount of association between the sexes helps to preserve the
healthiness of the sexual emotional attitude association between the
sexes will not of course prevent the development of congenital
inversion in this connection it is pointed out by bethe that it was
precisely in sparta and lesbos where homosexuality was most ideally
cultivated that the sexes so far as we know associated more freely than
in any other greek state247
the question of the treatment of homosexuality must be approached with
discrimination caution and skepticism nowadays we can have but little
sympathy with those who at all costs are prepared to cure the invert
there is no sound method of cure in radical cases
at one time the seemingly very radical method of castration was advocated
and occasionally carried out as in a case i have recorded in a previous
chapter history xxvi like all methods of treatment it is sometimes
believed to have been successful by those who carried it out usually
after a short period it is found to be unsuccessful and in some cases
the condition especially the mental condition is rendered worse it is
not difficult to understand why this should be sexual inversion is not a
localized genital condition it is a diffused condition and firmly
imprinted on the whole psychic state there may be reasons for castration
or the slighter operation of vasectomy but although sexual tension may
be thereby diminished no authority now believes that any such operation
will affect the actual inversion castration of the body in adult age
cannot be expected to produce castration of the mind moll fr ncke
bloch rohleder hirschfeld are all either opposed to castration for
inversion or very doubtful as to any beneficial results
    in a case communicated to me by dr shufeldt an invert had
    himself castrated at the age of 26 to diminish sexual desire
    make himself more like a woman and to stop growth of beard but
    the only apparent physical effect he wrote was to increase my
    weight 10 per cent and render me a semiinvalid for the rest
    of my life after two years my sexuality decreased but that may
    have been due to satiety or to advancing years i was also
    rendered more easily irritated over trifles and more revengeful
    terrible criminal autosuggestions came into my head never
    experienced before fr revue de chirurgie march 10 1905
    published the case of an invert of english origin who had been
    castrated the inverted impulse remained unchanged as well as
    sexual desire and the aptitude for erection but neurasthenic
    symptoms which had existed before were aggravated he felt less
    capable to resist his impulses became migratory in his habits of
    life and addicted to the use of laudanum in a case recorded by
    ch hughes alienist and neurologist aug 1914 the results
    were less unsatisfactory in this case the dorsal nerve of the
    penis was first excised without any result see also alienist
    and neurologist feb 1904 p 70 as regards worse than
    useless results of cutting the pudic nerve and a year or so
    later the testes were removed and the patient gained tranquillity
    and satisfaction his homosexual inclinations appeared to go and
    he began to show inclination for asexualized women being
    specially anxious to meet with a woman whose ovaries had been
    removed on account of inversion reference may also be made to

    europischen boden neurologisches centralblatt 1909 no 5

more trust has usually been placed in the psychotherapeutical than the
surgical treatment of homosexuality at one time hypnotic suggestion was
carried out very energetically on homosexual subjects krafftebing seems
to have been the first distinguished advocate of hypnotism for application
to the homosexual dr von schrencknotzing displayed special zeal and
persistency in this treatment he undertook to treat even the most
pronounced cases of inversion by courses lasting more than a year and
involving in at least one case nearly one hundred and fifty hypnotic
sittings he prescribed frequent visits to the brothel previous to which
the patient took large doses of alcohol by prolonged manipulations a
prostitute endeavored to excite erection a process attended with varying
results it appears that in some cases this course of treatment was
attended by a certain sort of success to which an unlimited good will on
the part of the patient it is needless to say largely contributed the
treatment was however usually interrupted by continual backsliding to
homosexual practices and sometimes naturally the cure involved a
venereal disorder the patient was enabled to marry and to beget
children248 it is a method of treatment which seems to have found few
imitators this we need not regret the histories i have recorded in
previous chapters show that it is not uncommon for even a pronounced
invert to be able sometimes to effect coitus it often becomes easy if at
the time he fixes his thoughts on images connected with his own sex but
the perversion remains unaffected the subject is merely as one of molls
inverts expressed it practising masturbation per vaginam such
treatment is a training in vice and as raffalovich points out the
invert is simply perverted and brought down to the vicious level which
necessarily accompanies perversity249
there can be no doubt that in slight and superficial cases of
homosexuality suggestion may really exert an influence we can scarcely
expect it to exert such influence when the homosexual tendency is deeply
rooted in an organic inborn temperament in such cases indeed the subject
may resist suggestion even when in the hypnotic state this is pointed out
by moll a great authority on hypnotism and with much experience of its
application to homosexuality but never inclined to encourage an
exaggerated notion of its efficacy in this field forel who was also an
authority on hypnotism was equally doubtful as to its value in relation
to inversion especially in clearly inborn cases krafftebing at the end
said little about it and ncke who was himself without faith in this
method of treating inversion stated that he had been informed by the
last homosexual case treated by krafftebing by hypnotism that in spite
of all goodwill on the patients side the treatment had been quite
useless fr also had no belief in the efficacy of suggestive
treatment nor has merzbach nor rohleder numa praetorius states that the
homosexual subjects he is acquainted with who had been so treated were
not cured and hirschfeld remarks that the inverts cured by hypnotism
were either not cured or not inverted250
moll has shown his doubt as to the wide applicability of suggestive
therapeutics in homosexuality by developing in recent years what he terms
associationtherapy in nearly all perverse individuals he points out
there is a bridgemore or less weak no doubtwhich leads to the
normal sexual life by developing such links of association with
normality moll believes it may be possible to exert a healing influence
on the homosexual thus a man who is attracted to boys may be brought to
love a boyish woman251 indications of this kind have long been observed
and utilized though not developed into a systematic method of treatment
in the case of bisexual individuals or of youthful subjects whose
homosexuality is not fully developed it is probable that this method is
beneficial it is difficult to believe however that it possesses any
marked influence on pronounced and developed cases of inversion252
somewhat the same aim as molls associationtherapy though on the basis
of a more elaborate theory is sought by freuds psychoanalytic method of
treating homosexuality for the psychoanalytic theory to which reference
was made in the previous chapter the congenital element of inversion is a
rare and usually unimportant factor the chief part is played by perverse
psychic mechanisms it is the business of psychoanalysis to straighten
these out and from the bisexual constitution which is regarded as common
to every one to bring into the foreground the heterosexual elements and
so to reconstruct a normal personality developing new sexual ideals from
the patients own latent and subconscious nature sadger has especially
occupied himself with the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality and
claims many successes253 sadger admits that there are many limits to
the success of this treatment and that it cannot affect the inborn
factors of homosexuality when present other psychoanalysts are less
sanguine as to the cure of inversion stekel appears to have stated that
he has never seen a complete cure by psychoanalysis and ferenezi is not
able to give a good account of the results especially as regards what he
terms obsessional homosexuality he states that he has never succeeded in
effecting a complete cure although obsessions in general are especially
amenable to psychoanalysis254
i have met with at least two homosexual persons who had undergone
psychoanalytic treatment and found it beneficial one however was
bisexual so that the difficulties in the way of the successgranting it
to be realwere not serious in the other case the inversion persisted
after treatment exactly the same as before the benefit he received was
due to the fact that he was enabled to understand himself better and to
overcome some of his mental difficulties the treatment therefore in his
case was not a method of cure but of psychic hygiene of what hirschfeld
would call adaptationtherapy there can be no doubt thateven if we
put aside all effort at cure and regard an inverts condition as inborn
and permanenta large and important field of treatment here still
remains
as we have seen in the two previous chapters sexual inversion cannot be
regarded as essentially an insane or psychopathic state255 but it is
frequently associated with nervous conditions which may be greatly
benefited by hygiene and treatment without any attempt at all to overcome
a homosexual attitude which may be too deeply rooted to be changed the
invert is specially liable to suffer from a high degree of neurasthenia
often involving much nervous weakness and irritability loss of
selfcontrol and genital hyperesthesia256 hirschfeld finds that over
67 per cent inverts suffer from nervous troubles and among the cases
dealt with in the present study as shown in chapter v slight nervous
functional disturbances are very common these are conditions which may be
ameliorated and they may be treated in much the same way as if no
inversion existed by physical and mental tonics or if necessary
sedatives by regulated gymnastics and outofdoor exercises and by
occupations which employ without overexerting the mind very great and
permanent benefit may be obtained by a prolonged course of such mental and
physical hygiene the associated neurasthenic conditions may be largely
removed with the morbid fears suspicions and irritabilities that are
usually part of neurasthenia and the invert may be brought into a fairly
wholesome and tonic condition of selfcontrol
the inversion is not thus removed but if the patient is still young and
if the perversion does not appear to be deeply rooted in the organism it
is probable thatprovided his own goodwill is aidinggeneral hygienic
measures together with removal to a favorable environment may gradually
lead to the development of the normal sexual impulse if it fails to do
so it becomes necessary to exercise great caution in recommending
stronger methods purely platonic association with the other sex moll
points out leads to better results than any prescribed attempt at
coitus for even when such attempt is successful it is not usually
possible to regard the results with much satisfaction not only is the
acquisition of the normal instinct by an invert very much on a level with
the acquisition of a vice but probably it seldom succeeds in eradicating
the original inverted instinct257 what usually happens is that the
person becomes capable of experiencing both impulsesnot a specially
satisfactory state of things it may be disastrous especially if it leads
to marriage as it may do in an inverted man or still more easily in an
inverted woman the apparent change does not turn out to be deep and the
inverts position is more unfortunate than his original position both for
himself and for his wife258
it may be observed in the histories brought forward in chapter iii that
the position of married inverts we must of course put aside the
bisexual is usually more distressing than that of the unmarried among my
cases 14 per cent are married hirschfeld finds that 16 per cent of
inverts are married and 50 per cent are impotent he is unable to find a
single cure of homosexuality and seldom any improvement due to marriage
nearly always the impulse remains unaffected the inverts happiness is
however often affected for the worse and not least by the feeling that
he is depriving his wife of happiness an invert who had left his country
through fear of arrest and married a rich woman who was in love with him
said to hirschfeld five years imprisonment would not have been worse
than one year of marriage259 in a marriage of this kind the homosexual
partner and the normal partnerhowever ignorant of sexual mattersare
both conscious often with equal pain that even in the presence of
affection and esteem and the best will in the world there is something
lacking the instinctive and emotional element which is the essence of
sexual love and springs from the central core of organic personality
cannot voluntarily be created or even assumed260
for the sake of the possible offspring also marriage is to be avoided
it is sometimes entirely for the sake of children that the invert desires
to marry but it must be pointed out that homosexuality is undoubtedly in
many cases inherited often it is true the children turn out fairly
well but in many cases they bear witness that they belong to a neurotic
and failing stock261 hirschfeld goes so far as to say that it is always
so and concludes that from the eugenic standpoint the marriage of a
homosexual person is always very risky in a large number of cases such
marriages prove sterile the tendency to sexual inversion in eccentric and
neurotic families seems merely to be natures merciful method of winding
up a concern which from her point of view has ceased to be profitable
    as a rule inverts have no desire to be different from what they
    are and if they have any desire for marriage it is usually
    only momentary very pathetic appeals for help are however
    sometimes made i may quote from a letter addressed to me by a
    gentleman who desired advice on this matter in part i write to
    you as a moralist and in part as to a physician dr q has
    published a book in which without discussion hypnotic treatment
    of such cases was reported as successful i am eager to know if
    your opinion remains what it was this new assurance comes from a
    man whose moral firmness and delicacy are unquestionable but you
    will easily imagine how one might shrink from the implantation of
    new impulses in the unconscious self since newly created
    inclinations might disturb the conditions of life at any rate
    in my ignorance of hypnotism i fear that the effort to give the
    normal instinct might lead to marriage without the assurance that
    the normal instinct would be stable i write therefore to
    explain my present condition and crave your counsel it is with
    the greatest reluctance that i reveal the closely guarded secret
    of my life i have no other abnormality and have not hitherto
    betrayed my abnormal instinct i have never made any person the
    victim of passion moral and religious feelings were too
    powerful i have found my reverence for other souls a perfect
    safeguard against any approach to impurity i have never had
    sexual interest in women once i had a great friendship with a
    beautiful and noble woman without any mixture of sexual feeling
    on my part i was ignorant of my condition and i have the bitter
    regret of having caused in her a hopeless loveproudly and
    tragically concealed to her death my friendships with men
    younger men have been colored by passion against which i have
    fought continually the shame of this has made life a hell and
    the horror of this abnormality since i came to know it as such
    has been an enemy to my religious faith here there could be no
    case of a divinely given instinct which i was to learn to use in
    a rational and chaste fashion under the control of spiritual
    loyalty the power which gave me life seemed to insist on my
    doing that for which the same power would sting me with remorse
    if there is no remedy i must either cry out against the injustice
    of this life of torment between nature and conscience or submit
    to the blind trust of baffled ignorance if there is a remedy
    life will not seem to be such an intolerable ordeal i am not
    pleading that i must succumb to impulse i do not doubt that a
    pure celibate life is possible so far as action is concerned but
    i cannot discover that friendship with younger men can go on
    uncolored by a sensuous admixture which fills me with shame and
    loathing the gratification of passionnormal or abnormalis
    repulsive to esthetic feeling i am nearly 42 and i have always
    diverted myself from personal interests that threatened to become
    dangerous to me more than a year ago however a new fate seemed
    to open to my unhappy and lonely life i became intimate with a
    young man of 20 of the rarest beauty of form and character i am
    confident that he is and always has been pure he lives an
    exalted moral and religious life dominated by the idea that he
    and all men are partners of the divine nature and able in the
    strength of that nature to be free from evil i believe him to be
    normal he shows pleasure in the society of attractive young
    women and in an innocent lighthearted way refers to the time
    when he may be able to marry he is a general favorite but
    turned to me as to a friend and teacher he is poor and it was
    possible for me to guarantee him a good education i began to
    help him from the longings of a lonely life i wanted a son and
    a friend in my inward desolation i craved the companionship of
    this pure and happy nature i felt such a reverence for him that
    i hoped to find the sensuous element in me purged away by his
    purity i am indeed utterly incapable of doing him harm i am
    not morally weak nevertheless the sensuous element is there and
    it poisons my happiness he is ardently affectionate and
    demonstrative he spends the summers with me in europe and the
    tenderness he feels for me has prompted him at times to embrace
    and kiss me as he always has done to his father of late i have
    begun to fear that without will or desire i may injure the
    springs of feeling in him especially if it is true that the
    homosexual tendency is latent in most men the love he shows me
    is my joy but a poisoned joy it is the bread and wine of life
    to me but i dare not think what his ardent affection might ripen
    into i can go on fighting the battle of good and evil in my
    attachment to him but i cannot define my duty to him to shun
    him would be cruelty and would belie his trust in human fidelity
    without my friendship he will not take my moneythe condition of
    a large career i might indeed explain to him what i explain to
    you but the ordeal and shame are too great and i cannot see
    what good it would do if he has the capacity of homosexual
    feeling he might be violently stimulated if he is incapable of
    it he would feel repulsion
    suppose then that i should seek hypnotic treatment i still do
    not know what tricks an abnormal nature might play me when
    diverted by suggestion i might lose the joy of this friendship
    without any compensation i am afraid i am afraid might i not
    be influenced to shun the only persons who inspire unselfish
    feeling
    bear with this account of my story many virtues are easy for
    me and my life is spent in pursuits of culture alas that all
    the culture with which i am credited all the prayers and
    aspirations all the strong will and heroic resolves have not rid
    my nature of this evil bent what i long for is the right to
    love not for the mere physical gratification for the right to
    take another into the arms of my heart and profess all the
    tenderness i feel to find my joy in planning his career with
    him as one who is rightfully and naturally entitled to do so i
    crave this since i cannot have a son i leave the matter here
    when i read what i have written i see how pointless it is it is
    possible indeed that brooding over my personal calamity
    magnifies in my mind the sense of danger to this friend through
    me and that i only need to find the right relation of
    friendliness coupled with aloofness which will secure him against
    any too ardent attachment certainly i have no fear that i shall
    forget myself yet two things array themselves on the other
    side i rebel inwardly against the necessity of isolating myself
    as if i were a pestilence and i rebel against the taint of
    sensuous feeling the normal man can feel that his instinct is no
    shame when the spirit is in control i know that to the
    consciousness of others my instinct itself would be a shame and a
    baseness and i have no tendency to construct a moral system for
    myself i have to be sure moments when i declare to myself that
    i will have my sensuous gratification as well as other men but
    the moment i think of the wickedness of it the rebellion is soon
    over the disesteem of self the sense of taint the necessity of
    withdrawing from happiness lest i communicate my taint that is a
    spiritual malady which makes the groundtone of my existence one
    of pain and melancholy should you have only some moral
    consolation without the promise of medical assistance i should
    feel grateful
    in such a case as this one can do little more than advise the
    sufferer that however painful his lot may be it is not without
    its consolations and that he would be best advised to pursue as
    cheerfully as may be the path that he has already long since
    marked out for himself the invert sometimes fails to realize
    that for no man with high moral ideals however normal he may be
    is the conduct of life easy and that if the invert has to be
    satisfied with affection without passion and to live a life of
    chastity he is doing no more than thousands of normal men have
    done voluntarily and contentedly as to hypnotism in such a case
    as this it is altogether unreasonable to expect that suggestion
    will supplant the deeply rooted organic impulses that have grown
    up during a lifetime
we may thus conclude that in the treatment of inversion the most
satisfactory result is usually obtained when it is possible by direct and
indirect methods to reduce the sexual hyperesthesia which frequently
exists and by psychic methods to refine and spiritualize the inverted
impulse so that the inverts natural perversion may not become a cause of
acquired perversity in others the invert is not only the victim of his
own abnormal obsession he is the victim of social hostility we must seek
to distinguish the part in his sufferings due to these two causes when i
review the cases i have brought forward and the mental history of inverts
i have known i am inclined to say that if we can enable an invert to be
healthy selfrestrained and selfrespecting we have often done better than
to convert him into the mere feeble simulacrum of a normal man an appeal
to the paiderastia of the best greek days and the dignity temperance
even chastity which it involved will sometimes find a ready response in
the emotional enthusiastic nature of the congenital invert platos
dialogues have frequently been found a source of great help and
consolation by inverts the manly love celebrated by walt whitman in
leaves of grass although it may be of more doubtful value for general
use furnishes a wholesome and robust ideal to the invert who is
insensitive to normal ideals262
    among recent books iolus an anthology of friendship edited
    by edward carpenter may be recommended a similar book in
    german of a more extended character is lieblingminne und
    freudesliebe in der weltliteratur edited by elisr von kupffer
    mention may also be made of the freundschaft 1912 of baron
    von gleichenrusswurm a sort of literary history of friendship
    without specific reference to homosexuality although many
    writers of inverted tendency are introduced platens
    tagebcher are notable as the diary of an invert of high
    character and ideals the volumes of the jahrbuch fr sexuelle
    zwischenstufen contain many studies bearing on the ideal and
    esthetic aspects of homosexuality
    various modern poets of high ability have given expression to
    emotions of exalted or passionate friendship toward individuals
    of the same sex whether or not such friendship can properly be
    termed homosexual it is scarcely necessary to refer to in
    memoriam in which tennyson enshrined his affection for his
    early friend arthur hallam and developed a picture of the
    universe on the basis of that affection the poems of edward
    cracroft lefroy are notable and mr john gambril nicholson has
    privately issued several volumes of verse a chaplet of
    southernwood a garland of ladslove etc showing delicate
    charm combined with high technical skill some books mainly or
    entirely written in prose may fairly be included in the same
    group such are in the key of blue by john addington symonds
    and the memoirs of arthur hamilton published anonymously by a
    wellknown author ac benson in which on somewhat platonic
    lines the idea is worked out that the individual sufferer must
    pass from the love of one fair form to the love of abstract
    beauty and from the contemplation of his own suffering to the
    consideration of the root of all human suffering
    as regards the modern poetic literature of feminine homosexuality
    there is probably nothing to put beside the various
    volumespathetic in their brave simplicity and sincerityof
    rene vivien see ante p 200 most other feminine singers
    of homosexuality have cautiously thrown a veil of heterosexuality
    over their songs
    novels of a more or less definitely homosexual tone are now very
    numerous in english french german and other languages in
    english the homosexuality is for the most part veiled and the
    narrative deals largely with schoollife and boys in order that
    the emotional and romantic character of the relations described
    may appear more natural thus tim an anonymously published
    book by ho sturgis 1891 described the devotion of a boy to
    an older boy at eton and his death at an early age jaspar
    tristram by aw clarke 1899 again is a wellwritten story
    of a schoolboy friendship of homosexual tone a boy is
    represented as feeling attraction to boys who are like girls and
    a girl became attractive to the hero because she is like a boy
    and recalls her brother whom he had formerly loved the garden
    god a tale of two boys by forrest reid 1905 is another
    rather similar book in its way a charming and delicately written
    idyll imre a memorandum 1906 by xavier mayne the
    pseudonym of an american author who has also written the
    intersexes privately issued at naples is a book of a
    different class representing the frankly homosexual passion of
    two mutually attracted men an englishman who is supposed to
    write the story and a hungarian officer it embodies a notable
    narrative of homosexual development which is probably more or
    less real
    in french there are a number of novels dealing with
    homosexuality sometimes sympathetically sometimes with artistic
    indifference sometimes satirically andr gide in
    limmoraliste and other books rachilde madame vallette
    willy in the wellknown claudine series may be mentioned
    among other writers of more or less distinction who have once or
    oftener dealt with homosexuality special reference should be
    made to the belgian author george eekhoud whose escalvigor
    prosecuted at bruges on its publication is a book of special
    power the homosexual stories of essebac of which lelu
    1902 is considered the best are of a romantic and sentimental
    character lucien 1910 by binetvalmer is a penetrating and
    scarcely sympathetic study of inversion nortals les
    adolescents passionns already mentioned p 325 is a notably
    intimate and precise study of homosexuality in french schools it
    would be easy to mention many others
    in germany during recent years many novels of homosexual
    character have been published they are not usually it would
    seem of high literary character but are sometimes notable as
    being more or less disguised narratives of real fact bodys aus
    eines mannes mdchenjahren is said to be a faithful
    autobiography der neue werther eine hellenische
    passionsgeschichte by narkissos 1902 is also said to be
    authentic another book that may be mentioned is konradins ein
    junger platos aus dem leben eines entgbeistes 1914 the
    german belletristic literature of homosexuality as well as that
    of other countries will be found adequately summarized and
    criticised by numa praetorius in the volumes of the jahrbuch fr
    sexuelle zwischenstufen see also hirschfelds die
    homosexualitt pp 47 and 1018 et seq
it is by some such method of selftreatment as this that most of the more
highly intelligent men and women whose histories i have already briefly
recorded have at last slowly and instinctively reached a condition of
relative health and peace both physical and moral the method of
selfrestraint and selfculture without selfrepression seems to be the
most rational method of dealing with sexual inversion when that condition
is really organic and deeply rooted it is better that a man should be
enabled to make the best of his own strong natural instincts with all
their disadvantages than that he should be unsexed and perverted crushed
into a position which he has no natural aptitude to occupy as both
raffalovich and fr have insisted it is the ideal of chastity rather
than of normal sexuality which the congenital invert should hold before
his eyes he may not have in him the making of lhomme moyen sensuel he
may have in him the making of a saint263 what good work in the world
the inverted may do is shown by the historical examples of distinguished
inverts and while it is certainly true that these considerations apply
chiefly to the finergrained natures the histories i have brought
together suffice to show that such natures constitute a considerable
proportion of inverts the helplessly gross sexual appetite cannot thus be
influenced but that remains true whether the appetite is homosexual or
heterosexual and nothing is gained by enabling it to feed on women as
well as on men
a strictly ascetic life it needs scarcely be said is with difficulty
possible for all persons either homosexual or heterosexual it is
however outside the province of the physician to recommend his inverted
patients to live according to their homosexual impulses even when those
impulses seem to be natural to the person displaying them the most that
the physician is entitled to do it seems to me is to present the
situation clearly and leave to the patient a decision for which he must
himself accept the responsibility forel goes so far as to say that he
sees no reason why inverts should not build cities of their own and marry
each other if they so please since they can do no harm to normal adults
while children can be protected from them264 such notions are however
too far removed from our existing social conventions to be worth serious
consideration
    the standpoint here taken up it may be remarked by no means
    denies to the invert a right to the fulfillment of his impulses
    numa praetorius remarks it would seem justly that while the
    invert must properly be warned against unnatural sexual license
    and while those who are capable of continence do well to preserve
    it to deny all right to sexual activity to the invert merely
    causes those inverts who are incapable of selfcontrol to throw
    recklessly aside all restraints zeitschrift fr sexuelle
    zwischenstufen vol viii 1906 p 726 the invert has the
    right to sexual indulgence it may be but he has also the duty
    to accept the full responsibility for his own actions and the
    necessity to recognize the present attitude of the society he
    lives in he cannot be advised to set himself in violent
    opposition to that society
    the world will not be a tolerable place for pronounced inverts
    until they are better understood and that will involve a radical
    change in general and even medical opinion an inverted
    physician of high character and successful in his profession
    writes to me on this point the first and easiest thing to do
    it seems to me is to convince the medical profession that we
    unfortunate people are not only as sane but as moral as our
    normal brothers and that we are even more alive to the supreme
    necessity of selfcontrol necessary from every point of view
    than they it is not license we want but justice it is the
    cruelty and prejudice of convention which we wish to abolishnot
    the proper and just indignation of society with crimes against
    the social order we want to make it possible for us to satisfy
    our inborn instincts which are not concerned essentially with
    sexual acts so called alone without thereby becoming
    criminals one of us who would under any circumstances seduce a
    person of his own sex of immature age and particularly one whose
    sexual complexion was unknown deserves the severe punishment
    which would be meted out to a normal person who did the same to a
    young girlbut no more while so long as no public offense is
    given there should be no penalty or obloquy whatever attached
    to sexual acts committed with full consent between mature
    persons these acts may or may not be wrong and immoral just as
    sexual acts between mature persons of different sexes may or may
    not be wrong or immoral but in neither case has the law any
    concern and public opinion should make no distinction between
    the two it is in the highest degree important that it should be
    clearly understood that we want no relaxation of moral
    obligations at present we suffer an inconceivably cruel wrong
we have always to remember and there is indeed no possibility of
forgetting that the question of homosexuality is a social question
within certain limits the gratification of the normal sexual impulse
even outside marriage arouses no general or profound indignation and is
regarded as a private matter rightly or wrongly the gratification of the
homosexual impulse is regarded as a public matter this attitude is more
or less exactly reflected in the law thus it happens that whenever a man
is openly detected in a homosexual act however exemplary his life may
previously have been however admirable it may still be in all other
relations every ordinary normal citizen however licentious and
pleasureloving his own life may be feels it a moral duty to regard the
offender as hopelessly damned and to help in hounding him out of society
at very brief intervals cases occur and without reaching the newspapers
are more or less widely known in which distinguished men in various
fields not seldom clergymen suddenly disappear from the country or
commit suicide in consequence of some such exposure or the threat of it
it is probable that many obscure tragedies could find their explanation in
a homosexual cause
    some of the various tragic ways in which homosexual passions are
    revealed to society may be illustrated by the following
    communication from a correspondent not himself inverted who
    here narrates cases that came under his observation in various
    parts of the united states the cases referred to will be known
    to many but i have disguised the names of persons and places
    at the age of 14 i was a chorister at  church whose
    choirmaster an englishman named mwm was an accomplished man
    seemingly a perfect gentleman and a devout churchman he never
    seemed to care for the society of ladies never mingled much with
    the men but sought companionship with the choristers of my age
    he frequently visited at the homes of his favorites to tea and
    when he asked the parents consent for georges or franks
    company on an excursion or to the theater and then to spend the
    night with him such request was invariably granted i shall ever
    remember my first night with him he began by fondling and
    caressing me quieting my alarm by assurances of not hurting me
    and after invoking me to secrecy and with promises of many future
    pleasures i consented to his desire or passion which he seemed
    to satisfy by an attempt at fellatio was this depravity i
    would say no after reading his subsequent confession found in
    his room after his death by suicide this was brought about by
    his too intimate relations with the rectors son who contracted
    st vituss dance and in the delirium of a fever that followed
    from nervous exhaustion told of him and his doings a thorough
    investigation took place and m fled a brokenhearted and
    disgraced man who as the result of remorse relentless
    persecution and exposure through several years ended his life
    by drowning himself in his confession he spoke of having been
    raised under a very strong moral restraint and having lived an
    exemplary life with the exception of this strange desire that
    his willpower could not control
    the next case is that of ch he came of an old family of brainy
    men who have and do yet occupy prominent places in the pulpit
    and the bar and was himself a gifted young attorney i knew him
    intimately as for six years he was a close neighbor and we were
    associated in lodgework he was an effeminate little fellow
    height 5 feet 2 inches weight 105 pounds very nearsighted
    and he had a light voice not a treble or falsetto but still a
    voice that detracted materially from the beautiful rhetoric that
    flowed from his lips he had served his country as its
    representative in the legislature and had received the nomination
    for senator over a hardfought political battle the last
    canvass and speeches were made at a town which was in
    consequence crowded that night h had to occupy a room with a
    stranger named e a travelling salesman there were two beds in
    this room mr e on the following day told several people that
    during the night he was awakened by h who had come over to his
    bed and had his mouth on his person and that he had threatened
    to kick him out of the room but that h pleaded with him and
    fell on his knees and swore that he had been overcome by a
    passion that he had heretofore controlled and begged of him not
    to expose him these facts coming to the notice of his opponents
    within twentyfour hours they hastened to take advantage of it
    by placarding h as a second oscar wilde and stating the facts
    as far as decency and the law allowed hs friends came to him
    and gave him one of two alternatives if guilty either to kill
    himself or leave that section forever if not guilty to slay his
    traducer eh affirmed his innocence and in company with two
    friends c and j took the train for  learning there that
    e was at a town twelve miles east they hired a fast livery and
    drove overland they found e at the station awaiting the
    arrival of a train h with a pistol strode forward and in his
    excitement said you exposed me did you being nearsighted
    his aim proved wide of the mark e sprang forward and grappled
    with h for possession of the pistol and was fired upon by c
    and j who shot him in the back he expired in a few minutes
    his last statement being to the effect that h was guilty as
    accused h c and j were sentenced to the penitentiary for
    life during my six years acquaintance with h i knew of nothing
    derogatory to his character nor has anyone ever come forward to
    say that on any other occasion he ever displayed this weakness i
    know his early life had a pure atmosphere as he was an only
    child and the idol of both his parents who builded high their
    hopes of his future success and who survive this disgrace but
    are brokenhearted
    the next case is that of the rev tw professor at the
    university of  mr w is a scholarly gentleman affable in
    his address eloquent in his oratory and a fine classical
    scholar he was exposed by some of his students who to use a
    slang phrase accused him of being a headworker at his
    examination by the faculty he confessed his weakness and said
    he could not control his unholy passion his resignation was
    accepted both by the church and the college and he left
    i know of a few other cases that have their peculiar traits and
    am confident that these persons did not become possessed of this
    habit through the socalled indiscretions of youth as in every
    case their early life was freer from contamination than that of
    90 per cent of the boys who on reaching mans estate have
    like myself no desire to deviate from the oldfashioned way
    formulated by our ancient sire adam
it can scarcely be said that the consciousness of this attitude of society
is favorable to the inverts attainment of a fairly sane and wellbalanced
state of mind this is indeed one of the great difficulties in his way
and often causes him to waver between extremes of melancholia and
egotistic exaltation we regard all homosexuality with absolute and
unmitigated disgust we have been taught to venerate alexander the great
epaminondas socrates and other antique heroes but they are safely
buried in the remote past and do not affect our scorn of homosexuality in
the present
it was in the fourth century at rome that the strong modern opposition
to homosexuality was first clearly formulated in law265 the roman race
had long been decaying sexual perversions of all kinds flourished the
population was dwindling at the same time christianity with its
judaicpauline antagonism to homosexuality was rapidly spreading the
statesmen of the day anxious to quicken the failing pulses of national
life utilized this powerful christian feeling constantine theodosius
and valentinian all passed laws against homosexuality the last at all
events ordaining as penalty the vindices flamm but their enactments
do not seem to have been strictly carried out in the year 538 justinian
professing terror of certain famines earthquakes and pestilences in
which he saw the mysterious recompense which was meet prophesied by st
paul266 issued his edict condemning unnatural offenders to the sword
lest as the result of these impious acts as the preamble to his novella
77 has it whole cities should perish together with their inhabitants
for we are taught by holy scripture that through these acts cities have
perished with the men in them267 this edict which justinian followed
up by a fresh ordinance to the same effect constituted the foundation of
legal enactment and social opinion concerning the matter in europe for
thirteen hundred years268 in france the vindices flamm survived to
the last st louis had handed over these sacrilegious offenders to the
church to be burned in 1750 two pederasts were burned in the place de
grve and only a few years before the revolution a capuchin monk named
pascal was also burned
after the revolution however began a new movement which has continued
slowly and steadily ever since though it still divides european nations
into two groups justinian charlemagne and st louis had insisted on the
sin and sacrilege of sodomy as the ground for its punishment269 it was
doubtless largely as a religious offense that the code napolon omitted
to punish it the french law makes a clear and logical distinction between
crime on the one hand vice and irreligion on the other only concerning
itself with the former homosexual practices in private between two
consenting adult parties whether men or women are absolutely unpunished
by the code napolon and by french law of today only under three
conditions does the homosexual act come under the cognizance of the law
as a crime 1 when there is outrage public  la pudeurie when
the act is performed in public or with a possibility of witnesses 2
when there is violence or absence of consent in whatever degree the act
may have been consummated 3 when one of the parties is under age or
unable to give valid consent in some cases it appears possible to apply
article 334 of the penal code directed against habitual excitation to
debauch of young persons of either sex under the age of 21
this method of dealing with unnatural offenses has spread widely at first
because of the political influence of france and more recently because
such an attitude has commended itself on its merits in belgium the law is
similar to that of the code napolon as it is also in italy spain
portugal roumania japan and numerous south american lands in
switzerland the law is a little vague and varies slightly in the different
cantons but it is not severe in geneva and some other cantons there is
no penalty the general tendency is to inflict brief imprisonment when
serious complaints have been lodged and cases can sometimes be settled
privately by the magistrate
the only large european countries in which homosexuality per se remains
a penal offense appear to be germany austria russia and england in
several of the german states such as bavaria and hanover simple
homosexuality formerly went unpunished but when the laws of prussia were
in 1871 applied to the new german empire this ceased to be the case and
unnatural carnality between males became an offense against the law this
article of the german code section 175 has caused great discussion and
much practical difficulty because although the terms of the law make it
necessary to understand by widernatrliche unzucht other practices
besides pdicatio not every homosexual practice is included it must be
some practice resembling normal coitus there is a widespread opinion that
this article of the code should be abolished it appears that at one time
an authoritative committee pronounced in favor of this step and their
proposition came near adoption the austrian law is somewhat similar to
the german but it applies to women as well as to men this is logical
for there is no reason why homosexuality should be punished in men and
left unpunished in women in russia the law against homosexual practices
appears to be very severe involving in some cases banishment to siberia
and deprivation of civil rights but it can scarcely be rigorously
executed
the existing law in england is severe but simple carnal knowledge per
anum of either a man or a woman or an animal is punishable by a sentence
of penal servitude with not less than three years or of imprisonment with
not more than two years even gross indecency between males however
privately committed has been since 1885 a penal offense270 the clause
is open to criticism with the omission of the words or private it
would be sound and in harmony with the most enlightened european
legislation but it must be pointed out that an act only becomes indecent
when those who perform it or witness it regard it as indecent the act
which brought each of us into the world is not indecent it would become
so if carried on in public if two male persons who have reached years of
discretion consent together to perform some act of sexual intimacy in
private no indecency has been committed if one of the consenting parties
subsequently proclaims the act indecency may doubtless be created as may
happen also in the case of normal sexual intercourse but it seems
contrary to good policy that such proclamation should convert the act
itself into a penal offense moreover gross indecency between males
usually means some form of mutual masturbation no penal code regards
masturbation as an offense and there seems to be no sufficient reason why
mutual masturbation should be so regarded271 the main point to be
insured is that no boy or girl who has not reached years of discretion
should be seduced or abused by an older person and this point is equally
well guaranteed on the basis introduced by the code napolon however
shameful disgusting personally immoral and indirectly antisocial it may
be for two adult persons of the same sex men or women to consent
together to perform an act of sexual intimacy in private there is no
sound or adequate ground for constituting such act a penal offense by law
one of the most serious objections to the legal recognition of private
gross indecency is the obvious fact that only in the rarest cases can
such indecency become known to the police and we thus perpetrate what is
very much like a legal farce the breaking of few laws as moll truly
observes regarding the german law so often goes unpunished as of this
it is the same in england as is amply evidenced by the fact that of the
english sexual inverts whose histories i have obtained not one so far
as i am aware has ever appeared in a policecourt on this charge
it may further be pointed out that legislation against homosexuality has
no clear effect either in diminishing or increasing its prevalence this
must necessarily be so as regards the kernel of the homosexual group if
we are to regard a considerable proportion of cases as congenital in
france homosexuality per se has been untouched by the law for a century
yet it abounds chiefly it seems among the lowest in the community
although the law is silent social feeling is strong and whenas has
been the case in one instancea man of undoubted genius has his name
associated with this perversion it becomes difficult or impossible for the
admirers of his work to associate with him personally very few cases of
homosexuality have been recorded in france among the more intelligent
classes the literature of homosexuality is there little more than the
literature of male prostitution as described by policeofficials and as
carried on largely for the benefit of foreigners in germany and austria
where the law against homosexuality is severe it abounds also perhaps
to a much greater extent than in france272 it certainly asserts itself
more vigorously a far greater number of cases have been recorded than in
any other country and the german literature of homosexuality is very
extensive often issued in popular form and sometimes enthusiastically
eulogistic in england the law is exceptionally severe yet according to
the evidence of those who have an international acquaintance with these
matters homosexuality is fully as prevalent as on the continent some
would say that it is more so much the same is true of the united states
though there is less to be seen on the surface it cannot therefore be
said that legislative enactments have very much influence on the
prevalence of homosexuality the chief effect seems to be that the attempt
at suppression arouses the finer minds among sexual inverts to undertake
the enthusiastic defense of homosexuality while coarser minds are
stimulated to cynical bravado273
    as regards the prevalence of homosexuality in the united states
    i may quote from a wellinformed american correspondent
    the great prevalence of sexual inversion in american cities is
    shown by the wide knowledge of its existence ninetynine normal
    men out of a hundred have been accosted on the streets by
    inverts or have among their acquaintances men whom they know to
    be sexually inverted everyone has seen inverts and knows what
    they are the public attitude toward them is generally a negative
    oneindifference amusement contempt
    the world of sexual inverts is indeed a large one in any
    american city and it is a community distinctly organizedwords
    customs traditions of its own and every city has its numerous
    meetingplaces certain churches where inverts congregate
    certain cafs well known for the inverted character of their
    patrons certain streets where at night every fifth man is an
    invert the inverts have their own clubs with nightly
    meetings these clubs are really dancehalls attached to
    saloons and presided over by the proprietor of the saloon
    himself almost invariably an invert as are all the waiters and
    musicians the frequenters of these places are male sexual
    inverts usually ranging from 17 to 30 years of age sightseers
    find no difficulty in gaining entrance truly they are welcomed
    for the drinks they buy for the companyand other reasons
    singing and dancing turns by certain favorite performers are the
    features of these gatherings with much gossip and drinking at
    the small tables ranged along the four walls of the room the
    habitus of these places are generally inverts of the most
    pronounced type ie the completely feminine in voice and
    manners with the characteristic hip motion in their walk though
    i have never seen any approach to feminine dress there doubtless
    the desire for it is not wanting and only police regulations
    relegate it to other occasions and places you will rightly infer
    that the police know of these places and endure their existence
    for a consideration it is not unusual for the inquiring stranger
    to be directed there by a policeman
    the oscar wilde trial see ante p 48 with its wide
    publicity and the fundamental nature of the questions it
    suggested appears to have generally contributed to give
    definiteness and selfconsciousness to the manifestations of
    homosexuality and to have aroused inverts to take up a definite
    attitude i have been assured in several quarters that this is so
    and that since that case the manifestations of homosexuality have
    become more pronounced one correspondent writes
    up to the time of the oscar wilde trial i had not known what the
    condition of the law was the moral question in itselfits
    relation to my own life and that of my friendsi reckoned i had
    solved but i now had to ask myself how far i was justified in
    not only breaking the law but in being the cause of a like
    breach in others and others younger than myself i have never
    allowed the dictum of the law to interfere with what i deemed
    to be a moral development in any youth for whom i am responsible
    i cannot say that the trial made me alter my course of life of
    the rightness of which i was too convincingly persuaded but it
    made me much more careful and it probably sharpened my sense of
    responsibility for the young reviewing the results of the trial
    as a whole it doubtless did incalculable harm and it
    intensified our national vice of hypocrisy but i think it also
    may have done some good in that it made those who like myself
    have thought and experienced deeply in the matterand these must
    be no small fewready to strike a blow when the time comes
    for what we deem to be right honorable and clean
    from america a lady writes with reference to the moral position
    of inverts though without allusion to the wilde trial
    inverts should have the courage and independence to be
    themselves and to demand an investigation if one strives to
    live honorably and considers the greatest good to the greatest
    number it is not a crime nor a disgrace to be an invert i do
    not need the law to defend me neither do i desire to have any
    concessions made for me nor do i ask my friends to sacrifice
    their ideals for me i too have ideals which i shall always hold
    all that i desireand i claim it as my rightis the freedom to
    exercise this divine gift of loving which is not a menace to
    society nor a disgrace to me let it once be understood that the
    average invert is not a moral degenerate nor a mental degenerate
    but simply a man or a woman who is less highly specialized less
    completely differentiated than other men and women and i
    believe the prejudice against them will disappear and if they
    live uprightly they will surely win the esteem and consideration
    of all thoughtful people i know what it means to an invertwho
    feels himself set apart from the rest of mankindto find one
    human heart who trusts him and understands him and i know how
    almost impossible this is and will be until the world is made
    aware of these facts
but while the law has had no more influence in repressing abnormal
sexuality than wherever it has tried to do so it has had in repressing
the normal sexual instinct it has served to foster another offense what
is called blackmailing in england chantage in france and erpressung
in germanyin other words the extortion of money by threats of exposing
some real or fictitious offensefinds its chief field of activity in
connection with homosexuality274 no doubt the removal of the penalty
against simple homosexuality does not abolish blackmailing as the
existence of this kind of chantage in france shows but it renders its
success less probable
on all these grounds and taking into consideration the fact that the
tendency of modern legislation generally and the consensus of
authoritative opinion in all countries are in this direction it seems
reasonable to conclude that neither sodomy ie immissio membri in
anum hominis vel mulieris nor gross indecency ought to be penal
offenses except under certain special circumstances that is to say that
if two persons of either or both sexes having reached years of
discretion275 privately consent to practise some perverted mode of
sexual relationship the law cannot be called upon to interfere it should
be the function of the law in this matter to prevent violence to protect
the young and to preserve public order and decency whatever laws are
laid down beyond this must be left to the individuals themselves to the
moralists and to social opinion
at the same time and while such a modification in the law seems to be
reasonable the change effected would be less considerable than may appear
at first sight in a very large proportion indeed of cases boys are
involved it is instructive to observe that in legludics 246 cases
including victims and aggressors together in france 127 or more than
half were between the ages of 10 and 20 and 82 or exactly onethird
were between the ages of 10 and 14 a very considerable field of operation
is thus still left for the law whatever proportion of cases may meet with
no other penalty than social opinion
that however social opinionlaw or no lawwill speak with no uncertain
voice is very evident once homosexuality was primarily a question of
population or of religion now we hear little either of its economic
aspects or of its sacrilegiousness it is for us primarily a disgusting
abomination ie a matter of taste of esthetics and while unspeakably
ugly to the majority it is proclaimed as beautiful by a small minority i
do not know that we need find fault with this esthetic method of judging
homosexuality but it scarcely lends itself to legal purposes to indulge
in violent denunciation of the disgusting nature of homosexuality and to
measure the sentence by the disgust aroused or to regret as one english
judge is reported to have regretted when giving sentence that gross
indecency is not punishable by death is to import utterly foreign
considerations into the matter the judges who yield to this temptation
would certainly never allow themselves to be consciously influenced on the
bench by their political opinions yet esthetic opinions are quite as
foreign to law as political opinions an act does not become criminal
because it is disgusting to eat excrement as moll remarks is extremely
disgusting but it is not criminal the confusion which thus exists even
in the legal mind between the disgusting and the criminal is additional
evidence of the undesirability of the legal penalty for simple
homosexuality at the same time it shows that social opinion is amply
adequate to deal with the manifestations of inverted sexuality so much
for the legal aspects of sexual inversion
but while there can be no doubt about the amply adequate character of the
existing social reaction to all manifestations of perverted sexuality the
question still remains how far not merely the law but also the state of
public opinion should be modified in the light of such a psychological
study as we have here undertaken it is clear that this public opinion
molded chiefly or entirely with reference to gross vice tends to be
unduly violent in its reaction what then is the reasonable attitude of
society toward the congenital sexual invert it seems to lie in the
avoidance of two extremes on the one hand it cannot be expected to
tolerate the invert who flouts his perversion in its face and assumes
that because he would rather take his pleasure with a soldier or a
policeman than with their sisters he is of finer clay than the vulgar
herd on the other it might well refrain from crushing with undiscerning
ignorance beneath a burden of shame the subject of an abnormality which
as we have seen has not been found incapable of fine uses inversion is
an aberration from the usual course of nature but the clash of contending
elements which must often mark the history of such a deviation results now
and againby no means infrequentlyin nobler activities than those
yielded by the vast majority who are born to consume the fruits of the
earth it bears for the most part its penalty in the structure of its
own organism we are bound to protect the helpless members of society
against the invert if we go farther and seek to destroy the invert
himself before he has sinned against society we exceed the warrant of
reason and in so doing we may perhaps destroy also those children of
the spirit which possess sometimes a greater worth than the children of
the flesh
here we may leave this question of sexual inversion in dealing with it i
have sought to avoid that attitude of moral superiority which is so common
in the literature of this subject and have refrained from pointing out
how loathsome this phenomenon is or how hideous that such an attitude is
as much out of place in scientific investigation as it is in judicial
investigation and may well be left to the amateur the physician who
feels nothing but disgust at the sight of disease is unlikely to bring
either succor to his patients or instruction to his pupils
that the investigation we have here pursued is not only profitable to us
in succoring the social organism and its members but also in bringing
light into the region of sexual psychology is now i hope clear to every
reader who has followed me to this point there are a multitude of social
questions which we cannot face squarely and honestly unless we possess
such precise knowledge as has been here brought together concerning the
part played by the homosexual tendency in human life moreover the study
of this perverted tendency stretches beyond itself
                            oer that art
    which you say adds to nature is an art
    that nature makes
pathology is but physiology working under new conditions the stream of
nature still flows into the bent channel of sexual inversion and still
runs according to law we have not wasted our time in this toilsome
excursion with the knowledge here gained we are the better equipped to
enter upon the study of the wider questions of sex

255 this is now generally recognized see eg roubinovitch and borel
un cas duranisme lencphale aug 1913 these authors conclude
that it is today impossible to look upon inversion as the equivalent or
the symptom of a psychopathic state though we have to recognize that it
frequently coexists with morbid emotional states ncke also in his
extensive experience found that homosexuality is rare in asylums and
slight in character he dealt with this question on various occasions
see eg jahrbuch fr sexuelle zwischenstufen vol viii 1906
256 krafftebing considered that the temporary or lasting association of
homosexuality with neurasthenia having its root in congenital conditions
is almost invariable and some authorities like meynert have regarded
inversion as an accidental growth on the foundation of neurasthenia
257 fr expressed himself concerning the general treatment of
homosexuality in the same sense and even more emphatically fr
linstinct sexuel 1899 pp 272 286 he considers that all forms of
congenital inversion resist treatment and that since a change in the
inverts instincts must be regarded rather as a perversion of the invert
than a cure of the inversion one may be permitted to doubt not only the
utility of the treatment but even the legitimacy of attempting it the
treatment of sexual inversion he declared is as much outside the
province of medicine as the restoration of colorvision in the
colorblind the ideal which the physician and the teacher must place
before the invert is that of chastity he must seek to harness his wagon
to a star
258 i have been told by a distinguished physician who was consulted in
the case of a congenital invert highly placed in the english government
service who married in the hope of escaping his perversion and was not
even able to consummate the marriage it is needless to insist on the
misery which is created in such cases it is not of course denied that
such marriages may not sometimes become eventually happy thus kiernan
psychical treatment of congenital sexual inversion review of insanity
and nervous diseases june 1894 reports the case of a thoroughly
inverted girl who married the brother of the friend to whom she was
previously attached merely in order to secure his sisters companionship
she was able to endure and even enjoy intercourse by imagining that her
husband who resembled his sister was another sister liking and esteem
for the husband gradually increased and after the sister died a child was
born who much resembled her the wifes esteem passed through love of the
sister to intense natural love of the daughter as resembling the sister
through this to normal love of the husband as the father and brother the
final result may have been satisfactory but this train of circumstances
could not have been calculated beforehand moll is also opposed on the
whole eg deutsche medicinische presse no 6 1902 to marriage and
procreation by inverts
259 hirschfeld die homosexualitt ch xxi it might seem on
theoretical grounds that the marriage of a homosexual man with a
homosexual woman might turn out well hirschfeld however states that he
knows of 14 such marriages and the theoretical expectation has not been
justified 3 of the cases speedily terminated in divorce 4 of the couples
lived separately and all but 2 of the remaining couples regretted the
step they had taken i may add that in such a case even the expectation of
happiness scarcely seems reasonable since neither of the parties can feel
a true mating impulse toward the other
260 hirschfeld also notes die homosexualitt p 95 that women often
instinctively feel that there is something wrong in the love of their
inverted husbands who may perhaps succeed in copulating but betray their
deepest feelings by a repugnance to touch the sexual parts with the hand
the homosexual woman also as hirschfeld elsewhere points out with cases
in illustration p 84 may suffer seriously through being subjected to
normal sexual relationships
261 fr reports the case of an invert of great intellectual ability who
had never had any sexual relationships and was not averse from a chaste
life he was urged by his doctor to acquire the power of normal
intercourse and to marry on the ground that his perversion was merely a
perversion of the imagination he did so and though he married a
perfectly strong and healthy woman and was himself healthy except in so
far as his perversion was concerned the offspring turned out
disastrously the eldest child was an epileptic almost an imbecile and
with strongly marked homosexual impulses the second and third children
were absolute idiots the youngest died of convulsions in infancy fr
linstinct sexuel p 269 et seq no doubt this is not an average case
but the numerous examples of the offspring of similar marriages brought
forward by hirschfeld op cit p 391 scarcely present a much better
result
262 it is scarcely necessary to add that the same principle is adaptable
to the case of homosexual women in all such cases writes an american
woman physician i would recommend that the moral sense be trained and
fostered and the persons allowed to keep their individuality being
taught to remember always that they are different from others rather
sacrificing their own feelings or happiness when necessary it is good
discipline for them and will serve in the long run to bring them more
favor and affection than any other course this quality or idiosyncrasy is
not essentially evil but if rightly used may prove a blessing to others
and a power for good in the life of the individual nor does it reflect
any discredit upon its possessor
263 the existence of an affinity between homosexuality and the religious
temperament has been referred to in ch i as recognized in many parts of
the world see for a more extended discussion horneffer der priester
and bloch die prostitution vol i pp 101110 the psychoanalysts
have also touched on this point thus pfister die frommingkeit des
grafen von zinzendorf 1910 argues that the founder of the pietistic
sect of the herrenhuter was of sublimated homosexual or bisexual
temperament
264 forel die sexuelle frage p 528 such ideas are of course
often put forward by inverts themselves
265 roman law previously seems to have been confined in this matter to
the protection of boys the scantinian and other roman laws against
paiderasty seem to have been usually a dead letter see for various notes
and references wg holmes the age of justinian and theodora vol i
p 121
266 epistle to the romans chapter i verses 267
267 in practice this penalty of death appears to have been sometimes
commuted to ablation of the sexual organs
268 for a full sketch of the legal enactments against homosexual
intercourse in ancient and modern times see numa praetorius die
straflichen bestimmungen gegen den gleichgeschlechtlichen verkehr
jahrbuch fr sexuelle zwischenstufen vol i pp 97158 this writer
points out that justinian and still more clearly pius v in the
sixteenth century distinguished between occasional homosexuality and
deeprooted inversion habitual offenders alone not those who had only
been guilty once or twice being punished
269 the influence of the supposed connection of sodomy with unbelief
idolatry and heresy in arousing the horror of it among earlier religions
has been emphasized by westermarck the origin and development of the
moral ideas vol i p 486 et seq
270 any male person who in public or private commits or is a party to
the commission of or procures or attempts to procure the commission by
any male person of any act of gross indecency with another male person
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and being convicted thereof shall be
liable at the discretion of the court to be imprisoned for any term not

homosexuality among tramps
by josiah flynt
i have made a rather minute study of the tramp class in the united states
england and germany but i know it best in the states i have lived with
the tramps there for eight consecutive months besides passing numerous
shorter periods in their company and my acquaintance with them is nearly
of ten years standing my purpose in going among them has been to learn
about their life in particular and outcast life in general this can only
be done by becoming part and parcel of its manifestations
there are two kinds of tramps in the united states outofworks and
hoboes the outofworks are not genuine vagabonds they really want
work and have no sympathy with the hoboes the latter are the real tramps
they make a business of begginga very good business tooand keep at it
as a rule to the end of their days whisky and wanderlust or the love
of wandering are probably the main causes of their existence but many of
them are discouraged criminals men who have tried their hand at crime and
find that they lack criminal wit they become tramps because they find
that life on the road comes the nearest to the life they hoped to lead
they have enough talent to do very well as beggars better generally
speaking then the men who have reached the road simply as drunkards they
know more about the tricks of the trade and are cleverer in thinking out
schemes and stories all genuine tramps in america are however pretty
much the same as far as manners and philosophy are concerned and all are
equally welcome at the hangout276 the class of society from which
they are drawn is generally the very lowest of all but there are some
hoboes who have come from the very highest and these latter are
frequently as vicious and depraved as their less wellborn brethren
concerning sexual inversion among tramps there is a great deal to be
said and i cannot attempt to tell all i have heard about it but merely
to give a general account of the matter every hobo in the united states
knows what unnatural intercourse means talking about it freely and
according to my finding every tenth man practises it and defends his
conduct boys are the victims of this passion the tramps gain possession
of these boys in various ways a common method is to stop for awhile in
some town and gain acquaintance with the slum children they tell these
children all sorts of stories about life on the road how they can ride
on the railways for nothing shoot indians and be perfeshunnels
professionals and they choose some boy who specially pleases them by
smiles and flattering caresses they let him know that the stories are
meant for him alone and before long if the boy is a suitable subject he
smiles back just as slyly in time he learns to think that he is the
favorite of the tramp who will take him on his travels and he begins to
plan secret meetings with the man the tramp of course continues to
excite his imagination with stories and caresses and some fine night
there is one boy less in the town on the road the lad is called a
prushun and his protector a jocker the majority of prushuns are
between 10 and 15 years of age but i have known some under 10 and a few
over 15 each is compelled by hobo law to let his jocker do with him as he
will and many i fear learn to enjoy his treatment of them they are
also expected to beg in every town they come to any laziness on their
part receiving very severe punishment
how the act of unnatural intercourse takes place is not entirely clear
the hoboes are not agreed from what i have personally observed i should
say that it is usually what they call legwork intercrural but
sometimes immissio penis in anum the boy in either case lying on his
stomach i have heard terrible stories of the physical results to the boy
of anal intercourse
one evening near cumberland pennsylvania i was an unwilling witness of
one of the worst scenes that can be imagined in company with eight
hoboes i was in a freightcar attached to a slowly moving train a
colored boy succeeded in scrambling into the car and when the train was
well under way again he was tripped up and seduced to use the hobo
euphemism by each of the tramps he made almost no resistance and joked
and laughed about the business as if he had expected it this indeed i
find to be the general feeling among the boys when they have been
thoroughly initiated at first they do not submit and are inclined to run
away or fight but the men fondle and pet them and after awhile they do
not seem to care some of them have told me that they get as much pleasure
out of the affair as the jocker does even little fellows under 10 have
told me this and i have known them to willfully tempt their jockers to
intercourse what the pleasure consists in i cannot say the youngsters
themselves describe it as a delightful tickling sensation in the parts
involved and this is possibly all that it amounts to among the smallest
lads those who have passed the age of puberty seem to be satisfied in
pretty much the same way that the men are among the men the practice is
decidedly one of passion the majority of them prefer a prushun to a
woman and nothing is more severely judged than rape one often reads in
the newspapers that a woman has been assaulted by a tramp but the
perverted tramp is never the guilty party
i believe however that there are a few hoboes who have taken to boys
because women are so scarce on the road for every woman in hoboland
there are a hundred men that this disproportion has something to do with
the popularity of boys is made clear by the following case in a gaol
where i was confined for a month during my life in vagabondage i got
acquainted with a tramp who had the reputation of being a sod
sodomist one day a woman came to the gaol to see her husband who was
awaiting trial one of the prisoners said he had known her before she was
married and had lived with her the tramp was soon to be discharged and
he inquired where the woman lived on learning that she was still
approachable he looked her up immediately after his release and
succeeded in staying with her for nearly a month he told me later that he
enjoyed his life with her much more than his intercourse with boys i
asked him why he went with boys at all and he replied cause there
aint women enough if i cant get them ive got to have the other
it is in gaols that one sees the worst side of this perversion in the
daytime the prisoners are let out into a long hall and can do much as
they please at night they are shut up two and even four in a cell if
there are any boys in the crowd they are made use of by all who care to
have them if they refuse to submit they are gagged and held down the
sheriff seldom knows what goes on and for the boys to say anything to him
would be suicidal there is a criminal ignorance all over the states
concerning the life of these gaols and things go on that would be
impossible in any wellregulated prison in one of these places i once
witnessed the fiercest fight i have ever seen among hoboes a boy was the
cause of it two men said they loved him and he seemed to return the
affection of both with equal desire a fight with razors was suggested to
settle who should have him277 the men prepared for action while the
crowd gathered round to watch they slashed away for over half an hour
cutting each other terribly and then their backers stopped them for fear
of fatal results the boy was given to the one who was hurt the least
jealousy is one of the first things one notices in connection with this
passion i have known them to withdraw entirely from the hangout life
simply to be sure that their prushuns were not touched by other tramps
such attachments frequently last for years and some boys remain with
their first jockers until they are emancipated
emancipation means freedom to snare some other boy and make him submit
as the other had been obliged to submit when younger as a rule the
prushun is freed when he is able to protect himself if he can defend his
honor from all who come he is accepted into the class of old stagers
and may do as he likes this is the one reward held out to prushuns during
their apprenticeship they are told that some day they can have a boy and
use him as they have been used thus hoboland is always sure of recruits
it is difficult to say how many tramps are sexually inverted it is not
even certainly known how many vagabonds there are in the country i have
stated in one of my papers on tramps that counting the boys there are
between fifty and sixty thousand genuine hoboes in the united states a
vagabond in texas who saw this statement wrote me that he considered my
estimate too low the newspapers have criticised it as too high but they
are unable to judge if my figures are as i believe at least
approximately correct the sexually perverted tramps may be estimated at
between five and six thousand this includes men and boys
i have been told lately by tramps that the boys are less numerous than
they were a few years ago they say that it is now a risky business to be
seen with a boy and that it is more profitable as far as begging is
concerned to go without them whether this means that the passion is less
fierce than it used to be or that the men find sexual satisfaction among
themselves i cannot say definitely but from what i know of their
disinclination to adopt the latter alternative i am inclined to think
that the passion may be dying out somewhat i am sure that women are not
more numerous on the road than formerly and that the change if real
has not been caused by them so much for my finding in the united states
in england where i have also lived with tramps for some time i have
found very little contrary sexual feeling in germany also excepting in
prisons and workhouses it seems very little known among vagabonds there
are a few jewish wanderers sometimes peddlers who are said to have boys
in their company and i am told that they use them as the hoboes in the
united states use their boys but i cannot prove this from personal
observation in england i have met a number of male tramps who had no
hesitation in declaring their preference for their own sex and
particularly for boys but i am bound to say that i have seldom seen them
with boys as a rule they were quite alone and they seem to live chiefly
by themselves
it is a noteworthy fact that both in england and germany there are a great
many women on the road or at all events so near it that intercourse
with them is easy and cheap in germany almost every town has its quarter
of stadtschieze278 women who sell their bodies for a very small sum
they seldom ask over thirty or forty pfennigs for a night which is
usually spent in the open air in england it is practically the same
thing in all the large cities there are women who are glad to do business
for three or four pence and those on the road for even less
the general impression made on me by the sexually perverted men i have met
in vagabondage is that they are abnormally masculine in their intercourse
with boys they always take the active part the boys have in some cases
seemed to me uncommonly feminine but not as a rule in the main they are
very much like other lads and i am unable to say whether their liking for
the inverted relationship is inborn or acquired that it is however a
genuine liking in altogether too many instances i do not in the least
doubt as such and all the more because it is such it deserves to be
more thoroughly investigated and more reasonably treated
josiah flynt who wrote the foregoing account of tramplife for the
second edition of this volume was well known as author sociologist and
tramp he was especially and it would seem by innate temperament the
tramp which part he looked to perfection he himself referred to his
weasoned face and diminutive form and felt completely at home in he
was thus able to throw much light on the psychology of the tramp and his
books such as tramping with tramps are valuable from this point of
view his real name was f willard and he was a nephew of miss frances
willard he died in chicago in 1907 at the age of 38 shortly after
writing a frank and remarkable autobiography i am able to supplement
his observations on tramps so far as england is concerned by the
following passages from a detailed record sent to me by an english
correspondent
i am a male invert with complete feminine sexual inclinations different
meetings with tramps led me to seek intimacy with them and for about
twenty years i have gone on the tramp myself so that i might come in the
closest contact with them in england scotland and wales
as in the united states there are two classes of tramps those who would
work such as harvesters roadmakers etc and those who will not work
but make tramping a profession among both these classes my experience is
that 90 per cent or i even would be bold enough to say 100 per cent
indulge in homosexuality when the opportunity occurs and i do not make
any distinction between the two classes
there are numerous reasons for this and i will state a few a certain
number may prefer normal connection with a female but except for those
who tramp in vans and a limited number who have donnas with them women
are not available as prostitutes very seldom allow intimacy for love
except when drunk tramps are also afraid of any venereal disease as it
means the misery of the lock hospital most of them are sociable and
prefer to tramp with a make with this mate with whom he sleeps and
rests and boozes when they are in funds sexual intimacy naturally takes
place as my experience has been that one of the two is male and the
other female in their sexual desires but i have known instances where
they have acted both roles then male prostitution is to be had for
nothing and even occasionally when a tramp meets a toff it is a means
of earning money either fairly or otherwise i have never known a male
tramp to refuse satisfaction if i offered a drink or two or a small sum
of money one told me that he envied no lords or toffs as long as he got
plenty of booze and buggery
another one who told me that he had been twentyfive years on the road
said that he could not endure to sleep alone he was a pedlar openly of
cheap religious books and secretly of the vilest pamphlets and
photographs he had done time and he said the greatest punishment to
him was not being able to have a make who would submit to penetration
though he was not particular what form the sexual act took another fine
young man whom i chanced to meet the very day he had been released from a
long sentence in prison for burglary and with whom i passed a night of
incessant and almost brutal intimacy said his punishment was seeing men
always about him and being unable to have connection with them another
and very powerful influence in tramps toward homosexuality is that in
the low lodging houses they are obliged to frequent a single bed is
perhaps double to one with a bedmate whom perhaps he has never seen
before and especially in hot weather when the rule is nakedness
my sexual desires being for the male invert i have come most in contact
with them and have found that they form much the larger class among
harvesters and seafaring tramps it is seldom you find a dandy such as i
was considered and as such i was eagerly courted and any suggestion of
intimacy on my part quickly responded to as regards the use of young boys
for homosexual indulgence it is not common as it is too dangerous though
i have known boys especially those belonging to vans or gypsies to
prostitute themselves always for money
on one occasion i saw a boy who created quite an outburst of lust of
homosexual nature the incident took place in a small seafaring town in
scotland one evening before a fair was to be held it occurred in a low
public house where a number of very rough and mostly drunken men were
assembled a blind man came in led by an extremely pretty but
effeminatelooking youth of about 17 wearing a ragged kilt and with bare
legs and feet he had long curling fair hair which reached to his
shoulders and on it an old bonnet was perched he also wore an old
velveteen shooting jacket all eyes were turned on the pair and they were
quickly offered drinks a remark was made by one man that he believed the
youth was a lassie the boy said i will show you i am a laddie and
pulled up his kilt exposing his genitals and then his posterior
boisterous laughter greeted this indecent exposure and suggestion and
more drinks were provided the blind man then played his fiddle and the
boy danced with frequent recurrences of the same indecencies he was
seized kissed and caressed by quite a number of men some of whom
endeavored to masturbate him which he resisted but performed it for
them after the closing time came i and about ten or twelve men all
occupied the same room the old man continued to play and the youth
stark naked continued to dance and suggested we others should do so and
an erotic scene took place which was only closed to view by the boss who
was present putting out the lamp
two classes of tramps i have met openly declare their preference for
homosexuality they are men who have been in the army and sailors and
seafaring men in general it is said that jack has a wife in every port
but i believe from my experience that the wife in many cases is of the
male sex and this among those of all nationalities as is the case with
soldiers among these also jealousy is more common than amongst ordinary
tramps and if you are dandy to a soldier if you make advances or
receive them from a senior trouble is likely to occur between them
i could give many instances of my own personal experiences to show that
tramps are looked upon by men in the country districts as legitimate
complacent and purchaseable objects for homosexual lust

appendix b
the schoolfriendships of girls
i
a schoolfriendship is termed by italian girls a flame flamma this
term as explained by obici and marchesini indicates in schoolslang
both the beloved person and the friendship in the abstract but it is a
friendship which has the note of passion as felt and understood in this
environment in every college the flame is regarded as a necessary
institution the relationship is usually of a markedly platonic character
and generally exists between a boarder on one side and a daypupil on the
other notwithstanding however its apparently nonsexual nature all the
sexual manifestations of college youth circle around it and in its
varying aspects of differing intensity all the gradations of sexual
sentiment may be expressed
obici and marchesini carried on their investigation chiefly among the
pupils of normal schools the age of the girls being between 12 and 19 or
20 there are both boarders and daypupils at these colleges the boarders
are most inflammable but it is the daypupils who furnish the sparks
obici and marchesini received much assistance in their studies from former
pupils who are now themselves teachers one of these a daypupil who had
never herself been either the object or the agent in one of these
passions but had had ample opportunity of making personal observations
writes as follows the flame proceeds exactly like a loverelationship
it often happens that one of the girls shows manlike characteristics
either in physical type or in energy and decision of character the other
lets herself be loved acting with all the obstinacyand one might almost
say the shynessof a girl with her lover the beginning of these
relationships is quite different from the usual beginnings of friendship
it is not by being always together talking and studying together that
two become flames no generally they do not even know each other one
sees the other on the stairs in the garden in the corridors and the
emotion that arises is nearly always called forth by beauty and physical
grace then the one who is first struck begins a regular courtship
frequent walks in the garden when the other is likely to be at the window
of her classroom pauses on the stairs to see her pass in short a mute
adoration made up of glances and sighs later come presents of beautiful
flowers and little messages conveyed by complacent companions finally
if the flame shows signs of appreciating all these proofs of affection
comes the letter of declaration letters of declaration are long and
ardent to such a degree that they equal or surpass real
lovedeclarations the courted one nearly always accepts sometimes with
enthusiasm oftenest with many objections and doubts as to the affection
declared it is only after many entreaties that she yields and the
relationship begins
another collaborator who has herself always aroused very numerous flames
gives a very similar description together with other particulars thus
she states it may be said that 60 per cent of the girls in a college
have flame relationships and that of the remaining 40 only half refuse
from deliberate repulsion to such affections the other 20 are excluded
either because they are not sufficiently pleasing in appearance or because
their characters do not inspire sympathy and regarding the method of
beginning the relationship she writes sometimes flames arise before
the two future friends have even seen each other merely because one of
them is considered as beautiful sympathetic nice or elegant elegance
exerts an immense fascination especially on the boarders who are bound
down by monotonous and simple habits as soon as a boarder hears of a
daypupil that she is charming and elegant she begins to feel a lively
sympathy toward her rapidly reaching anxiety to see her the longedfor
morning at length arrives the beloved unconscious of the tumult of
passions she has aroused goes into school not knowing that her walk her
movements her garments are being observed from stairs or dormitory
corridor for the boarders these events constitute an important part of
collegelife and often assume for some the aspect of a tragedy which
fortunately may be gradually resolved into a comedy or a farce
many letters are written in the course of these relationships obici and
marchesini have been able to read over 300 such letters which had been
carefully preserved by the receivers and which indeed formed the chief
material for their study these letters clearly show that the flame most
usually arises from a physical sympathy an admiration of beauty and
elegance the letters written in this flame relationship are full of
passion they appear to be often written during periods of physical
excitement and psychic erethism and may be considered obici and
marchesini remark a form of intellectual onanism of which the writers
afterward feel remorse and shame as of a physically dishonorable act in
reference to the underlying connection of these feelings with the sexual
impulse one of the lady collaborators writes i can say that a girl who
is in love with a man never experiences flame emotions for a companion
obici and marchesini thus summarize the differential character of flames
as distinguished from ordinary friendships 1 the extraordinary
frequency with which even by means of subterfuges the lovers exchange
letters 2 the anxiety to see and talk to each other to press each
others hands to embrace and kiss 3 the long conversations and the
very long reveries 4 persistent jealousy with its manifold arts and
usual results 5 exaltation of the beloveds qualities 6 the habit of
writing the beloveds name everywhere 7 absence of envy for the loved
ones qualities 8 the lovers abnegation in conquering all obstacles to
the manifestations of her love 9 the vanity with which some respond to
flame declarations 10 the consciousness of doing a prohibited thing
11 the pleasure of conquest of which the trophies letters etc are
preserved
the difference between a flame and a friendship is very well marked in
the absolute exclusiveness of the former whence arises the possibility
of jealousy at the same time friendship and love are here woven together
the letters are chaste a few exceptions among so many letters not
affecting this general rule and the purity of the flame relationship is
also shown by the fact that it is usually between boarders and daypupils
girls in different classes and different rooms and seldom between those
who are living in close proximity to each other certainly writes one
of the lady collaborators the first sensual manifestations develop in
girls with physical excitement pure and simple but at all events i
would wish to believe it the majority of collegegirls find sufficient
satisfaction in being as near as possible to the beloved person of
whichever sex in mutual admiration and in kissing or very frequently
in conversation that is by no means moral though usually very
metaphorical the object of such conversation is to discover the most
important mysteries of human nature the why and the wherefore it deals
with natural necessities which the girl feels and has an intuition of
but as yet knows nothing definite about such conversations are the order
of the day in schools and in colleges and specially revolve around
procreation the most difficult mystery of all they are a heap of
stupidities this lady had only known of one definitely homosexual
relationship during the whole of her collegelife the couple in question
were little liked and had no other flames the chief general sexual
manifestations this lady concludes which she had noted among her
companions was a constant preoccupation with sexual mysteries and the
necessity of talking about them perpetually
another lady collaborator who had lived in a normal school had had
somewhat wider experiences she entered at the age of 14 and experienced
the usual loneliness and unhappiness of a new pupil one day as she was
standing pensive and alone in a corner of the room a companionone who
on her arrival had been charged to show her over the collegeran up to
her embracing me closing by mouth with a kiss and softly caressing my
hair i gazed at her in astonishment but experienced a delicious
sensation of supreme comfort here began the idyll i was subjected to a
furious tempest of kisses and caresses which quite stunned me and made me
ask myself the reason of such a new and unforeseen affection i
ingenuously inquired the reason and the reply was i love you you
struck me immediately i saw you because you are so beautiful and so
white and because it makes me happy and soothes me when i can pass my
hands through your hair and kiss your plump white face i need a soul and
a body this seemed to me the language of a superior person for i could
not grasp all its importance as on the occasion when she first embraced
me i looked at her in astonishment and could not for the moment respond
to a new fury of caresses and kisses i felt that they were not like the
kisses of my mamma my papa my brother and other companions they gave
me unknown sensations the contact of those moist and fleshy lips
disturbed me then came the exchange of letters and the usual rights and
duties of flames when we met in the presence of others we were only to
greet each other simply for flames were strictly prohibited i obeyed
because i liked her but also because i was afraid of her othellolike
jealousy she would suffocate me even bite me when i played joyously
and thoughtlessly with others and woe to me if i failed to call her when
i was combing my hair she liked to see me with my hair down and would
rest her head on my shoulder especially if i were partially undressed i
let her do as she liked and she would scold me severely because i was
never first in longing for her running to meet her and kissing her but
at the same time the thought of losing her the thought that perhaps one
day she would shower her caresses on others secretly wounded my heart
but i never told her this one day however when with the headmistress
gazing at a beautiful landscape i was suddenly overwhelmed with sadness
and burst out crying the headmistress inquired what was the matter and
throwing myself in her arms i sobbed i love her and i shall die if she
leaves off loving me she smiled and the smile went through my heart i
saw at once how silly i was and what a wrong road my companion was on
from that day i could no longer endure my flame the separation was
absolute i courageously bore bites and insults even scratches on my
face followed by long complaints and complete prostration i thought it
would be mean to accuse her but i invented a pretext for having the
number of my bed changed this was because she would dress quietly and
come to pass hours by my bed resting her head on the pillow she said she
wished to smell the perfume of my health and freshness this continual
turbulent desire had now nauseated me and i wished to avoid it
altogether later i heard that she had formed a relationship which was not
blessed by any sacred rite
notwithstanding the platonic character of the correspondences obici and
marchesini remark there is really a substratum of emotional sexuality
beneath it and it is this which finds its expression in the indecorous
conversations already referred to the flame is a lovefiction a play
of sexual love this characteristic comes out in the frequently romantic
names of men and women invented to sign the letters
even in the letters themselves however the element of sexual
impressionability may be traced on friday we went to a service at san
b writes one who was in an institution directed by nuns but
unfortunately i saw ml at a window when i thought she was at a and i
was in a nervous state the whole time imagine that that dear woman was at
the window with bare arms and as it seemed to me in her chemise no
doubt a similar impression might have been made on a girl living in her
own family but it is certain that the imaginative coloring tends to be
more lively in those living in colleges and shut off from that varied and
innocent observation which renders those outside colleges freer and more
unprejudiced on a boy who is free to see as many women as he chooses a
womans face cannot make such an impression as on a boy who lives in a
college and who is liable to be as it were electrified if he sees any
object belonging to a woman especially if he sees it by stealth or during
a mood of erotism such an object calls out a whole series of wanton
imaginations which it could not do in one who by his environment was
already armed against any tendencies to erotic fetichism the attraction
exerted by that which we see but seldom and around which fancy
assiduously plays the attraction of forbidden fruit produces tendencies
and habits which could scarcely develop in freedom curiosity is acute
and is augmented by the obstacles which stand in the way of its
satisfaction flame attraction is the beginning of such a morbid
fetichism a sentiment which under other conditions would never have gone
beyond ordinary friendship may thus become a flame and even a flame
of markedly sexual character under these influences boys and girls feel
the purest and simplest sentiments in a hyperesthetic manner the girls
here studied have lost an exact conception of the simple manifestations of
friendship and think they are giving evidence of exquisite sensibility
and true friendship by loving a companion to madness friendship in them
has become a passion that this intense desire to love a companion
passionately is the result of the college environments may be seen by the
following extract from a letter you know dear much better than i do
how acutely girls living away from their own homes and far from all those
who are dearest to them on earth feel the need of loving and being loved
you can understand how hard it is to be obliged to live without anyone to
surround you with affection and the writer goes on to say how all her
love turns to her correspondent
while there is an unquestionable sexual element in the flame
relationship this cannot be regarded as an absolute expression of real
congenital perversion of the sexinstinct the frequency of the phenomena
as well as the fact that on leaving college to enter social life the
girl usually ceases to feel these emotions are sufficient to show the
absence of congenital abnormality the estimate of the frequency of
flames in normal schools given to obici and marchesini by several lady
collaborators was about 60 per cent but there is no reason to suppose
that women teachers furnish a larger contingent of perverted individuals
than other women the root is organic but the manifestations are ideal
and platonic in contrast with some other manifestations found in
collegelife no inquiry was made as to the details of solitary sexual
manifestations in the colleges the fact that they exist to more or less
extent being sufficiently recognized the conversations already referred
to are a measure of the excitations of sexuality existing in these college
inmates and multiplied in energy by communication such discourse was
wrote one collaborator the order of the day and it took place chiefly at
the time when letterwriting also was easiest it may well be that sensual
excitations transformed into ethereal sentiments serve to increase the
intensity of the flames
taken altogether obici and marchesini conclude the flame may be regarded
as a provisional synthesis we find here in solution together the
physiological element of incipient sexuality the psychical element of the
tenderness natural to this age and sex the element of occasion offered by
the environment and the social element with its nascent altruism
ii
that the phenomena described in minute detail by obici and marchesini
closely resemble the phenomena as they exist in english girls schools is
indicated by the following communication for which i am indebted to a
lady who is familiar with an english girls college of very modern type
from inquiries made in various quarters and through personal observation
and experience i have come to the conclusion that the romantic and
emotional attachments formed by girls for their female friends and
companions attachments which take a great hold of their minds for the
time being are far commoner than is generally supposed among english
girls more especially at school or college or wherever a number of girls
or young women live together in one institution and are much secluded
as far as i have been able to find out these attachmentswhich have
their own local names eg raves spoons etcare comparatively
rare in the smaller private schools and totally absent among girls of the
poorer class attending board and national schools perhaps because they
mix more freely with the opposite sex
i can say from personal experience that in one of the largest and best
english colleges where i spent some years raving is especially common
in spite of arrangements which one would have thought would have abolished
most unhealthy feelings the arrangements there are very similar to a
large boys college there are numerous boardinghouses which have on an
average forty to fifty students each house is under the management of a
welleducated housemistress assisted by housegovernesses quite separate
from collegeteachers each house has a large garden with tenniscourts
etc and cricket hockey and other games are carried on to a large
extent games being not only much encouraged but much enjoyed each girl
has a separate cubicle or bedroom and no junior under 17 years of age
is allowed to enter the cubicle or bedroom of another without asking
permission or to go to the bedrooms during the day in fact everything
is done to discourage any morbid feelings but all the same as far as my
experience goes the friendships there seem more violent and more
emotional than in most places and sex subjects form one of the chief
topics of conversation
in such large schools and colleges these raves are not only numerous
but seem to be perennial among the girls of all ages from 13 years
upward girls under that age may be fond of some other student or teacher
but in quite a different way these raves are not mere friendships in
the ordinary sense of the word nor are they incompatible with ordinary
friendships a girl with a rave often has several intimate friends for
whom affection is felt without the emotional feelings and pleasurable
excitement which characterize a rave
from what i have been told by those who have experienced these raves
and have since been in love with men the emotions called forth in both
cases were similar although in the case of the rave this fact was not
recognized at the time this appears to point to a sexual basis but on
the other hand there are many cases where the feeling seems to be more
spiritual a sort of uplifting of the whole soul with an intense desire to
lead a very good lifethe feeling being one of reverence more than
anything else for the loved one with no desire to become too intimate and
no desire for physical contact
raves as a rule begin quite suddenly they may be mutual or all on
one side in the case of schoolgirls the mutual rave is generally found
between two companions or the girls may have a rave for one of their
teachers or some grownup acquaintance who does not necessarily enter
into the schoollife in this case there may or may not be a feeling of
affection for the girl by her rave though minus all the emotional
feelings
occasionally a senior student will have a rave on a little girl but
these cases are rare and not very active in their symptoms girls over 18
having fewer raves and generally condemning them
in the large school already referred to of which i have personal
knowledge raving was very general hardly anyone being free from it
any fresh student would soon fall a victim to the fashion which rather
points to the fact that it is infectious sometimes there might be a lull
in the general raving only to reappear after an interval in more or less
of an epidemic form sometimes nearly all the raves were felt by
students for their teachers at other times it was more apparent between
the girls themselves
sometimes one teacher was raved on by several girls in many cases the
girls raving on a teacher would have a very great friendship with one of
their companionstalking with each other constantly of their respective
raves describing their feelings and generally letting off steam to one
another indulging sometimes in the active demonstrations of affection
which they were debarred from showing the teacher herself and in some
cases having no desire to do so even if they could
as far as i have been able to judge there is not necessarily any
attraction for physical characteristics as beauty elegance etc the
two participants are probably both of strong character or a weak character
raves on a stronger but rarely vice vers
i have often noticed that the same person may be raved on at different
times by several people of different characters and of all ages say up
to 30 years of age it is hard to say why some persons more than others
should inspire this feeling often they are reserved without any
particular physical attraction and often despising raving and emotional
friendships and give no encouragement to them that the majority of
raves have a sexual basis may be true but i am sure that in the
majority of cases where young girls are concerned this is not in the least
recognized and no impurity is indulged in or wished for the majority of
the girls are entirely ignorant of all sexual matters and understand
nothing whatever about them but they do wonder about them and talk about
them constantly more especially when they have a rave which seems to
point to some subtle connection between the two that this ignorance
exists is largely to be deplored the subject if once thought of is
always thought of and talked of and information is at length generally
gained in a regrettable manner from personal experience i know the evil
results that this ignorance and constant endeavoring to find out
everything has on the mind and bodies of schoolgirls if children had the
natural and simple laws of creation carefully explained to them by their
parents much harm would be prevented and the conversation would not
always turn on sexual matters the bible is often consulted for the
discovery of hidden mysteries
raves on teachers are far commoner than between two girls in this case
the girl makes no secret of her attachment constantly talking of it and
describing her feelings to any who care to listen and writing long letters
to her friends about the same in the case of two girls there is more
likely to be a sexual element great pleasure being taken in close contact
with one another and frequent kissing and hugging when parted long
letters are written often daily they are full of affectionate
expressions of love etc but there is also a frequent reference to the
happiness and desire to do well that their love has inspired them with
while often very deeply religious feelings appear to be generated and many
good resolutions are made their various emotional feelings are described
in every minute detail to each other
the duration of raves varies i have known them to last three or four
years more often only a few months occasionally what began as a rave
will turn into a sensible firm friendship i imagine that there is seldom
any actual inversion and on growing up the raves generally cease that
the ravers feel and act like a pair of lovers there is no doubt and the
majority put down these romantic friendships for their own sex as due in
a great extent in the case of girls at schools to being without the
society of the opposite sex this may be true in some cases but
personally i think the question open to discussion these friendships are
often found among girls who have left school and have every liberty even
among girls who have had numerous flirtations with the opposite sex who
cannot be accused of inversion and who have all the feminine and domestic
characteristics
in illustration of these points i may bring forward the following case
a and b were two girls at the same college they belonged to different
cliques or sets occupied different bedrooms never met in their
schoolwork and were practically only known to one another by name one
day they chanced to sit next to one another at some meal they both
already had raves a on an actor she had lately seen b on a married
woman at her home the conversation happened to turn on raves and
mutual attraction was suddenly felt from that moment a new interest
came into their lives they lived for one another at the time a was 14
b a year older both were somewhat precocious for their age were
practical with plenty of common sense very keen on games interested in
their lessons and very independent but at the same time with marked
feminine characteristics and popular with the opposite sex after the
first feeling of interest there was a subtle excitement and desire to
meet again all their thoughts were occupied with the subject each day
they managed as many private meetings as possible they met in the
passages in order to say goodnight with many embraces as far as possible
they hid their feelings from the rest of their world they became
inseparable and a very lasting and real but somewhat emotional
affection in which the sexual element was certainly marked sprang up
between them although at the time they were both quite ignorant of sexual
matters yet they indulged their sexual instincts to some extent they
felt surcharged with hitherto unexperienced feelings and emotions
instinct urged them to let these have play but instinctively they also
had a feeling that to do so would be wrong this feeling they endeavored
to argue out and find reasons for when parted for any length of time they
felt very miserable and wrote pages to one another every day pouring
forth in writing their feelings for one another in this time of active
attraction they both became deeply religious for a time the active part
of the affection continued for three or four years and now after an
interval of ten years they are both exceedingly fond of one another
although their paths in life are divided and each has since experienced
love for a man both look back upon the sexual element in their friendship
with some interest it may be remarked in passing that a and b are both
attractive girls to men and women and b especially appears always to
have roused rave feelings in her own sex without the slightest
encouragement on her part the duration of this rave was exceptionally
long the majority only lasting a few months while some girls have one
rave after another or two or three together
i may mention one other case where i believe that if it a sexual basis
this was not recognized by the parties concerned or their friends two
girls over 20 years of age passed in a corridor a few words were
exchanged the beginning of a very warm and fast friendship they said it
was not a rave they were absolutely devoted to one another but from
what i know of them and what they have since told me their feelings were
quite free from any sexual desires though their love for one another was
great when parted they exchanged letters daily but were always
endeavoring to urge one another on in all the virtues and as far as i can
gather they never gave way to any feeling they thought was not for the
good of their souls
letters and presents are exchanged vows of eternal love are made
quarrels are engaged in for the mere pleasure of reconciliation and
jealousy is easily manifested although raves are chiefly found among
schoolgirls they are by no means confined to them but are common among
any community of women of any age say under 30 and are not unknown
among married women when there is no inversion in these oases there is
usually of course no ignorance of sexual matters
whether there is any direct harm in these friendships i have not been
able to make up my mind in the case of schoolgirls if there is not too
much emotion generated and if the sexual feelings are not indulged in i
think they may do more good than harm later on in life when all ones
desires and feelings are at their strongest it is more doubtful

that the phenomena as found in the girls colleges of america are exactly
similar to those in italy and england is shown among other evidence by
some communications sent to mr eg lancaster of clark university
worcester mass a few years ago
mr eg lancaster sent out a questionnaire to over 800 teachers and
older pupils dealing with various points connected with adolescence and
received answers from 91 persons containing information which bore on the
present question279 of this number 28 male and 41 female had been in
love before the age of 25 while 11 of each sex had had no love
experiences this indicating since the women were in a majority that the
absence of love experience is more common in men than in women these
answers were from young people between 16 and 25 years of age two males
and 7 females have loved imaginary characters while 3 males and not less
than 46 females speak of passionate love for the same sex love of the
same sex lancaster remarks though not generally known is very common
it is not mere friendship the love is strong real and passionate it
may be remarked that these 49 cases were reported without solicitation
since there was no reference to homosexual love in the questionnaire
many of the answers to the syllabus are so beautiful lancaster observes
that if they could be printed in full no comment would be necessary he
quotes a few of the answers thus a woman of 33 writes at 14 i had my
first case of love but it was with a girl it was insane intense love
but had the same quality and sensations as my first love with a man at 18
in neither case was the object idealized i was perfectly aware of their
faults nevertheless my whole being was lost immersed in their existence
the first lasted two years the second seven years no love has since been
so intense but now these persons though living are no more to me than
the veriest stranger another woman of 35 writes girls between the ages
of 14 and 18 at college or girls schools often fall in love with the same
sex this is not friendship the loved one is older more advanced more
charming or beautiful when i was a freshman in college i knew at least
thirty girls who were in love with a senior some sought her because it
was the fashion but i knew that my own homage and that of many others was
sincere and passionate i loved her because she was brilliant and utterly
indifferent to the love shown her she was not pretty though at the time
we thought her beautiful one of her adorers on being slighted was ill
for two weeks on her return she was speaking to me when the object of our
admiration came into the room the shock was too great and she fainted
when i reached the senior year i was the recipient of languishing glances
original verses roses and passionate letters written at midnight and
three in the morning no similar confessions are recorded from men

in south america corresponding phenomena have been found in schools and
colleges of the same class there they have been especially studied by
mercante in the convent high schools of buenos aires where the students
are girls between the ages of 10 and 22280 mercante found that
homosexuality here is not clearly defined or explicit and usually it is
combined with a predisposition to romanticism and mysticism it is usually
of a passive kind but in this form so widespread as to constitute a kind
of epidemic it was most manifest in institutions where the greatest
stress was placed on religious instruction
the recreations of the school in question were quiet and enervating
active or boisterous sports were prohibited to the end that good manners
might be cultivated in the playrooms the girls observed the strictest
etiquette and discipline was maintained independent of oversight by
teachers mercante could hardly believe however that the decorum was
more than external
later when the girls broke up they were found in pairs or small groups
in corners on benches beside the pillars arm in arm or holding hands
what they were speaking of could be surmised their conversation and
confidences came to me indirectly they were sweethearts talking about
their affairs in spite of the spiritual and feminine character of these
unions one element was active the other passive thus confirming the
authorities on this matter gamier rgis lombroso bonfigli
mercante found the points of view of the two members of each pair to be
quite different in moral aspect one takes the initiative she commands
she cares for she offers she gives she makes decisions she considers
the present she imagines the future she smoothes over difficulties
gives encouragement and initiative she commands she cares for she
offers she gives she docile gives way in matters of dispute and
expresses her affection with sweet words and promises of love and
submission the atmosphere silent and quiet was however charged with
jealousy squabble desires illusions dreams and lamentations
mercantes informant assured him that practically every girl had her
affinity and that there were at least twenty welldefined love affairs
the active party starts the conquest by making eyes next she becomes more
intimate and finally proposes women being highly adaptable the
neophyte unless she is rebellious gets into the spirit of it all if she
is not complaisant she must prepare for conflict because the prey
becomes more desirable the more the resistance encountered
opportunity was offered to mercante to observe some of the correspondence
between the girls though of indifferent training and ability in other
respects the girls speak and write regarding their affairs with most
admirable diction and style no data are given regarding the actual
intimate relations between the girls
