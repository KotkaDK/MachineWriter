introduction
i think that some of you have been with me at willow farm before today
when we were there we went into the farmers fields in early spring and
saw the men and horses at work with ploughs and harrows a little later
on we saw some of the crops sown such as barley and turnips in summer
we were in the hayand cornfields and later still we saw the ricks
being made
today we are at willow farm again and i want to show you some of the
flowers that grow there i do not mean those which mrs hammond the
farmers wife grows in her garden pretty as they are we will look
rather at the wild flowers in the fields the hedges and by the
roadside in the lane no one sows their seed nor takes care of them in
any way yet they grow and blossom year after year and nearly all of
them are beautiful
before we begin to look at them we must make sure that we quite
understand just what a flower is even those of you who live in large
towns and have perhaps never been in the country see flowers of some
sort i feel sure you see them in shop windows and they are also often
sold in the streets you have seen wallflowers and daffodils in the
spring roses in the summer violets in winter as well as other kinds
you do not need to be told that these are flowers
what about the grass on lawns and in such places as battersea park and
hyde park in london oh you say that is not a flower at allthat
is just grass yes it is grass but the grass has a flower as well as
a rose bush or a violetplant it is only because the grass is kept cut
short that you do not see its flower on a lawn if grass is not cut or
eaten by animals it grows tall in spring then in may or june you would
see the flowers on tall straight stems which stand among the blades of
grass many of these grass flowers are very beautiful and we will look
presently at some of them in one of the farmers fields
perhaps some of you have gardens or grass plots at your own homes if
you see some dandelions in the lawn or groundsel among the flowers or
vegetables in the garden beds you say those weeds must be pulled up
you call the dandelion and the groundsel weeds but they have flowers
all the same the dandelion is perhaps one of the most lovely yellow
flowers that we have
they are weeds certainly in your lawn or garden beds for they ought not
to be there weeds are plants in the wrong place by and by in the
farmers fields we shall see many pretty flowers which he calls weeds
we speak of the nettle as a weed and do not usually admire it yet the
nettle has a flower as we shall see
then what do you think of a tree having a flower that is perhaps a new
idea to you yet if you look at a horsechestnut tree in june you will
see at once the large spikes of beautiful white flowers with which it is
covered apple trees have a beautiful pink or pink and white flower
and the almond tree bears a lovely pink flower all other trees have
flowers too but they are often small the flowers of the oak and the
beech are small but though you may not notice them they are on the
tree each spring
almost all plants including large trees have flowersthey are
flowering plants just a few plants have no flower ferns have none nor
have the mosses and lichens which grow on walls and rocks and on the
stems of trees fungi too such as the mushroom have no flowers
nearly all other plants have flowers it is by the flower or blossom
that a plant is reproduced after the flower has faded comes the fruit
and seed the seed falls into the ground or is sown and from it springs
another plant without the flower there would be no seed
you see that there are rather more flowers than you had thought still
while we are strolling in the fields and lanes at willow farm we shall
look most at what are generally called flowers we shall look at
comparatively small plants in which the flower or blossom is easily
noticed because it is large or brightcoloured or sweetscented but
while we are admiring a daisy or a dandelion in the spring we must not
forget that the great oaktree above it also has a flower of its ownwe
must remember that the oaktree also is a flowering plant
chapter ii
in the coppice
outside the front door of willow farm is a broad curving gravel drive
at the far end of which a white gate opens into the lane on one side of
this drive is a narrow strip of ground planted with flowers and shrubs
and close to the front door there is a patch of grass on which stands a
large old mulberry tree
on the other side of the drive is a lawn beyond that are more flowers
and then the vegetable garden further on still is a little wood or
coppice of nut bushes on this march morning we shall find some wild
flowers in this little wood
between the vegetable garden and the wood is a low grassy bank it is
bright today with yellow primroses the primrose always blossoms early
here for the bank is sunny and is sheltered from cold winds
illustration primrose
i daresay most of you have seen a primrose before today each pale
yellow blossom is made up of five petals which are joined together
forming a tube or corolla the petals are notched or indented on the
outer edge at the centre of the blossom where the petals meet each
petal is marked with a spot of darker yellow each flower grows alone on
a long slender stem at the top of the stem is a kind of green tube out
of which the yellow blossom appears the primrose blossoms have a scent
not strong but very sweet and pleasant
the leaves are called radical or root leaves they are so called
because each leaf appears to grow direct from the root but the leaves
really grow from a short stem at the top of the roota stem so short
that it does not appear above the ground at all
among the bushes of the coppice itself we will notice the flowers which
first catch our eyethe pretty blossoms of the wood anemone the whole
coppice is starred with the beautiful white flowers we pick one and see
that it has sixsix what six petals you say no these are not
petals for the anemone has none they are sepals the sepals of a plant
generally enclose the blossom before it is opened and they are usually
green in the anemone the petals are absent the sepals take their place
and are white instead of green their under side is often not pure
white but is streaked with pale pink
several blossoms which we pick have six of these sepals that is the
usual number but sometimes there are only five and sometimes more than
six
the blossoms of the anemone grow on longer and stronger stalks than
those of the primrose and on each stalk are three leaves these leaves
grow round the stalk in a ring each leaf is tripartitein three
parts or divisions the edges of these divided leaves are deeply
serrated besides the three leaves on each flowerstalk similar leaves
grow from underground stems which creep along not far below the surface
of the soil such creeping underground stems are usually called
rhizomes
at the further side of the coppice where a hedge separates it from the
little meadow called home close are sweet violets we catch their
fragrant scent before we see them for the tiny flowers are half hidden
among broad green leaves each blossom has five petals of a dark purple
colour there are white sweet violets too but none are growing in our
little wood today
at the base of the blossomthe part where it joins the stemone of the
petals has a little spur which points back towards the stem the blossom
is therefore said to be spurred we may presently see other plants with
spurred flowers
there is another violet which grows wild in englandthe dog violet it
is larger than our sweet violets here but it has no scent
illustration anemone
while we have been examining the flowers on the ground the nut bushes
above our heads are waiting to remind us of what we said just nowthat
trees also have flowers the flowers of the nut bush or hazel are easily
seen for they appear before the leaves are open what we see today are
often called catkins but the name which country children give them is
lambstails it is a very good name too for they are more like the
tail of some tiny lamb than anything else
these catkins are yellowishwhite in colour and soft and almost woolly
to the touch they hang in clusters from the hazel twigs and in the
strong march wind which blows today they shake and flutter like the
tails of lambs at play some of them leave a dusty powder on our fingers
when we handle them that is the pollen of the flower
it is not where these yellow catkins are dancing on the twigs today
that the hazel nuts will appear in autumn the nuts will grow on twigs
where there are very small red flowerssomething like tiny
paintbrushes these are the female flowers they will be fertilized by
the yellow pollen of the catkins and will produce the nuts
chapter iii
flowers on the walls
behind the narrow strip of ground with flowers and shrubs on the other
side of the drive there is a low stone wall a piece of the lawn on
which the mulberry tree stands has been cut away and a flight of steps
leads down to a little gate into the foldyard
this wall between the garden and the foldyard is very old and roughnot
like the smooth brick walls you see in towns the stones are of
different shapes and sizes the mortar has fallen out of it in many
places and here and there are holes and crevices yet it is a very
beautiful old wall for many things grow on it mosses and grasses and
other flowers too are there
on this may morning we not only see but also smell one of the flowers
which grow upon the wallit is the beautiful sweetscented wallflower
it grows here and there along the top of the wall and a few plants of
it are even springing from the sides some of the plants are quite large
and their stems are tough these have grown here for a long time the
wallflower is a perennial plant unless it is killed or torn up by the
roots it will live and grow for many years others are quite young and
only a few inches high these have grown from seeds dropped last autumn
by the older plants
you very likely wonder how the wallflower or any other plant can grow
upon the wall for there is no earth to be seennothing but stones and
crumbling mortar but if we pull up one of the smaller plants we shall
find earth clinging to its roots dry dusty earth has been blown upon
the wall by wind and has lodged in chinks and holes dust and soil
too were mixed with the mortar when the wall was built and dead leaves
falling on it and decaying have produced a little morefor decayed
leaves make earth or soil wallflowers and other plants which grow on
walls and rocks find very little soil sufficient for their needs
most of the blossoms of the wallflowers upon this wall are of a golden
yellow colour and are very sweet some of the blossoms are however a
darker yellow than others and here and there are petals which are quite
brown
if we look at the garden behind us we shall see that mrs hammond has
several beds of wallflower this year it is a flower of which she is
very fond there are wallflowers of two different colours in her beds
one kind has bright golden blossoms rather deeper in colour than any of
those upon the wall the other has flowers that are a rich dark brown
illustration wallflower
these plants are sturdier and more bushy than those upon the wall and
there are more flowers on each plant the flowers are finer too and
have a stronger scent if mrs hammond had wished she could have sown
seed to produce many different shades of brown and yellow wallflowers
she might also have had a purple wallflower and even a wallflower of so
pale a yellow as to be almost white
if you and i were clever gardeners and had plenty of time and patience
we could get purple or nearly white wallflowers from these
yellowflowered plants upon the wall it would perhaps take us many
years but we should succeed at last this is how we should set about
it
suppose that we wished to have a wallflower nearly white we should look
carefully along the wall in spring when the blossoms are out until we
found the very palest yellow blossom we could see we should mark that
plant and when the flower was over and the seed was ripe we should
collect the seed among the plants grown from this seed we should choose
again the plant that had the palest flowers and should save the seed
from that we might have to go on doing this for twenty years or more
but in time we should have a wallflower so pale as to be almost white
quite white we should never get our wallflower for no pure white
flower can be obtained from a yellow one however pale our wallflower
might be there would still always be just a tinge of yellow or cream
colour in it
if on the other hand we wanted a purple or a very dark brown
wallflower we should save seed from those blossoms which were nearest
to the colour we wanteddark brown or with a tinge of purple in them
we should sow seed from the darkest blossoms again and again and at
last we should get what we wished to have
illustration red valerian
illustration stinging nettle
illustration white dead nettle
besides choosing seed from the lightest or darkest blossoms we should
tend our plants very carefully and well giving them plenty of good rich
soil this would make them grow bushy and with many flowers as we see
them in mrs hammonds garden beds
many of our garden flowers have been produced in this way by selecting
and improving wild flowers of course all flowers grow wild somewhere
some in england but many more in foreign countries where the air is
warmer and the soil richer and better the pansy is a little english
wild flower with yellow blue and red petals from this little flower
gardeners have produced large and beautiful pansies of many different
colours and shades of colourswhite yellow blue and brown this has
been done by careful selection just as we spoke of doing with the
wallflowers
but if the large singlecoloured pansies of which i have told you or
mrs hammonds dark brown wallflowers were allowed to seed
themselvesthat is were allowed to drop and sow their own seed year
after yeardo you know what would happen they would gradually revert
or turn back to their original form and colour the flowers would become
mixed in colour and less fine in size at last they would be simple wild
flowers again
illustration pansy
now it is june and the blossoms of the wallflower have faded and
fallen the old wall is however growing gay with another plantthe
red valerian we must be careful to remember that it is the red
valerian for there are other valerians there is the great valerian
which does not grow on walls or rocks but in damp and shady places its
flowers are pale pink
the blossoms of the red valerian on the wall are bright crimson and
they grow in rows on small stems which spring from a stout stalk a foot
or two in height each blossom of five petals forms a little tube or
corolla the base or foot of each little tube appears as a point on the
under side of the flower stem the red valerian like the violet is a
spurred flower
the leaves are long and pointed and they grow in pairs on opposite
sides of the stalk sometimes the edges of the leaves are quite smooth
sometimes they are serrated or toothed like the edge of a saw if we
pulled a plant of red valerian from the wall we should find the roots
very long and branching they need to be so for the plant often grows
on rocks and other places where it is exposed to wind if the roots had
not a firm hold the tall stems laden with blossoms might be blown down
the red valerian flowers all through the summer its clusters of crimson
flowers are as great an ornament to the old wall as were the wallflowers
in may
now let us go down the steps into the foldyard there is a wall on
either side of us as we descend the wall which faces the north is
nearly always in shadow and there are ferns growing but of it between
the stones one of these is a beautiful hartstongue fern with large and
shining leaves we said just now however that ferns have no flowers
so we will turn to something that grows on the wall opposite
this is the ivyleaved toadflax it grows on walls and rocks as the red
valerian does but it is a very different plant in appearance the stems
of the red valerian are tall and upright those of the toadflax are
slender and drooping there is a large mass of it on the side of the
wall and we find that the root is at the highest point of the whole
mass the stems with the flowers and leaves hang down below the root it
is a trailing plant
there are however other roots clinging to the wall here and there
below the main root the plant like several others is able to throw
out fresh roots from the joints of its stems and these give it a firmer
hold
the flowers are small and their colour is a pale lilacblue with a
bright yellow spot in the centre these flowers too are spurred the
leaves are smooth and thickwhat is called fleshy they are divided
into five lobes or divisions and are not unlike an ivyleaf in shape
when we turn a leaf or two over we see that the under side of some is
dark purple
illustration ivyleaved toadflax
this little plant is usually said to prefer a damp situation and to
blossom from may till october this wall beside the steps is certainly
rather damp for the moisture from the garden above soaks down to it in
my own garden however the ivyleaved toadflax grows on some very dry
old walls and i have found it in flower in the middle of december
neither the toadflax nor the red valerian are really natives of england
they were brought to our country many hundreds of years ago they have
spread so much that they have now become wildflowers in the same way
many others of our wild flowers were once unknown in england
now that we have come down the steps into the foldyard we see that it
lies a good deal below the house and garden built round the foldyard
are the stables for the carthorses the cowhouses and the great barn
behind the stables is the rickyard that like the garden is above the
foldyard from it there are only two or three steps to the door of the
loft or tallet above the stables it is there that we will go now
the wall of the tallet is of stone and is very old the roof is tiled
there is a little hole cut in the bottom of the door and you will see
one like it in the door of the granary it is made so that old tib and
the other cats can go in and catch mice growing between the stones of
the wall just by the tallet door is the plant i want to show you now
it is the stonecrop some of the stems grow upright while others are
trailing at the top of each upright stem is a cluster of bright yellow
flowers some of these are fully open and we see that each blossom has
five pointed petals the trailing stems have no flowers at all they are
barren but the leaves on the barren stems are much more numerous and
closer together than those on the upright flowering stems
illustration common stonecrop
these leaves are very curious they are not flat like the leaves of the
red valerian the toadflax and most other flowers they are very thick
and fleshysomething like a short round pointed stick they grow close
against the stalk not in pairs but alternately first a leaf on one
side of the stalk then a leaf on the other they are erect too that
is they point in the same direction as the stalk
on the barren stems the leaves grow so closely that they quite cover the
stalk they have a hot sharp taste and the plant is sometimes called
wallpepper the roots are very thin and can spread easily through
narrow chinks of the wall
we will see one more plant of the walls before we look for flowers
elsewhere our next plant is not very common at willow farm still i
know where to look for it built against one side of the big barn in the
foldyard is a little leanto shed often there are calves in it but
just now we are more interested in something that is on the roof
standing close to the wall of the shed is a cattle criba kind of big
square box or trough on legs in which hay or chaff is put for the
cattle the shed is not very high and by standing on the crib we can
scramble on to the roof here is the plant we want to see
it is the houseleek of which a clump is growing between the tiles
almost flat on the tiles is a dense mass of large green fleshy leaves
these leaves are evergreen they do not die and fall off in winter from
this cluster of leaves rise straight thick stems nearly a foot high the
stems are thickly covered with erect leaves which grow smaller towards
the top of the stem
at the top of the stem is a cluster of very handsome rosyred flowers
each blossom is starshaped when fully open and generally has twelve
petals
illustration house leek
if we could see the roots we should find them very threadlike or
fibrous like those of other flowers we have been looking at today i
do not think i can very well show you the roots however we should have
to pull up a plant and that would not please ben the cowman at all
there is a belief in country places that it is bad luck to disturb the
houseleekthat someone in the house on which it grows is sure to die
soon afterwards certainly the plant is not growing on a house
hereonly on the calves cot still if any misfortune should happen to
the calves we might be blamed by ben besides it would be a pity to
disturb so handsome a plant would it not
we have spent some time in looking at these flowers on the walls and
roof because we think them very wonderful we see how little soil they
can have in which to grow and how in dry weather they can have very
little moisture either yet the leaves of several of them are thick and
fleshy and the flowers of some are large and beautiful what could be
more handsome than the blossoms of the wallflower the red valerian and
the houseleek
chapter iv
three handsome weeds
at the end of the drive near the front door another white gate leads
to the nag stables where mr hammond keeps the two horses which he
rides and drives billy the old brown pony has a little stable of his
own close by and further on are the granary and the poultry yard
perhaps you have heard the saying ill weeds grow apace it is
certainly a true one for most of the plants which we call weeds grow
quickly and well wherever they are allowed to remain we shall not have
far to look for the three weeds which i want to show you this morning
the first of them is the stinging nettle it grows round the woodpile
in the middle of the poultryyard and there are great clumps of it
beside the hedge which divides the poultryyard from the kitchen garden
it is really a very handsome plant though you may not have thought so
before look how tall and straight the stems are and how evenly and
regularly the dark green pointed leaves grow from it they grow in
pairs on opposite sides of the stem and are serrated there is
something rather unusual about the stem of the nettle which we will
notice at once i have brought out a pair of thick leather gloves so
that we can pick a stem without being stung
you know what shape the trunks of trees are round yes round or nearly
so so are the stems of most plants the stems of the red valerian are
round the stem of the nettle however is square or if not perfectly
square it has four distinct sides perhaps you had never noticed this
before for the nettle is certainly not a plant with which one cares to
have very much to do
both the stems and leaves are covered with tiny hairs these hairs are
really small hollow tubes ending in a sharp point when the nettle
stings you it first pricks the skin with these sharp points and then a
drop of poison falls from the tube into the wound the point has made
if you happen to get stung by a nettle do not bathe your hand with
cold water that will only make the pain worse while you are waiting
for the pain to pass off remember that in india there are nettles whose
sting causes great pain which lasts for several days you might be much
worse off you see
the small greenishyellow flowers of the stinging nettle grow in long
feathery clusters on stalks which spring from the main stem close to a
pair of leaves
the young leaves of the nettle are said to be very nice boiled as
vegetables i cannot say that i have ever eaten them myself years ago
country people used to take a great deal of nettle tea as medicine in
spring nowadays they seem to prefer patent medicines from the chemists
shop a dye is made from the roots of the nettle and another dye from
the stem and leaves the young leaves or tops when chopped up are good
for poultry especially for turkeys so nettles are useful you seenot
merely stinging weeds the nettle too is a relation of the hemp plant
from which we get our string and ropes
illustration travellers joy
you may sometimes see or hear of the white red and yellow dead nettle
but these are not really nettles at all their leaves are somewhat
similar but they are quite different plants
hanging over this great patch of nettles by the hedge there is another
weed the travellers joy or old mans beard its stem has climbed not
only up the hedge but high into a hawthorn bush which stands there it
has many small white feathery flowers with a pleasant scent on each
leaf stem there are usually five leaflets one at the end of the stem
and two pairs lower down these leaf stems are long and tough and it is
chiefly by them that the plant can climb as it does they twine round
any branch or twig they touch and give the travellers joy a firm
support i have seen trees in woods covered with this plant to a height
of twenty feet from the ground
in the autumn and early winter you would admire the travellers joy as
much as you do now the flowers will certainly be gone but each seed
which takes the place of a blossom will have a little plume of silky
white threads attached to ita sort of feathery tail these serve as
wings by which the seeds are often carried long distances by the wind
the seeds of some other plants which we shall see have something of the
same kind
there is another climbing plant in the hedge the large bindweed or
convolvulus to look at it however we will go round into the garden
where there is more of it than mrs hammond cares to see it is
certainly a beautiful plant with its large threesided pointed leaves
and its great pure white bellshaped flowerssomething like the mouth
of a trumpet
in the farmhouse garden however it is certainly a weeda plant in the
wrong place we see that at once close to the hedge are some gooseberry
and currant bushes and into these the bindweed has climbed the
bindweeds stems are twined round the stems and branches of the bushes
till they are almost hidden by it and are bent down by the weight
illustration large bindweed
the bindweed climbs as we see by twisting its stem round the tree to
which it clings but though it is a climbing plant its stems can grow
for a foot or more from the ground without support some of the shoots
of the bindweed are two or three feet away from the stems of the fruit
bushes but they have grown unsupported till they could reach an
overhanging bough and cling to that
every now and then dan who looks after the garden when he has time
cuts oft all the bindweed close to the ground and pulls some of it up
by the roots but fresh shoots soon appear again it is of little use to
dig up the ground near the bushes for the bindweed is twisted all among
their roots
you think the bindweed and the travellers joy beautiful flowers and
so they are at the same time these plants are far more troublesome and
dangerous weeds than the stinging nettle nearly all plants that cling
to other plants do harm they prevent the stems and boughs to which they
cling from swelling freely see how tightly the bindweed stems are
twisted round the boughs of this currant bush ivy bindweed and other
clinging plants often kill or seriously injure valuable trees in this
way
chapter v
clover
i said all i could to make you admire the nettle and to see what a
handsome and even useful plant it is i am afraid however that you do
not care much for it i do not see that any of you have gathered a
handful to take home when we go in to dinner presently if mrs hammond
were to say will you have green peas or nettletops i believe you
would all say peas if you please so we had better look for a flower
that you may like better we will go to ashmead where the cows are
grazing and will find some clover
mr hammond grows clover in some of his fields every year those of you
who have been at willow farm before and have walked about the farmers
fields know this for we saw the bailiff sowing clover broadcast
besides the fields of clover however there is always plenty of it
growing among the meadow grass we find some directly we go through the
gate into ashmead it is a plant with a bright purplishred blossom
let us sit down and examine it carefully
the blossom is a little knob or ball of colour almost round it is
made up of a great many little purple stalks standing upright and very
close together pull a few of these stalks from the blossom and put
their lower ends between your lips they are quite sweet like sugar
nearly all flowers contain honey or rather nectar of which the bees
make honey some flowers have much nectar some less and some have none
at all the clover contains a great deal
now look at the leaves each has three leaflets if you can find a leaf
with four of these leaflets the country children will think you very
fortunate for a fourleaved clover is said to bring good luck just
as a fourleaved shamrock does in ireland a fourleaved clover is
however rather rare i hope you may find one but i am rather afraid
you will not
here is another clover not quite so handsome as the red clover at
which we have just been looking the flowers are white and are rather
smaller this is white or dutch clover it is a perennial plant and one
which spreads over a great deal of ground if it is allowed to do so
we saw you remember that the ivyleaved toadflax on the wall by the
foldyard steps sent out fresh roots from its stems as it grew the white
clover does the same the stems creep along the ground send out fresh
roots and in this way the plant spreads quickly
keeping a few stems of both these clovers in our hands we will go a
little further up the lane there in a field we shall see something
that even country people cannot see every day the clover which farmers
usually sow is either the red clover or the white or else another kind
called alsike this year mr hammond has sown a field with a fourth
kindcrimson clover
did you ever see a more beautiful sight the whole field is a blaze of
rich crimson colour i shall never forget the day i first saw a field
of crimson clover i was so delighted that i asked the farmernot mr
hammond but another friendif he would have a field of it for me to
admire every year he said he would tell me by and by at the end of the
year he said he did not find it such a useful food for his animals as
the red and white clovers and he should not sow it againat least not
very soon you see pretty things are not always the most useful
let us see what differences we can find between the three clovers we
have gathered we look first at the blossoms that of the red clover is
as we have said like a little round ball or knob the flower of the
white clover is of much the same shape but is less fine the flower of
the crimson clover is altogether different in shape it has indeed many
small crimson stems but these do not form a round ball they are
arranged in the form of a little circular cone or pyramid which is large
at the bottom and pointed at the top
illustration clover leaves 1 white 2 crimson 3 red
there are other differences immediately below the flower of the red
clover is a pair of leaves the blossom is said to be sessile or
seated on these leaves other leaves and also other blossoms grow
on the same stem now look at the white clover the blossom grows on
a stalk without any leaves or other blossoms on itonly the single
blossom at the top of the stalk the blossom of the crimson clover has
leaves below it
today we easily distinguish one clover from the others by the flowers
supposing however that we looked at them some day before the flowers
were out what then are there any differences in the leaves all three
have leaves formed of three leafletsthey are trefoilsbut the leaves
are otherwise different
those of the red clover grow on stems branching from the flower stem
and sometimes on the flower stem itself both leaves and stems are
hairy and on the leaves there is generally a white mark something the
shape of a horseshoe
the leaves of the white clover grow like the flower at the top of the
stema single leaf on each stem the under sides of the leaves are
smooth and glossy the leaves of the crimson clover grow on the flower
stems like those of the red clover but the leaflets are broader and
rounder than the red clover leaflets the crimson clover is an annual
while the others are perennials
all these clovers are good food for the farmers animals or stock the
red clover is perhaps the most useful bees however prefer the white
clover for they can more easily get at its nectar
sheep are exceedingly fond of clover but mr hammond is always careful
not to turn them into a field of clover when they are very hungry
or to let them stray in by accident if they got in they would eat it
ravenously and many would very likely die too hearty a meal of clover
has the same effect on them as a great quantity of new bread would have
on you or me
we have spent so much time this morning looking at the clovers that we
have only a minute or two to stand at the gate of a field of beans the
blossoms are prettywhite with dark spotsand they are very fragrant
a field of beans in flower gives us one of the most delightful of all
country scents
chapter vi
in ashmead
there are many other flowers besides the clover in ashmead today and
this afternoon we will look at some that grow among the grass one of
these you may perhaps call a weed yet it is one of the most beautiful
wild flowers in england i mean the golden dandelion
on a lawn or in a garden bed it would certainly be a weed and a very
troublesome one here among the grass we need only think of it as a very
lovely flower see what a rich golden yellow the little florets of the
blossom are plants like the dandelion in which the blossom is composed
of a number of florets are called composite plants
if we examine the plant closely we shall find that each stalk which
bears a blossom and each long deeply indented leaf grows like the
flowerstem and leaf of the primrose from a very short underground
stem it is from the indented leaves that the dandelion gets its name
the leaves have something the appearance of the teeth of a lion now
the french name for lions tooth is dent de lion and we english have
corrupted this into dandelion
each flowerstem is round and when we pull one we see that it is a
hollow tube we bite a piece of the stalk as we did with the clover
blossom what a difference the clover was quite sweet but the
dandelion is very bitter you may not like the taste perhaps but the
white milkylooking juice is quite wholesome dandelion tea and
dandelion beer are often made by country people and the leaves give a
pleasant flavour to a salad
shall we pull up a plant and examine the root i am afraid we cannot
unless you care to go back to the house for a fork or a trowel the
dandelion has a very long strong roottaprootwhich goes deep into
the ground and there is no tall main stem of which we can take
holdthe leaves and flower stalks only break off in our hands
here is a stalk from which the flower has fallen leaving only the seed
of what does it remind you of the travellers joy in autumn yes the
dandelion has what is called a pappus attached to its seed rather
similar to the feathery tail of the travellers joy this makes the
dandelion a troublesome weed the seeds are easily carried by the wind
and if a patch of dandelions is allowed to go to seed it will produce
fresh plants quite far away before the seeds are scattered each head is
like a round white fluffy ball
here are daisies with their dainty white florets often tinged with
pink in the centre of each blossom is a yellow spot every night the
white florets fold up over the yellow centre and do not open until the
morning this fact explains to us the daisys name it is the days eye
which opens at dawn and shuts at night
the daisy is a little flower which everyone knows and loves yet in the
wrong place it is a weed it is a perennial and it spreads very fast of
course both perennials and annuals spread by means of their seed but
perennials also spread in other ways as well we will see how the daisy
does this
there with my pocket knife i have easily dug up a plant the root is
small and compact not long like that of the dandelion but when i try
to lift the daisy plant from the grass i find that it is still held
down by a stout tough thread branching from the root this thread is
connected with another daisy plant from that one there is another
thread connected with a third plant when we have at last got our plant
clear away from the ground three more are hanging to it by these
threads
that is how the daisy spreads it throws out these threadlike shoots
from the root and from these grow another root and plant i knew only
too well what we should find there are far too many daisies in my lawn
at home and i found out long ago the way in which they spread so fast
if daisies are allowed to increase in this way they form large clumps
which smother and kill the grass we notice that each flowerstem and
each leaf of the daisy springs from a very short underground stem as
those of the dandelion do
daisies and dandelions are plentiful in ashmead and so are the yellow
buttercups there are however not quite so many buttercups as you
might think at first the real name of what we call the buttercup is the
bulbous crowfoot and there is also a meadow crowfoot in the field a
third crowfoot is the corn crowfoot today we will notice one or two
differences between the two plants we see here
illustration bulbous crowfoot
the blossoms of both plants have five smooth shining yellow petals
we see however that those of the bulbous crowfoot or buttercup form
a real cup while the petals of the meadow crowfoot spread out almost
flat the meadow crowfoot grows two or three feet high the buttercup
is a shorter plant
the flowers are pretty but that i am afraid is all that we can
say for either of these plants they are both of them bitter and
unwholesome and horses and cattle avoid eating them some people even
say that to carry a bunch of the stems will make the hands sore so i
think that we will only look at and admire the flowers where they grow
the cowslip is a very different plant indeed and we will not call it a
weed even mr hammond is not sorry to see it here for he is fond of a
glass of the sweet cowslip wine which mrs hammond will make if we busy
ourselves and take home some large basketfuls of the drooping blossoms
before we set to work however let us examine the plant
looking at a stalk of cowslip blossoms we see something peculiar about
it at oncesomething unlike the other flowers we have seen six or
seven drooping blossoms grow from the stalk we have picked and they
all grow from the very top of the stalk the point at the top of the
stalk from which the blossoms grow is called the umbel
each blossom has five yellow petals joined together to form a corolla
in the centre of the blossom where these petals meet each is marked
with a spot of deep orangered colour the yellow petals are
comparatively small and peep out of a long pale green sheath called
the calyx
surely we have seen a flower like this beforethe primrose in the
little coppice yes the primrose had five pale yellow petals rather
larger than those of the cowslip and joined together to form a corolla
they grew out of a long green calyx also each petal had a spot of
darker yellow in the centre of the blossom the leaves of both the
primrose and the cowslip are much wrinkled and they grow from a short
underground stem
but you say each primrose blossom grew alone on the top of a long
stem yes but if we had dug up a primrose plant we should have found
that several flower stems grew from the same pointthe top of a very
short stem which hardly appeared above the ground they grew from an
umbel and the primrose is closely related to the cowslip the
difference is that the blossoms of the primrose grow on long stems
from a shortstemmed umbel those of the cowslip grow on short stems
from a longstemmed umbel
chapter vii
in the hayfield
here we are in the hayfield at the end of june it is not really the
hayfield yet but it will be so as soon as the grass is cut for hay
this will be done in a few days so we must lose no time if we wish to
look at some of the flowers before they are cut down
we must not stroll all over this field as we did in ashmead for the
long grass should not be trampled down or it will be difficult for the
machine to cut quite near the gate however are plenty of flowers and
we shall find others if we step carefully along the side of the hedge
we will look first at those flowers which are most important to the
farmer the flowers of the grass we saw you remember that the grass
has flowers just as the rose and the wallflower have if you had thought
that the flowers of all grass would be alike you see now that you were
quite mistaken there are many different grass flowers here
illustration section of grass stem
not only are the flowers different but so are the stems and also the
leaves or blades mr hammond could come into the field in early spring
or autumn when the grass is not in flower and could tell you to which
kind of grass any blade belonged today we shall easily distinguish the
different kinds of grasses by their flowers though we will also notice
differences in their stems and leaves
let us pick a stem or culm of grass we see that the greater part of it
is hollow but at intervals there are joints and here the stem is
solid from each joint grows a leafsheath which is wrapped round the
stem for a little distance above the joint out of each sheath grows a
leaf all grass leaves are long and narrow compared with those of most
other plants but some grass leaves are longer and narrower than others
now for a flower the stem which we have picked is the stem of perennial
rye grass the blossom we see consists of several small spikelets
there are eighteen on our stem they grow alternately on two opposite
sides of the stem first one on one side then one on the other they
have no stalk of their own they are sessile or seated on the stem as
the spikelets are flat and grow on two sides of the stem only each stem
looks as if it had been pressed in a book as perhaps you have sometimes
pressed flowers
the leaves are dark green glossy and shining on the under side of each
leaf there is a prominent rib which extends the whole length this rib
is one of the signs by which mr hammond can tell a blade of rye grass
at once without seeing the flower
this is one of the farmers most useful grasses it forms a close thick
carpet or sward and the more it is trodden on by animals grazing the
better it seems to thrive
here is another excellent grass with a flower quite different in
appearance from the last it is called timothy grass it was first
cultivated in america by a man named timothy hanson and it is now
always known by his christian name mr hammond knows this and now you
know it too but a good many farmers who have plenty of timothy grass in
their fields do not know the reason of its name
illustration cowslip
illustration honeysuckle and wild rose
illustration grasses 1 cocksfoot 2 sweet vernal 3 meadow
foxtail 4 common timothy 5 tufted hair 6 common rye grass
the spikelets of timothy are very small and grow in dense clusters at
the end of the stem so that the blossom forms a kind of tail indeed
timothy is sometimes called meadow catstail a name which gives a very
good idea of its appearance this cluster or tail of spikelets is green
and also rather rough to the touch notice these two points about it we
shall see the reason presently the green leaves have a greyish tint and
are broader than many grass leaves when cut and made into hay the
leaves are rather stiff and hard
timothy grows in good thick clumps but does not make a very spreading
sward moist weather suits it best though it can stand a dry summer
fairly well it is a late grass other grasses in the field are in full
flower today but there are only a few ears of timothy to be seen its
floweringtime is july in one way it is a valuable grass for hay it is
heavy and hay is always sold by weight on the other hand timothy hay
is rather hard
now here is a grass something like timothy yet different in several
ways it is meadow foxtail the ear formed by the cluster of spikelets
is of the same shape as an ear of timothy like a round tail slightly
pointed but the ear of timothy was green while this is a beautiful
silvery grey timothy was rough the ear of meadow foxtail is very soft
and silky to the touch the silkiness and the silvery grey colour are
given to the ear by a soft hair called the awn which grows from each
spikelet the leaves are broad and juicy and there are many of them
meadow foxtail unlike timothy is an early grass you may find it
in flower in april an early grass is always valuable to the farmer
who wants herbage for his sheep and cattle after the long winter
the foxtail moreover is a spreading grass some of its stems are
prostrate they do not stand upright but creep along the ground from
these prostrate stems fresh roots grow and produce fresh plants thus
meadow foxtail makes a good sward
another useful grass is cocksfoot each culm has four or five thick
clusters of spikelets growing on small stalks of their own the clusters
grow from the culm in a way which reminds us of the claw of a fowl that
is the reason of the name cocksfoot is a tall and quick growing plant
and both the stem and flower feel rough and hard the bluegreen leaves
are very juicy the root goes deep into the soil so that this grass
resists drought well
we must notice the sweet vernal grass though there is not much of it in
the field for this grass when it is dry gives out much of the sweet
scent we smell in or near a hayfield if we chew a stalk we notice the
scent ourselves and animals like the pleasant flavour which it gives to
hay though it is an early grass it also lasts till late in the autumn
the spikelets make a cluster or tail at the end of the stalk but they
do not grow so closely together as those of the timothy and meadow
foxtail
look at this tufted hair grass it is very pretty perhaps one of the
prettiest grasses we have seen but the farmer looks upon it as a weed
it has a large and spreading head of flower the spikelets grow on
stems and become gradually smaller towards the top of the stalk the
flower is purple with a shining silvery light upon it it grows in
thick clumps or tussocks and cattle do not care about the leaves
chapter viii
in the hayfield continued
there are many other grasses in the field some of them are useful
while others the farmer would call weeds we must now look at other
flowers and as the grass is so tall it will be better to choose tall
flowers which can easily be seen we soon spy a thistle among the grass
near the gate
there are several kinds of thistle in englandthe milk thistle the
nodding thistle and some others this is the common field thistle it
is far too common to please mr hammond or any other careful farmer it
is true that it is only an annual but like the dandelion it has a
pappus attached to its seed however hard mr hammond tries to get rid
of thistles from his fields fresh seeds are constantly blown into them
from thistles on the roadside banks or in the fields of farmers not so
careful as himself it is very disheartening to a good farmer to have
careless neighbours when mr hammond hears that a new tenant is coming
to a neighbouring farm he always hopes that he will be a clean
farmerthat he will try to keep his fields free from weeds
the stiff stem of the thistle is often three or four feet tall and
divides into smaller branches which bear a flower at the end these
flowers are a little like those of the red clover each blossom has many
small upright florets purplishred in colour the leaves are not very
tempting to touch but they are very interesting they are divided into
several lobes or divisions and each lobe ends in a sharp point they
have no leaf stem to connect them with the stalk of the plant what is
curious about them is that they do not grow from a small point on the
stalk they are decurrent or running along the stalk a broad strip
at the base of each leaf is attached to the stalk
docks too are far too numerous among the grass they are very
troublesome weeds they are perennials and they also scatter a great
deal of seed they have large clusters of small flowers without any true
petals the leaves are very large and pointed growing on long leaf
stems the stems of the dock are tough and they blunt the mowers
scythes and the knives of the mowingmachine
some people have a good word even for the dock they say that a dock
leaf wrapped round the part stung by a nettle will lessen the pain
others advise us to rub the part with dock seed i do not think myself
that either remedy has much effect but the leaves of the sorrel which
is a relative of the dock will lessen the pain of nettle stings mrs
hammond always uses dock leaves to wrap round the pats of butter which
she sends to market
above us in the hedge are two of the sweetest flowers of the farm the
pink dog rose is one the petals of each blossom are five in
numberwhat a number of fivepetalled flowers we have seen the leaves
have five or sometimes seven serrated leaflets one of which is always
at the end of the leaf stem these leaflets are not always perfectly
straight sometimes the pointed end turns a good deal to one side
of course we want to gather some of the flowerswho does not want to
gather roses we want some fully opened blossoms and many of the dainty
buds but the straggling stems of the rose soon teach us the truth of
the proverb no rose without a thorn the stems are thickly covered
with thorns these are not only sharp but hooked as well and we do not
get our bunch of roses without a scratch or two
the other beauty of the hedge is the honeysucklea lovely flower which
may also be a dangerous weed the tight grasp of its strong twining stem
will soon seriously injure any young tree to which it clings here it is
doing little harm and we need only think of the clusters of fragrant
flowers each cluster grows at the end of a stalk some are pale pink
others golden yellow while some are almost white after the blossom
comes the bright red berry which contains the seed the leaves grow in
pairs those low down on the stem have leaf stalks but the upper ones
are sessile on the stem
taking care not to trample the grass we have strolled down the
hedgeside till we have reached the other end of the field where there
is a ditch at once there is a fragrant scent in the aira scent like
that of almonds it is the meadow sweet which grows on the banks of
streams or damp ditches
illustration meadow sweet
it is a beautiful plant as well as a fragrant one at the top of the
tall stems are large clusters of small fivepetalled flowers
creamywhite the stem itself is handsome it is often three or four
feet high smooth stout and of a reddish colour the large leaves grow
alternately on the stem they are made up of several pairs of leaflets
with a single leaflet at the end the upper surface of the leaves is
dark green but the under side is generally covered with a soft white
down
the scent of meadow sweet is very pleasant in the field today but i
think we should find it rather too strong if we took a bunch into the
house yet queen elizabeth is said to have loved meadow sweet strewn on
the floors of her apartments
chapter ix
in the cornfield
one morning early in july while we are having breakfast at willow farm
we ask mr hammond if he thinks we shall find any flowers in his
wheatfield the farmer laughs and says he hopes we shall not but he is
very much afraid that we shall as we are here on purpose to look for
flowers we are glad to find them anywhere mr hammond thinks more about
his crops than about flowers and does not care to see a single blossom
in his corn however pretty it may be
we are soon at the field and there is no mistake about the flowers
being there too close to the gate where the wheat is not quite so
thick as elsewhere there is a splendid patch of scarlet poppies this
is perhaps the very brightest wild flower that we have
some plants as we have seen are annuals others are perennials an
annual only lives for one year the plant springs up from the seed
grows through the summer and in the autumn or the winter dies a
perennial lives for many years the flowers fade and fall as those of
annuals do even the leaves and stems may droop and die the roots and
lower part of the stem do not die they live in the ground through the
winter and in the following year fresh stems appear the white clover
which we found in ashmead is a perennial the crimson clover is an
annual
if you sowed a patch of your garden with poppy seed you would have the
flowers growing there year after year you might therefore say surely
the poppy is a perennial i only sowed the seed one year yet the
poppies appear again and again that is because the plants sowed their
own seed the flowers faded then the seedcases shed their seed upon
the ground next spring the seeds produced fresh plants most annual
wild flowers sow their own seed in this way but we must not mistake
them for perennials because year after year they grow in the same place
in your patch of garden you can easily prevent the poppies from growing
more than one year if you wish to do so all that is necessary is to
pick off every flower before it fades then no seed will fall and you
will be rid of the poppies
mr hammond might do the same you think if he wishes to rid his field
of poppies but you see there are many poppies growing among the wheat
all through the field to get at each plant and cut off all the flowers
would trample down the wheat and do more harm than good all that the
farmer can do is to have as many weeds as possible hoed up while the
wheat is young and short even then many more come up later in the
spring
the seeds of the poppy have no pappus like those of the thistle and some
other plants they are not blown far away by the wind but fall close to
the plant there are however an immense number of very tiny seeds in
each seedcase as we see by opening the round cuplike case on a stem
from which the flower has fallen this great number of seeds adds to the
difficulty of getting rid of poppies
we i am afraid are hardly sorry that the poppies are among the corn
today the glorious scarlet blossoms give a rich fiery tint to the
whole field
on a poppy plant close to the gate there are several blossoms some
of them are fully open some of them are still only buds you see a
difference between the open flowers and the buds at once the open
flowers stand upright on the stalk the buds hang down
here is a bud just opening the green case called the calyx which
contains the scarlet petals is already partly open it is splitting in
half and the flower will soon be out then the calyx will fall off
here is a blossom from which the calyx has just dropped the four large
scarlet petals two of which are slightly larger than the other two
have lain inside all crumpled upnot neatly folded as is the case with
most flowers yet in a very short time after the calyx has dropped off
the sap will flow into the petals and will smooth them out they will be
as glossy smooth and shining as the other blossoms fully open on the
plant
the brilliant poppy is more beautiful than usefulto the farmer and the
bees at any rate most flowers contain nectar but the poppy has none at
all if the bees come to it it is for the dusty yellow pollen to make
into wax
the seed pods of some flowers open when ripe and the seeds fall out
in others the pod or case does not open but rots away the poppy has a
different way of scattering its seed there is a ring of tiny holes in
the seed case and through these holes the seed is shaken out the
leaves are long but vary a good deal in size and shape the stems are
covered with stiff and bristly hairs
chapter x
in the cornfield continued
besides the poppies there is charlock in the field not much mr
hammond will be glad to know for he has been trying for many years to
get rid of this plant altogether pretty as the yellow blossoms of the
charlock are it is one of the most troublesome weeds which the farmer
has to fight it is only an annual certainly and each seedpod holds no
more than six or seven seeds the seeds however are oily and this
oiliness preserves them if they are ploughed deep into the ground they
may live there for several years and will produce a plant when turned
up again by the plough or the scuffle
mr hammond tells me that some years ago this field was full of
charlock and in the early summer there would be more charlock than
wheat to be seen this is how he got rid of it every year he ploughed
the field and got it ready for the crop as early as possible then the
charlock sprang up before the crop of corn or turnips was sown thus it
could be rooted out still as we see today there is a little left
though it is growing less each year
charlock is wild mustard there is more seed than blossom here today
for the flowering time for charlock is in june if we chew some seed
from a pod we shall find it hot and biting to the tongue in some parts
of england many farmers grow mustard as one of their crops
near willow farm some farmers grow mustard as a catchcrop they sow it
in autumn as soon as another crop has been taken off the field in the
spring it is eaten by sheep or else it is ploughed in a catchcrop
ploughed in like this enriches the land moreover a number of weeds are
buried with the catchcrop before they have time to blossom and to shed
their seed
the yellow blossom of the charlock is pretty and the poppy is the
finest scarlet wild flower we have there is a third flower among the
wheat today the beautiful blue corn flower or corn bluebottle it is
no more welcome to the farmer than the poppy and the charlock are it is
a perennial and therefore difficult to get rid of moreover when we
pull up a stem we find it quite hard work it is so tough these tough
stems blunt the sickles of the reapers and the knives of the reaping
machine
illustration left creeping field thistle
illustration right field scabious
illustration left evergreen alkanet
illustration center cornflower
illustration right smaller bindweed
illustration charlock
to us it is only a very beautiful flower the florets in the centre of
each blossom are dark purple but the outer ones are of a brighter blue
the leaves are long and narrow those near the bottom of the stem are
rather broader than those higher up the stems themselves are not round
but angular we can feel corners or angles as we hold one in our hand
they are also covered with a kind of down
there is another flower which we shall see better if we come to the
stubble field after the wheat is cut but some of it is near the gate
today this is the smaller bindweed we see that it is a relation of
the large bindweed in the garden hedge it has leaves and flowers of the
same shape but the flowers are smaller and are pink and white those
of the large bindweed are rarely anything but pure white
this is another troublesome weed here it does not climb as the large
bindweed does but creeps along the ground twining round everything it
meets in the potato field it is often even more troublesome than here
corn is cut but potatoes are dug out of the ground the small
bindweed forms such a thick carpet over the field and twines round the
potato stems so closely that it is often very difficult to dig up the
potatoes
here is another little flower which i am glad to show you now the
scarlet pimpernel this and the poppy are the only scarlet wild
flowers we have there are many pink and also many purple flowers
but only these two are really scarlet
the pimpernel differs from the poppy in almost everything except its
colour the poppy has a tall stout stem and its blossoms are very
large the pimpernel trails on the ground and has tiny flowers the
blossoms of the poppy have four petals those of the pimpernel have
five these are a beautiful scarlet but not quite so bright a scarlet
as those of the poppy
the leaves grow in pairs and the small bare stalks which carry a flower
at their ends spring from the stem beside the leaves the leaves are
sessile on the stem turning a leaf over we find that on its under side
are black or dark purple spots
illustration pimpernel
the blossoms of the pimpernel close up when rain is near and it is
often called the poor mans weatherglass sometimes but very rarely a
plant is found which has pink or even pure white blossoms there is
also a blue pimpernel another pimpernel is the bog pimpernel but we
shall not find it in this dry field of corn as you may guess by the
name
one more flower we will look at and then it will be time to leave our
cornfield and to search elsewhere growing on the hedgebank at the side
of the field is a pretty lilacblue flower on a long bare stalk it is
the field scabious
the blossoms are in shape like a round ball very much flattenedlike a
round pincushion there are no large petals here as with the poppy but
a great number of small florets those on the outer edge of the blossom
are larger than those inside each floret is a tiny tube or pipe
the leaves are on separate stalks from those which bear the flowers and
they grow in pairs they are divided into several pairs of lobes with a
single lobe at the end of each leaf some leaves grow from that part of
the stem which is underground and these are larger than the others and
are sometimes of a different shape both the leaves and the stem are
hairy
chapter xi
on the chase
we have now seen a good many flowers of the farm we have found them in
the coppice on the garden wall and in the fields today we will go a
little further off three miles away
you say surely that is a long way off for the farmer to have a field
it is not exactly a field the chase is a great open common or moor
which belongs to the village or parish where willow farm is nearly all
the people of the village have certain rights of pasturage on it they
may let their horses and cattle and sheep graze there every now and
then mr hammond sends some of his sheep to the chase to feed there for
a few weeks it is very high dry ground and that is good for sheep
the road runs through the middle of the great common without any hedge
or fence on either side there are horses and sheep and cattle here on
this may morning donkeys too all the sheep are marked and we soon see
some which belong to willow farm they are stamped on the back in large
letters wh for william hammond a farmer easily knows his own horses
and cows sheep are less easy to recognise and are usually marked
illustration gorse
one of the flowers of the chase we see at once in whatever direction we
look across the common there is a perfect blaze of goldthe blossoms of
the prickly gorse or furze spring is the time to see its mass of golden
yellow blossoms best but i do not think there is a week or even a day
in the whole year when some of the flowers are not out did you ever
hear the saying kissing is out of season when the gorse is out of
bloom that is never
the gorse flowers are beautiful and their scent is sweet as to
gathering them however there is a terrible difficulty the flowers
grow among long sharp spikes which cover the stems closely you would
almost as soon gather nettles there are very few real leaves and they
are small and not easily seen but the thorns are beautiful to look at
if not to touchthey are such a rich dark green
nor is gorse a useless plant if the prickly stems are bruised or mashed
a little they form a fodder which animals like indeed a pony near us
seems to enjoy them as they are he is tearing off and eating piece
after piece from a gorse bush his mouth must be less tender than ours
later in the summer we visit the chase again to find some flowers that
were not out in may on our way we pass a potato field in blossoma
very pretty sight these blossoms are a palish purple but sometimes the
potato flowers are white
the hairbell is a flower which we shall now find on the chasea great
contrast to the stout and thorny bush of gorse the hairbells stem is
almost as slender as a thread although it stands upright each blossom
is a dainty little blue bell of five petals white blossoms are
sometimes found but not often
there are leaves as well as flowers on the stem growing from the lower
part of the stem close to the ground we may perhaps find some broader
rounder leaves perhaps not however for these lower leaves soon wither
and die away
illustration hairbell
the hairbell loves to grow where there is fresh pure air here on the
chase we are high up it has been a long steep climb from willow farm
and we are more than five hundred feet above sea level far below us a
few miles away we see a broad river on which steamers and sailingships
are passing up and down away to the west is the sea from which a
breeze is nearly always blowing across the chase no wonder that the
little hairbell loves the spot
we have found a yellow flower and a blue one on the chase and now we
have not far to look for something red here is a clump of heath or
ling and not far off a patch of heather too we must be careful to
distinguish heath from heather let us look at the heath first
on the heath as on the hairbell we find bellshaped flowers but the
blossoms of the heath are very small and grow from a tough woody stem
they are a reddishpurple on little side branches growing from the
stems are the very tiny leaves the whole plant is low bushy and
spreading
illustration heath and heather
the flowers of the heather are rather larger deep crimson in colour
and grow in clusters on the flower stems grow very small narrow leaves
there are generally three of them together and they do not grow so
thickly as the leaves of heath among these leaves are some that are
made up of several leaflets
gorse heather and heath are spreading plants and if they were
allowed to grow unchecked they would soon smother and destroy the
turf every few years therefore the chase is burnt in winter or spring
both gorse and heath burn easily the fire spreading fast from one patch
to another the smoke of the burning chase may then be seen from many
miles away
when the fire has burnt out the chase looks very black and dismal but
the roots and underground stems of both the heather and the gorse are
still alive fresh shoots will grow and soon the gorse will be golden
in the spring the heather purple in the summer as they were before
chapter xii
in the lanes
this is the last day that we can spend in looking for wild flowers at
willow farm perhaps some of you already knew something about flowers
before this visit if so you may have been disappointed that we have
not seen some favourite flower of your own you may think we have
passed over many flowers which deserved to be noticed
for that matter i think every wild flower deserves to be noticed but
we certainly should not have time for all i showed you several plants
growing on the walls and roof because it was interesting to see that
quite beautiful flowers such as the wallflower and the houseleek could
grow with very little soil we looked rather closely at the clovers and
at the grasses in the hayfield because these plants are important to
the farmer they are part of his crops then too we noticed several
weeds which do him harm
today i am going to take a kind of holiday i shall show you three
flowers not because they have much to do with the farmer but because
they are great favourites of my own
none of these are very common at willow farm although i know where to
find each one we will go first down the little stony lane which leads
from near the foldyard gate to the cottages where the shepherd and the
bailiff live here we shall find the alkanet it is a perennial and it
blossoms here year after year i only know one other place in the
village where it grows like some other flowers we have seen it is not
really a native of england
it has a very beautiful blue blossom a little like the blossom of the
forgetmenot which perhaps you know but the flower of the alkanet is
of a deeper richer blue here again as with so many other flowers we
have seen the blossom is formed of the five lobes of a corolla in the
centre of each blue blossom is a small white spot
the blossoms grow in little clusters on a short stalk and on this stalk
there is always one pair of small leaves the leaves on the main stems
of the plant are larger the lower leaves have stalks but those on the
upper part of the stem are sessile the leaves are hairy and so are the
stems which often grow two or three feet high
we saw that the poppy and the pimpernel were the only two true scarlet
wild flowers of our fields in the same way there is only one other
english wild flower which has such a deep blue blossom as the alkanet
that is the borage and the borage like the alkanet is not really a
native of england for a fine golden yellow flower i do not know
anything which can beat the dandelion if we have not seen every wild
flower which grows at willow farm we have at any rate seen three which
have the deepest and richest colours
now for my next favourite this time we go to the shady lane leading
from willow farm to the church that is the only place near here where
i have found the lesser periwinkle there is also a larger periwinkle
very similar to my favourite here except in size
illustration lesser periwinkle
to find the periwinkle in full flower we should have to come in spring
but though it is july now we shall still find a blossom here and
there i hope even in winter we might do so too
the lesser periwinkle has a blue flower but the blue is a pale lilac
blue here again the petals are really the five spreading lobes of the
corolla there is something curious about these lobes they are of a
peculiar irregular shape that is not easy to describe they are not
exactly pointed and they are not regular in shape you could cut the
petal of a buttercup into two equal parts it would be almost impossible
to do this with the lobes of the periwinkle blossom
the leaves are dark green glossy and pointed and they grow in pairs
often however we find two pairs of leaves growing so closely together
that they seem to grow in fours the leaves are evergreen they do not
fade and die in autumn
some of the periwinkle stems are erect and are about six inches high
others are creeping it is only the erect stems which bear flowers the
creeping ones are barren they do useful work however for they form
fresh roots as we have seen the stalks of some other plants do in this
way the whole bank beside the lane has become covered with the pretty
plant
the periwinkle is a comparatively small plant the last flowerthe
foxglovethat we shall see at willow farm is quite different it is a
very tall plant it is generally described as growing from three to five
feet high but i have seen a stem of eight or nine feet we shall find
it growing on the hedgebank in little orchard and it also often grows
in woods
some plants as we know are annuals others are perennials the
foxglove is neither it is a biennialthat is a two years plant if
you sow foxglove seed you will have no flowers the first year only a
root and a great bunch of leaves in the second year tall stems which
bear the flowers will appear in the autumn after it has flowered the
foxglove generally dies though sometimes it may live for another year
or even two foxgloves of course will reproduce themselves by seed as
annuals and perennials do
illustration foxglove
the foxglove is something different from anything that we have seen as
yet the flowers grow on short flower stalks and hang down from the
tall stems a great many on each stem here there are no petals but
what we see and admire so much is the bellshaped corolla purplered in
colour this purple bell is spotted with white inside bellshaped is
perhaps not a very good description the flower is more like a large
thimble or the finger of a glove
a glove for a foxthat is the meaning of the name you perhaps say
no it has nothing to do with a fox many years ago nearly everyone
believed in fairies and the fairies were often called the good folk or
good people it is they and not the fox who were supposed to use the
purple blossoms as a glove if you say folks glove quickly you will
see how easily it comes to sound foxglove so our last thought among the
flowers is of the fairies in whose existence hardly anyone believes
