translators preface
this translation was undertaken with the especial object of
facilitating the study of the native medicinal plants by the
numerous medical officers stationed at small posts throughout the
philippines in order to aid in the recognition of these plants
the botanical descriptions have been revised to the extent of adding
where possible the size and shape of the plant english name length
of leaves color of flowers etc in many instances supplying the
entire botanical description where it had been omitted on account of
general familiarity with the plant comparing the few analyses that i
have had an opportunity to make with corresponding ones in the native
works from which dr tavera has taken his botanical descriptions
i am impressed with the necessity for a revision of the botany of the
philippines however as the therapeutic properties of the flora are
of foremost interest to the medical profession i have not hesitated
to publish the book in its present form as an entering wedge leaving
to those better fitted the great work of classifying the flora of
these islands in accordance with modern botanical science
dr tavera has faithfully described the malay and hindu therapeutics
of the present day enriching his description by observations founded
on a long practice in paris and in his own native luzon from this
potpourri of scientific therapeutics and ignorant superstitious
drugging the interested physician will elicit not a few useful data
concerning the treatment of disease in the tropics and at the same
time gain a more intimate knowledge of both the people and plants of
our new asiatic possessions
i take this occasion to gratefully acknowledge my obligations to
mr a p tonielli stenographer and translator of the supreme court
of the philippines for typewriting the manuscript of this translation

preface
commissioned by his majestys government to study the medicinal
plants of my native country i returned there and spent two years in
collecting data regarding the use that the filipinos make of their
plants in the treatment of disease at the same time i collected and
carefully preserved some with the purpose of taking them to europe to
study their chemical composition in the laboratories of paris under the
direction of the eminent men who had been my instructors in medicine
the work i did in the philippines was preliminary a preparation
for the more extended study of the subject which i wished to make
in paris where i went with my notes and collection unfortunately
upon leaving manila i confided the mounting and pressing of my
plants to an inexperienced person who stupidly placed in the midst
of them several succulent tubers which decomposed during the voyage
and spoiled the other plants at the same time i received in paris
an important collection of the vegetable drugs of the philippines
sent by my friend the pharmacist m rosedo garcia and destined for
the worlds fair of 1889 i opened with great pleasure the wood and
zinc box in which the collection came anticipating that i should be
able to carry out my plan of study and at the same time win for my
friend garcia a welldeserved premium imagine my disappointment
upon finding that by an unfortunate coincidence his plants had
arrived in the same condition as mine having also been packed with
tubers of ubi gabi etc and several cocoanuts which had decomposed
many times since then i have tried to obtain from manila through
exchange or payment of money a similar collection but have been
unable to secure a single leaf of the plants i so desired if in the
future i have the good fortune to procure any i shall make a study
of those at hand and publish the results
i herewith publish the results of my investigations and experiments
in manila where especially in the neighboring towns of san mateo
and san miguel i often had opportunities for using with good
results the plants of which this volume treats i may add that in
spite of the limited means at my disposal in manila and the short
time left me by my regular occupations i was able to conduct a few
laboratory experiments owing to which this work contains some personal
observations reinforcing those quoted from medical literature
the flora of the archipelago is known today through the works of
fathers blanco llanos fernandez del villar and naves and of the
engineers jordano the brothers vidal and soler and others who have
brought such honor to spanish science preparing the way for the study
of the therapeutic and industrial applications of that wonderfully rich
plant life with which our islands have been endowed their works help
us to recognize the plants whose medicinal virtues are herein described
and it is to them i owe the botanical descriptions in this treatise
father blanco in describing certain plants mentions their medicinal
uses in the philippines but his descriptions are few and very
deficient as one would expect in a work of the scope of his flora a
jesuit of some reputation father clain published in manila in 1712
a book entitled remedios fciles para diferentes enfermedades in
which he speaks of the medicinal virtues of some of the indigenous
plants almost the same ones that appear in another work a frank
and pleasing little treatise written by father santa maria father
mercado is the only one who has written a special treatise on the
subject and his manuscript remained unedited until the augustinian
fathers of manila published it in the last edition of father blancos
flora but neither this work nor those of clain or santa maria are
useful to a physician nor are they as accurately written as works
of a scientific character should be from time to time superficial
articles have appeared in the manila papers regarding the virtues of
some plant or other and these books and articles comprise the whole
literature on the subject up to this time
some physicians regard with small favor the therapeutic application of
plants by the filipino herbdoctors curanderos as being entirely
empirical this disparagement is unjustified because in all the
most rational and scientific remedies that we make use of the first
step towards the final development of their relative position among
remedies is due to empiricism which is founded on daily experience
on observation of results obtained in specific cases facts that
are handed down from father to son for generations the scientific
explanation is lacking but those first ideas frequently owing their
origin to chance or perhaps to superstition have often been based
upon the observation of facts which although fortuitous are none
the less positive
many of the plants mentioned in this book are official in the
pharmacopoeia of india and we see no reason why their use should be
proscribed in the philippines filipino physicians not only can but
should employ many indigenous plants in their therapeutics in many
instances they would find them more useful than the exotics which
are not always fresh and are commonly reduced in strength by long
keeping or damaged by some circumstance of voyage or climate the
price is another argument in favor of the use of native drugs if
the pharmacists would prepare extracts and keep on hand the crude
drugs most in demand the public would gain a great advantage and the
druggists be well repaid for their labor physicians and pharmacists
will surely understand these advantages and when finally one considers
that the patients generally prefer to be treated with native plants
i feel justified in the hope that their use will spread rapidly in
the philippines
to employ therapeutically the drugs described in this work is not
to experiment in anima vilis as some would have us believe to
experiment is to employ unknown remedies of unknown virtues and
properties
in this treatise i am not attempting to fix the indications for this
or that product but simply make known the diseases in which the
filipinos and the natives of other countries employ the products any
physician has a perfect right to prescribe these drugs as have also
the curanderos and even the laity with this difference however
that the physician is capable of observing results and guiding
himself by the physiologic action of the drugs his knowledge of
the physiologic and anatomopathologic problems of the human body
will enable the physician to make scientific inferences that would
be hidden from the common curandero
as neither the manila nor the provincial physicians keep these
medicinal plants in stock with the exception of those that are
official in the european and american pharmacopoeias it will be
necessary for the physician who wishes to use them to busy himself
with seeking them and laying in a sufficient stock to serve him when
the opportunity presents itself it is necessary to preserve them by
drying and this is best done by exposing them several days to the fresh
air in a dry placefor example the corridors of the housebeing
careful not to expose them to the rays of the sun in which latter
event the fleshy and juicy plants which do not desiccate rapidly
putrefy or ferment
a convenient way to get them is to visit the binondo square where there
has been market for native drugs from time immemorial the gardeners
from the neighboring towns especially those from pasay and singalon
regularly offer the plants for sale and will undertake to supply you
with any that may not be on hand inasmuch as the common names of the
plants lead to many mistakes and much confusion it is indispensable to
acquaint ones self with the description of the plant and be sure that
the actual product conforms in all respects to the description for
this purpose it is well to obtain flowering specimens and bearing
this fact in mind i have been careful to indicate the flowering
season of each plant by making excursions to the towns of san mateo
and angono i have obtained an abundance of whatever i sought and
at the same time have learned by talking with the mountaineers and
curanderos what uses they make of their plants the curanderos
know a great deal concerning these uses but become very reticent
as soon as they are questioned about them whether it is dread of
ridicule or selfishness or fear that silences them the fact remains
that it is no easy matter to glean any useful facts from them and
yet by tact and friendliness one may elicit much more information
from them than first impressions would lead one to hope
leaves should be gathered when fully developed rejecting the old
dried and wormeaten ones
the best time to gather bark is one month before the period of
inflorescence when it is rich in sap the flowers are best gathered
when about half expanded the fruit is gathered green or ripe according
to the active principle sought the seeds should always be mature
not all parts of the plant are equally provided with the active
principle which may be localized in the root or the flower or distinct
principles may exist in different parts of the same plant therefore
the part indicated and only that part should be employed
in the root the active substance usually resides in the bark sometimes
in the parenchyma that envelopes the woody tissue and rarely in the
woody tissue itself as for example in rhubarb and pareira brava
the stem bark is also a frequent seat of the active principle of
which the outer portion contains the greater amount according to
the valuable experiments of howard
some plants owe their therapeutic importance to their wood others to
their leaves or flowers and regarding the localization of the active
principle in these parts we have nothing especial to indicate the
fruit however may have a pericarp consisting of mucilage starch
sugar and gum etc while the seeds contain fatty matter fixed or
essential oils or alkaloids as is the case with coffee and cacao in
view of these facts we repeat that it is indispensable to use that
part of each plant which i have indicated as applicable to a determined
case or condition
i earnestly hope that the physicians and pharmacists practising in
the philippines may undertake investigations and experiments regarding
the therapeutic properties of the plants of my native land and that
my endeavors may have acted as a stimulus or inspiration to the loyal
and earnest study of the subjects that are now awakening such interest
not only in europe and america but in india and japan
i should be pleased to receive notes plants or reports of researches
from any one interested in the subject matter of this book and i
shall consider it a pleasure as well as a duty to devote my forces
small as they may be to aiding any one who may do me the honor to
claim my assistance

the decoction of the fruit is given after meals as a tealike beverage
to aid digestion or for its carminative effect in flatulent colic
star anise has an aromatic taste slightly bitter and acrid and
a very marked perfume of anise which with its starlike form gives
the plant one of its names it is a very useful stimulant tonic
stomachic and carminative
it is official in all pharmacopoeias and the pericarp is the part
employed
the dose is from 1 to 2 grams to 100 of water in infusion to be
taken in one draught
according to schlegel it contains the following substances an
essential oil 4675 a green waxy material which melts at 51 a resin
a gum and saponin the essential oil is almost identical with that
of anise from which it is impossible to distinguish it chemically the
only difference is that the former has a blander odor and solidifies
at 125 instead of 10 as does the oil of anise

in burmah they extract the balsam by the following method a large
hole is cut in the trunk of the tree and a fire is built in this
cavity and kept up till the wood of the trunk begins to burn by
which time the oleo resin has collected in abundance in the segments
of bamboo placed to receive it when the exudate diminishes fire is
again placed in the cavity and one tree may tolerate 2 3 or even 4
of these cavities the exudate on standing separates into 2 parts
a solid called guad which forms the lower layer and a supernatant
liquid which is the balsam it is dense viscid and very fluorescent
opaque and graygreen by reflected light it has an odor similar to
that of copaiba is bitter and aromatic its density is 0964 it
is soluble in benzine in bisulphuret of carbon chloroform the
essential oils and less so in ether and acetic acid it becomes turbid
and coagulates if it be kept at 100 for some time and it solidifies
at 200 while copaiba remains liquid at this temperature

cotton is used extensively in bacteriological laboratories as a
filter of liquids and gases this property possessed by cotton
of retaining in its fibers the germs of the air was utilized by
the famous french surgeon gurin in the treatment that bears his
name the denuded surfaces exposed to infection by airborne bacteria
are completely protected against them when according to the gurin
treatment they are enveloped in large masses of fresh raw cotton
presumably free from microrganisms to avoid the possibility of
infection by the cotton itself it is now the practice to sterilize
it either by means of chemicals such as carbolic acid iodoform
etc or by physical means such as high temperatures
raw cotton is used in compounding gun cotton or explosive cotton also
named pyroxylin and this is used to make collodion so extensively
employed in medicine
pyroxylin is made by treating cotton with equal parts of nitric and
sulphuric acids then washing with water till the latter ceases to
give a precipitate with chloride of baryta then dry in the air

cause of dilatation of the stomach in the philippines the seed

theobromine starch glucose gum tartaric acid free or combined
tannin and mineral substances of these the butter and theobromine

theobromine c7h8n4o2 is a weak alkaloid crystalline
slightly bitter slightly soluble in cold water more soluble in hot
water less soluble in alcohol and ether stable in the air up to
100 sublimes without decomposition at 290 in microscopic crystals
of the form of rhomboid prisms ending in an octohedric point keller
this alkaloid is very little used in therapeutics and its physiological
action is said to be analogous to that of caffeine but weaker it
is better to use the salt of the alkaloid and that most frequently
employed is the salicylate of soda and theobromine in doses of from
2 to 6 grams daily in solution or pill lately however dr gram
has maintained that theobromine is a powerful diuretic operating when
other diuretics fail and further that this effect is produced without
injuring the heart the double salt is nontoxic though sometimes in
exceedingly weak patients it produces vertigo dr gram administers

butter is obtained by grinding or mashing the roasted seeds in a hot

boiling water it is then pressed between two hot iron plates and
the butter thus obtained is refined by boiling water it is then
put aside in earthen pans or still better in moulds where it
solidifies it does not easily become rancid and for this reason
enters into the composition of many ointments and pomades or is

used internally as an antipyretic in fevers and in dysentery mistaking
the properties of the plant it is given for vesical calculus which
if composed of oxalates would be increased instead of diminished by
the treatment in fact the salt of sorrel in the leaves contains a
large quantity of oxalic acid mixed with potassium oxalate in china
india and the philippines the entire plant is used as an antiscorbutic
the cold infusion of the leaves is given internally in doses of from
30 to 60 grams but it is not a medicine to be given indiscriminately
because in addition to its power of adding to the bulk of calculi of
the oxalates the contained potassium oxalate is poisonous in doses
of 25 to 30 grams if a concentrated solution is taken it operates as
a corrosive poison producing violent pains in the stomach vomiting
faintness and great weakness if the solution is dilute its absorption
is rapid and it operates very energetically when a patient is poisoned
by a concentrated solution the stomachpump is contraindicated
because the mucous membrane of the organ is corroded and ulcerated
if by a dilute solution use the pump to remove as much of the poison
as possible the best antidote is a watery solution of a soluble salt

serving the same uses for food as the camia its acidity is due to
the presence of oxalic acid which makes the green fruit useful for
removing ink and rust stains from clothes the juice of the fruit is
refreshing and is given internally mixed with water and sugar as a
refreshing drink in fevers and as an antiscorbutic for the latter
the ripe fruit is eaten uncooked
in mauritius the juice is used to treat dysentery and hepatitis padre

rice in diarrhoea and bilious colic in connection with the subject
of camias and balimbins we should mention the fruit treatment of the
bilious diarrhoea of the tropics spoken of by the french physicians
of cochin china dr van der burg of the dutch indies also strongly
recommends the treatment of diarrhoea by fruits in temperate regions
using fruits like peaches pears etc and in the tropics lychies
mangosteens etc in regard to the mangosteens we must not forget that
while the bark is given because of the amount of tannin it contains
the composition of the pulp is very different the fruit acids seem
to exercise great influence in the cure of this obstinate disease

pilipitch or elemi as they call it in manila is a substance
existing in soft masses slightly yellowish or gray resembling old
honey in appearance its odor is strong and agreeable somewhat like
that of lemon and turpentine its taste is acrid and bitter
the french pharmacist meaujean demonstrated in 1820 that elemi contains
two resins one soluble in the cold and the other in hot spirits of
wine other chemists among them baup flckiger and hanbury have
found elemi to be composed of a resinous substance and a colorless
essential oil the proportion of the latter flckiger gives as 10
and further states that it is dextrogyrous sainteclaire deville found
the essential oil levogyrous a fact that emphasizes the probability of
there being different products in the market bearing the name of elemi
baup obtained several principles from it 1 a resin brein
fusible at 187 soluble in cold alcohol crystallizable in oblique
rhombic prisms 2 another crystalline substance bryoidin soluble
in 360 parts water at 10 and melting at 13 3 a small amount of
breidin a body soluble in 260 parts water and melting at 100
4 another resin soluble in boiling alcohol called amyrin
white pitch is used in the philippines to make plasters which they
apply to the back and breast of patients suffering from bronchial
or pulmonary complaints it is also applied to indolent ulcers we

its indications for internal use are the same

given him good results in several cases of beriberi particularly
in recent cases and those in which nervous and paralytic symptoms
predominated in concan the juice of the leaves is given in doses

paste with cow urine are used locally in treatment of itch they are
also used in the treatment of leprosy gout rheumatism and other
diseases which according to their medical theories are derived from
cold humors for these purposes they give the seeds internally
beginning with one and increasing daily until 50 are taken at the
same time they make external applications of the oil or of another

usesthe part of the plant most important in therapeutics is the
seed the size of a small pea bright red with a black spot hard and
shining the filipino children use them to make rosaries and other
decorations in the distant past the filipinos used these seeds to
weigh gold a practice followed even today by the hindoos the famous
susrutas author of the ayur veda recommends them internally for
nervous diseases modern therapeutics however limits their use
to one disease though that is frequent and stubborn enough namely
chronic granular conjunctivitis
some physicians state that these seeds are poisonous and others the
contrary but the fact that they are used as food among the poor
classes of egypt demonstrates their harmlessness in the digestive
tract at least when introduced into the circulation they undoubtedly
exercise a toxic effect we have already mentioned that their use
is limited nowadays to the therapeutics of the eye the decoction of
the seeds known in europe under the name of jaqueritiso named in
brazilproduces a purulent inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva and
it is precisely this counterirritant effect which makes it useful in
chronic granular conjunctivitis the persistence of which has defied
the most heroic measures of therapeutics the french oculist dr de
wecker was the first to employ jequirity for this purpose in the
form of a 24 hours maceration of the seeds 10 grams to 500 grams of
water it is necessary to use a product recently prepared and with
this several applications a day are made it is now known that the
inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva is not caused by germlife
contained in the solution but by an inorganic ferment discovered
by bruylans and venneman and named jequiritin they state that it
is produced during the germination of the seeds or of the cells in
the powdered seeds warden and waddell of calcutta have isolated
an essential oil an acid named bric and an amorphous substance
called abrin obtained by precipitation with alcohol from a watery
infusion of the pulverized seeds its action is identical with that of
jequiritin
the infusion appears to possess considerable value as a stimulating
application to indolent ulcers
the root is a good substitute for licorice is emollient and has an

usesthe decoction of sibukao is given in hemorrhages especially
of the lungs it is probably the red color of this decoction which
originated the idea of giving it to check bleeding and this is the
practice of the native filipino doctors as well as of the arabs
and hindoos the natives of cochin china reasoning in an opposite
manner prescribe it as emmenagogue some authors recommend sibukao
as a substitute for logwood the decoction is administered in chronic
diarrhoea especially that of children a few cases of phlebitis have
been reported as occasioned by its use the extract is made as follows

the filtrate to a syrupy consistency do not use iron vessels
sibukao contains much tannin and gallic acid and a peculiar substance
which distinguishes it from logwood brasilin c22h20o7
which gives a red color to alkaline solutions instead of blue or
purple it is a crystalline pigment which may be considered a compound
of hematoxylon and fenol

previous to the studies of the above authors the seeds had been
therapeutically tested by delioux de savignac and professor
clouet heckel and schlagdenhauffen have confirmed the febrifuge
virtues of the seeds and are uncertain as to the active principle
since they found no glucoside or alkaloid in their analysis the
antiperiodic properties are comparable with those of quinine and have
even proved effective in some cases in which quinine failed it seems
quite clear that the tannin is the active principle which is the
more probable because its antiperiodic virtues are now recognized
by all therapeutists

different lands its antiherpetic properties are notable and the
tagalo name of the plant gamut sa buni means literally medicine
for herpes the natives use the juice of the leaf applied locally
to the affected part these properties have long been familiar to
the malays and to the hindoos who in their medical works give the
plant the sanscrit name of dadrughna meaning to cure herpes the
pharmacopoeia of bengal recommends cassia in the form of an ointment
made by mixing the crushed tender leaves with simple ointment this
preparation is in our opinion undesirable on account of its liability
to become rancid and vaseline should be the excipient used another
application for herpetic eruptions is the juice of the leaves mixed
with an equal quantity of lemon juice the malays use the leaves dried
in the sun adding to them a little water and rubbing them briskly
on the affected parts the vigorous treatment being an important part
of the cure
the decoction of the leaves is a laxative and according to mr j wood
the tincture has an action similar to that of senna dr pulney andy

a good substitute for extract of colocynth

macerate 10 or 12 days filter and express then filter again and

the seeds contain vermifuge principles
the activity of this plant in herpes is due to the chrysophanic acid

the effect

dujardinbeaumetz has tested the therapeutic value of these seeds in
diabetes but with negative results scott has maintained that by adding
the powdered seed to a mixture of malt and starch fermentation is
impeded but dr villy in the laboratory of dujardinbeaumetz has
demonstrated that such is not the case contrary to the opinions
of those physicians who stated that jambul was capable of causing
the glucose to disappear from the urine of diabetic patients without
concurrent diabetic regimen dujardinbeaumetz observed in his trials
of the drug that the slightest relaxation of the regimen was followed
by an increase of glucose under the influence of the medicine in doses
of 210 grams daily at the same time maintaining a strict diabetic

from the third to the fifth day but this occurred only in cases of

hours to raise a blister and at the same time cause severe pain he
found it much more painful than cantharides and much less prompt to

obtained with it results very different from those just mentioned
this is not surprising in view of the fact that the tincture holds
in solution in a small quantity of ether a considerable amount

sufficient dose of tannate of pelletierine is 3040 centigrams in

preparatory measures mentioned above it causes toxic symptoms similar

symptoms of intoxication as vertigo inverted vision and muscular

and this quantity may be given to a child in a little milk if no
symptoms supervene within onehalf hour give another similar dose and
so on up to 3 or 4 doses or 12 gm in all after the last dose give
the purgative as a routine it is certainly imprudent to trust the
administration of such a drug to any one incapable of recognizing the
symptoms of intoxication and as no one but a physician can judge the
effects of the alkaloid he himself should remain with the patient until
the efficient dose has been absorbed this is manifestly impractical
and we therefore maintain that the alkaloid is not suited for the
treatment of children

usesthe decoction of the leaves is used locally in sores and atonic
ulcers followed by a poultice of the boiled and mashed leaves the
natives use the cold infusion of the leaves to wash clothes spotted
with blood and the spots disappear rapidly by virtue of the ferment
papain which digests the fibrin the infusion is also very useful as
a wash for sores and gangrenous ulcers modifying their appearance
very rapidly
before proceeding further it is desirable to give a description of
papain a digestive ferment which exists throughout the whole plant
fruit trunk leaves and petioles it is contained in the milky juice
which exudes from all these parts when cut this juice was studied
simultaneously by wurtz in france and peckolt in brazil the best
method of collecting it is to make several superficial longitudinal
incisions in the green fruit without removing it from the tree
immediately an abundance of juice appears in the incisions and
coagulates rapidly the best time to do this is the early morning the
fruit does not suffer by this process but continues developing and
ripens perhaps more rapidly at the same time improving in flavor
becoming sweeter the seeds however atrophy and lose their power
of germination peckolt gives the following as the composition of
the juice

the milky juice is neutral and coagulates rapidly separating in
two parts a kind of insoluble pulp and a limpid colorless serum if
combined with fibrin raw meat white of egg or gluten it gradually
softens them and completely dissolves them in 3 or 4 hours in vitro
at 40 c combined with milk it coagulates it and soon precipitates
the casein which is also dissolved a little later it digests
lumbricoids and tapeworms and the false membrane of croup in a few
hours according to wurtz and bouchut papain is prepared as follows
the fluid juice or the aqueous solution of the milky exudate is
precipitated by the addition of ten times the volume of alcohol the
precipitate after treating again with concentrated alcohol is
dissolved in water and the addition of subacetate of lead eliminates
the albuminoids and peptones but does not precipitate the papain the
liquid is filtered and the lead salts separated by means of a current
of hydrogen sulphide it is filtered again and alcohol added gradually
which process first precipitates whatever sulphate of lead may have
passed through the filter and then the papain
papain is an amorphous substance perfectly white soluble in water
insipid odorless an aqueous solution if shaken violently foams like
a solution of soap boiling makes it turbid and when concentrated it
has a slightly astringent taste it is precipitated by hydrochloric
nitric picric and the metaphosphoric acids trommers test gives it a
beautiful blue violet color which on boiling changes to a red violet
it is an extremely active digestive ferment comparable with pepsin
but superior to the latter because it does not require an acid medium
as its digestive action takes place even in the presence of an alkaline
medium and of antiseptic substances such as boric acid phenol etc it
is given in doses of 1040 centigrams in different vehicles such as
water wine etc it should be given after meals carefully and properly
diluted in order that its action may not be exerted upon the gastric
mucous membrane itself its use is contraindicated in gastric ulcer
a watery solution prepared by macerating the green fruit has been
used effectively to remove blemishes from the face leaving the skin
clean and smooth the natives use little pieces of the green fruit to
remove freckles which they call pecas the ripe fruit is edible
and its taste quite agreeable in some of the malay islands it is
given for dysentery but it must be remembered that the ripe fruit
does not contain papain
the pure exudate is given to children as an anthelmintic in doses of
26 grams with a little molasses but it is not so harmless that it
may be used with impunity in this form moncorvo and others having
reported cases of peritonitis with symptoms suggestive of cholera
following its use it is drastic and digestive in addition to its
anthelmintic action but according to rabuteau boiling destroys the
first property without affecting the others dr lemarchand of the
island of mauritius gives the following anthelmintic prescription
        juice of papaya and molasses    aa 1 tablespoon

        boiling water                      4 tablespoons

castor oil for a child onehalf dose
this treatment frequently causes colic for the relief of which the
author advises an injection of sweetened water sir oshaughnessys
prescription is preferable
    2060 drops of the exudate in a little sweetened water
this dose cannot cause any untoward symptoms and is efficient in
expelling both lumbricoids and tni
the triturated seeds may be given internally in doses of 12 grams

in the seeds the presence of a resinous oil an oleaginous material
of disagreeable odor and taste called by peckolt caricin a fatty
acid papayic acid and a resin in india the seeds are considered

for several hours before eating in order to soften it for the same
purpose they sometimes boil the meat in water containing a few leaves

in 1870 according to dymock broughton analyzed the fresh bark and
reported that the bitter taste was due to esculin which after drying
and coming in contact with decomposing organic matter is transformed
into the almost tasteless esculetin naylor studied the bark at
a later period and attributed the bitterness to an alkaloid that
he named hymenodictyonine this substance exists in the form of a
gelatinous mass creamcolored very hygroscopic an ethereal solution
carefully evaporated deposits it in the form of crystals its
empirical form is c23h40n2 it is probably volatile and is
notable for its lack of oxygen it differs from quinoidine in that
it is inactive  and that in combination with platinum it retains
less of this metal than does quinoidine it differs from paricine
in its proportion of hydrogen and from berberine in containing more
carbon in the presence of sulphuric acid its solution assumes a yellow
color changing to winered and then to dark red naylor extracted
another principle which he found combined with the alkaloid in a soda
precipitate of the latter it is a product of the decomposition of a
glucose the formula of which is c25h49o7 this compound remains
insoluble when the alkaloid is treated with ether repeated boiling
in alcohol renders it colorless it is bitter soluble in alcohol

coffea arabica l
nom vulgcafe sp coffee eng
usesthe infusion of roasted and ground coffee seeds constitutes
a beverage of arabic origin but now common all over the world in
the philippines where a few years ago the coffee plant was only
cultivated in gardens the harvest has assumed such proportions
that it now constitutes one of the greatest sources of agricultural
wealth its use is becoming more general every day and the discovery
of its alkaloid caffeine the therapeutical use of which is also
steadily increasing has given new importance to the seed on account
of its increasing demand in the drug trade when newly harvested its
taste is not very agreeable for it needs considerable time2 or 3
yearsin which to dry completely before it acquires the aromatic
properties and the savor of which it is susceptible general morin
relates an incident of having drunk a delicious infusion of coffee
made from authentic moka that had been kept for fifty years of course
under ideal conditions of preservation
in civilized countries coffee is an article of prime necessity as a
food here we shall consider it therapeutically under two heads as
a tonicstimulant and as an antiseptic as caffeine is the principle
that acts upon the heart we shall consider the cardiac properties of
coffee under the head of that alkaloid so important that it may best
be studied separately
there are two preparations of coffee the decoction used by the arabs
and the infusion used in europe and adopted in the philippines the
decoction forms a tonic and aromatic drink devoid of any excitant
properties but the infusion is highly excitant and should not be
taken in such large amounts as the decoction for its action may be
powerful enough to cause headache nausea trembling of the extremities
and disorders of vision and hearing these phenomena however are not
dangerous and rapidly subside as soon as the urine eliminates the
substances that cause them
infusion of coffee stimulates especially the cerebral functions and
the circulation as to its digestive properties opinion is divided
but it is more probable that it lacks them and that coffee taken
after meals owes its reputation as a digestive aid to two distinct
factorsthe temperature and the sugar without doubt it exerts an
anaphrodisiac action on account of which the illustrious linnus
called it the drink of eunuchs this action seems incompatible with
the fact that the arabs who are so much given to the abuse of the
pleasures forbidden to eunuchs are most addicted to the use and abuse
of coffee the explanation rests in the form in which they consume
their coffee namely the decoction which is free from the sedative
principle of the seed that undoubtedly resides in the aromatic
ingredient cafeol
coffee is contraindicated in hysterical and nervous persons in
children and in those who suffer with insomnia or palpitation it
counteracts sleep and coma being very useful in poisoning by opium or
its alkaloids its stimulant action is as rapid as that of alcohol on
several occasions it has yielded me marked results when given by
stomach or by enema in cases of nervous and cardiac depression indeed
it is a remedy that i cannot recommend too highly and each day leaves
me more convinced of its therapeutic activity and certainty
attention has only lately been directed to the antiseptic property of
coffee though we have long been availing ourselves of that property
without knowing it this is true of many other medicinal agents
indeed of all that the modern studies of bacteriology have presented
to us as antifermentives and microbicides roasted coffee in powder
form gives good results if dusted over ulcers and gangrenous sores
rapidly improving their appearance and destroying the foetid odor it
corrects the unhygienic properties of nonpotable water and therefore
enters into the army and navy ration of nearly all the nations of
europe in epidemics of disease every physician should advise its
use in mild infusion as a regular beverage
dr luderitz experimenting in the hygienic institute of berlin
reported that no bacteria could resist the action of coffee in
infusion he attributed this action not only to the tannin which
is present in high percentage but principally to the empyreumatic
substances formed by the roasting the caffeine takes no part in this
action dr luderitz exposed the coffee to the open air for six days
and found it free from bacteria at the end of that time whatever may
be the explanation of its activity the fact remains that coffee is
highly antiseptic and this should be kept in mind by physicians not
only because it is everywhere easily obtained and an infusion easily
prepared but because it in addition possesses the great advantage
of being nontoxic

cabalonga for katbolongan the natives handle it with the greatest
imprudence selling everywhere in the markets and in the chinese
shops called tindangbayang it is not only a remedy among them
but a sort of panacea to which they attribute among other virtues
that of expelling evil spirits simply worn about the neck they grate
it with a piece of earthen pot mix with a little tuba vinegar and
apply it to the temples for headache in bites of poisonous animals
they advise the application of the powdered seed over the wound a
treatment which instead of being beneficent might easily be harmful
to the patient before proceeding further let us give the chemical
composition of the seeds in order that their uses may be the better
understood
strychnine is found in them in the proportion of 121 12 and
brucine 1214 flckiger and hanbury by drying it over sulphuric
acid and burning it with cal sdica obtained 178 of nitrogen which
represents 10 of albuminoid material strychnine and brucine exist
in combination with igasuric acid discovered by ludwig in 1873 the
proportion of both the alkaloids is greater than in the seeds of nux
vomica which contain only 2550 strychnine and 1205 brucin
although some authors give it as high as 101 strychnine can be
obtained more readily and in larger proportions from st ignatius bean
but it is generally obtained from nux vomica seeds on account of the
cheapness of the latter
it is more energetic than nux vomica and its use in medicine should
be condemned preference however being given to the official
preparations among which the best known is that commonly called
bitter drops of beaum of which the following is the composition

to the accidents it may give rise to its use in therapeutics
is very limited like all the active solanace it is effective
against neuralgia and spasm of the muscular tissues and is therefore
indicated in strangulated hernia and in intestinal obstruction in
these conditions the infusion of 15 grams of the dried leaf to
250 grams of water is given by enema trousseau advises nonsmokers
who suffer from chronic constipation to smoke a cigarette fasting
a practice which according to him stimulates defecation for the
same condition the people of southern india are accustomed to apply
a poultice of the bruised leaves to the anal region
tobacco has been used by enema to combat tetanus dr lesth of
the general hospital for europeans bombay claims to have obtained
excellent results by applying a poultice over the entire length of
the spinal column dr dymock has confirmed this practice
a decoction of the leaves is used as a lotion to destroy pediculi
capitis and pubis and to wash gangrenous ulcers
the daily increasing practice of smoking like all other subjects
divides mankind into two camps one for and one against the habit both
parties exaggerate their arguments the abuse of the plant without
doubt sets up disturbances of the digestion the heart and the
nervous system it is furthermore positive that persons of a certain
disposition and with certain ailments are injured by even a moderate
use of tobacco the above facts serve as arms for the opponents of
the habit the robust who smoke and drink to excess and meet with
an accidental death on a railroad or from an acute disease that
overtakes them in the midst of perfect health serve as arguments for
the defenders to prove the innocence of the custom the antiseptic
qualities of the smoke and of the entire plant also lend the smoker
a defensive argument as he may uphold the habit as hygienic and
highly useful in preventing microbic infection the antiseptic power
of tobacco smoke is undoubted but it is intolerable that a physician
under the pretext of avoiding self infection should enter the house
of his patient and continue smoking at the bedside
chronic nicotine poisoning is the result of a gradual intoxication
by the absorption of the active principle of tobacco the alkaloid
nicotine excessive smoking conduces to nicotism more common in
europe than in the tropics because the natives of europe smoke the
pipe and being confined in closed dwellings breathe continuously an
atmosphere of smoke in the philippines on the contrary the pipe is
almost unknown and owing to the nature of the dwellings the smoking
is carried on practically in the open air an injurious practice of
the filipino smokers is that of swallowing the smoke and this is a
fitting point to call attention to an error of dujardinbeaumetz who
states that in those who habitually swallow the smoke the nicotine
acts directly upon the stomach the expression swallow smoke
tragar el humo does not mean to force it into the stomach by an
act of deglutition and i am sure no one attempts to dispose of it
in that way but to inspire or breath it into the air passages it
is evident that this latter habit does not involve the stomach but
those who practice it expose themselves more to nicotism than those
who keep the smoke in the mouth or expel it through the nose
the first cigar causes symptoms familiar to nearly everybody
dizziness malaise cold sweat vomiting diarrhoea dilatation of
the pupils and rapid heart actionan acute intoxication chronic
intoxication or nicotism manifests itself by disturbances of digestion
vision and especially circulation it has been assigned as one of the
causes of early atheroma and of angina pectoris it should therefore
be proscribed in persons who present symptoms of gastrointestinal
or of heart disease and in every patient who complains of slight
precordial pains commonly attributed to flatus but in reality
cardiac neuralgia a fugitive symptom announcing the possibility of
that grave accident angina pectoris capable of ending the life of
the patient with one stroke
nicotine c10h14n2 is an oleaginous liquid heavier than

several workmen died from the effects of wounds caused by splinters of
the wood but the statement has not been confirmed by later cases and
the deaths were most probably due to a septic infection independent

in philippine as well as spanish cooking both are difficult of
digestion and communicate a very disagreeable odor to the breath
intolerable to those who are unaccustomed to it garlic possesses
the singular property familiar to many students and soldiers
of inducing a transient fever if introduced within the anus when
bruised and applied to the skin it has a counterirritant action which
makes it useful in the treatment of rheumatism but the odor is so
disagreeable that it is not worth while to use it for that purpose
when we have so many other medicines which produce the same effect
without being objectionable it is also used locally for the bites
of venomous animals
the onion is used cooked as a poultice over the bladder and internally

usesthe seeds form part of a masticatory very common throughout
the extreme orient known as buyo and composed of a betel leaf
a little slaked lime and a slice of the fruit of the bonga known
as siri in indochina and among the malays it is so common that
it is hard to find a man or woman who does not use it the saliva
of those who use it is red and of a strong odor and its careless
use in time blackens the teeth and makes the breath extremely
disagreeable habitual chewers consider it a tonic of the mouth and
stomach and a general stimulant as well it probably does possess
these properties but they are reversed in the case of persons who
use it immoderately for they lose appetite become salivated and
the whole organism degenerates the carbonized and powdered fruit
is used as a dentifrice but its virtues are doubtless identical with
those of any vegetable charcoal i e absorbent and antiseptic
one unaccustomed to the use of bonga and chewing it for the first time
usually experiences a most disagreeable combination of symptoms
constriction of the oesophagus a sensation of heat in the head
and face the latter becoming red and congested at the same time
dizziness and precordial distress are experienced the same phenomena
occur in certain persons after eating palmito salad or the tender
central portion of the bonga and of other palms
the flowers are eaten in salad like the abovementioned palmito the
seed is astringent and tnifuge for the latter purpose it is given
internally as a powder in a dose of from 16 to 24 grams its action
is uncertain the catechu which is obtained in india from the bonga
differs from that obtained from the acacia catechu and is a tonic
analogous to rhatany and cinchona
the seeds contain about 14 of a fatty crystalline material which
melts at 39 and after saponification yields a crystalline fatty acid
that may be regarded as a mixture of lauric and muriatic acids they
also contain about 14 of a red amorphous tonic material which
after drying is but slightly soluble in cold or hot water
the lower part of the petiole of the leaves is thin and broad
ensheathing the trunk is as tough as pasteboard when dry and is used
in the philippines as wrapping paper dr bholanauth bose and other
physicians of india use it as a material for splints in fractures
a practice which might well be imitated in manila and especially in

philippines without it and the bamboo plant the people of the
archipelago would not know how to live it produces vinegar an
alcoholic drink called tuba or cocowine an oil an edible nut
and its leaves are used instead of nipa to roof the huts
tuba is an opaline slightly sweet liquid with an agreeable taste
which rapidly becomes acid under the influence of the heat a flowering
or fruitbearing stalk which has not been incised before is chosen
and encircled with several rings of rope or rattan the stalk is then
cut and a bamboo vessel called a bombn is hung to receive the sap
which escapes during the night this liquid is valuable as a drink
for those who are debilitated suffering from pulmonary catarrh and
even for consumptives who are accustomed to drink it every morning
sometimes with marvelous results according to reports the heat of
the day rapidly ferments the tuba converting it into a mild vinegar
which is widely used for domestic purposes in the philippines when
fermented and distilled it produces a weak alcohol of disagreeable
taste called cocowine
the ripe fruit contains a rather soft and savory meat which is
generally eaten mixed with the clear sweet coconut milk later the
meat becomes firmer and is used as a food and an oil much used in the
islands is extracted from it to extract the oil the meat is grated
and pressed until all the juice is extracted this is called the milk
and when boiled is converted almost completely into oil cocoanut
milk has an agreeable taste and may in some cases take the place of
cows milk it is apt to produce diarrhoea however which action
may be bad for some but on the other hand good for others such as
the habitually constipated both the meat and the milk are widely
used by the natives in making sweets
in the greater part of the islands it is the only oil used for
illumination as a medicine it is employed internally as a purgative
and externally in the treatment of scores of troubles in which the
good results obtained are due not to the oil but to the massage used
in rubbing it in it has the reputation of stimulating the growth
of the hair and all the natives and some europeans use it lavishly
as a hair ointment when fresh its odor is agreeable but it easily
becomes rancid and assumes a most disagreeable odor in the visayan
islands they make an oil of a nauseous odor which they call in manila
caracoa it is used only for illumination and by the poor
at a temperature of 20 or more the oil remains liquid it is colorless
when fresh and properly extracted it solidifies at 18 and two kinds
of soap are made of it one soft and exceedingly cheap called quiapo
the other hard white of a high quality but as a rule containing

construction of roofs and walls of houses which are therefore called
nipa houses the decoction of the fresh leaves is used as a lotion
for indolent ulcers and a popular preserve is made from the fruit
like the coco and following the same process the nipa yields a liquid
also called tuba and possessing properties identical with those of
the former plant the weak alcohol distilled from it has some repute
in the treatment of conjunctivitis for which purpose a few drops are
mixed with a small quantity of water and the eyes are washed with it
several times a day this alcohol improperly called wine of nipa
has a characteristically unpleasant odor which makes it impracticable
for medicinal or industrial use several chemists have attempted to
remove the characteristic odor from nipa alcohol but their results
had always been negative because the odorous principle was distilled
over at the same temperature as the alcohol finally a distinguished
filipino chemist d anacleto del rosario perfected a process of
producing from the nipa tuba an absolute alcohol perfectly free from
the characteristic odor an alcohol in fact possessing all the
qualities of chemically pure alcohol and of such a high grade that
it was awarded the first prize at the last worlds fair in paris
