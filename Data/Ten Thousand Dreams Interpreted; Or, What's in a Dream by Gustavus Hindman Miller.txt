we are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates for time for better editing
please note  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
the official release date of all project gutenberg etexts is at
midnight central time of the last day of the stated month  a
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so  to be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month  since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less
information about project gutenberg one page
we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work  the
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  this
projected audience is one hundred million readers  if our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtytwo text
files per month  or 400 more etexts in 1996 for a total of 800
if these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach 80 billion etexts
the goal of project gutenberg is to give away one trillion etext
files by the december 31 2001  10000 x 100000000trillion
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 10 of the present number of computer users  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that so it
will require us reaching less than 5 of the users in 2001

in a dream in a vision of the night when
deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon
the bed then he openeth the ears of men and
sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw
man from his purpose and hide pride from man

preface
dreams are rudiments of the great state to come
we dream what is about to happenbailey
the bible as well as other great books of historical and
revealed religion shows traces of a general and substantial
belief in dreams  plato goethe shakespeare and napoleon
assigned to certain dreams prophetic value  joseph saw
eleven stars of the zodiac bow to himself the twelfth star
the famine of egypt was revealed by a vision of fat and lean cattle
the parents of christ were warned of the cruel edict of herod
and fled with the divine child into egypt
pilates wife through the influence of a dream advised her husband
to have nothing to do with the conviction of christ  but the gross
materialism of the day laughed at dreams as it echoed the voice and
verdict of the multitude crucify the spirit but let the flesh live
barabbas the robber was set at liberty
the ultimatum of all human decrees and wisdom is to gratify
the passions of the flesh at the expense of the spirit
the prophets and those who have stood nearest the fountain
of universal knowledge used dreams with more frequency than
any other mode of divination
profane as well as sacred history is threaded with incidents
of dream prophecy  ancient history relates that gennadius
was convinced of the immortality of his soul by conversing
with an apparition in his dream
through the dream of cecilia metella the wife of a consul the roman senate
was induced to order the temple of juno sospita rebuilt
the emperor marcian dreamed he saw the bow of the hunnish conqueror
break on the same night that attila died
plutarch relates how augustus while ill through the dream
of a friend was persuaded to leave his tent which a few hours
after was captured by the enemy and the bed whereon he had lain
was pierced with the enemies swords
if julius caesar had been less incredulous about dreams he would
have listened to the warning which calpurnia his wife
received in a dream
croesus saw his son killed in a dream
petrarch saw his beloved laura in a dream on the day she died
after which he wrote his beautiful poem the triumph of death
cicero relates the story of two traveling arcadians who went to
different lodgingsone to an inn and the other to a private house
during the night the latter dreamed that his friend was begging for help
the dreamer awoke but thinking the matter unworthy of notice went to
sleep again  the second time he dreamed his friend appeared saying it would
be too late for he had already been murdered and his body hid in a cart
under manure  the cart was afterward sought for and the body found
cicero also wrote if the gods love men they will certainly disclose
their purposes to them in sleep
chrysippus wrote a volume on dreams as divine portent
he refers to the skilled interpretations of dreams as a true divination
but adds that like all other arts in which men have to proceed
on conjecture and on artificial rules it is not infallible
plato concurred in the general idea prevailing in his day
that there were divine manifestations to the soul in sleep
condorcet thought and wrote with greater fluency in his dreams
than in waking life
tartini a distinguished violinist composed his devils sonata
under the inspiration of a dream  coleridge through dream influence
composed his kubla khan
the writers of greek and latin classics relate many instances
of dream experiences  homer accorded to some dreams divine origin
during the third and fourth centuries the supernatural origin
of dreams was so generally accepted that the fathers relying upon
the classics and the bible as authority made this belief a doctrine
of the christian church
synesius placed dreaming above all methods of divining the future
he thought it the surest and open to the poor and rich alike
aristotle wrote  there is a divination concerning some things
in dreams not incredible  camille flammarion in his great book
on premonitory dreams and divination of the future says
i do not hesitate to affirm at the outset that occurrence of dreams
foretelling future events with accuracy must be accepted as certain
joan of arc predicted her death
cazotte the french philosopher and transcendentalist warned condorcet
against the manner of his death
people dream now the same as they did in medieval and ancient times
the following excerpt from the unknown1 a recent book
by flammarion the french astronomer supplemented with a few
of my own thoughts and collections will answer the purposes
intended for this book
1 from the unknown  published by harper  brothers copyright
1900 by camille flammarion
we may see without eyes and hear without ears not by unnatural excitement
of our sense of vision or of hearing for these accounts prove the contrary
but by some interior sense psychic and mental
the soul by its interior vision may see not only what is
passing at a great distance but it may also know in advance
what is to happen in the future  the future exists potentially
determined by causes which bring to pass successive events
positive observation proves the existence of a psychic world
as real as the world known to our physical senses
and now because the soul acts at a distance by some power that belongs
to it are we authorized to conclude that it exists as something real
and that it is not the result of functions of the brain
does light really exist
does heat exist
does sound exist
no
they are only manifestations produced by movement
what we call light is a sensation produced upon our optic nerve
by the vibrations of ether comprising between 400 and 756 trillions
per second undulations that are themselves very obscure
what we call heat is a sensation produced by vibrations between 350
and andsic 600 trillions
the sun lights up space as much at midnight as at midday
its temperature is nearly 270 degrees below zero
what we call sound is a sensation produced upon our auditory nerve
by silent vibrations of the air themselves comprising between 32000
and 36000 a second
      
very many scientific terms represent only results not causes
the soul may be in the same case
the observations given in this work the sensations the impressions
the visions things heard etc may indicate physical effects produced
without the brain
yes no doubt but it does not seem so
let us examine one instance
turn back to page 156
a young woman adored by her husband dies at moscow  her fatherinlaw
at pulkowo near st petersburg saw her that same hour by his side
she walked with him along the street then she disappeared
surprised startled and terrified he telegraphed to his son
and learned both the sickness and the death of his daughterinlaw
we are absolutely obliged to admit that something emanated
from the dying woman and touched her fatherinlaw this
thing unknown may have been an ethereal movement
as in the case of light and may have been only an effect
a product a result but this effect must have had a cause
and this cause evidently proceeded from the woman who was dying
can the constitution of the brain explain this projection
i do not think that any anatomist or physiologist will give
this question an affirmative answer  one feels that there is
a force unknown proceeding not from our physical organization
but from that in us which can think
take another example see page 57
a lady in her own house hears a voice singing
it is the voice of a friend now in a convent and she faints
because she is sure it is the voice of the dead
at the same moment that friend does really die twenty miles
away from her
does not this give us the impression that one soul holds
communication with another
here is another example page 163
the wife of a captain who has gone out to the indian mutiny sees one night
her husband standing before her with his hands pressed to his breast
and a look of suffering on his face  the agitation that she feels convinces
her that he is either killed or badly wounded  it was november 14th
the war office subsequently publishes his death as having taken place
on november 15th  she endeavors to have the true date ascertained
the war office was wrong  he died on the 14th
a child six years old stops in the middle of his play and
cries out frightened  mamma i have seen mamma  at that
moment his mother was dying far away from him page 124
a young girl at a ball stops short in the middle of a dance and cries
bursting into tears  my father is dead i have just seen him
at that moment her father died  she did not even know he was ill
all these things present themselves to us as indicating
not physiological operations of one brain acting on another
but psychic actions of spirit upon spirit  we feel that they
indicate to us some power unknown
no doubt it is difficult to apportion what belongs to the spirit
the soul and what belongs to the brain  we can only let ourselves
be guided in our judgment and our appreciations by the same
feeling that is created in us by the discussion of phenomena
this is how all science has been started  well and does not every
one feel that we have here to do with manifestations from beings
capable of thought and not with material physiological facts only
this impression is superabundantly confirmed by investigation concerning
the unknown faculties of the soul when active in dreams and somnambulism
a brother learns the death of his young sister by a terrible nightmare
a young girl sees beforehand in a dream the man whom she will marry
a mother sees her child lying in a road covered with blood
a lady goes in a dream to visit her husband on a distant steamer
and her husband really receives this visit which is seen by a third person
a magnetized lady sees and describes the interior of the body
of her dying mother what she said is confirmed by the autopsy
a gentleman sees in a dream a lady whom he knows arriving at night
in a railroad station her journey having been undertaken suddenly
a magistrate sees three years in advance the commission of a crime
down to its smallest details
several persons report that they have seen towns and landscapes
before they ever visited them and have seen themselves in situations
in which they found themselves long after
a mother hears her daughter announce her intended marriage six months
before it has been thought of
frequent cases of death are foretold with precision
a theft is seen by a somnambulist and the execution of
the criminal is foretold
a young girl sees her fiance or an intimate friend dying
these are frequent cases etc
all these show unknown faculties in the soul  such at least
is my own impression  it seems to me that we cannot reasonably
attribute the prevision of the future and mental sight to a nervous
action of the brain
i think we must either deny these facts or admit that they must
have had an intellectual and spiritual cause of the psychic order
and i recommend sceptics who do not desire to be convinced to deny
them outright to treat them as illusions and cases of a fortuitous
coincidence of circumstances  they will find this easier
uncompromising deniers of facts rebels against evidence
may be all the more positive and may declare that the writers
of these extraordinary narratives are persons fond of a joke
who have written them to hoax me and that there have been persons
in all ages who have done the same thing to mystify thinkers
who have taken up such questions
these phenomena prove i think that the soul exists
and that it is endowed with faculties at present unknown
that is the logical way of commencing our study which in the end
may lead us to the problem of the afterlife and immortality
a thought can be transmitted to the mind of another
there are mental transmissions communications of thoughts
and psychic currents between human souls  space appears
to be no obstacle in these cases and time sometimes seems
to be annihilated
a few years ago a person whom i will designate as a related a dream
to me as follows  i take no interest in pugilism or pugilists
but i saw in a dream every detail of the corbett and fitzsimmons mill
four days before it took place out west  two nights before the fight i
had a second dream in which a favorite horse was running but suddenly
just before the judges stand was passed a hitherto unobserved little black
horse ran ahead and the crowd shouted in my ears fitzsimmons wins 
b relates the following as a dream  i saw the american soldiers
in claycolored uniform bearing the flag of victory two weeks
before the spanishamerican war was declared and of course before
any living being could have known the uniform to be adopted
later i saw several days before the actual occurrence happened
the destruction of cerveras fleet by the american navy
signed b
just after the south african hostilities began i saw in a dream
a fierce struggle between the british and boers in which the former
suffered severe losses  a few nights after i had a second dream
in which i saw the contending forces in a longdrawn contest
very disastrous to both and in which neither could claim a victory
they seemed to be fighting to a frazzle  signed c
d related to me at the time of the occurrence of the dream the following
it had been suggested to me that the two cereals corn and wheat were too
far apart and that i ought to buy corn  at noon i lay down on a lounge
to await luncheon i had barely closed my eyes before a voice whispered
dont buy but sell that corn  what do you mean  i asked
sell at the present price and buy at 23 78  the foregoing dream was
related to me by a practical successful business man who never speculates
i watched the corn market and know it took the turns indicated in the dream
in this dream we find the dreamer conversing with some strange
intelligence possessed of knowledge unknown to objective reason
it could not therefore have been the waking thoughts
of the dreamer for he possessed no such information
was the message superinduced through the energies and
activities of the waking mind on the subjective mind
this could not have been because he had no such thoughts
besides the intelligence given was free from the errors
of the calculating and anxious waking mind
we must therefore look to other sources for an explanation  was it
the higher self that manifested to abraham in the dim ages of the world
was it the divine voice that gave solace to krishna in his abstraction
was it the unerring light that preceded gautama into the strange solitudes
of asia  was it the small voice that elijah heard in the desert
of shurr  was it the comforter of jesus in the wilderness and the garden
of distress  or was it pauls indwelling spirit of this earthly tabernacle
one thing we may truthfully affirmthat it did not proceed from the rational
objective mind of the rank materialist who would close all doors to that
inner life and consciousness where all true religion finds its birthmark
its hope its promises and its faith which rightly understood
will leave to the horrors of the roman crucifixion the twin thieves
superstition and scepticism while the angel of goodwill will go
free to solace the world with the fruit and fragrance of enduring power
and promise the steel chains that fasten these hydraheaded crocodiles
of sensuous poison around love and destiny can only be severed by the diamond
of wisdom and knowledge
a citizen worthy of confidence relates the following dream
in december 1878 i saw in a dream my brotherinlaw henry yarnell
suffering from a bloody knife wound after this i awoke but soon
fell asleep again  the second time i dreamed of a similar scene
except that the wound was the result of a shotgun  after this i
did not go to sleep again  i was much troubled about my dream
and soon started in the direction of my brotherinlaws house
i had not gone far when i met an acquaintance who promptly informed
me that my brotherinlaw had been shot  signed e
a wellknown resident of chattanooga tenn formerly of new york city
will vouch for the accuracy of the following incident in his life
on february 19 1878 i was boarding with a family on christopher street
new york while my wife and baby were visiting my parents in the country
a short distance from the city  our baby was taken sick
the malady developed into brain fever followed by water on the brain
causing the little ones death
at our boardingplace there was at the time a quartette of us
grass widowers as we called ourselves and in order to pass away
the time pleasantly we had organized a grass widowers euchre club
we used to meet almost every evening after dinner in the diningroom
and play until about eleven oclock when we would retire
on the above date i dreamed that after playing our usual evening
games we took our departure for our rooms and on the way up
the second flight of stairs i heard a slight movement behind me
on looking around i found i was being followed by a tall figure
robed in a long loose white gown which came down to the floor
the figure seemed to be that of a mani would say about seven
feet tallwho followed me up the second flight and along
the hallway entering my room  after coming in the door he made
a circle of the room and seemed to be looking for something
and when he approached the door to make his exit he stopped still
and with a gesture of his hand remarked i have taken all you have
on the following morning about 930 oclock i received a telegram
from my wife announcing the death of our only baby  signed f
a wellknown citizen of chattanooga tenn relates and vouches
for the truth of the following occurrence
several years ago when a boy i had a schoolmate and friend willie t
between whom and myself there sprung up a mutual feeling of high regard
we were chums in the sense that we were almost constantly together both at
school and at home and among the partnerships we formed was one of having
amateur shadowgraph and panoramic shows in the basement of willies home
this much to show the mental and social relationship that existed between us
some time during this association i cannot recall the exact night now
i had a strange dream in which my chum appeared to me with outstretched hand
asking me to shake saying i shall not see you any more  with that
the dream lapsed and was over  i thought nothing of the occurrence and had
almost forgotten it when one day about a week later during which time i had
not had a glimpse of my chum while he was out hunting with another friend
w mcc in following him over a rail fence the latters gun was accidentally
discharged in willies face and neck resulting in instant death
with this shocking news the memory of the dream i had had came back to me
vividly and puzzled me very greatly and indeed has puzzled me to this day
signed g
the recipients of the above dreams are living today and their names
and address may be obtained none of them are credulous fanatics
or predisposed to a belief in psychic or spirit phenomena
the above dreams except two cannot be explained by telepathy
because the mental picture cast on the dream mind had not in either
instance taken place in waking life  this would account for
the dream perception of d which did not in all probability
take place until after the murder had been committed
the vision of f might be disposed of in the same way
in this instance f saw the whiterobed specter open the door
walk around the room and finally taking his position as if
to depart say  i have taken all you have  no doubt this
vision took place at the exact moment of the childs death
there are thousands of similar experiences occurring daily in the lives
of honest healthy and sane human beings that rival the psychic
manifestations of indian yogism or hebrew records
still men go on doubting this true and loving subjective intelligence
that is constantly wooing for entrance into the soul and is ever
vigilant in warning the material life of approaching evils
they prefer the witch of endor and the black magicians of ancient
egypt to the higher or christ self that has been seen and heard
by the sages and saints of all ages assuming appropriate symbols
as in the case of the vision of f where the angel of
death was assumed
to paul it appeared as a great personal truth whom he was
relentlessly persecuting  to many a wayward son or daughter
of the present time it appears as a dead relative or friend
in order to approach the material mind and make its
warning more effective
to those who were interested in the teachings of christ but who after
his death were inclined to doubt him this higher self materialized
in the form of the great master in order to impress on their material
minds the spiritual import of his teachings  so to this day when doubt
and temptation mar the moral instinct god through the spiritual self
as job says approaches man while in deep sleep upon the bed to impress
his instructions that he may change man from his purpose
the spiritual world always fixes its orbit upon a
straight line while the material world is fonder of curves
we find man struggling through dreadful marshes and deserts
of charlatanism in order to get a glimpse into his future
instead of solicitously following the straight line of inner
consciousness that connects with the infinite mind from which
aided by his church and the healthy action of his own judgment
he may receive those helpful spiritual impressions and messages
necessary to solace the longings of the searching soul
the philosophy of the true master is the straight line
pythagoras plato and christ created angles by running vertical lines
through the ecclesiastical and hypocritical conventionalities of their day
the new angles and curves thus produced by the bold philosophy
of the humble nazarene have confronted with impregnable firmness
during the intervening ages the sophistry of the pharisees
in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men
in slumberings upon the bed then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth
their instruction  that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide
pride from manjob 3315
man cannot contradict the laws of nature  but are all the laws
of nature yet understood
real philosophy seeks rather to solve than to denylytton
those who live active lives exclude spiritual thought and
fill their minds with the fascinations of worldly affairs
pleasure and business dream with less frequency than
those who regard objective matters with lighter concern
the former depend alone upon the voluptuous warmth of the world
for contentment they look to money the presence of some one
or to other external sources for happiness and are often disappointed
while the latter with a just appreciation of temporal wants
depend alone upon the inner consciousness for that peace
which passeth all carnal understanding
they are strengthened as were buddha and christ by suppressing
the sensual fires for forty days and nights in the wilderness of trial
and temptation  they number a few and are never disappointed
while the former number millions
nature is threefold so is man male and female son or soul
the union of one and two produce the triad or the trinity
which underlies the philosophy of the ancients
man has a physical or visible body an atom of the physical or visible earth
he has a soul the exact counterpart of his body but invisible and subjective
incomplete and imperfect as the external man or vice versa
the soul is not only the son or creation of man but it is the real man
it is the inner imperishable double or imprint of what has outwardly
and inwardly transpired  all thoughts desires and actions enter the soul
through the objective mind
the automaton of the body responds as quickly to the bat
of the eye as it does to the movement of the whole body
by it the footsteps of man and the very hairs of his head are numbered
thus it becomes his invisible counterpart  it is therefore the book
of life or death and by it he judges himself or is already judged
when it is complete nothing can be added or taken from its personnel
it is sometimes partly opened to him in his dreams but in death
is clearly revealed
man has also a spiritual body subjective to and more ethereal
than the soul  it is an infinitesimal atom and is related
in substance to the spiritual or infinite mind of the universe
just as the great physical sun the center of visible light
life and heat is striving to purify the foul miasma of the marsh
and send its luminous messages of love into the dark crevices
of the earth so the great spiritual sun of which the former
is a visible prototype or reflection is striving to illuminate
with divine wisdom the personal soul and mind of man thus enabling
him to become cognizant of the spiritual or christ presence within
the heresy and herod of wanton flesh degenerate victim of
the sensuous filth and fermentation of selfindulgence is ever
striving to exile and suppress from the wilderness of sin
the warning cry of the nazarite voice by intriguing with the cunning
incestuous daughters of unholy thoughts and desires
the objective mind is most active when the body is awake
the subjective influences are most active and often fill
the mind with impressions while the physical body is asleep
the spiritual intelligence can only intrude itself when
the human will is suspended or passive to external states
a man who lives only on the sensual plane will receive his
knowledge through the senses and will not while in that state
receive spiritual impressions or warning dreams
men and women rarely ever degrade themselves so low that
the small voice of the desert does not bring them a message
sodom and gomorrah vile with the debauchery of a nameless crime
were not deserted by the angel of love until the fire
which they had lighted in their souls had consumed them
the walls of jericho did not fall until rahab the harlot
had been saved and the inmates had heard for several days
the ramshorn and the tramp of joshuas infantry
the evangelist jonah the sam jones of hebrew theology
exhorted the adulterous nineveh many times to repentance
before it fell
david while intoxicated with the wine of love from languishing
in the seductive embrace of the beautiful bathing nymph bathsheba
heard the voice of nathan  surely god is no respecter of persons
and will speak to all classes if the people will not stiffen their
necks or harden their hearts
women dream more often and more vividly than men because their dream
composition is less influenced and allied to external environments
all dreams possess an element of warning or prescience
some more than others  this is unknown to the many but is known
to the observing few  there are many people who have no natural
taste for music and who do not know one note from another
there are also those who cannot distinguish one color from another
to the former there is no harmony of sound and to the latter
there is no blending of colors
they are heard and seen but there is no artistic recognition of the same
still it would be absurd to say to either the musician or the artist
your art is false and is only an illusion of the senses
one man apparently never dreams another dreams occasionally
and still another more frequently none atttemptsic to interpret
their dream or to observe what follows therefore the verdict is
there is nothing in dreams  schopenhauer aptly says
no man can see over his own height intellect is invisible
to the man who has none the first is like the blind man who
denies the existence of light because he does not perceive it
the second and third resemble the colorblind man who sees
but who persists in calling green blue and vice versa
a fourth man sees in a dream a friend walking in his room
the vision is so vivid he instantly gets up and strikes a match
after making sure there is no intruder about the room he looks
at his watch and goes back to bed  the next day he receives
the unwelcome tidings that his friend died at the exact moment
of the vision
at another time he hears in his dream a familiar voice cry out in agony
soon he hears of a shocking accident or distressing illness befalling
the one whose voice he recognized in the dream2
2 for authentic records see flammarions unknown
the third man already referred to has about the same dream experiences
but calls them strange coincidences or unconscious cerebration etc
again the fourth man dreams of walking through green fields
of corn grass or wheat  he notes after such dreams prosperous
conditions follow for at least a few days  he also notes
if the area over which he passes is interspersed with rocks or other
adverse signs good and bad follow in the wake of the dream
if he succeeds in climbing a mountain and finds the top barren
he will accomplish his object but the deal will prove unprofitable
if it is green and springlike in appearance it will yield good results
if he sees muddy water sickness business depression or causes
for jealousy may develop
a nightmare suggests to the dreamer to be careful of health and diet
to relax his whole body to sleep with his arms down and keep plenty
of fresh air in the room
he sums up the foregoing with a thousand similar dream incidents
and is led to believe certain dreams possess an element of warning
there are three pure types of dreams namely subjective
physical and spiritual  they relate to the past
present and future and are influenced by past or subjective
physical and spiritual causes  the latter is always deeply prophetic
especially when it leaves a vivid impression on the conscious mind
the former too possesses an element of warning and prophecy
though the true meaning is hidden in symbols or allegory
they are due to contingent mental pictures of the past
falling upon the conscious mind of the dreamer
thus he is back at the old home and finds mother pale and aged
or ruddy and healthy and the lawn withered or green
it all augurs according to the aspect the picture assumes
ill or good fortune
physical dreams are more or less unimportant  they are usually
superinduced by the anxious waking mind and when this is so they
possess no prophetic significance
dreams induced by opiates fevers mesmerism and ill health come under
this class  a man who gambles is liable to dream of cards if he dreams
of them in deep sleep the warning is to be heeded but if it comes
as a reverie while he sleeps lightly he should regard it as worthless
such dreams reflect only the present condition of the body and mind
of the dreamer but as the past and present enter into shaping the future
the reflections thus left on the waking mind should not go by unheeded
we often observe matters of dress and exterior appearance through mirrors
and we soon make the necessary alterations to put our bodies in harmony
with existing formalities  then why not study more seriously the mental
images reflected from the mirror of the soul upon our minds through the occult
processes within us
thirdly the spiritual dreams are brought about by the higher self penetrating
the soul realm and reflecting upon the waking mind approaching events
when we put our animal mind and soul in harmony with our higher self we
become one with it and therefore one with the universal mind or will by
becoming a part of it  it is through the higher self we reach the infinite
it is through the lower self we fall into the whirlpool of matter
these dreams are a part of the universal mind until they
transpire in the life of man  after this they go to make a part
of the personal soul  whatever has not taken place in the mind
or life of man belongs exclusively to the impersonal mind
but as soon as a man lives or sees a thing that thing
instantly becomes a part of his soul hence the clairvoyant
or mind reader never perceives beyond the personal ego
as the future belongs exclusively to god or the universal mind
and has no material subjective existence therefore it cannot
be known except through the channels of the higher self
which is the truth or the word that is constantly striving
to manifest itself through the flesh
our psychical research people give us conclusive proof of mental
telepathy or telegraphy between finite minds  thus communications
or impressions are conveyed many miles from one mind to another
this phenomenon is easier when one or both of the subjects are
in a state of somnambulence or asleep
in thought transference or mind reading it is absolutely
necessary to have a positive and a negative subject
through the same law that mental impressions are telegraphed
from one finite mind to another a man may place himself in harmony
with the infinite mind and thus receive true and healthful
warnings of coming evil or good  homer aristotle and other
writers of the ancient classics thought this not improbable
the statesman the poet the philosopher of the bible were
unanimous in attaching prophetic significance to dreams
has the law of ethereal vibrations undergone any recent
changes to debar or molest the communion of the soul with its
spiritual father any more than it has debarred contact with its
material mother or environments
we only understand the great laws of nature by effects
we know that vegetation planted in native soil and properly attended
with light heat and moisture will grow and yield a certain
species of fruit  we may infer how it does this but we cannot
explain the process of transformation any more than we can explain
why certain tropical birds are burnished with glowing colors
and that other birds under the murky skies are gray and brown
while in the arctic regions they bleach
in sleep we see without being awakened the angry lightning rend
the midnight clouds and hear the explosive thunder hurl its fury at us
but can we explain it any more than our scientist can explain the natural
forces of thought of love and hate or the subtle intuition of woman
what of the silhouette or the anthelion of the scandinavian alps
and the aerial cities so often seen by explorers and travelers
do not they defy the law of optics  must we understand the intricacies
of articulation and the forces back of it before we can appropriate speech
must we discard all belief in an infinite mind because we cannot
understand it and therefore say we are not a part of it because there
is no infinite  should we discard the belief in the infinitude of number
because we cannot understand it and therefore say that finite number
is not a part of the infinite
no scientist or naturalist is so grossly stupid as to deny
the infinite expansion of numbers  if this be so it establishes
the infinite of number of which every finite number is a part
and thus we have a parallel in mathematics the very cornerstone
of the exact sciences for a finite and an infinite mind
it is from the prototype of this infinite of number namely
the infinite of intelligence that spiritual dreams proceed
they are therefore the reflection of truth upon the dream mind
and occur with less frequency than do dreams of the other two classes
there are also mixed dreams due to a multitude of incidents
arising from one or more sources which being reflected upon
the mind at the same instant produce an incoherent effect similar
to that which might be produced by running the same newspaper
through two or more presses all of different size type
again if you sit before a mirror where flashlights of faces and
other things are reflected simultaneously and instantly removed
you will fail to obtain a welldefined impression of what passed
before your mind
if you should pass on a train at the speed of two miles a minute
through a forest of flowers and trees your mind would be unable
to distinguish one flower or tree from another
it is in a similar way dream life and incidents may fall upon the mind
a woman may dream of receiving a letter and in the same connection see
muddy water or an arid landscape  closely following in waking life
she is astonished to receive a letter in about the same manner of her dream
but the muddy water and the arid landscape are missing
this is a mixed dream and is due to more than one cause
the first part is literal in its fulfilment and belongs to
the spiritual class the other part of the dream is subjective
and therefore allegorical in meaning  together with the letter
it was a forewarning of misfortune
these dreams are more difficult of interpretation than those
belonging to the spiritual type  in such dreams you may see water
letters houses money people and countless other things
the next day you may cross water or receive a letter the other
things you may not see but annoyance or pleasure will follow
again you may have a similar dream and not receive a letter or cross water
but the waking life will be filled with the other dream pictures and you will
experience disappointing or pleasant surprises as are indicated by the letter
or water sign
i have selected the allegorical type of dreams for the subject of this work
dreams that are common occurrences and are thought by the world
to be meaningless
i have endeavored through the occult forces in and about me
to find their esoteric or hidden import
dreams transpire on the subjective plane  they should therefore
be interpreted by subjective intelligence  this though burdened
with many business cares i have honestly endeavored to do
through the long hours of many nights i have waited patiently
and passively the automatic movement of my hand to write
the subjective definitions without receiving a word or a single
manifestation of intelligence and again the mysterious forces
would write as fast as my hand could move over the paper
i will leave it for my readers to draw their own conclusions
as to whether automatic writing is the work of extraneous spirits
through the brain and intelligence of the medium or the result
of autosuggestive influence upon the subjective personality
it is argued by the materialist with some degree of strength
that the healthy man does not dream this is perhaps true in a way
but the whole man comprises the past present and future  the past
and future always embrace more of the conditions that surround him than
the present  the present is only the acute stage while the chronic stage
considered from a personal view is the past and future combined
man cannot eliminate entirely these states from himself for while they
are past and future to the personal mind they are ever present
to the higher subjective senses he is therefore never in perfect
health unless these states are in harmony with the present
the personal self in a normal state cannot free itself from the past
or from the anxieties of the future
the reader should ever keep before his mind the fact that no man
ever had the same dream twice  he may have had very similar dreams
but some detail will be missing  nature seems to abhor duplicates
you could no more find two dreams alike than you could find facsimiles
in two blades of grass  a man cannot live two days exactly alike
different influences and passions will possess him  consequently no two
dreams can be had under exactly the same influences  stereotypes are
peculiarly the invention of man and not of god or nature
since it is impossible to find a man twice in exactly the same
mental state it is equally impossible for him to dream the same
dream twice therefore it is only possible to approximate
dream interpretation by classing them into families
this i have attempted to do in a more comprehensive way than
other writers who have preceded me
all men are acquainted with health and sickness love and hate
success and failure  sickness hate and failure belong to kindred families
and often ally their forces in such a way that it is hard to say whether
the dreamer will fail in love health or some business undertaking
but at all times a bad symbol is a warning of evil though that evil may
be minimized or exaggerated or vice versa according as signs are good
thus if the dream symbol indicates wealth or fortune to the peasant
his waking life may be gladdened by receiving or seeing a fiftycent piece
or finding assuring work while the same symbol to a wealthy man would
mean many dollars or a favorable turn in affairs
it is the same in physical life  a man may hear the sound of a wagon
he cannot determine by the rattle of the wheels whether it is laden
with laundry groceries or dry goods  he may judge as to its size
and whether it is bearing a heavy or a light burden  when it
objectifies he will be able to know its full import and not before
so with dream symbols  we may know they are fraught with evil or good
as in the case of pilates wife but we cannot tell their full meaning
until their reflections materialize before the objective sense
death is more frequently foretold by dream messages or visions
as explained in another part of this chapter
during sleep the will is suspended leaving the mind often a prey
to its own fancy  the slightest attack of an enemy may be foretold
by the unbridled imagination exaggerating the mental picture into
a monstrous shark or snake when indeed a much less portentous
sign was cast from the dream mold
a woman may see a serpent in waking life and through fright lose reason
or selfcontrol she imagines it pursues her when in reality it is going
an opposite direction in a like way dreams may be many times unreal
the mind loses its reason or will in sleep but a supersensitive
perception is awakened and as it regains consciousness from sleep
the sound of a knock on the wall may be magnified into a pistol shot
the sleeping mind is not only supersensitive as to existing external sounds
and light but it frequently sees hours and days ahead of the waking mind
nor is this contradictory to the laws of nature  the ant housed
in the depth of the earth away from atmospheric changes
knows of the approach of the harvest and comes forth to lay
by his store
in a like manner the pet squirrel is a better barometer of the local weather
than the weather bureau  with unerring foresight when a wintry frown nowhere
mars the horizon he is able to apprehend a cold wave twentyfour hours ahead
and build his house accordingly
so in sleep man dreams the future by intuitive perception of invisible
signs or influences while awake he reasons it out by cause and effect
the former seems to be the law of the spiritual world while the latter
would appear to be the law of the material world  man should not depend
alone upon either  together they proclaim the male and female principle
of existence and should find harmonious consummation
in this manner only can man hope to achieve that perfect normal
state to which the best thought of the human race is aspiring
where he can create and control influences instead of being
created and controlled by them as the majority of us are at
the present day
god the highest subjective source of intelligence may in a
dream leave impressions or presentiments on the mind of man
the highest objective source of intelligence
the physical sun sends its light into the dark corners of the earth
and god the spiritual sun imparts spiritual light into the passive
and receptive soul
man by hiding in a cave or closing the windows and doors of his house
may shut out all physical light so he may steep his soul in sensual
debauchery until all spiritual light is shut out
just as the vital essence of the soil the mother of nature
may be extracted by abuse either from omission or commission
until neither the light of the sun nor the moisture of the heavens
will wake the flush of life so may the spiritual essence
be deadened when the soil of the soul is filled with the aged
and multiplying weeds of ravishing materiality
the dream mind is often influenced by the waking mind
when the waking mind dwells upon any subject the dream mind
is more or less influenced by it and it often assists the waking
mind in solving difficult problems  the personal future
embodied in the active states of the universal mind
may affect the dream mind producing premonitions of death
accidents and misfortune
the objective mind rejoices or laments over the aspects of the past
and present while the spiritual mind striving with the personal future
either laments or rejoices over the prospective conditions
one is the barometer of the past while the other is the barometer
of the future
if we study carefully the spiritual impressions left upon the dream mind
through the interpretations of this book we will be able to shape our future
in accordance with spiritual law
thus our temporal events will contribute to our spiritual development
and in turn our spiritual knowledge will contribute to our temporal welfare
without this harmonious interaction of the two great forces in man
the divine plan of destiny cannot be reached
this can only be accomplished through the material mind
or reason dominating the animal emotions of the heart
in this way we would not covet our neighbors goods or grow
angry with our brother over trifles
the house vacated by the sefishsic appetites of the world would
be filled with the whispers of spiritual love and wisdom necessary
to the mutual welfare and development of body and soul
the theory used in this book to interpret dreams is both simple and rational
by the using of it you will be surprised to find so many of the predictions
fulfilled in your waking life  we deal with both the thought and the dream
the thought or sign implied in the object dreamed of and the influence
surrounding it are always considered in the interpretation
thoughts proceed from the visible mind and dreams from the invisible mind
the average waking mind receives and retains only a few of the lessons
of life  it is largely filled with idle and incoherent thoughts that
are soon forgotten  the same may be truly said of the dream mind
many of our day thoughts are day dreams just as many of our night dreams
are night thoughts  our day deeds of evil or good pierce or soothe
the conscience just as our night symbols of sorrow and joy sadden or please
the objective senses  our days thoughts are filled with the warnings
and presence of the inner mind and our nights thoughts are tinctured
and often controlled by our external mind
some writer has said  everything that exists upon earth has its
ethereal counterpart  christ said  as a man thinketh so is he
a hindu proverb says  man is a creature of reflection he becomes
that upon which he reflects  a modern metaphysicist says
our thoughts are real substance and leave their images upon
our personality they fill our aura with beauty or ugliness according
to our intents and purposes in life  each evil thought or action
has its pursuing phantom each smile or kindly deed its guiding angel
we leave wherever we ignobly stand a tomb and an epitaph to haunt
us through the furnace of conscience and memory
closely following in the wake of our multiplying evil thoughts are armies
of these ghastly spectres pursuing each other with the exact intents
and purposes of the mind that gave them being  if we consider well these
facts we will be forced into thinking our best thoughts at all times
thoughts are the subjective and creative force that produces action
action is the objective effect of thought hence the character of our daily
thoughts is making our failure or success of tomorrow
the impersonal mind deals with all time and things as ever present
the objective mind is constantly striving to penetrate
the spiritual realm while the spiritual mind is striving to
enter matter hence our actions have their subjective counterparts
and their subethereal counterparts  the universal mind
in harmony with the evolutionary plans and laws of the macrocosms
materializes through functions of the microcosm imparting to each
with its routine of failure and success its daily objectivity
the inner or passive dream mind may perceive the subjective types
or antitypes many days before they objectify through the microcosm
their meaning is often wrapt in symbols but sometimes
the actual as it occurs in objective life is conveyed
our own thought images which have passed before the objective mind
may be perceived by the clever mind reader but those antitypes
which are affecting our future but which have none other
but subjective existence are rarely ever perceived by any one
except by the power of the higher self or the spirit within
for this reason we are enjoined by the sages to study self
with the physical mind we only see physical objects
with the subjective mind we see only subjective objects
this was pauls doctrine and it is the belief of the best
psychic thought of this century  by means of our reason
an objective process for divining the futureaided by mathematical
and geographical data we may outline the storm centers and the path
of the rain days before they appear in certain localities
after eliminating all contingencies arising from clerical
error and counteracting influence the prognostication is sure
of fulfilment  for centuries ahead the astronomer foretells
the eclipse of the moon and the sun and the arrival of comets
he does not do this by crossing the borderland dividing the spiritual
from the physical world  in a like manner the subjective
forces operate upon their own planes and know very little
even of their own corporal realm just as our physical senses
know little if anything of the soul or spiritual habitation
they know that by gross living the sense of conscience may
be dulled or that by right living it may be strengthened
in like manner the subjective mind perceives by its own senses
certain invisible types of evil seeking external manifestations
in the microcosm  it knows that these forms of error will work
harm to the objective mind and that if persisted in they
will pervert all intercourse or interchange of counsel between
the two factions of the man  in this there is no spiritual
perception of physical objects any more than there is in mundane
life a sense perception of spiritual images and antitypes
the former only sees the forms that manifest on its plane
while the latter can note only those common to its sphere
each may recognize and feel the violence or good that these
manifestations will do to their respective counterparts
but we have no reason to believe that normal objective or
subjective states have visional powers beyond their own plane
the mind of man acting upon the mind of the macrocosm will produce
according as he thinks or acts antitypes of good or evil in
the imagination of the world which is reflected upon the spiritual
aura of the microcosm previous to taking on corporal form
while in this state they may be perceived by subjectivity
and thus the images seen are impressed on the dream mind
during sleep or on the passivity of the objective sense
evil or righteous acts recently committed will more acutely affect
the present waking mind than those enacted at a more remote period
in a similar way future disaster or success which is soon to occur
will impress the dream mind more vividly than those which are
to transpire at a later date  but in the lives of all men there
are past incidents which they will never forget and which
will never cease to fill their hearts with pride or remorse
so too in their distant future there are important events
to transpire which are struggling through tumultuous infinitude
to leave their ghastly or smiling impress upon the dream mind
if your mental states are passive you will receive the warnings
there are cases on record which show events have been forecast
years ahead of their occurrence
we do not claim that this book will prove an interpreter of all dreams
or that the keys disclosed will open to you all the mysteries of the future
or even all those surrounding your own personality but by studying
the definitions and the plane upon which they were written you will be able
through the power of your own spirit to interpret your own dreams
the combination of dream and dream influences are as infinite as the stars
or the combination of thought and number  they can only be classed
and considered as such  they cannot be analyzed in detail or as a whole
in mathematics we have nine digits from which an infinite variety
of combinations may be formed and solved by the deduction of the mind
through them we may measure time space quality and quantity
the symbol o and i exist by reason of no thing and some
thing or death and life  the figure one is subject to
illimitable expansion  it is without beginning in the infinite
of number as god is without beginning in the infinite of being
as with the vegetable kingdom the tiny seed or acorn silently
working its magical transformation into a plant or tree
and directing its destiny with marvelous intelligence
through the torrid and frigid vicissitudes of the seasons
so is man without beginning in the infinitude of his own
being or microcosm  man is both a type and antitype
a type of what preexisted in the imagination of the world and an
antitype of a future life yet to manifest itself on another plane
where the incidents of the one will be subjective as the events
occurring in infancy or in other planes are now subjective
his dreams thoughts and actions and the influences that
produce them and their multiplying combination cannot be
numbered or reproduced any more than you can number the leaves
of the forest or find two exactly similar units among them
thus the full meaning or interpretation of dreams cannot be fully
demonstrated through mental or even spiritual stereotypes
but by the intelligent use of this book you will be able to trace
out almost any dream combination and arrive at the true nature
of its portent
a wise doctor in preparing medicine for a patient
considers well his age temperament and his present condition
so should the interpreter of dreams ponder well the mental state
the health habits and temperament of the dreamer
these things no one can know so well as the dreamer himself
he therefore with the aid of this book will be able to interpret
his dreams by the light that is in him
man is the microcosm or a miniature world  he has a soul and
mental firmament bounded by the stellar dust and the milky way
and filled with the mystery of suns satellites and stars
these he can study best by the astronomy of induction and introspection
he has also a physical plane diversified by oceans
lakes rivers fertile valleys waste places and mountains
all are in cosmic interdependency as they are in the macrocosm
here rests the mystery of beingthe grandest of subjects
the student is no less bewildered and awed than the geologist
who gropes blindly through the seams of the earth searching
for links in the infinite chain of knowledge or the astronomer
sweeping the heavens of the macrocosm in quest of new phenomena
the two planes are dependent upon each other  it is the smile
or disease of the firmament that blesses or diseases the earth
it is likewise the impure firmament of the microcosm that diseases
the body and soul  if it reflects the drought of thought or the
various states of evil deserts will enlarge forest of infectious
venomous growth will form the habitation of lust and murder
before great moral or physical revolutions or catastrophes occur
clouds will darken the horizon of the dream mind storms will gather
lurid flames of lightning will flash their volatile anger
the explosive thunder will recklessly carry on its bombardment
bells will ring strange knocking will be heardsymbols of a message
phantom forms will be seen familiar voices will call and plead
with you unknown visitors will threaten you unearthly struggles
with hideous giants and agonies of mind and body will possess you
malformations of the most hideous type will seize your vision
shrouded in sheets of a whitish vapor evanescent specters
with pallid face and of warning countenance will cling around you
and contagion and famine will leave their desolate impress upon
the flower of health and in the field of plenty  thus all of us
would be nightly warned in our circle or miniature world if we
would develop subjective strength to retain the impressions left
upon our dream mind  but in spite of all reason and conscience
in spite of the inductive knowledge received through our senses
we go on from day to day and step by step feeding our soul
on the luscious fruit of the outward senses until the rank
weeds of sefishnesssic have choked out all other forces
thus the soul is filled with thought images that assume the form
of vicious animals homely visaged fowls rabid and snarling
cats and dogs leprous and virile serpents cankerous lizards
slimy intestine worms hairy and malicious insects
they are generated by greed envy jealousy covetousness backbiting
amorous longings and other impure thoughts  with the soul filled
with this conglomeration of virus and filth why doubt a hell and its
counterpart condition or expect the day or night to bring happiness
if evil thoughts will infest the soul with ravenous microbes
good thoughts and deeds will starve and suppress their activity
and create a heaven to supplant them  with this grand and eternal
truth in view man should ever think kindly of those about him
control his temper in word and action seek his own think the best
of thoughts study to relieve the worthy poor seek solace in the depth
of being and let gentleness and meekness characterize his life
then will he sow the seeds of a present and future heaven
his day thoughts and his night thoughts in harmony will point
with unerring forecast to a peaceful end  spiritual and helpful
warnings will fall upon the dream mind as gently as dew upon
the flowers and as softly as a mothers kiss upon the lips of love
when our external lives are guided by the forces within
sweet are the words and messages from our own spirit
for those who are truly blessed are those who seek divine love
through the channels of their inner world of consciousness
illust caption  a diagram giving the theory of this book
and the relationship between the microcosm and the macrocosm
fragmentary thoughts from dream realms
man is a little circle or world composed of the infinitesimal atoms thrown
off from the great circle or parent world and fitting into his place
in the zone of life  if in the revolutions of the great circle he catches
more material he increases his circle to objective or subjective growth
if he absorbs spiritual or mind atoms as they fall from the great body
of creative source he enlarges or contracts his own circle according
to the assimilation of the food he receives from the parent
it is optional with man to obtain spiritual or material manna
as it is disseminated throughout existence  to feed on material
diet alone contracts and distorts the circle of the man
but a full comprehension of the needs of the circle a proper
denial of supply to some of the compounds together with a tender
care of other parts will round out the whole into a perfect
physical and mental circle of life
dissentious and conflicting results should be avoided in computing
the length and breadth of the compounded circle of mans individual world
objective life is one of the smallest compounds in real life
dream life is fuller of meaning and teaching of the inner or god life
than is the exterior life of man  the mind receives education
from communing with the dream composition in the great circle
consult with your whole nature or circle before beginning a serious work
partial consultations or material advice only often brings defeat
of objects sought when a true home counsel would have brought success
and consequent happiness
man should live in his subjective realms and study more his
relation to other compositions or circles thus fructifying
and making beautiful his own world through intercourse with
others who have worked in the great storehouse of subjectivity
and who have climbed already from the basement into the light
of spiritual sunshine
   
a few questions and subjective answers regarding dreams
questionwhat is a dream
answera dream is an event transpiring in that world belonging to the mind
when the objective senses have withdrawn into rest or oblivion
then the spiritual man is living alone in the future or ahead
of objective life and consequently lives mans future first
developing conditions in a way that enables waking man to shape
his actions by warnings so as to make life a perfect existence
qwhat relationship is sustained between the average man and his dreams
aa dream to the average or sensual person bears the same relation to his
objective life that it maintained in the case of the ideal dreamer but it
means pleasures sufferings and advancements on a lower or material plane
qthen why is man not always able to correctly interpret his dreams
ajust as words fail sometimes to express ideas so dreams fail
sometimes in their mind pictures to portray coming events
qif they relate to the future why is it we so often dream
of the past
awhen a person dreams of past events those events are warnings of evil
or good sometimes they are stamped so indelibly upon the subjective mind
that the least tendency of the waking mind to the past throws these pictures
in relief on the dream consciousness
qwhy is it that present environments often influence our dreams
abecause the future of man is usually affected by the present
so if he mars the present by wilful wrongs or makes it bright
by right living it will necessarily have influence on his dreams
as they are forecastings of the future
qwhat is an apparition
ait is the subjective mind stored with the wisdom gained from futurity
and in its strenuous efforts to warn its present habitation
the corporal bodyof dangers just ahead takes on the shape of a dear
one as the most effective method of imparting this knowledge
qhow does subjectivity deal with time
athere is no past and future to subjectivity
it is all one living present
qif that is so why cant you tell us accurately of our future
as you do of our past
abecause events are like a procession they pass a few at a time
and cast a shadow on subjective minds and those which have passed
before the waking mind are felt by other minds also and necessarily
make a more lasting impression on the subjective mind
   
qto illustrate  a person on retiring or closing his eyes had a face
appear to him the forehead well formed but the lower parts distorted
explain this phenomenon
aa changed state from perfect sleep or waking possessed him
now the mans face was only the expression of his real
thoughts and the state of his business combined
his thoughts were strong and healthy but his business fagging
hence his own spirit is not a perfect likeness of his own soul
as it takes every atom of earthly composition perfectly normal
to reproduce a perfect spirit picture of the soul or mortal man
he would have seen a true likeness of himself had conditions
been favorable thus a man knows when a complete whole is
his portion  study to make surroundings always harmonious
life is only being perfectly carried on when these conditions
are in unison
how to develop the power to dream
keep the mind clear and as free from material rubbish as is
possible and go to sleep in a negative condition this will
of course have to be cultivated by the subject a person can
if he will completely relax his mind and body to the receptive
mood required for dreams to appear as realities or true
explanations of future events
   
to dream you are conversing with a dead relative and that
relative endeavors to extract a promise from you warns you
of coming distress unless you follow the advice given
disastrous consequences could be averted if minds could grasp
the inner workings and sight of the higher or spiritual self
the voice of relatives is only that higher self taking form to approach
more distinctly the mind that lives near the material plane
there is so little congeniality between common or material
natures that persons should depend more largely upon their own
subjectivity for true contentment and pleasure
   
dreams exaggerated
the will is suspended during sleep so the dream mind is more a prey
to excitability than the waking mind
thus when images appear upon the dream vision they are frequently distorted
into hideous malformations that fill it with fear and excitement
contrary dreams
the constant dwelling of the mind upon certain things distorts
their shapes upon subjectivity thus throwing dreams in exactly
opposite channels to the waking reality  yet the dreamer always
feels a sense of being awake in dreams like these and on awakening
experiences no recuperation of mind or body after such contrary dreams
sleep is not fully sustained while the dreamer is held by material
ideas in the subjective state
   
when dreams are less prescient
the cessation of the organs to perform healthful functions converts
a man into a different person and dreams while in this state would
have no prophetic meaning unless to warn the dreamer of this
disorganization of his physical system
dreams are symbols used by subjectivity to impress the objective
or material mind with a sense of coming good or evil  subjectivity is
the spiritual part of man  the soul is that circle of man lying
just outside the gross materiality and partaking largely of it
all thoughts and desires enter first the soul or material mind
and then cast themselves on the spirit  frequently the soul becomes
so filled with material or present ideas that the spiritual symbols
are crowded out and then it is that dreams seen to be contrary
material subjectivity that is all thoughts and ideas emanating
from material sources go to make up this circle then the mind
catches up the better thoughts of this section and weaves them
into a broader and more comprehensive power sustaining the owner
in his own judgment
and still another circle is formed of the finer compound of this
which is spiritual subjectivity or the highest element of intelligence
reached by man  this circle is the spiritual man and relates
in substance to the spiritual soul of the macrocosm or universe
it becomes strong or weak as we recognize or fail to recognize
it as a factor of being  the process of spiritual development
is similar to that of the vegetable and animal kingdoms
the trees on the outer rim of the forest are more capable of resisting
the wind than those more to the center by reason of their exposure
to storms the roots have penetrated with double strength far
into the earth and the branches are braced with toughened bark
and closely knitted ligaments
the same may be said of the animal kingdom  the mind is developed
by vigorous exercise just as are likewise the muscles of the body
the more these are cultivated by drawing from their parental affinities
in the macrocosm the more knowledge or power they take on
thus as a man simulates in thought and action an ape a tiger a goat
a snake or a lamb he takes on their characteristics and is swayed by
like influences to enmity meekness covetousness and avariciousness
to illustrate further  if he is cunning he draws on the fox of
the microcosm and becomes in action and thought like that animal
if selfishness survives the hog principle is aroused from its latent
cells in the microcosm and he is dominated by material appetites
in a similar way he may perceive the spiritual in himself
natures laws with all their numberless and intricate ramifications
are simple in their harmony of process and uniformity of purpose
when applied to the physical and ethical developments of man
possibilities for inner improvements or expansions rest with material man
if he entertains gross desires to the exclusion of spiritual germs
he will dwarf and degrade higher aspirations and thus deprive subjective
spirituality of her rightful possessions
   
nature in compounding the materials for the creation of the deaf man
inadvertently dropped the ingredient sound hence making an imperfect being
and sound being thus foreign to his nature he can only be approached
by signs even in dreams  subjectivity uses natures forces
while a normal person uses dreams to work on his waking consciousness
as it is impossible to use with effect a factor which a man does not
naturally possess a deaf man rarely ever dreams of sound or a blind
man of light
   
two dreams are never the same nor are two flowers ever alike
whatever symbol is used to impress the dreamer is the one
which is likely to warn him more definitely than any other
no two persons being ever in the same state at the same time
the same symbols would hardly convey identical impressions
neither will the same dream be as effective in all cases
of business or love with the same dreamer
a persons dream perception wavers much as it does in waking hours
you fail to find the same fragrance in the rose at all times
though the same influences seemingly surround you and thus it is
that different dreams must be used for different persons to convey
the same meaning
creation confident of her power to perfect her designs
does not resort to that monotony in her work which might result
were the perception of man or the petals and fragrance of flowers
cast from one stereotyped mold of intelligence beauty or sweetness
this variety of scheme runs through all creation
you think you have identical dreams but there is always
some variation even if it be something dreamed immediately over
nature is no sluggard and is forever changing her compounds
so that there is bound to be change in the details even of dreams
this change would not materially affect the approach of happiness
or sorrow in different people and hence the same dreams are
reliable for all
persons of the same or similar temperament will be more deeply
impressed by a certain dream than would people their opposite
and though the dream cannot be the same in detail yet it is
apparently the same just as two like flowers are called roses
though they are not identical
if a young woman twentyfive and a girl of fifteen should each have a dream
of marriage the same definition would apply to each just the same
as if they would each approach a flower and smell of it differently
different influences will possess them unconsciously though the outward
appearance be the same
a young woman of a certain age is warned in a dream of trouble
likely to befall her while another of similar age and
threatened trouble is warned also but in different symbols
which she fails to grasp and bring back to waking existence
and she thus believes she has had no warning dream
there are those in the world who lack subjective strength
material or spiritual and hence they fail to receive dreams
however symbolic because there is no power within them
to retain these impressions
there are many reasons for this loss utter material grossness want
of memory physical weakness uncoupled from extreme nervousness
and total lack of faith in any warning or revelation purporting
or coming from the dream consciousness
to dream at night and the following day have the thing dreamed of
actually take place or come before your notice is not allegorical
it is the higher or spiritual sense living or grasping the immediate
future ahead of the physical mind  the spiritual body is
always first to come into contact with the approaching future
it is present with it while still future to the physical body
there is no reason why man should not grasp coming events earlier
only he does not cultivate inner sight as he does his outer senses
the allegorical is used because man weakens his spiritual force
by catering to the material senses
he clings to the pleasures and woes of the material world
to the exclusion of spirituality

more distinctly the mind that lives near the material plane
there is so little congeniality between common or material natures
that persons should depend upon their own subjectivity for true
contentment and pleasure
52 paracelsus says on this subject  it may happen that the soul of
persons who have died perhaps fifty years ago may appear to us in a dream
and if it speaks to us we should pay special attention to what it says
for such a vision is not an illusion or delusion and it is possible
that a man is as much able to use his reason during the sleep of his body
as when the latter is awake and if in such a case such a soul appears
to him and he asks questions he will then hear that which is true
through these solicitous souls we may obtain a great deal of knowledge
to good or to evil things if we ask them to reveal them to us
many persons have had such prayers granted to them  some people that were
sick have been informed during their sleep what remedies they should use
and after using the remedies they became cured and such things have
happened not only to christians but also to jews persians and heathens
to good and to bad persons

or excarnate spirits but rather through the personal spirit glimpses
that is in manauthor

dreams relating to death or dying unless they are due
to spiritual causes are misleading and very confusing to
the novice in dream lore when he attempts to interpret them
a man who thinks intensely fills his aura with thought or
subjective images active with the passions that gave them birth
by thinking and acting on other lines he may supplant these
images with others possessed of a different form and nature
in his dreams he may see these images dying dead or
their burial and mistake them for friends or enemies
in this way he may while asleep see himself or a relative die
when in reality he has been warned that some good thought
or deed is to be supplanted by an evil one  to illustrate
if it is a dear friend or relative whom he sees in the agony
of death he is warned against immoral or other improper thought
and action but if it is an enemy or some repulsive object
dismantled in death he may overcome his evil ways and thus give
himself or friends cause for joy  often the end or beginning
of suspense or trials are foretold by dreams of this nature
they also frequently occur when the dreamer is controlled by imaginary
states of evil or good  a man in that state is not himself
but is what the dominating influences make him  he may be warned
of approaching conditions or his extrication from the same
in our dreams we are closer to our real self than in waking life
the hideous or pleasing incidents seen and heard about us in our
dreams are all of our own making they reflect the true state
of our soul and body and we cannot flee from them unless we drive
them out of our being by the use of good thoughts and deeds
by the power of the spirit within us
