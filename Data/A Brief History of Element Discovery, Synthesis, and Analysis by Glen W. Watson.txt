a brief history of element discovery synthesis and analysis
it is well known that the number of elements has grown from four in the
days of the greeks to 103 at present but the change in methods needed
for their discovery is not so well known up until 1939 only 88
naturally occurring elements had been discovered it took a dramatic
modern technique based on ernest o lawrences nobelprizewinning atom
smasher the cyclotron to synthesize the most recently discovered
elements most of these recent discoveries are directly attributed to
scientists working under the atomic energy commission at the university
of californias radiation laboratory at berkeley
but it is apparent that our present knowledge of the elements stretches
back into history back to englands ernest rutherford who in 1919
proved that occasionally when an alpha particle from radium strikes a
nitrogen atom either a proton or a hydrogen nucleus is ejected to the
dane niels bohr and his 1913 idea of electron orbits to a once unknown
swiss patent clerk albert einstein and his now famous theories to
polands marie curie who in 1898 with her french husband pierre
laboriously isolated polonium and radium back to the french scientist
h a becquerel who first discovered something he called a spontaneous
emission of penetrating rays from certain salts of uranium to the
german physicist w k roentgen and his discovery of x rays in 1895 and
back still further
during this passage of scientific history the very idea of element
has undergone several great changes
the early greeks suggested earth air fire and water as being the
essential material from which all others were made aristotle considered
these as being combinations of four properties hot cold dry and
moist see fig 1
illustration fig 1 the elements as proposed by the early greeks
later a fifth essence ether the building material of the heavenly
bodies was added
paracelsus 14931541 introduced the three alchemical symbols salt
sulfur and mercury sulfur was the principle of combustability salt
the fixed part left after burning calcination and mercury the
essential part of all metals for example gold and silver were
supposedly different combinations of sulfur and mercury
robert boyle in his sceptical chymist 1661 first defined the word
element in the sense which it retained until the discovery of
radioactivity 1896 namely a form of matter that could not be split
into simpler forms
the first discovery of a true element in historical time was that of
phosphorus by dr brand of hamburg in 1669 brand kept his process
secret but as in modern times knowledge of the elements existence
was sufficient to let others like kunkel and boyle in england succeed
independently in isolating it shortly afterward
as in our atomic age a delicate balance was made between the
lightgiving desirable and heatgiving feared powers of a
discovery an early experimenter was at first delighted with the white
waxy substance that glowed so charmingly in the dark of his laboratory
but later wrote i am not making it any more for much harm may come of
it
robert boyle wrote in 1680 of phosphorus it shone so briskly and lookt
so oddly that the sight was extreamly pleasing having in it a mixture
of strangeness beauty and frightfulness
these words describe almost exactly the impressions of eye witnesses of
the first atom bomb test at alamagordo new mexico july 16 1945
for the next two and threequarters centuries the chemists had much fun
and some fame discovering new elements frequently there was a long
interval between discovery and recognition thus scheele made chlorine
in 1774 by the action of black manganese manganese dioxide on
concentrated muriatic acid hydrochloric acid but it was not
recognized as an element till the work of davy in 1810
occasionally the development of a new technique would lead to the easy
discovery of a whole group of new elements thus davy starting in 1807
applied the method of electrolysis using a development of voltas pile
as a source of current in a short time he discovered aluminum barium
boron calcium magnesium potassium sodium and strontium
the invention of the spectroscope by bunsen and kirchhoff in 1859
provided a new tool which could establish the purity of substances
already known and lead to the discovery of others thus helium was
discovered in the suns spectrum by jansen and isolated from uranite by
ramsay in 1895
the discovery of radioactivity by becquerel in 1896 touched off by
roentgens discovery of x rays the year before gave an even more
sensitive method of detecting the presence or absence of certain kinds
of matter it is well known that pierre and marie curie used this
newfound radioactivity to identify the new elements polonium and
radium compounds of these new elements were obtained by patient
fractional recrystallization of their salts
the explanation of radioactivity led to the discovery of isotopes by
rutherford and soddy in 1914 and with this discovery a revision of our
idea of elements became necessary since boyle it had been assumed that
all atoms of the individual elements were identical and unlike any
others and could not be changed into anything simpler now it became
evident that the atoms of radioactive elements were constantly changing
into other elements thereby releasing very large amounts of energy and
that many different forms of the same element lead was the first
studied were possible we now think of an element as a form of matter
in which all atoms have the same nuclear charge
the human mind has always sought order and simplification of the
external world in chemistry the fruitful classifications were
dobereiners triads 1829 newlands law of octaves 1865 and
mendeleevs periodic law 1869 the chart expressing this periodic law
seemed to indicate the maximum extent of the elements and gave good
hints where to look for and the probable properties of the remaining
ones see fig 2
by 1925 all but four of the slots in the 92place file had been filled
the vacancies were at 43 61 85 and 87
illustration fig 2 periodic chart of the elements 1963
workers using traditional analytical techniques continued to search for
these elements but their efforts were foredoomed to failure none of
the nuclei of the isotopes of elements 43 61 85 and 87 are stable
hence weighable quantities of them do not exist in nature and new
techniques had to be developed before we could really say we had
discovered them
in 1919 rutherford accomplished scientifically what medieval alchemists
had failed to do with magic experiments and other less sophisticated
techniques it wasnt gold the goal of the alchemists he found but
something more valuable with even greater potential for good and evil a
method of transmuting one element into another by bombarding nitrogen
nuclei with alpha particles from radium he found that nitrogen was
changed into oxygen
the process for radioactive transmutation is somewhat like a common
chemical reaction an alpha particle which has the same charge 2 and
atomic mass 4 as a helium nucleus penetrates the repulsive forces of
the nitrogen nucleus and deposits one proton and one neutron this
changes the nitrogen atom into an oxygen atom the reaction is written
    7n14  2he4  1h1  8o17
the number at the lower left of each element symbol in the above
reaction is the proton number this number determines the basic chemical
identity of an atom and it is this number scientists must change before
one element can be transformed into another the common way to
accomplish this artificially is by bombarding nuclei with nuclear
projectiles
rutherford used naturally occurring alpha particles from radium as his
projectiles because they were the most effective he could then find but
these natural alpha particles have several drawbacks they are
positively charged like the nucleus itself and are therefore more or
less repulsed depending on the proton number of the element being
bombarded they do not move fast enough to penetrate the nuclei of
heavier elements those with many protons and for various other
reasons some of them unexplained are inefficient in breaking up the
nucleus it is estimated that only 1 out of 300000 of these alpha
particles will react with nitrogen
physicists immediately began the search for artificial means to
accelerate a wider variety of nuclear particles to high energies
protons because they have a 1 charge rather than the 2 charge of the
alpha particles are repulsed less strongly by the positive charge on
the nucleus and are therefore more useful as bombarding projectiles in
1929 e t s walton and j d cockcroft passed an electric discharge
through hydrogen gas thereby removing electrons from the hydrogen atom
this left a beam of protons i e hydrogen ions which was then
accelerated by high voltages this cockcroftwalton voltage multiplier
accelerated the protons to fairly high energies about 800000 electron
volts but the protons still had a plus charge and their energies were
still not high enough to overcome the repulsive forces coulombic
repulsion of the heavier nuclei
a later development the van de graaff electrostatic generator produced
a beam of hydrogen ions and other positively charged ions and electrons
at even higher energies an early model of the linear accelerator also
gave a beam of heavy positive ions at high energies these were the next
two instruments devised in the search for efficient bombarding
projectiles however the impasse continued neither instrument allowed
scientists to crack the nuclei of the heavier elements
ernest o lawrences cyclotron built in 1931 was the first device
capable of accelerating positive ions to the very high energies needed
its basic principle of operation is not difficult to understand a
charged particle accelerated in a cyclotron is analogous to a ball being
whirled on a string fastened to the top of a pole a negative electric
field attracts the positively charged particle ball towards it and
then switches off until the particle swings halfway around the field
then becomes negative in front of the particle again and again attracts
it as the particle moves faster and faster it spirals outward in an
ever increasing circle something like a tether ball unwinding from a
pole the energies achieved would have seemed fantastic to earlier
scientists the bevatron a modern offspring of the first cyclotron
accelerates protons to 9913 the speed of light thereby giving them
62 billion electron volts bev
another instrument the heavyion linear accelerator hilac
accelerates ions as heavy as neon to about 15 the speed of light it is
called a linear accelerator because it accelerates particles in a
straight line stanford university is currently 1963 in the process of
building a linear accelerator approximately two miles long which will
accelerate charged particles to 999 the speed of light
but highly accelerated charged particles did not solve all of sciences
questions about the inner workings of the nucleus
in 1932 during the early search for more efficient ways to bombard
nuclei james chadwick discovered the neutron this particle which is
neutral in charge and is approximately the same mass as a proton has
the remarkable quality of efficiently producing nuclear reactions even
at very low energies no one exactly knowns why at low energies
protons alpha particles or other charged particles do not interact
with nuclei because they cannot penetrate the electrostatic energy
barriers for example slow positive particles pick up electrons become
neutral and lose their ability to cause nuclear transformations slow
neutrons on the other hand can enter nearly all atomic nuclei and
induce fission of certain of the heavier ones it is in fact these
properties of the neutron which have made possible the utilization of
atomic energy
with these tools researchers were not long in accurately identifying
the missing elements 43 61 85 and 87 and moreindeed the list of
new elements isotopes and particles now seems endless
element 43 was made for the first time as a result of bombarding
molybdenum with deuterons in the berkeley cyclotron the chemical work
of identifying the element was done by emilio segr and others then
working at palermo sicily and they chose to call it technetium
because it was the element first made by artificial technical methods
element 61 was made for the first time from the fission disintegration
products of uranium in the clinton oak ridge reactor marinsky and
glendenin who did the chemical work of identification chose to call it
promethium because they wished to point out that just as prometheus
stole fire a great force for good or evil from the hidden storehouse
of the gods and presented it to man so their newly assembled reactor
delivered to mankind an even greater force nuclear energy
element 85 is called astatine from the greek astatos meaning
unstable because astatine is unstable of course all other elements
having a nuclear charge number greater than 84 are unstable too
astatine was first made at berkeley by bombarding bismuth with alpha
particles which produced astatine and released two neutrons the
element has since been found in nature as a small constituent of the
natural decay of actinium
the last of the original 92 elements to be discovered was element 87
francium it was identified in 1939 by french scientist marguerite
perey
children have a game in which they pile blocks up to see how high they
can go before they topple over in medieval times petty rulers in their
italian states vied with one another to see who could build the tallest
tower some beautiful results of this game still remain in florence
siena and other italian hill cities currently americans vie in a
similar way with the wheelbase and overall length of their cars after
1934 the game among scientists took the form of seeing who could extend
the length of the periodic system of the elements as with medieval
towers it was italy that again began with the most enthusiasm and
activity under the leadership of enrico fermi
merely adding neutrons would not be enough that would make only a
heavier isotope of the already known heaviest elements uranium
however if the incoming neutron caused some rearrangement within the
nucleus and if it were accompanied by expulsion of electrons that
would make a new element trials by fermi and his coworkers with
various elements led to unmistakeable evidence of the expulsion of
electrons beta activity with at least four different rates of decay
halflives claims were advanced for the creation of elements 93 and
94 and possibly further the transuranium elements table i much
difficulty was experienced however in proving that the activity really
was due to the formation of elements 93 and 94 as more people became
interested and extended the scope of the experiments the picture became
more confused rather than clarified careful studies soon showed that
the activities did not decay logarithmicallywhich means that they
were caused by mixtures not individual pure substancesand the
original four activities reported by fermi grew to at least nine
as a matter of fact the way out of the difficulty had been indicated
soon after fermis original announcement dr ida noddack pointed out
that no one had searched among the products of fermis experiment for
elements lighter than lead but no one paid any attention to her
suggestion at the time the matter was finally cleared up by dr otto
hahn and f strassmann they were able to show that instead of uranium
having small pieces like helium nuclei fast electrons and superhard
xrays knocked off as expected the atom had split into two roughly
equal pieces together with some excess neutrons this process is called
nuclear fission the two large pieces were unstable and decayed further
with the loss of electrons hence the beta activity this process is
so complicated that there are not as originally reported only four
halflives but at least 200 different varieties of at least 35
different elements the discovery of fission attended by the release of
enormous amounts of energy led to feverish activity on the part of
physicists and chemists everywhere in the world in june 1940 mcmillan
and abelson presented definite proof that element 93 had been found in
uranium penetrated by neutrons during deuteron bombardment in the
cyclotron at the university of california radiation laboratory
the california scientists called the newly discovered element neptunium
because it lies beyond the element uranium just as the planet neptune
lies beyond uranus the particular isotope formed in those first
experiments was 93np239 this is read neptunium having a nuclear charge
of 93 and an atomic mass number of 239 it has a halflife of 23 days
during which it gives up another electron beta particle and becomes
element 94 or plutonium so called after pluto the next planet beyond
neptune this particular form of plutonium 94pu239 has such a long
halflife 24000 years that it could not be detected the first
isotope of element 94 to be discovered was pu238 made by direct deuteron
bombardment in the berkeley 60inch cyclotron by radiation laboratory
scientists seaborg mcmillan kennedy and wahl it had an alphadecay
halflife of 864 years which gave it sufficient radioactivity so that
its chemistry could be studied
having found these chemical properties in pu238 experimenters knew
94pu239 would behave similarly it was soon shown that the nucleus of
94pu239 would undergo fission in the same way as 92u235 when
bombarded with slow neutrons and that it could be produced in the newly
assembled atomic pile researchers wished to learn as much as possible
about its chemistry therefore during the summer of 1942 two large
cyclotrons at st louis and berkeley bombarded hundreds of pounds of
uranium almost continuously this resulted in the formation of 200
micrograms of plutonium from this small amount enough of the chemical
properties of the element were learned to permit correct design of the
huge plutoniumrecovery plant at hanford washington in the course of
these investigations balances that would weigh up to 105 mg with a
sensitivity of 002 microgram were developed the test tubes and
beakers used had internal diameters of 01 to 1 mm and could measure
volumes of 110 to 110000 ml with an accuracy of 1 the fact that
there was no intermediate stage of experimentation but a direct
scaleup at hanford of ten billion times required truly heroic skill
and courage
by 1944 sufficient plutonium was available from uranium piles reactors
so that it was available as target material for cyclotrons at berkeley
it was bombarded with 32mev doubly charged helium ions and the
following reactions took place
    94pu239 alpha n 96cm242 alpha  150 days  94pu238
this is to be read plutonium having an atomic number of 94 94
positively charged protons in the nucleus and a mass number of 239 the
whole atom weighs approximately 239 times as much as a proton when
bombarded with alpha particles positively charged helium nuclei reacts
to give off a neutron and a new element curium that has atomic number
96 and mass number 242 this gives off alpha particles at such a rate
that half of it has decomposed in 150 days leaving plutonium with
atomic number 94 and mass number 238 the radiochemical work leading to
the isolation and identification of the atoms of element 96 was done at
the metallurgical laboratory of the university of chicago
the intense neutron flux available in modern reactors led to a new
element americium am as follows
    94pu239 n gamma 94pu240 n gamma 94pu241 beta
             95am241
the notation n gamma means that the plutonium absorbs a neutron and
gives off some energy in the form of gamma rays very hard x rays it
first forms 94pu240 and then 94pu241 which is unstable and gives
off fast electrons beta leaving 95am241
berkelium and californium elements 97 and 98 were produced at the
university of california by methods analogous to that used for curium
as shown in the following equations
    95am240  alpha  97bk243  0n1
and 96cm241  alpha  98cf244  0n1
the next two elements einsteinium 99es and fermium 100fm were
originally found in the debris from the thermonuclear device mike
which was detonated on eniwetok atoll november 1952 this method of
creating new substances is somewhat more extravagant than the mythical
chinese method of burning down a building to get a roast pig
these elements have since been made in nuclear reactors and by
bombardment this time the bullet was n14 stripped of electrons till it
had a charge of 6 and the target was plutonium
researchers at the university of california used new techniques in
forming and identifying element 101 mendelevium a very thin layer of
99es253 was electroplated onto a thin gold foil and was then bombarded
from behind the layer with 41mev alpha particles unchanged 99es253
stayed on the gold but those atoms hit by alpha particles were
knocked off and deposited on a catcher gold foil which was then
dissolved and analyzed fig 3 this freed the new element from most of
the very reactive parent substances so that analysis was easier even
so the radioactivity was so weak that the new element was identified
one atom at a time this is possible because its daughter element
fermium spontaneously fissions and releases energy in greater bursts
than any possible contaminant
illustration fig 3 the production of mendelevium
in 1957 in stockholm element 102 was reported found by an
international team of scientists who called it nobelium but diligent
and extensive research failed to duplicate the stockholm findings
however a still newer technique developed at berkeley showed the
footprintsif not the living presenceof 102 see fig 4 the rare
isotope curium246 is coated on a small piece of nickel foil enclosed
in a heliumfilled container and placed in the heavyion linear
accelerator hilac beam positively charged atoms of element 102 are
knocked off the foil by the beam which is of carbon12 or carbon13
nuclei and are deposited on a negatively charged conveyor apron but
element 102 doesnt live long enough to be actually measured as it
decays its daughter product 100fm250 is attracted onto a charged
aluminum foil where it can be analyzed the researchers have decided
that the hen really did come first they have the egg therefore the hen
must have existed by measuring the time distance between target and
daughter product they figure that the henmother element 102 must
have a halflife of three seconds
illustration fig 4 the experimental arrangement used in the
discovery of element 102
in an experiment completed in 1961 researchers at the university of
california at berkeley unearthed similar footprints belonging to
element 103 named lawrencium in honor of nobel prizewinner ernest o
lawrence they found that the bombardment of californium with boron
ions released alpha particles which had an energy of 86 mev and
decayed with a halflife of 8  2 seconds these particles can only be
produced by element 103 which according to one scientific theory is a
type of dinosaur of matter that died out a few weeks after creation of
the universe
the halflife of lawrencium lw is about 8 seconds and its mass number
is thought to be 257 although further research is required to establish
this conclusively
research on lawrencium is complicated its total alpha activity
amounts to barely a few counts per hour and since scientists had the
alphaparticle footprints only and not the beast itself the
complications increased therefore no direct chemical techniques could
be used and element 103 was the first to be discovered solely by
nuclear methodsa
for many years the periodic system was considered closed at 92 it has
now been extended by at least eleven places table i and one of the
extensions plutonium has been made in truckload lots its production
and use affect the life of everyone in the united states and most of the
world
surely the end is again in sight at least for ordinary matter although
persistent scientists may shift their search to the otherworld anti
particles these too will call for very special techniques for
detection of their fleeting presence
early enthusiastic researchers complained that a mans life was not long
enough to let him do all the work he would like on an element the
situation has now reached a state of equilibrium neither man nor
element lives long enough to permit all the desired work
a in august 1964 russian scientists claimed that they created element
104 with a halflife of about 03 seconds by bombarding plutomium with
accelerated neon22 ions
