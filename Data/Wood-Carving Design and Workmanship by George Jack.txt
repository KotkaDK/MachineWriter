editors preface
in issuing these volumes of a series of handbooks on the artistic
crafts it will be well to state what are our general aims
in the first place we wish to provide trustworthy textbooks of
workshop practise from the points of view of experts who have
critically examined the methods current in the shops and putting aside
vain survivals are prepared to say what is good workmanship and to set
up a standard of quality in the crafts which are more especially
associated with design secondly in doing this we hope to treat design
itself as an essential part of good workmanship during the last century
most of the arts save painting and sculpture of an academic kind were
little considered and there was a tendency to look on design as a
mere matter of appearance such ornamentation as there was was
usually obtained by following in a mechanical way a drawing provided by
an artist who often knew little of the technical processes involved in
production with the critical attention given to the crafts by ruskin
and morris it came to be seen that it was impossible to detach design
from craft in this way and that in the widest sense true design is an
inseparable element of good quality involving as it does the selection
of good and suitable material contrivance for special purpose expert
workmanship proper finish and so on far more than mere ornament and
indeed that ornamentation itself was rather an exuberance of fine
workmanship than a matter of merely abstract lines workmanship when
separated by too wide a gulf from fresh thoughtthat is from
designinevitably decays and on the other hand ornamentation
divorced from workmanship is necessarily unreal and quickly falls into
affectation proper ornamentation may be defined as a language
addressed to the eye it is pleasant thought expressed in the speech of
the tool
in the third place we would have this series put artistic craftsmanship
before people as furnishing reasonable occupations for those who would
gain a livelihood although within the bounds of academic art the
competition of its kind is so acute that only a very few per cent can
fairly hope to succeed as painters and sculptors yet as artistic
craftsmen there is every probability that nearly every one who would
pass through a sufficient period of apprenticeship to workmanship and
design would reach a measure of success
in the blending of handwork and thought in such arts as we propose to
deal with happy careers may be found as far removed from the dreary
routine of hack labor as from the terrible uncertainty of academic art
it is desirable in every way that men of good education should be
brought back into the productive crafts there are more than enough of
us in the city and it is probable that more consideration will be
given in this century than in the last to design and workmanship
                                   
this third volume of our series treats of one branch of the great art of
sculpture one which in the past has been in close association with
architecture it is well therefore that besides dealing thoroughly
as it does with the craftsmanship of woodcarving it should also be
concerned with the theory of design and with the subjectmatter which
the artist should select to carve
such considerations should be helpful to all who are interested in the
ornamental arts indeed the present book contains some of the best
suggestions as to architectural ornamentation under modern circumstances
known to me architects can not forever go on plastering buildings over
with trade copies of ancient artistic thinking and they and the public
must some day realize that it is not mere shapes but only thoughts
which will make reasonable the enormous labor spent on the decoration of
buildings mere structure will always justify itself and architects who
can not obtain living ornamentation will do well to fall back on
structure well fitted for its purpose and as finely finished as may be
without carvings and other adornments it would be better still if
architects would make the demand for a more intellectual code of
ornament than we have been accustomed to for so long
on the side of the carver either in wood or in stone we want men who
will give us their own thought in their own workas artists that
isand will not be content to be mere hacks supplying imitations of all
styles to order
on the teaching of woodcarving i should like to say a word as i have
watched the course of instruction in many schools it is desirable that
classes should be provided with casts and photographs of good examples
such as mr jack speaks of varying from rough choppings up to minute
and exquisite work but all having the breath of life about them there
should also be a good supply of illustrations and photographs of birds
and beasts and flowers and above all some branches and buds of real
leafage then i would set the student of design in woodcarving to make
variations of such examples according to his own skill and liking if
he and the teacher could be got to clear their minds of ideas of
style and to take some example simply because they liked it and to
adapt it just because it amused them the mystery of design would be
nearly solved most design will always be the making of one thing like
another with a difference later motives from nature should be brought
in but always with some guidance as to treatment from an example known
to be fine i would say for instance do a panel like this only let
it be oak foliage instead of vine and get a thrush or a parrot out of
the bird book
in regard to the application of carving i have been oppressed by the
accumulation in carving classes of little carved squares and oblongs
having no relation to anything that in an ordinary way is carved to
carve the humblest real thing were it but a real toy for a child would
be better than the production of these panels or of the artificial
trivialities which our minds instinctively associate with bazaars

authors preface
to the reader
be you prentice or student or what is still better both in one i
introduce the following pages to you with this explanation that all
theoretical opinions set forth therein are the outcome of many years of
patient sifting and balancing of delicate questions and these have with
myself long since passed out of the category of mere opinions into
that of settled convictions with regard to the practical matter of
technique it lies very much with yourself to determine the degree of
perfection to which you may attain this depends greatly upon the amount
of application which you may be willing or able to devote to its
practise
rememberthe laws which govern all good art must be known before they
can be obeyed they are subtle but unalterable the conditions most
favorable to your craft must first be understood before these laws can
be recognized there yet remains at your own disposal that devotion of
energy which is the first essential step both in the direction of
obtaining clearer views and in conquering technical difficulties
i have to thank the following gentlemen for their assistance in
providing photographs for some of the illustrations messrs bedford

preamble
     student and apprentice their aims and conditions of
     worknecessity for some equality between
     theory and practisethe students opportunity
     lies on the side of design
the study of some form of handicraft has of late years become an
important element in the training of an art student it is with the
object of assisting such with practical directions as well as
suggesting to more practised carvers considerations of design and
treatment that the present volume has been written the art of
woodcarving however lends itself to literary demonstration only in a
very limited way more especially in the condensed form of a textbook
which must be looked upon merely as a temporary guide of use only until
such time as practise and study shall have strengthened the judgment of
the student and enabled him to assimilate the many and involved
principles which underlie the development of his craft
if the beginner has mastered to some extent the initial difficulties of
the draftsman and has a fair general knowledge of the laws of design
but no acquaintance with their application to the art of woodcarving
then the two factors which will most immediately affect his progress
apart from natural aptitude are his opportunities for practise and
his knowledge of past and present conditions of work no one can become
a good carver without considerable practiseconstant if the best
results are to be looked for just as truly without some knowledge of
past and existing conditions of practise none may hope to escape the
danger of becoming on the one hand dull imitators of the superficial
qualities of old work or on the other followers of the first
willothewisp novelty which presents itself to their fancy
if use of the tools and knowledge of materials were the only subjects of
which a carver need become master there would be no way equal to the
oldfashioned one of apprenticeship to some good craftsman daily
practise with the tools insures a manual dexterity with which no amateur
need hope to compete many traditional expedients are handed down in
this way that can be acquired in no other there is however another
side of the question to be considered of quite as much importance as
the practical one of handicraft skill the art of woodcarving has also
to fulfil its intellectual function as an interpreter of the dreams and
fancies of imagination in this respect there is little encouragement to
be looked for in the dull routine of a modern workshop
there are therefore two widely separated standpoints from which the
art may be viewed it may be looked at from the position of a regular
craftsman who regards it primarily as his means of livelihood or it
may be dealt with as a subject of intellectual interest based upon its
relation to the laws of art in general as in the first instance the
use of the tools can not be learned without some accompanying
knowledge of the laws of art however slight that acquaintance may be
the method of apprenticeship has the advantage of being the more
practical of the two but it must be accepted with all the conditions
imposed upon it by the pressure of commercial interest and its usages
conditions which it may easily be imagined are far more favorable to
the performance of dull taskwork than to the adventurous spirit of
curiosity which should prompt the enterprise of an energetic student
on the other hand although an independent study of the art offers a
wider range of interest the student is for that very reason exposed
to the risk of involving himself in a labyrinth of confusing and
ineffectual theories the fact is that neither method can at the
present time be exclusively depended upon as a means of development
neither can be pronounced complete in itself nor independent of the
other the only sure safeguard against the vagueness of theory is
constant practise with the tools while to the craftsman in the full
enjoyment of every means for exercising and increasing his technical
skill a general study and intelligent conception of the wide
possibilities of his art is just as essential if it were only as an
antidote to the influence of an otherwise mechanical employment the
more closely these contradictory views are made to approximate the
more certain will become the carvers aims and the clearer will be his
understanding of the difficulties which surround his path enabling him
to choose that which is practicable and intrinsically valuable both as
regards the theory and practise of his art
if the student through lack of opportunities for practise is debarred
from all chance of acquiring that expertness which accompanies great
technical skill he may at least find encouragement in the fact that he
can never exhaust the interest afforded by his art in its infinite
suggestion to the imagination and fancy and also that by the exercise
of diligence and a determination to succeed he may reasonably hope to
gain such a degree of proficiency with the tools as will enable him to
execute with his hands every idea which has a definite existence in his
mind generally speaking it will be found that his manual powers are
always a little in advance of his perceptions
thus the student may gradually work out for himself a natural and
reliable manner of expressing his thoughts and in a way too that is
likely to compensate for his technical shortcomings by exciting a more
lively interest in the resources of the art itself the measure of his
success will be determined partly by his innate capacity for the work
and partly by the amount of time which he is enabled to give to its
practise the resources of his art offer an infinite scope for the
exercise of his powers of design and as this is the side which lies
nearest to his opportunities it should be the one which receives his
most earnest attention not merely as experiments on paper but as
exercises carried out to the best of his ability with the tools such
technical difficulties as he may encounter in the process will gradually
disappear with practise there is also encouragement in the thought that
woodcarving is an art which makes no immediate calls upon that
mysterious combination of extraordinary gifts labeled genius but is
rather one which demands tribute from the bright and happy inspirations
of a normally healthy mind there is in this direction quite a lifes
work for any enthusiast who aims at finding the bearings of his own
small but precious gift and in making it intelligible to others while
at the same time keeping himself free from the many confusions and
affectations which surround him in the endeavor
chapter ii
tools
     average number of tools required by carversselection for
     beginnersdescription of toolsposition when in useacquisition
     by degrees
we will suppose that the student is anxious to make a practical
commencement to his studies the first consideration will be to procure
a set of tools and we propose in this place to describe those which
will answer the purposes of a beginner as well as to look generally at
others in common use among craftsmen
the tools used by carvers consist for the most part of chisels and
gouges of different shapes and sizes the number of tools required by
professional carvers for one piece of work varies in proportion to the
elaborateness of the carving to be done they may use from half a dozen
on simple work up to twenty or thirty for the more intricate carvings
this number being a selection out of a larger stock reaching perhaps as
many as a hundred or more many of these tools vary only in size and
sweep of cutting edge thus chisels and gouges are to be had ranging
from 116th of an inch to 1 inch wide with curves or sweeps in each
size graduated between a semicircle to a curve almost flat few carvers
however possess such a complete stock of tools as would be represented
by one of each size and shape manufactured such a thing is not
required an average number of say seventy tools will always give a
sufficient variety of size and sweep for general purposes few pieces of
work will require the use of more than half of these in its execution
the beginner however need not possess more than from twelve to
twentyfour and may even make a start with fewer it is a good plan to
learn the uses of a few tools before acquiring a complete set as by
this means when difficulties are felt in the execution of work a tool
of known description is sought for and purchased with a foreknowledge of
its advantages this is the surest way to gain a distinct knowledge of
the varieties of each kind of tool and their application to the
different purposes of design
the following list of tools see figs 1 and 2 will be found sufficient
for all the occasions of study beginning by the purchase of the first
section nos 1 to 17 and adding others one by one until a set is made
up of twentyfour tools the tools should be selected as near the sizes
and shapes shown in the illustration as possible the curved and
straight strokes represent the shape of the actual cuts made by pressing
the tools down perpendicularly into a piece of wood this in the case
of gouges is generally called the sweep
nos 1 2 3 are gouges of sweeps varying from one almost flat no 1
to a distinct hollow in no 3 these tools are made in two forms
straightsided and spadeshaped an illustration of the spade form is
given on the second page of tools in purchasing his set of tools the
student should order nos 1 2 3 10 11 in this form they will be
found to have many advantages as they conceal less of the wood behind
them and get well into corners inaccessible to straightsided tools
they are lighter and more easily sharpened and are very necessary in
finishing the surface of work and in shaping out foliage more
especially such as is undercut
illustration fig 1
illustration fig 2
nos 5 6 7 are straight gouges graduated in size and sweep no 8 is
called a veiner because it is often used for making the grooves which
represent veins in leaves it is a narrow but deep gouge and is used
for any narrow grooves which may be required and for outlining the
drawing at starting
no 9 is called a v tool or parting tool on account of its shape it
is used for making grooves with straight sides and sharp inner angles at
the bottom it can be used for various purposes such as undercutting
clearing out sharply defined angles outlining the drawing etc etc
it should be got with a square cutting edge not beveled off as some are
made nos 10 11 12 are flat chisels or as they are sometimes
called firmers nos 10 and 11 should be in spade shape no 13 is
also a flat chisel but it is beveled off to a point and is called a
cornerchisel it is used for getting into difficult corners and is a
most useful tool when used as a knife for delicate edges or curves
nos 14 and 16 are what are known as bent chisels they are used
principally for leveling the ground or background and are therefore
also called grounders these tools are made with various curves or
bends in their length but for our present uses one with a bend like
that shown to tool no 23 fig 2 and at a in fig 3 will be best
more bend as at b would only make the tool unfit for leveling
purposes on a flat ground
no 15 is a similar tool but called a corner grounder as it is
beveled off like a cornerchisel
no 17 is an additional gouge of very slow sweep and small size this is
a very handy little tool and serves a variety of purposes when you come
to finishing the surface
these seventeen tools will make up a very useful set for the beginner
and should serve him for a long time or at least until he really begins
to feel the want of others then he may get the remainder shown on fig
2
nos 18 19 20 are deep gouges having somewhat straight sides they
are used where grooves are set deeply and when they are required to
change in section from deep and narrow to wide and shallow this is done
by turning the tool on its side which brings the flatter sweep into
action thus changing the shape of the hollow nos 21 22 are gouges
but are called bent gougesfront bent in this case back bent
when the cutting sweep is turned upside down it is advisable when
selecting these tools to get them as shown in the illustration with a
very easy curve in their bend they are more generally useful so as
quick bends are only good for very deep hollows these tools are used
for making grooves in hollow places where an ordinary gouge will not
work owing to its meeting the opposing fiber of the wood
no 23 is a similar tool but very easy both in its sweep and
bendthe sweep should be little more than recognizable as a curve this
tool may be used as a grounder when the wood is slightly hollow or
liable to tear up under the flat grounder
no 24 is called a maccaroni tool this is used for clearing out the
ground close against leaves or other projections as it has two square
sides it can be used right and left
in the illustration fig 3 a shows the best form of grounding tool
b is little or no use for this purpose as it curves up too suddenly
for work on a flat ground it is a good thing to have the handles of
tools made of different colored woods as it assists the carver in
picking them out quickly from those lying ready for use
illustration fig 3
when in use the tools should be laid out in front of the carver if
possible and with their points toward him in order that he may see the
shape and choose quickly the one he wants
the tempering of tools is a very important factor in their efficiency
it is only of too common occurrence to find many of the tools
manufactured of late years unfit for use on account of their softness of
metal there is nothing more vexatious to a carver than working with a
tool which turns over its cutting edge even in soft wood such tools
should be returned to the agent who sold them
with a selection from the above tools acquired by degrees in the manner
described almost any kind of work may be done there is no need
whatever to have a tool for every curve of the design these can readily
be made by using straight chisels in combination with such gouges as we
possess or by sweeping the curves along their sides with a chisel used
knife fashion no really beautiful curves can be made by merely
following the curves of gouges however various their sweeps as they
are all segments of circles
tools generally come from the manufacturer ground but not sharpened as
the student must in any case learn how to sharpen his tools it will be
just as well to get them in that way rather than ready for use as this
process of sharpening tools is a very important one it must be reserved
for another place should tools be seriously blunted or broken they must
be reground this can be done by the carver either on a grindstone or a
piece of gritty york stone care being taken to repeat the original
bevel or they may be sent to a tool shop where they are in the habit
of grinding carving tools
catalogues of tools may be had from good makers they will be found to
consist mainly in a large variety of the tools already mentioned those
which are very much bent or curved are intended for special application
to elaborate and difficult passages in carving and need not concern the
student until he comes to find the actual want of such shapes such for
instance as bent parting tools and back bent gouges
in addition to the above tools carvers occasionally use one called a
router this is a kind of plane with a narrow perpendicular blade it
is used for digging or routing out the wood in places where it is to
be sunk to form a ground it is not a tool to be recommended for the use
of beginners who should learn to make sufficiently even backgrounds
without the aid of mechanical contrivances carvers also use the
rifler which is a bent file this is useful for very fine work in
hard wood and also for roughly approximating to rounded forms before
finishing with the tools
a few joiners tools are very useful to the carver and should form
part of his equipment a wide chisel say about 114 in wide a small
iron bullnose plane and a keyhole saw will all be helpful and save
a lot of unnecessary labor with the carving tools

sharpeningstonesmallet and bench
     different stones in usecase for stonesslipsround mallet
     besta homemade bencha makeshift benchcramps and clips
the stones which are most generally used for the purpose of sharpening
carving tools are turkey and washita there are many others some
equally good but washita is easily procured and very serviceable it
is to be had in various grades and it may be just as well to have one
coarse and one fine but in any case we must have a finegrained stone
to put a keen edge on the tools a turkey stone is a finegrained and
slowcutting one and may take the place of the finer washita the
india oilstone is a composition of emery with some kind of stone dust
and is a useful stone for quickly rubbing down superfluous steel before
putting an edge to the tool it is better to get these stones without
cases as they can then be used on both sides one for flat tools and
one for gouges which wear the face of a stone into grooves a case may
be made by hollowing out a block of wood so as to take the stone
loosely and if at one end a small notch is made in this block a
screwdriver may be inserted under the stone when it is necessary to turn
it two brads or pins should be inserted in holes having their points
just appearing below the bottom of the block these prevent it slipping
about when in use these stones should be lubricated with a mixture of
olive oil and paraffin in equal parts bicycle lubricating oil is very
good for this purpose
illustration fig 4
for sharpening the insides of tools slips are made with rounded edges
of different sizes one slip of washita stone and one of arkansas
will be enough for the present as they will fit moderately well most of
the gouges in the beginners set of tools the arkansas being used for
the smaller tools the arkansas slip should be what is called
knifeedged this is required for sharpening such tools as the veiner
and v tool it is a very fine marblelike stone and exceedingly
brittle care must be taken in handling it as a fall would in all
probability be fatal
the bench and mallet
the malletthe carvers mallet is used for driving his tools where
force is required the most suitable form is the round one made of
beech one 4 ins diameter will be heavy enough
the benchevery carver should provide himself with a bench he may
make one for himself according to the size and construction shown in the
illustration fig 5 the top should be made of two 11 x 2 in boards
and as steadiness is the main feature to be aimed at the joints should
have some care those in illustration are shown to be formed by
checking one piece of wood over the other with shoulders to resist
lateral strain proper tenons would be better but more difficult to
make it must have a projecting edge at the front and ends to receive
the clamps the bench should have a joiners benchscrew attached to
the back leg for holding work which is to be carved on its edges or
ends the feet should be secured to the floor by means of iron brackets
as considerable force is applied in carving hard wood which may move
the bench bodily unless it is secured or is very heavy professional
carvers use a bench which is composed of beech planks three or four
inches in thickness and of length according to shoproom
illustration fig 5
illustration fig 6
should it not be possible to make or procure a bench then a substitute
must be used fig 6 gives a suggestion for making such a temporary
bench the top is composed of one piece of board 11 ins wide and 112
in thick it should be about 2 ft 6 ins long and rest on two blocks
fixed about 112 in from the ends which must project as in fig 6
this may be used on any ordinary table to which it should be secured by
means of two 312in clamps the height from the floor should be 3 ft
2 ins to top of board this gives a good height for working as carvers
invariably stand to their work the height can be regulated by making
the blocks a higher or lower to suit the table which is to be used
illustration fig 7
crampscramps for holding the work in position on the bench are of
several kinds for ordinary thicknesses of wood two 412in screw
clamps like the one in fig 7 will be sufficient wooden blocks may be
also used to hold one end of the work down while the other is held by a
clamp these blocks are notched out to fit over the thickness of the
board being carved as in fig 7 carvers use for their heavier work a
benchscrew as it is called that is a screw which passes through
the bench into the back of the work which may thus be turned about at
will also if the work is very thick they hold it in position by means
of a bench holdfast a kind of combined lever and screw but neither
of these contrivances is likely to be required by the beginner whose
work should be kept within manageable dimensions
chapter iv
woods used for carving
     hard wood and soft woodcloseness of grain desirableadvantages
     of pine and english oak
the woods suitable for carving are very various but we shall confine
our attention to those in common use of the softer woods those which
are most easily procured and most adaptable to modern uses are yellow
pine bass wood kauri pine and lime these are all good woods for the
carver but we need not at present look for any better qualities than
we shall find in a good piece of yellow pine free from knots or shakes
the following woods may be considered as having an intermediate place
between soft and hard sycamore beech and holly they are
lightcolored woods and very useful for broad shallow work
english oakof the hard woods in common use the principal kinds are
oak walnut and occasionally mahogany of oak the english variety is
by far the best for the carver being close in the grain and very hard
it is beyond all others the carvers wood and was invariably used by
them in this country during the robust period of medieval craftsmanship
it offers to the carver an invigorating resistance to his tools and its
character determines to a great extent that of the work put upon it it
takes in finishing a very beautiful surface when skilfully handledand
this tempts the carver to make the most of his opportunities by adapting
his execution to its virtues other oaks such as austrian and american
are often used but they do not offer quite the same tempting
opportunity to the carver they are by nature quickergrowing trees
and are consequently more open in the grain they have tough sinewy
fibers alternating with softer material they rarely take the same
degree of finish as the english oak but remain somewhat dull in
texture good pieces for carving may be got but they must be picked out
from a quantity of stuff chestnut is sometimes used as a substitute for
oak but it is better fitted for largescaled work where fineness of
detail is not of so much importance
italian walnutthis is a very finegrained wood of even texture
the italian variety is the best for carving it cuts with something of
the firmness of english oak and is capable of receiving even more
finish of surface in small details it is admirably suited for fine work
in low relief in choosing this wood for carving the hardest and
closest in grain should be picked as it is by no means all of equal
quality it should be free from sap which may be known by a light
streak on the edges of the dark brown wood
english walnut has too much figure in the grain to be suitable for
carving american walnut is best fitted for sharply cut shallow carving
as its fiber is caney if it is used the design should be one in which
no fine modeling or detail is required as this wood allows of little
finish to the surface
mahogany more especially the kind known as honduras is very similar
to american walnut in quality of grain it cuts in a sharp caney manner
the spanish variety was closer in grain but is now almost
unprocurable work carved in mahogany should like that in american
walnut be broad and simple in style without much rounded detail
it is quite unnecessary to pursue the subject of woods beyond the few
kinds mentioned woods such as ebony sandalwood cherry brier box
peartree lancewood and many others are all good for the carver but
are better fitted for special purposes and small work as this book is
concerned more with the art of carving than its application it will
save confusion if we accept yellow pine as our typical soft wood and
good closegrained oak as representing hard wood it may be noted in
passing that the woods of all flowering and fruitbearing trees are very
liable to the attack of worms and rot
no carving in whatever wood should be polished i shall refer to this
when we come to texture and finish

     out the insidestropping fine toolsimportance of sharp tools
having given this brief description of the tools and materials used by
carvers we shall suppose a piece of work is about to be started the
first thing the carver will require to do is to sharpen his tools that
is if we may assume that they have just come from the manufacturer
ground but not yet brought to an edge it will be seen that each has a
long bevel ending in a blunt ridge where the cutting edge should be we
shall take the chisel no 10 and sharpen that first as it is the
easiest to do and so get a little practise before we try the gouges
the oilstone and oil have already been described the first thing is to
well oil the stone and lay it on the bench in a position with its end
toward the operator
illustration a angle for softwood
b angle for hardwood
fig 8
tools which are going to be used in soft wood require rather a longer
bevel and more acute edge than when they are wanted for hard wood both
angles are shown in fig 8 lay the flat of the tool on the stone at an
angle of about 15 with the handle in the hollow of the right hand and
two fingers of the left pressed upon the blade as near to the stone as
possible then begin rubbing the tool from end to end of the stone
taking care not to rock the right hand up and down but to keep it as
level as possible throughout the stroke bearing heavily on the blade
with the left hand to keep it well in contact with the stone rocking
produces a rounded edge which is fatal to keenness c fig 9 gives
approximately to an enlarged scale the sections of a good edge and d
that of an imperfect one
illustration c good cutting edge d badly formed edge fig 9
practise alone will familiarize the muscles of the wrist with the proper
motion but it is important to acquire this in order to form the correct
habit early it should be practised very slowly at first until the
hands get accustomed to the movements when one side of the tool has
been rubbed bright as far as the cutting edge turn it over and treat
the other in the same way carvers tools unlike joiners are rubbed
on both sides in the proportion of about twothirds outside to
onethird inside when a keen edge has been formed which can easily be
tested by gently applying the finger it should be stropped on a piece
of stout leather it will be found if the finger is passed down the
tool and over its edge that the stoning has turned up a burr this must
be removed by stropping on both sides alternately a paste composed of
emery and crocus powders mixed with grease is used to smear the leather
before stropping this can either be procured at the tool shop or made
by the carver when the tool has been sufficiently stropped and all
burr removed it is ready for use but it is as well to try it on a
piece of wood first and test it for burr and if necessary strop it
again
before we leave this tool however we shall anticipate a little and
look at it after it has been used for some time and become blunt its
cutting edge and the bevel above it are now polished to a high degree
owing to friction with the wood we lay it on the stone taking care to
preserve the original angle 15 we find on looking at the tool after
a little rubbing that this time it presents a bright rim along the edge
in contrast with the gray steel which has been in contact with the
stone this bright rim is part of the polished surface the whole bevel
had before we began this second sharpening which proves that the actual
edge has not yet touched the stone we are tempted to lift the right
hand ever so little and so get rid of this bright rim sometimes called
the candle we shall thus get an edge quicker than if we have to rub
away all the steel behind it we do this and soon get our edge the
bright rim has disappeared but we have done an unwise thing and have
not saved much time because we have begun to make a rounded edge
which if carried a little farther will make the tool useless until it
is reground there is no help for it time must be spent and trouble
taken in sharpening tools with method and care there need be very
little grinding unless tools are actually broken
to resume our lesson in toolsharpening we can not do much carving with
one chisel so we shall now take up gouge no 2 as being the least
difficult this being a rounded tool we must turn the stone over and
use the side we have determined to keep for gouges etc we commence
rubbing it up and down the stone in the same manner as described for the
chisel but in addition we have now another motion to bring all the
parts of the edge into contact with the stone the gouge must be rolled
from side to side as it goes up and down to accomplish this the wrist
should be slowly practised until it gets into step with the up and down
motions it matters very little whether one turn of the tool is given to
one passage along the stone or only one turn to many up and down
rubbings the main thing is evenness of rubbing all along the circular
edge as if one part gets more than its share the edge becomes wavy
which is a thing to be avoided as much as possible when the outside has
been cleanly rubbed up to the edge the inside is to be rubbed out with
the washita slip and oil to the extent of about half as much as the
outside the handle of the tool should be grasped in the left hand
while its blade rests on a block of wood or on the oilstone hold the
slip between the fingers and thumb slanting a little over the inner
edge and work it in a series of short downward strokes beginning the
stroke at one corner of the gouge and leaving off at the other see fig
10 strop the outside of the tool and test for burr then lay the
leather over the handle of another tool and strop the inside repeating
the operation until all burr has been removed when probably the tool
will be ready for use
illustration fig 10
the veiner requires the same kind of treatment only as this tool is not
part of a circle in its section having straight sides only onehalf
must be done at a time and it is as well to give the straight sides one
stroke or so in every halfdozen all to itself to keep it in shape care
must be taken with this tool as it is easily rubbed out of shape the
inside must be finished off with the arkansas knifeedged slip one side
at a time as it is impossible to sweep out the whole section of these
deep tools at one stroke stropping must follow as before but as this
tool is so small that the leather will not enter its hollow the leather
must be laid down flat and the hollow of the tool drawn along its edge
until it makes a little ridge for itself which fills the hollow and
clears off burr see fig 11 if any such adheres outside a slight rub
on the arkansas stone will probably remove it when the edges of the
tools begin to get dull it often happens that they only require to be
stropped which should be frequently done as the treatment of all
gouges is more or less like what has been described practise will
enable the student to adapt it to the shape of the tool which requires
his attention there remains only the v tool the spoon tools and the
maccaroni which all require special attention the point of the v tool
is so acute that it becomes difficult to clear the inside a knifeedged
slip is used for this purpose and it is well also to cut a slip of wood
to a thin edge and after rubbing it with paste and oil pass it down
frequently over the point between the sides unless a very sharp point
is obtained this tool is practically useless the least speck of burr
or dullness will stop its progress or tear up the wood in sharpening
it the sides should be pressed firmly on the stone watching it every
now and then to see what effect is being produced if a gap begins to
appear on one side as it often does then rub the other side until it
disappears taking care to bear more heavily on the point of the tool
than elsewhere if the sides get out of shape pass the tool along the
stone holding it at right angles to the side of the stone but at the
proper angle of elevation in this case the tool is held near its end
between fingers and thumb spoon tools must be held to the stone at a
much higher angle until the cutting edge is in the right relation to the
surface or they may be drawn sidewise along it taking care that every
part of the edge comes in contact and receives an equal amount of
rubbing these may be treated half at a time or all round according to
the size and depth of the tool however it is produced the one thing
essential is a long straightsectioned cutting bevel not a rounded or
obtuse one strop the inside by folding up the leather into a little
roll or ball until it fills the hollow of the tool
illustration fig 11
for the small set of tools described in chapter ii one flat oilstone and
two slips will be found sufficient for a beginning but as a matter of
fact it will be advisable as the number of tools is enlarged to
obtain slips of curves corresponding to the hollows of all gouges as
nearly as possible many professional carvers have sets of these slips
for the insides of tools varying in curves which exactly fit every
hollow tool they possess including a triangular one for the inside of
the v tool the same rule sometimes applies to the sweeps of the
outsides of gouges for these corresponding channels are ground out in
flat stones a process which is both difficult and laborious if the
insides are dealt with on fitting slips which may be easily adapted to
the purpose by application to a grindstone the outsides are not so
difficult to manage so that grooved stones may be dispensed with
before we leave the subject of sharpening tools it will be well to
impress upon the beginner the extreme importance of keeping his tools in
good order when a tool is really sharp it whistles as it works a dull
tool makes dull work and the carver loses both time and temper there
can be no doubt that the great technical skill shown in the works of
grinling gibbons and his followers could not have been arrived at
without the help of extraordinarily sharp tools tools not merely
sharpened and then used until they became dull but tools that were
always sharp and never allowed to approach dullness sharpening tools
is indeed an art in itself and like other arts has its votaries who
successfully conquer its difficulties with apparent ease while others
are baffled at every point impatience is the stumblingblock in such
operations those most painstaking people the chinese according to all
accounts put magic into their sharpening stones the keenness of their
blades being only equaled by that of their wits in all such matters of
delicate application to make a good beginning is a great point gained
to carefully examine every tool and at the expense of time correct the
faults of management is the only way to become expert in sharpening
tools

chip carving
     its savage origina clue to its only claim to artistic
     importancemonotony better than varietyan exercise in impatience
     and precisiontechnical methods
one of the simplest forms of woodcarving is that known as chip
carving this kind of work is by no means of modern origin as its
development may be traced to a source in the barbaric instinct for
decoration common to the ancient inhabitants of new zealand and other
south sea islands technically and with modern tools it is a form of
the art which demands but little skill save in the matter of precision
and patient repetition as practised by its savage masters the
perfection of these two qualities elevates their work to the dignity of
a real art it is difficult to conceive the contradictory fact that
this apparently simple form of art was once the exponent of a struggling
desire for refinement on the part of fierce and warlike men and that it
should under the influence of polite society become the alltooeasy
task of esthetically minded schoolgirls in the hands of those warrior
artists and with the tools at their command mostly fashioned from
sharpened fishbones and such like rude materials it was an art which
required the equivalent of many fine artistic qualities as such are
understood by more cultivated nations the marvelous dexterity and
determined purpose evinced in the laborious decoration of canoe paddles
axhandles and other weapons is under such technical disabilities as
to tools really very impressive this being so there is no inherent
reason why such a rudimentary form of the art as chip carving should
not be practised in a way consistent with its true nature and
limitations as its elemental distinctions are so few and its methods
so simple it follows that in recognizing such limitations we shall
make the most of our design instead then of trusting to a forced
variety let us seek for its strong point in an opposite direction and
by the monotonous repetition of basketlike patterns win the
nottobedespised praise which is due to patience and perseverance in
this way only can such a restricted form of artistic expression become
in the least degree interesting the designs usually associated with the
civilized practise of this work are generally speaking of the kind
known as geometric that is to say composed of circles and straight
lines intersecting each other in complicated pattern now the variety
obtained in this manner as contrasted with the dignified monotony of
the savages method is the note which marks a weak desire to attain
great results with little effort the variety as such is wholly
mechanical the technical difficulties with modern tools at command
are felt at a glance to be very trifling therefore such designs are
quite unsuitable to the kind of work if human sympathies are to be
excited in a reasonable way
an important fact in connection with this kind of design is that most of
these geometric patterns are apart from their uncomfortable variety
based on too large a scale as to detail all the laborious carving on
paddles and clubs such as may be seen in our museums is founded upon
a scale of detail in which the holes vary in size from 116 to something
under 14 in their longest way only in special places such as
borders etc attaining a larger size such variety as the artist has
permitted himself being confined to the occasional introduction of a
circular form but mostly obtained by a subtle change in the proportion
of the holes or by an alternate emphasis upon perpendicular or
horizontal lines
as a test of endurance and as an experimental effort with carving
tools i set you this exercise in fig 12 you will find a pattern taken
from one of those south sea carvings which we have been considering
now take one of the articles so often disfigured with childish and
hasty efforts to cover a surface with socalled art work such as the
side of a bellows or the surface of a breadplate and on it carve this
pattern repeating the sameshaped holes until you fill the entire
space by the time you have completed it you will begin to understand
and appreciate one of the fundamental qualities which must go toward the
making of a carver namely patience and you will have produced a
thing which may give you pleasant surprises in the unexpected but very
natural admiration it elicits from your friends
illustration fig 12
having drawn the pattern on your wood ruling the lines to measurement
and being careful to keep your lines thin and clear as drawn with a
somewhat hard pencil proceed to cut out the holes with the chisel no
11 on our list 14 in wide it will serve the purpose much better than
the knife usually sold for this kind of work and will be giving you
useful practise with a very necessary carving tool the corner of the
chisel will do most of the work sloping it to suit the different angles
at the bottom of the holes each chip should come out with a clean cut
but to insure this the downward cuts should be done first forming the
raised diagonal lines
when you have successfully performed this piece of discipline you may
if you care to do more of the same kind of work carry out a design
based upon the principles we have been discussing but introducing a
very moderate amount of variety by using one or more of the patterns
shown in fig 12 all of which are from the same dusky artists designs
and can not be improved upon if you wish for more variety than these
narrow limits afford then try some other kind of carving with perhaps
leafage as its motive

the grain of the wood
     obstinacy of the woody fiberfirst exercise in
     groundingdescription of methodcutting the mitershandling of
     tools danger of carelessnessimportance of clean cutting
it is curious to imagine what the inside of a young enthusiasts head
must be like when he makes his first conscious step toward artistic
expression the chaotic jumbles of halfformed ideas whirling about in
its recesses produce kaleidoscopic effects which to him look like the
most lovely pictures if he could only learn to put them down let him
but acquire the technical department of his art and what easier than to
realize those most marvelous dreams later in his progress it begins to
dawn upon him that this same technical department may not be so very
obedient to his wishes it may have laws of its own which shall change
his fairy fancies into sober images not at all unlike something which
has often been done before by others but let the young soul continue to
see visions the more the better provided they be of the right sort we
shall in the meantime ask him to curb his imagination and yield his
faculties for the moment to the apparently simple task of realizing a
leaf or two from one of the trees in his enchanted valley
with the students kind permission we shall while these lessons
continue make believe that teacher and pupil are together in a
classroom or better still in a country workshop with chips flying
in all directions under busy hands
i must tell you then that the first surprise which awaits the beginner
and one which opens his eyes to a whole series of restraints upon the
freedom of his operations lies in the discovery that wood has a decided
grain or fiber he will find that it sometimes behaves in a very
obstinate manner refusing to cut straight here chipping off there and
altogether seeming to take pleasure in thwarting his every effort by
and by he gets to know his piece of wood where the grain dips and
where it comes up or wriggles and with practise he becomes its master
he finds in this his first technical difficulty a kind of blessing in
disguise because it sets bounds to what would otherwise be an
infinitely vague choice of methods
we shall now take a piece of yellow pine free from knots and planed
clean all round the size may be about 12 ins long by 7 ins wide we
shall fix this to the bench by means of two clamps or one clamp and a
screwed block at opposite corners now we are ready to begin work but
up to the present we have not thought of the design we intend executing
being so intent upon the tools and impatient for an attack upon the
silky wood with their sharp edges
the illustration fig 13 gives a clue to the sort of design to begin
with it measures about 11 ins long by 7 ins wide allowing a margin
all round the wood should be a little longer than the design as the
ends get spoiled by the clamps this little design need not and indeed
should not be copied make one for yourself entirely different only
bearing in mind the points which are to be observed in arranging it
and which have for their object the avoidance of difficulties likely to
be too much for a first effort these points are somewhat to this
effect the design should be of leaves laid out flat on a background
with no complication of perspective they should have no undulations of
surface that is to say the margins of all the features should be as
nearly as possible the original surface of the wood which may have just
the least possible bit of finish in the manner i shall describe later
on the articulation of the leaves and flower is represented by simple
gouge cuts there should be nothing in the design requiring rounded
surfaces the passage for tools in clearing out the ground between the
features must not be less than 14 in this will allow the 316 in
corner grounder to pass freely backward and forward the ground is
supposed to be sunk about threesixteenths of an inch
as you have not got your design made i shall for convenience sake
explain how fig 13 should be begun and finished first having traced
the fullsize design it should be transferred to the wood by means of a
piece of blue carbon paper
illustration fig 13
illustration fig 14
then with either the veiner or v tool outline the whole of the leaves
etc about 18 in deep keeping well on the outside of the drawing
ignore all minor detail for the present blocking out the design in
masses no outline need be grooved for the margin of the panel at
present as it should be done with a larger tool for this purpose take
gouge no 6 14 in wide and begin at the lefthand bottom corner of
the panel cut a groove about 116 in within the blue line taking care
not to cut off parts of the leaves in the process begin a little above
the corner at the bottom and leave off a little below that at the top
the miters will be formed later on
in this operation as in all subsequent ones the grain of the wood will
be more or less in evidence you will by degrees get to know the piece
of wood you are working upon and cut in such a way that your tool runs
with the grain and not against it that is to say you will cut as
much as possible on the uphill direction of the fiber this can not
always be done in deep hollows but then you will have had some practise
before you attempt these
now take chisel no 11 and with it stab into the grooved outline
pressing the tool down perpendicularly to what you think feels like the
depth of the ground the mallet need not be used for this as the wood
is soft enough to allow of the tools being pressed by the hand alone
but remember that the force must be proportioned to the depth desired
and to the direction of the grain much less pressure is wanted to drive
a tool into the wood when its edge is parallel with the grain than when
it lies in a cross direction small tools penetrate more easily than
large ones as a matter of course but one must think of these things or
accidents happen
when you have been all round the design in this way with such gouges as
may be needed for the slow and quick curves get the wood out nearly
down to the ground leaving a little for finishing do this with any
tool that fits the spaces best the larger the better cut across the
grain as much as possible not along it the flat gouge no 1 will be
found useful for this purpose in the larger spaces and the grounders
for the narrow passages this leaves the ground in a rough state which
must be finished later on
now take gouges nos 2 3 4 5 6 7 and chisels nos 10 11 12 and
with them cut down the outline as accurately as possible to the depth of
the ground and if you are lucky just a hairs breadth deeper in
doing this make the sides slope a little outward toward the bottom if
the gouges do not entirely adapt themselves to the contours of your
lines do not trouble but leave that bit to be done afterward with a
sweep of the tool either a flat gouge or the cornerchisel used like a
knife
now we have all the outline cut down to the depth of the background and
may proceed to clear out the wood hanging about between the design and
the ground all round it we shall do this with the grounders using
the largest one when possible and only taking to the smallest when
absolutely necessary on account of space this done we shall now
proceed to finish the hollow sides of the panel and make the miters
again take no 6 gouge and drive a clear hollow touching the blue line
at end of panel and reaching the bottom of the sinking ie the
actual ground as finished see a fig 15 to form the miter at top of
lefthand side of panel carry the hollow on until the tool reaches the
bottom of the hollow running along the top as soon as this point is
gained turn the tool out and pitch it a little up in the way shown at
c fig 15 in which the tool is shown at an angle which brings the
edge of the gouge exactly on the line of the miter to be formed
beginning as it does at b this quick turn of the handle to the left
takes out the little bit of wood shown by dotted lines at b and
forms onehalf of the miter the crossgrain cut should be done first
as in this way there is less risk of splintering now repeat the process
on the longgrain side of the panel and one miter is in a good way for
being finished
illustration fig 15
a word now about these sides of sunk panels they always look better if
they are hollowed with a gouge instead of being cut square down in the
first case they carry out the impression that the whole thing is cut out
of a solid piece of wood whereas when they are cut sharply down they
always suggest cabinetmaking as if a piece had been glued on to form a
margin
we have now got the work blocked out and the ground fairly level and we
are ready to do the little carving we have allowed ourselves before we
begin this i shall take the opportunity of reminding you that you must
be very careful in handling your tools it is a matter of the greatest
importance if the contingency of cut fingers or damaged work is to be
avoided the left hand in carving has nearly as much to do as the right
only in a different way grasp the chisel or gouge in the left hand
with the fingers somewhat extended that is the little finger will come
well on to the blade and the thumb run up toward the top of the handle
the wrist meanwhile resting on the work the right hand is used for
pushing the tool forward and for turning it this way and that in fact
does most of the guiding both hands may be described as opposing each
other in force for the pressure on the tool from the right hand should
be resisted by the left until almost a balance is struck and just
enough force left to cut the wood gently without danger of slipping
forward and damaging it or the fingers the tool is thus in complete
command and the slightest change of pressure on either hand may alter
its direction or stop it altogether never drive a tool forward with one
hand without this counterresistance as there is no knowing what may
happen if it slips never wave tools about in the hand and generally
remember that they are dangerous implements both to the user and the
work never put too much force on a tool when in the neighborhood of a
delicate passage but take time and eat the bit of wood out mouselike
in small fragments
now we are ready to finish our panel take the grounders according to
the size required always using the biggest possible keep the tool well
pressed down and shave away the roughness of the ground giving the
tool a slight sideway motion as well as a forward one work right up to
the leaves etc which if cut deep enough should allow the chips to
come away freely leaving a clear line of intersection if it does not
then the upright sides must be cut down until the ground is quite clear
of chips grounder tools are very prone to dig into the surface and make
work for themselves sharp tools practise and a slight sideway motion
will prevent this tool no 23 is useful in this respect its corners
being slightly lifted above the level of the ground as it passes along
corners that can not be reached with the bent chisels may be finished
off with the cornerchisel
now we come to the surface decorations for the carving in this design
consists of little more this is all done with the gouges generally
speaking enter the groove at its widest end and leave it at the
narrowest lowering the handle of the tool gradually as you go along to
lift the gouge out of the wood producing the drawing of the forms at
the same time a gouge cut never looks so well as when done at one
stroke patching it afterward with amendments always produces a labored
look if this has to be done the tool should be passed finally over the
whole groove to remove the superfluous tool marksa sideway gliding
motion of the edge combined with its forward motion often succeeds in
this operation to form the circular center of the flower press down
gouge nos 5 or 6 gently at first and perpendicular to the wood when a
cut has been made all round the circle work the edge of the tool in it
circuslike by turning the handle in the fingers round and round until
the edge cuts its way down to the proper depth see a fig 15
carve the sides of the leaves where necessary with flat gouges on the
inside curves and with chisels and cornerchisels on the outside ones
these should be used in a sliding or knifelike fashion and not merely
pushed forward finish the surface in the same manner all over between
the gouge grooves and the edges of the leaves producing a very slight
bevel as in section a fig 13 and this panel may be called finished
fig 14 is another suggestion for a design upon which i hope you will
base one of your own as an exercise at this stage of your progress
before we begin another though i shall take this opportunity of
reading you a short lecture on a most important matter which has a great
deal to do with the preparation of your mind in making a suitable choice
of subject for your future work
chapter viii
imitation of natural forms
     difficulties of selection and arrangementlimits of an imitative
     treatmentlight and distance factors in the arrangement of a
     designeconomy of detail necessarythe word conventional
broadly stated the three most formidable difficulties which confront
the beginner when he sets out to make what he is pleased to call his
design for carving in relief are firstly the choice of a subject
secondly how far he may go in the imitation of its details thirdly
its arrangement as a whole when he has decided the first two points
just now we shall deal only with the second difficulty that is how far
may likeness to nature be carried we shall do this because until we
come to some understanding on that point a right choice of subject
becomes practically impossible consequently the consideration of its
arrangement would be premature
there is strictly speaking only one aim worthy of the artists
attention be he carver or painter and that is the representation of
some form of life or its associations luckily there is a mighty
consensus of opinion in support of this dictum both by example and
precept so there is no need to discuss it or question its authority
we shall proceed therefore to act upon it and choose for our work
only such material as in some way indicates life either directly as in
trees animals or figures or by association and as explanation
thereof as in drapery and other accessoriesnever choosing a subject
like those known to painters as still life such as bowls fiddles
weapons etc unless as i have said they are associated with the more
important element
you have already discovered by practise that wood has a grain which sets
bounds to the possibilities of technique you have yet to learn that it
has also an inordinate capacity for swallowing light now as it is by
the aid of light that we see the results of our labor it follows that
we should do everything in our power to take full advantage of that
helpful agency it is obvious that work which can not be seen is only so
much labor thrown away there is approximately a right relative distance
from which to view all manner of carvings and if from this position the
work is not both distinct and coherent its result is valueless
then what is the quality which makes all the difference between a
telling piece of carving and one which looks at a moderate distance
like crumpled paper or the cork bark which decorates a suburban
summerhouse the answer is attention to strict economy in detail
without economy there can be no arrangement and without the latter no
general effect we are practically dealing not with so much mere wood
but unconsciously we are directing our efforts to a manipulation of the
light of dayplaying with the lamps of the skyand if we do not
understand this the result must be undoubtedly failure with a piece of
wood left on our hands cut into unintelligible ruts
but what you will say has all this to do with copying the infinite
variety of natures detail surely it can not be wrong to imitate what
is really beautiful in itself you will find the best answer to this in
the technical difficulties of your task you have the grain of the wood
to think of and now you have this other difficulty in managing the
light which is to display your design the obstinacy of the wood may be
to some extent conquered and indeed has been almost entirely so by the
technical resources of grinling gibbons but the treatment demanded by
the laws of light and vision is quite another question and if our work
is to have its due effect there is no other solution of the problem
than by finding a way of complying with those laws
if i want to represent a rose and make it intelligible at a glance from
such and such a point of view and i find after taking infinite pains to
reproduce as many as i can of its numerous petals and as much as
possible of its complicated foliage that i had not reckoned with the
light which was to illuminate it and that instead of displaying my work
to advantage it has blurred all its delicate forms into dusky and
chaotic masses would i not be foolish if i repeated such an experiment
rather i take the opposite extreme and produce a rose this time which
has but five petals and one or two sprays of rudimentary foliage
somehow the result is better and it has only taken me a tenth part of
the time to produce i now find that i can afford without offending the
genius of light or straining my eyesight to add a few more petals and
one or two extra leaves between those i have so sparingly designed and
a kind of balance is struck the same thing happens when i try to
represent a whole treei can not even count the leaves upon it why
then attempt to carve them let me make one leaf that will stand for
fifty and let that leaf be simplified until it is little more than an
abstract of the form i see in such thousandfold variety the proof that
i am right this time is that when i stand at the proper distance to view
my work it is all as distinct as i could wish it to be not a
leafpoint is quite lost to sight except where in vanishing into a
shadow it adds mystery without creating confusion
we have in this discovery a clue to the meaning of the word
conventional it means that a particular method has been agreed upon
as the best fitted for its purpose ie as showing the work to most
advantage with a minimum of labor not that experience had really
anything to do with the invention of the method strange to say the
earliest efforts in carving were based upon an unquestioning sense that
no other was possible certainly no attempts were made to change it
until in latter days temptations arose in various directions the
effects of which have entailed upon ourselves a conscious effort of
choice in comparing the results of the many subsequent experiments
before i continue this subject further i shall give you another
exercise with the object of making a closer resemblance to natural
forms bearing in mind the while all that has been said about a sparing
use of minute detail with reference to its visible effect we shall in
this design attempt some shaping on the surface of the leaves and a
little rounding too which may add interest to the work in my next
lecture to you i shall have something to say about another important
element in all designs for woodcarving i mean the shapes taken by the
background between the leaves like the patches of sky seen behind a
tree

rounded forms
     necessity for every carver making his own designsmethod of
     carving rounded forms on a sunk ground
illustration fig 16
fig 16 our second exercise like the first one is only to be taken as
a suggestion for a design to be made by yourself it is a fundamental
principle that both design and execution should be the work of one and
the same person and i want you to begin by strictly practising this
rule it was indeed one of the main conditions of production in the best
times of the past and there is not a shadow of doubt that it must again
come to be the universal rule if any real progress is to be made in the
art of woodcarving or in any other art for that matter just think
for a moment how false must be the position of both parties when one
makes a design and another carries it out the designer sets his
head to work we must not count his hands at present as they only note
down the results in a kind of writing a design is produced and
handed over to the carver to execute he the carver sets his hands and
eyes to work to carry out the other mans idea or at least interpret
his notes for the same his head meanwhile having very little to do
further than transfer the said notes to his hands for very good reasons
such an arrangement as this is bound to come to grief one is that no
piece of carving can properly be said to be designed until it is
finished to the last stroke a drawing is only a map of its general
outline with perhaps contours approximately indicated by shading in
any case even if a fullsize model were supplied by the designer the
principle involved would suffer just the same degree of violence for it
is in the actual carving of the wood that the designer should find both
his inspiration and the discipline which keeps it within reasonable
bounds he must be at full liberty to alter his original intention as
the work develops under his hand
apparently i have been led into giving you another lecture we must now
get to work on our exercise
draw and trace your outline in the same manner as before and transfer
it to the wood you may make it any convenient size say on a board 18
ins long by 9 ins wide or what other shape you like provided you
observe one or two conditions which i am going to point out it shall
have a fair amount of background between the features and the design
whatever it is shall form a traceable likeness to a pattern of some
description it shall have a rudimentary resemblance to nature without
going into much detail and last it shall have a few rounded forms in
it rounded both in outline and on the surface as for instance plums
illustration fig 17
in setting to work to carve this exercise follow the same procedure as
in the first one up to the point when the surface decorations began in
the illustration there is a suggestion for a variety in the background
which does not occur in the other in this case the little branches are
supposed to lie along the tops of gentle elevations and the plums to
lie in the hollows it produces a section something like this fig 17
there is a sufficient excuse for this kind of treatment in the fact that
the branches do not require much depth and the plums will look all the
better for a little more the depth of the background will thus vary
say between 316 in at the branches and 38 in at the plums the
branches are supposed to be perfectly level from end to end that is
they lie parallel to the surface of the wood but of course curve about
in the other direction the leaves on the other hand are supposed to
be somewhat rounded and falling away toward their sides and points in
places the vein in the center of the leaves may be done with a parting
tool as well as the serrations at the edge or the latter may perhaps
be more surely nicked out with a chisel after the leaves have received
their shapes the leaves being made to appear as if one side was higher
than the other and as though their points in some cases touched the
background while in others the base may be the lowest part the twigs
coming out from the branches to support the plums should be somewhat
like this in section and should lie along the curve of the background
and be in themselves rounded as in fig 18 see section a a the
bottom of the panel shows a bevel instead of a hollow border this will
serve to distinguish it as a startingpoint for the little branches
which appear to emerge from it like trees out of the ground the plums
should be carved by first cutting them down in outline to the
background as a fig 19 then the wood should be removed from the edge
all round to form the rounded surface to do this first take the large
gouge no 2 and with its hollow side to the wood cut off the top
from about its middle to one end and reversing the process do the same
with the other side then it will appear something like b fig 19
the remainder must be shaped with any tool which will do it best there
is no royal road to the production of these rounded forms but probably
gouge no 1 will do the most of it
illustration fig 18
illustration fig 19
here it may be observed that the fewer tools used the better as if many
are used there is always a risk of unpleasant facets at the places where
the various marks join each other before you try the plums or apples
or other rounded fruit which you may have in your design it would be as
well to experiment with one on a piece of spare wood in order to decide
upon the most suitable tools the stems or branches may be done with
flat gouge no 1 or the flat or corner chisel a very delicate twist or
spiral tendency in their upward growth will greatly improve their
appearance a mere faceting produced by a flat gouge or chisel will do
this anything is better than a mere round and bare surface which has a
tendency to look doughy the little circular mark on the end of the plum
call it a plum although that fruit has no such thing is done by
pressing gouge no 7 into the wood first with the handle rather near
the surface of the wood and afterward at a higher inclination this
taking out a tiny chip of a circular shape and leaving a vshaped
groove
now i am going to continue the subject of my last lecture in order to
impress upon you the importance of suiting your subject to the
conditions demanded by the laws of technique and light practise with
the tools must go hand in hand with the education of the head if good
results are to be expected nor must it be left wholly to hand and eye
if you are to avoid the pitfalls which lie in wait for the unwary
mechanic

the patterned background
     importance of formal pattern as an aid to visibilitypattern and
     free rendering comparedfirst impressions lastingmedieval choice
     of natural forms governed by a question of pattern
illustration fig 20
by a comparison of the piece of byzantine sculpture fig 20 with the
more elaborate treatment of foliage shown in fig 21 from late gothic
capitals in southwell minster it will be seen how an increasing desire
for imitative resemblance has taken the place of a patterned foundation
and how in consequence the background is no longer discernible as a
contrasting form the byzantine design is of course little more than a
pattern with sunk holes for a background and it is in marble but those
holes are arranged in a distinct and orderly fashion the other is a
highly realistic treatment of foliage the likeness to nature being so
fully developed that some of these groups have veins on the backs of
the leaves the question for the moment is this which of the two
extremes gives the clearest account of itself at a distance i think
there can be little doubt that the more formal arrangement bears this
test better than the other and this too in face of the fact that it
has cost much less labor to produce remember we are only now
considering the question of visibility in the design you may like the
undefined and suggestive masses into which the leaves and shadows of the
southwell one group themselves better than the unbending severity of the
lines in the other but that is not the point at present you can not
see the actual work which produces that mystery and i may point out
to you that what is here romantic and pleasing on account of its
changeful and informal shadows is on the verge of becoming mere
bewildering confusion a tendency which always accompanies attempts to
imitate the accidental or informal grouping of leaves so common to
their natural state the further this is carried the less is it
possible to govern the forms of the background pattern they become less
discernible as contrasting forms although they may be very
interesting as elements of mystery and suggestive of things not actually
seen the consequence is a loss of power in producing that
instantaneous impression of harmony which is one of the secrets of
effectiveness in carving this is greatly owing to the constant change
of plane demanded by an imitative treatment as well as the want of
formality in its background the lack of restful monotony in this
respect creates confusion in the lights making a closer inspection
necessary in order to discern the beauty of the work now the human
imagination loves surprises and never wholly forgives the artist who
failing to administer a pleasant shock invites it to come forward and
examine the details of his work in order to see how well they are
executed
illustration fig 21
these examples you will say are from architectural details which have
nothing to do with woodcarving on the contrary the same laws govern
all manner of sculpturesque compositionscale or material making no
difference whatever a sculptured marble frieze or a carved ivory
snuffbox may be equally censurable as being either so bare that they
verge on baldness and want of interest or so elaborate that they look
like layers of fungus
do not imagine that i am urging any preference for a byzantine treatment
in your work to do so would be as foolish as to ask you to don
medieval costume while at work or assume the speech and manners of the
tenth century it would be just as ridiculous on your part to affect a
bias which was not natural to you i am however strongly convinced
that in the choice of natural forms and their arrangement into orderly
masses more particularly with regard to their appearance in silhouette
against the ground and also in the matter of an economical use of
detail we have much to learn from the carvers who preceded the
fourteenth century they thoroughly understood and appreciated the value
of the light which fell upon their work and in designing it arranged
every detail with the object of reflecting as much of it as possible to
this end their work was always calculated for its best effects to be
seen at a fairly distant point of view and to make sure that it would
be both visible and coherent seen from that point they insisted upon
some easily understood pattern which gave the key to the whole at a
glance to make a pattern of this kind is not such an easy matter as it
looks the forms of the background spaces are the complementary parts of
the design and are just as important as those of the solid portions
it takes them both to make a good design
now i believe you must have had enough of this subject for the present
more especially as you have not yet begun to feel the extraordinary
difficulty of making up your mind as to what is and what is not fit for
the carvers uses among the boundless examples of beauty spread out for
our choice by dame nature
meantime i do not want you to run away with the impression that when
you have mastered the principles of economy in detail and an orderly
disposition of background that you have therefore learned all that is
necessary in order to go on turning out design after design with the
ease of a cook making pancakes according to a recipe you will find by
experience i think that all such principles are good for is to enforce
clearness of utterance so to speak and to remind you that it is light
you are dealing with and upon which you must depend for all effects
also that the power of vision is limited acting upon them is quite
another matter and one i am afraid in which no one can help you
much you may be counseled as to the best and most practical mode of
expressing your ideas but those thoughts and inventions must come from
yourself if they are to be worth having
in my next lecture i shall have something to say with regard to
originality of design but now we must take up our tools again and begin
work upon another exercise
chapter xi
contours of surface
     adaptation of old designs to modern purposesthrowing
     aboutcritical inspection of work from a distance as it proceeds
illustration fig 22
here are two fragments of a kind of running ornament fig 22 is a part
of the jamb molding of a church in vicenza if you observe carefully
you will find that it has a decidedly classical appearance the truth is
that it was carved by a gothic artist late in the fourteenth century
just after the renaissance influence began to make itself felt it is an
adaptation by him of what he remembered having seen in his travels of
the new style grafted upon the traditional treatment ready to his hand
it suits our purpose all the better on that account for the reason that
we are going to readapt his design into an exercise and shall attempt
to make it suitable to our limited ability in handling the tools to the
change in material from stone to wood and lastly to our different
aims and motives in the treatment of architectural ornament please do
all this for yourself in another design and look upon this suggestion
merely in the light of helping a lame dog over a stile
illustration fig 23
in this exercise fig 23 you will repeat all you have already done
with the others until you come to the shaping of the leaves in which
an undulating or up and down motion has been attempted this involves a
kind of double drawing in the curves one for the flat and one for the
projections so that they may appear to glide evenly from one point to
the other sweeping up and down right and left without losing their
true contours carvers call this process throwing about ie making
the leaves etc appear to rise from the background and again fall
toward it in all directions the phrase is a very meager one and but
poorly expresses the necessity for intimate sympathy between each
surface so thrown about it is precisely in the observance of this
last quality that effects of richness are produced you can hardly have
too much monotony of surface but may easily err by having too much
variety therefore whatever system of light and shade you may adopt be
careful to repeat its motive in some sort of rhythmic order all over
your work by no other means can you make it rich and effective at a
distance
it is well every now and then to put your work up on a shelf or ledge at
a distance and view it as a whole you will thus see which parts tell
and which do not and so gain experience on this point work should also
be turned about frequently sidewise and upside down in order to find
how the light affects it in different directions of course you must
not think that because your work may happen to look well when seen from
a little way off that it does not matter about the details whether they
be well or poorly carved on the contrary unless you satisfy the eye at
both points of view your work is a partial failure the one thing is as
important as the other only as the first glance at carved work is
generally taken at some little distance it is the more immediately
necessary to think of that before we begin to work for a closer
inspection first impressions are generally lasting with regard to
carved work and as i have said before beauty of detail seldom quite
atones for failure in the arrangement of masses
the rounded forms in this design may give you a little trouble but
practise and that alone will enable you to overcome this absolute
smoothness is not desirable glasspapered surfaces are extremely ugly
because they obtrude themselves on account of their extreme smoothness
having lost all signs of handiwork in the tool marks we shall have
something to say presently about these tool marks in finishing as it is
a very important subject which may make all the difference between
success or failure in finishing a piece of work
chapter xii
originality
     dangers of imposing wordsnovelty more common than originalityan
     unwholesome kind of originality
i told you that i should have something to say about originality almost
every beginner has some vague impression that his first duty should be
to aim at originality he hears eulogiums passed upon the individuality
of some one or other and tries hard to invent new forms of expression
or peculiarities of style only resulting in most cases in new forms
of ugliness which it seems is the only possibility under such conscious
efforts after novelty the fact is that it takes many generations of
ardent minds to accomplish what at first each thinks himself capable of
doing alone true originality has somewhat the quality of good wine
which becomes more delightful as time mellows its flavor and imparts to
it the aroma which comes of long repose like the new wine too
originality should shyly hide itself in dark places until maturity
warrants its appearance in the light of day that kind of originality
which is strikingly new does not always stand the test of time and
should be regarded with cautious skepticism until it has proved itself
to be more than the passing fashion or novelty of a season there is a
kind of sham art very conspicuous at the present time which was at
quite a recent date popularly believed to be very original it seems to
have arisen out of some such impatient craving for novelty and it has
been encouraged by an easygoing kind of suburban refinement which
neither knows nor cares very much what really goes to the making of a
work of art this new art has filled our shops and exhibitions with an
invertebrate kind of ornament which certainly has the doubtful merit of
never having been seen before it has evidently taken its inspiration
from the trailing and supine forms of floating seaweed and revels in
the expression of such boneless structure by way of variety it presents
us with a kind of symbolic tree remarkable for more than archaic
flatness and rigidity now this kind of originality is not only
absolutely valueless but exceedingly harmful its only merit is that
like its ideal seaweed it has no backbone of its own and we may hope
that it will soon betake itself to its natural home the slimy bottom of
the ocean of oblivion
meantime the only thing we are absolutely sure of in connection with
that muchabused word originality is this that no gift original or
otherwise can be developed without steady and continuous practise with
the tools of your craft
chapter xiii
pierced patterns
     exercise in background patterncare as to stabilitydrilling and
     sawing out the spacessome uses for pierced patterns
the present exercises may be described as a kind of carved open
fretworkthat is to say the ground is entirely cut away leaving the
pattern standing free this will form an excellent piece of discipline
with regard to the design of background forms because in such work as
this those forms assert themselves in a very marked manner if they are
in any way found to be conspicuously unequal in size or are awkwardly
designed as to shape the whole effect of the work is spoiled
illustration fig 24
for your first effort make a design based upon no 24 and please to
observe these rules in its construction the main or leading lines of
the pattern are to run as much as possible without crossing each other
the holes are to be fairly equal in size or rather in area as they
need not be at all like each other in shape the amount of wood left
standing to be of a width averaging never less than half the length of
the averagesized hole this is necessary for securing sufficient
strength of material in the crossgrained pieces which would be liable
to split if made too long and narrow the pattern should be formal in
character not necessarily symmetrical but it should be well balanced
you may have one part of your design composed of large holes and another
of small ones provided the change is part of a definite design as in
fig 25 you may even leave the wood in some parts forming a solid
background or you may treat it as a separate piece of simple carving
on the solid as in fig 26 being careful to execute it in a
consistently simple manner as in this kind of work much change of
manner in execution is inadvisable although at the same time it is
open to any amount of variety in design of outline and combination of
contrasts
illustration fig 25
illustration fig 26
take a piece of pine about 3 or 4 ft long and 7 or 9 ins wide by 34
in thick trace on your pattern and drill circular holes in the middle
of each space to be cut through then take a keyhole saw and remove the
wood by sawing round the space close to the blue line taking care not
to cut through it in any place the saw must be held very truly upright
in order to cut the sides of the spaces at right angles to the face of
the wood now carve the pattern on the surface in whatever manner you
have designedin grooves suggesting the articulation of the leaves in
short grooves which may pass for additional leaves or in a dozen ways
which practise may help you to invent
the wood should be held tightly down to the bench in all its parts or
at least in those being operated upon as it may if unsupported crack
across some of the narrow parts the sides of all the holes must be
carved out clean to remove the rough saw marks this can be done partly
by gouges or still better the wood may be held up on its edge and the
holes cut round with a sharp penknife where the grain allows it now
turn the work over on its face and carve bevels round each of the holes
this reduces the apparent thickness of wood and adds to the effect of
delicacy in the pattern
this work may be used for the cresting of some large piece of furniture
or may be adapted to fill screens or partitions stair newels and
balusters or it may be used as a cornice decoration in the manner
suggested by no 26 where the pierced work can be backed by a hollow
cornice which it fills and enriches
in our next exercise we shall try our hands upon a piece of hardwood for
a changemeantime do one or two of these fret patterns by way of
disciplinary exercise in outline forms

hardwood carving
     carvings can not be independent ornamentscarving impossible on
     commercial productionsthe amateur joinercorner
     cupboardsintroduction of foliage definite in form and simple in
     charactermethods of carving grapes
we now come to the question what are we going to do with all the pieces
of carving which we propose to undertake
there is no more inexorable law relating to the use of woodcarving than
the one which insists upon some kind of passport for its introduction
wherever it appears it must come in good company and be properly
introduced the slightest and most distant connection with a recognized
sponsor is often sufficient but it will not be received alone we do
not make carvings to hang on a wall and be admired altogether on their
own account they must decorate some object a church screen a font a
piece of furniture or even the handle of a knife it is not always an
easy matter to find suitable objects upon which to exercise our
woodcarving talents our furniture is all made now in a wholesale
manner which permits of no interference with its construction while at
the same time if we wish to put any carving upon it it is absolutely
essential that both construction and decoration should be considered
together
illustration fig 27
a very modest beginning may be made in adapting ornament to a useful
article by carving the surface of a bread plate these are usually made
of some hard wood such as sycamore they may be made of oak but
sycamore has the advantage in its lighter color which is more likely to
be kept clean two suggestions are given in figs 27 and 28 for carving
appropriate to this purpose the essentials are that there should be a
welldefined pattern simple in construction and as effective as
possible with little labor that there should be little or no rounding
of surface the design consisting of gouge cuts and incisions arranged
to express the pattern the incisions may form a regular sunk ground
but it should not be deep or it will not be easily kept clean then as
in cutting bread the knife comes in contact with the surface no
delicate work is advisable a large treatment with broad surfaces and
some plain spaces left to protect the carved work is likely to prove
satisfactory in every way a piece of sycamore should be procured ready
for carving this may be got from a woodturner but it will be as well
to give him a drawing on which is shown the section of edge and the
position of all turned lines required for confining the carving if the
plate is to be of any shape other than circular then it must be neatly
made by a joiner unless you can shape it yourself
illustration fig 28
many of you are i have no doubt handy joiners and may with a little
help put together some slight pieces of furniture to serve at least as
an excuse for the introduction of your carving here are some
suggestions for corner cupboards chosen as giving the largest area for
carved surface with the minimum of expense in construction the material
should be oakenglish if possible or it may be italian walnut the
doors of figs 40 and 41 are in three narrow boards with shallow beads
at the joints those of the others are each made of a single board and
should be 12 in to 58 in thick the doors may be about 2 ft 6 ins
high each having two ledges about 3 ins wide screwed on behind top
and bottom to keep them from twisting all moldings beads etc are to
be carved by hand no planes being used having traced the lines of your
design upon the board you may begin if there are moldings as in fig
32 by using a joiners marking gage to groove out the deepest parts of
the parallel lines in the moldings along the edges doing the same to
the curved ones with a v tool or veiner then form the moldings with
your chisels or gouges keep them very flat in section as in fig 29
the fret patterns on figs 32 35 and 36 where not pierced should
also be done in low relief not more than 18 in deep and the sides of
the bands beveled as in section a fig 30 the widths of these bands
ought not to be less than 12 in and look better if they are wider
very narrow bands have a better appearance if instead of being cut
straight down they are hollowed at sides like b in fig 30
illustration fig 29
illustration fig 30
illustration fig 31
fig 31 is a detail of a kind of gouge work which you must all know very
well one perpendicular cut of a gouge driven in with the mallet and
one side cut should form one of these crescent or thimbleshaped holes
they should not be too deep in proportion to their size their
combinations may be varied to a great extent two or three common ones
are shown in the illustration this form of ornament was in all
likelihood invented by some ingenious carpenter with a turn for art and
a limited stock of carving tools his humble contribution to the
resources of the carvers art has received its due share of the flattery
which is implied by imitation in all these patterns it is well to
remember that the flat surface of the board left between the cuts is
really the important thing to consider as all variety is obtained by
disposing the holes in such a way as to produce the pattern required by
means of their outlines on the plain surface thus waved lines are
produced as in fig 31 and little niches like mimic architecture as in
fig 34 by the addition of the triangularshaped holes at the top and
the splayed sills at the bottom it is obvious that an arrangement like
the latter should never be turned upside down if this attention to the
surface pattern is neglected the holes are apt to become mere confused
and meaningless spots
in small pieces of furniture like these which are made of comparatively
thin wood the carving need not have much depth say the ground is sunk
14 in at the deepest as oak is more tenacious than pine you will
find greater freedom in working it although it is so much harder to
cut you may find it necessary to use the mallet for the greater part of
the blocking out but it need not be much used in finishing a series of
short strokes driven by gentle taps of the mallet will often make a
better curve than if the same is attempted without its aid
it will be well now to procure the remainder of the set of twentyfour
tools if you have not already got them as they will be required for the
foliage we are about to attempt the deep gouges are especially useful
having two different sweeps on each tool they adapt themselves to
hollows which change in section as they advance
fig 32 contains very little foliage such as there is being disposed in
small diamondshaped spaces sunk in the face of the doors and a small
piece on the bracket below all this work should be of a very simple
character definite in form and broad in treatment
illustration fig 31 half
illustration fig 32 half
fig 33 is more elaborate but on much the same lines of design varied
by having a larger space filled with groups of leaves fig 34 gives the
carving to a larger scale in it the oakleaves are shown with raised
veins in the center the others being merely indicated by the gouge
hollows there is some attempt in this at a more natural mode of
treating the foliage while such work is being carved it is well to
look now and then at the natural forms themselves oak and laurel in
this case in order to note their characteristic features and as a
wholesome check on the dangers of mannerism
it is a general axiom founded upon the evidence of past work and a
respect for the laws of construction in the carpenters department that
when foliage appears in panels divided by plain spaces it should never
be made to look as if it grew from one panel into the other with the
suggestion of boughs passing behind the solid parts this is a
characteristic of japanese work and may perhaps be admirable when
used in delicate painted decorations on a screen or other light
furniture but in carvings it disturbs the effect of solidity in the
material and serves no purpose which can not be attained in a much
better way
illustration carving in panels of fig 33 fig 34
expedients have been invented to overcome the difficulty of making a
fresh start in each panel one of which is shown in fig 34 where the
beginning of the bough is hidden under a leaf it is presumable that the
bough may go on behind the uncarved portions of the board to reappear
in another place but we need not insist upon the fancy which loses all
its power when attention is called to it like riddles when the answer
is known
illustration fig 35
illustration fig 36
in fig 35 like the last the treatment is somewhat realistic this is
shown to a larger scale in fig 38 nevertheless it has all been
arranged to fit its allotted space and all accidental elements
eliminated such for instance as leaves disappearing in violent
perspective or even turned sidewise and all minute details which would
not be likely to show conspicuously if carved in wood in fig 39 a
is an outline of a group of vineleaves taken from nature as it
appeared and in which state it is quite unfitted for carving on
account of its complicated perspective and want of definite outline
fig 39 b is a detail also copied from nature but which might stand
without alteration provided it formed part of a work delicate enough
to note such close elaboration in so small a space this of course
would entirely depend upon the purpose for which the carving was
intended and whether it was meant for distant view or close inspection
as there is arrangement necessary in forming the outline so there is
just as much required in designing the articulation of the surfaces of
the leaves which should be so treated that their hollows fall into a
semblance of some kind of pattern fig 36 is a more formal design or
to use a very much abused word more conventional in which such
leafage as there is only serves the purpose of ornamental points
marking the divisions of the general design the gouge work upon the
leaves should be of the simplest description but strict attention is
necessary in drawing the grooves so that their forms may be clear and
emphatic leaving no doubt as to the pattern intended designs of this
kind have no interest whatever except as pieces of patterned work to
which end every other consideration should be sacrificed it must not be
cut too deepsay 14 in at the deepestand the sides of the panels
should be very gently hollowed out with a flattish sweep see section on
fig 37 in order to avoid any appearance of actual construction in
what more or less imitates the stiles and rails of a door fig 37 shows
a portion of the leafage to a larger scale and also a plan explaining
the construction of all these cupboards
illustration fig 37
illustration fig 38
illustration fig 39 a
fig 40 is designed upon the barest suggestion of natural foliage the
wavy stem being quite flat and running out flush into the flat margins
at the sides connecting them together the leaves in this case should
be carved leaving the veins standing solid grooved veins would have a
meager look upon such rudimentary leaves of course a more natural
treatment may be given to this kind of design but in that case it would
require to be carried all over the door and replace the formally
ornamental center panel the pierced pattern in cresting should be done
as already described for fig 24
illustration fig 39 b
illustration fig 40
illustration fig 41
fig 41 is a variant on the last design in this case a little more play
of surface is attempted making a point of carving the side lobes of
the leaves into little rounded masses which will reflect points of
light this is shown better on fig 42
illustration fig 42
illustration fig 43
in carving foliage like that of the vine where small dark holes or eyes
occur enough wood should be left round them to form deep dark little
pits they are very valuable as points of shadow in doing this cut the
rim all round with a very slight bevel as in section fig 43 whenever
leaves run out to a fine edge they also should have a small bevel like
this in order to avoid an appearance of weakness which acute edges
always present as a general rule leave as much wood as possible about
the edges of leaves as you want shadow from themdipping them only
where you are sure the variety will be effective in the execution of
bunches of rounded forms like grapes there is no special mechanical
expedient for doing them quickly and easily each must be cut out
separately and carved with whatever tools come handiest to their shape
and size it is a good way to begin by cutting triangular holes between
the grapes with the point of a small chisel see fig 44 after which
the rough shapes left may gradually be formed into ovals when the work
is very simple in character and does not require a realistic treatment
the grapes may be done in a more methodical way as in fig 45 first
cut grooves across both ways with a v tool dividing the grapes as at a
a then with a gouge turned hollow down round each line of grapes into
rolls as at b b do this both ways and afterward finish the form as
best you can

the sketchbook
     old work best seen in its original placemuseums to be approached
     with cautionmethodical memorandasome examplesassimilation of
     ideas better than making exact copies
in holiday time and as other opportunity arises be sure to visit some
old building be it church or mansion in this way you will make
acquaintance with many a fine specimen of old work which will set your
fancy moving in the one there may be a carved choirscreen or bench
ends in the other a fireplace or table the first sight of such things
in the places and among the surroundings for which they were designed
is always an eventful moment in the training of a carver because the
element of surprise acts like a tonic to the mind by arousing its
emulative instincts it is by seeing such things in their proper home
and associations that the best lessons are learned one sees in that
way for instance why the tool marks left by the old carvers on their
work look more effective than smoothly perfect surfaces when associated
with the rough timbers of the roof or the uneven surface of the
plastered wall one sees too the effect of time and friction in the
polished surfaces of bench ends rubbed and dusted by countless hands
until they have become smooth to the eye and touch and a mental note is
made to avoid sharp or spiky work in anything that is likely to be
within reach of the fingers in this way a certain balance is given to
the judgment in proportioning to each piece of work its due share of
labor and we come away with a fixed determination to pay more attention
in future to breadth of design and economy of actual carving a problem
which no carver finds easy but which must be faced if wasted work is
not to be his only reward

in museums too we shall find many useful lessons although there we
see things huddled together in a distracting fashion which demands great
wariness of selection the great point to be observed in making our
notes for future reference is that each sketch should contain some
memorandum of a special quality the one which attracted us at the time
of making it one may be made for sake of a general arrangement another
to remind us of some striking piece of detail or peculiarity of
execution the drawings need not be elaborate or labored provided they
make clear the points they were intended to record thus fig 46 is a
sketch which is meant as a memorandum of a lively representation of
birds taken from an old miserere seat fig 47 was done for sake of the
rich effect of an inscription on the plain side of a beam and also for
the peculiar and interesting section to which the beam had been cut
fig 48 again for sake of the arrangement of the little panels on a
plain surface and the sense of fitness and proportion which prompted
the carver to dispose his work in that fashion by which he has enriched
the whole surface at little cost of labor and by contrast enhanced the
value of the little strips and diamonds of carved work otherwise of no
particular interest figs 49 and 50 are two sketches of icelandic
carved boxes fig 49 was drawn as an example of the rich effect which
that kind of engraved work may have and of the use which it makes of
closely packed letters in the inscription the pattern is of course a
traditional norse one although the carving is comparatively modern the
points to be noted in the other box were its quaint and simple
construction the use of the letters as decoration more especially the
unpremeditated manner in which they have been grouped the four letters
below making a short line which is eked out by a rude bit of ornament
the letters are cut right through the wood and are surrounded with an
engraved line fig 51 was noted on account of the way in which a very
simple pierced ornament is made much of by repetition the ornament is
on a portuguese bed and this is only a detail of a small portion the
effect greatly depends upon the quantity but in this case that is a
point which is easily remembered without drawing more of it than is
shown the fact that this work is associated with richly turned
balusters is however noticed in the sketch as that might easily be
forgotten figs 47 to 51 are from south kensington museum

then we come to the sketch of a chair fig 52 or combined table and
chair the richly carved back is pivoted and forms the table top when
lowered over the arms upon which it rests the points to be noted in
this are the general richness of effect the contrast of wavy and rigid
lines and the happy way in which the architectural suggestion of arch
and pillars has been translated into ornament as this sketch was not
made so much for the chair itself as for its enriched back no
measurements have been taken otherwise chairs as such depend very
much upon exact dimensions for their proportions this chair is at
exning in suffolk
illustration fig 52
now we shall suppose that you are going to make many such sketches
both in museums and in country churches or houses you will find some
too elaborate for drawings in the time at your disposal in which case
you should obtain a photograph if possible making notes of any detail
which you wish particularly to remembersuch for instance as the
carved chest shown in plate i the subject st george and the dragon
is given with various incidents all in the one picture this is a
valuable and suggestive piece of work to have before you as the manner
in which the pictorial element has been managed is strikingly
characteristic of the carvers methods and well adapted to the
conditions of a technique which has no other legitimate means of dealing
with distant objects the king and queen looking out of the palace
windows are almost on the same scale as the figures in the
foreground the walls of the houses roofs etc have apparently quite
as much projection as the foreground rocksdistance is inferred rather
than expressed the very simple construction too is worth noting it
is practically composed of three boards a wide one for the picture and
two narrower ones for ends and feet
the object in making these sketches should be mainly to collect a
variety of ideas which may brighten the mind when there is occasion to
use its inventive faculties suggestive hints are wanted rarely will it
be possible or wise to repeat anything exactly as you see it these
sketches if made with care and from what constable used to call
breeding subjects will give your fancy a very necessary point of
vantage from which it may hazard flights of its own
as much of our knowledge must necessarily be gained from museums and as
they now form such an important feature of educational machinery i
think it will be well to devote a word or two of special notice to the
drawbacks which accompany their many advantages this i propose to do in
the following chapter
chapter xvi
museums
     false impressions fostered by fragmentary exhibitsenvironment as
     important as handicraftworks viewed as records of
     charactercarvers the historians of their time
a new world of commerce and machinery having slain and forgotten a past
race of artist craftsmen makes clumsy atonement by sweeping together
the fragments of their work and calling the collection a museum from
the four corners of the earth these relics have been gathered our
hungry minds are bidden to make choice according to fancy for here is
variety of food here are opportunities never before enjoyed by mortal
for an intellectual feastand of a kind which might be considered
godlike were it not for the suspicion of some gigantic joke that out
of all this huge mass of chaotic material we have not as yet been able
to make for ourselves some living form of art must indeed be to the
gods a continual subject of merriment
museums of art are in no respect the unmixed blessings which they appear
to be they have to be sure all the advantages of handy reference
but at the same time on account of the great diversity in the character
of their exhibits they tend to encourage the spread of a patchy kind of
knowledge far from being helpful to the arts in the interests of which
they are established it must be remembered that in these collections
all specimens of architecture and architectural carving are invariably
seen in false positions all have been wrenched from their proper
settings and placed more or less at random in lights and
relationships never contemplated by their designers to the environment
of a piece of architecture and the position and surroundings of carved
decorations are due quite half of their interest as works of art
deprive them of these associations and little is left but fragmentary
specimens of handicraft more or less unintelligible in their lonely
detachment misleading to the eye and dangerous as objects of
imitation in proportion to the dependence they once had upon those
absent and unknown associations
the educational purpose which these collections are intended to serve is
liable to be construed into an unreasoning assumption that every
specimen exhibited is equally worthy of admiration how often the
plodding student is to be seen carefully drawing and measuring work of
the dullest imaginable quality with no other apparent reason for his
pathetically wasted industry
it would be strange indeed if all in this vast record of past activity
was of equal value if merely to belong to the past was a sure warrant
that such work was the best of its kind far from this being the case
it requires the constant use of a more or less trained and critical
judgment to separate what is good from the indifferent or really bad in
these collections for all are usually present there is inequality in
artistic powers in technical skill and a distinction of yet greater
importance which lies in the significance the works bear as records of
the inner life of their creators artists carvers in particular are
the true scribes and historians of their times their works are as it
were bookswritten in words of unconscious but fateful meaning some
are filled with the noblest ideals expressed in beautiful and serious
language while others contain nothing but sorry jests and stupidities
as all the works of the past whether good or bad are the achievements
of men differing but little from ourselves save in the direction of
their energies and in their outward surroundings there is surely some
clue to the secret of their success or failure some light to be thrown
by their experience upon our own dubious and questioning spirit
what better could we look for in this respect than a little knowledge of
the lives led by the carvers themselves a mental picture of their
environment an acquired sense of the influence which this that or the
other set of conditions must have imposed upon their work with a little
aid from history in forming our judgments their works themselves will
assist usso faithful is the transcript of their witnessfor with
more certainty than applies to handwriting a fair guess may be made by
inference from the work itself as to the general status and ideals of
the workman the striking analogy between its salient characteristics
and the prevailing mood of that everchanging spirit which seeks
expression in the arts is nowhere more marked than in the work of the
carver

studies from naturefoliage
     medieval and modern choice of form compareda compromise
     adopteda list of plant forms of adaptable character
it is high time now that we had some talk about the studies from nature
which are to furnish you with subjects for your work i shall at present
deal only with studies of foliage as that is what you have been
practising and i wish you to carry on your work and studies as much as
possible on the same lines
between the few abstract forms representing a general type of foliage
so dear to the heart of the medieval carver and the unstinted variety
of choice displayed in the works of grinling gibbons and his time there
is such a wide difference that surely it points to a corresponding
disparity of aim although there is no doubt whatever that such a
striking change of views must have had its origin in some deeper cause
than that which is to be explained by artistic and technical
development yet i think that for our immediate purpose we shall find a
sufficiently good lesson in comparing the visible results of the two
methods broadly speaking then the medieval carver cared more for
general effect than for possibilities of technique he therefore chose
only such natural forms as were amenable to his preconceived
determination to make his work telling at a distance he had no
botanical leanings and rejected as unfit every form which would not
bend to his one purposethat of decoration on a large scaleand which
he aimed at making comprehensive at a glance rather than calling for
attention to its details he invented patterns which he knew would
assist in producing this result and here he further handicapped his
choice by limiting it to such forms as would repeat or vanish at
regulated intervals reflecting light or producing shadow just where it
was wanted to emphasize his pattern
the more modern carver on the contrary offered an allembracing
welcome to every form which presented itself to his notice he rejected
nothing which could by any possibility be carved nothing was too small
too thin or too difficult for his wonderful dexterity with the carving
tools his chief end was elaboration of detail and it was often
carried to a point which ignored the fact that nearly all of it would
become invisible when in position or if seen at all would only appear
in confused lumps and unintelligible masses
now for many reasons i think we had better take the medieval method as
our model up to a point and make a certain selection of material for
our studies based upon some relation to general effect but not
necessarily imitating a medieval austerity of rejection which would be
the merest affectation on our part upon these principles and taking
somewhat of a middle course i shall here note a few types of foliage
which i think may be useful to you in the work upon which you are
engaged
leaf forms with their appropriate flowers or fruit afford the carver a
very large proportion of his subject material they serve him as
principal subject as bordering or background to figures of men or
animals they occur as mere detached spots to break the monotony of
spaces or lines and in a thousand other ways give exercise to his
invention
as a general rule those leaves with serrated or deeply cleft and
indented edges lend themselves most readily to decorative treatment
large broad leaves with unbroken surfaces and triangular or rounded
outlines are less manageable those most commonly taken as models are
the vine with its grapesthis was freely used by medieval carvers
at first for its symbolic significance but afterward even more on
account of its rare beauty of form the play of light and shade on its
vigorous foliage the variety of its drawing in leaf vine and tendril
and the contrast afforded by its bunches of oval fruit caused it to be
accepted as a favorite subject for imitation in all kinds of carving it
lends itself kindly to all sorts of relief either high or low in
almost any material it is so recognizable even in the rudest attempts
at imitation that its popularity is well deserved
the hopvine shares some of these qualities though much less strongly
marked in character
the acanthusthis leaf was first adapted for the purpose of ornament
by the workmen of classical greece the inspiration was one of the few
which they took directly from natures models it was also freely used
by medieval carvers but with an insistence upon the flowing and
rounded character of its surface forms and again by the renaissance
artists with a return to its classical character of fluted and formal
strength of line the graceful drawing of its elaborately articulated
surface and the extraordinary accentuation of its outline provide an
endless source of suggestion it has been adapted in all manners
according to the fancy of the carversometimes long and drawn out at
others wide and spreading altogether it has been more thoroughly
generalized than any other natural form
the oak with its acorns appears in early medieval work but without
much attempt to represent its form with anything like individual
character in later work it has more justice done to its undoubted
merits as a decorative feature by a clearer recognition of its beauty in
clumps and masses fruit other than the grape and a nondescript kind of
berry was seldom represented by medieval craftsmen it formed however
a marked feature in renaissance ornament where pomegranate apple fig
and melon were in constant requisition
flowers in general were very little used in early times and then only
in a highly abstract form corresponding to that of the foliage the rose
and lily were the two most frequently seen but they seldom had more
individuality about them than was sufficient to make them recognizable
during the renaissance flowers were treated with much more regard to
their inherent beauties and were represented with great skill and power
of imitation although often carried beyond legitimate limits in this
direction when dealt with as ornaments rather than botanical details
they form a rich source of suggestion to the carver and offer a ready
means of contrast with masses of foliage the rose and lily are such
conspicuous flowers that they should in modern times be used in a way
consistent with our demands for individual character and likeness they
should be fairly well defined and easily recognizable it is quite
possible to treat these flowers in a very realistic way without
endangering their effect as decorative details they have both such
distinguished forms in flower and foliage
flowers should be chosen for their forms color should not be allowed
to deceive the eye in this respect unless the color itself is
suggestive of lines and contours
foliage should always be studied at its prime never when it is dried
and contorted in its forms
here is a short list of subjects including those i have mentioned all
having a sufficiently pronounced character to make them valuable as
stock in trade many more might be named but these are chosen as being
commonly familiar and as being representative types of various forms
for their leaves and fruitthe grapevine hopvine globe artichoke
tomato apple plum pear bramble and strawberry
for fruit and vinelike growths leafage too massive and smooth to be
of much value without adaptationthe melon vegetablemarrow
pumpkins and cucumber
for leafage flowers or seed vesselsthe acanthus oak thistles
teazle giant hemlock cowparsley buttercup
of garden flowersthe rose lily larkspur peony poppies
columbine chrysanthemum tulip christmas rose japanese anemone
for close and intricate designsperiwinkle winter aconite
trefoils of various kinds
many valuable hints on this subject may be gleaned by a study of
gerrards herbal which is full of welldrawn illustrations done in a
way which is very suggestive to the designer
a careful study of the outline forms of leaves is a schooling in itself
so much may be learned from it it teaches the relation between form and
growth in a way which makes it possible to use the greatest freedom of
generalization without violating structural laws the same causes which
govern the shaping of a tree are present in the leaf settling its final
outline so that however wandering and fantastic it may appear there
is not the smallest curve or serration which does not bear witness to a
methodical development and to every accidental circumstance which
helped or hindered its fulfilment
you could not do better than make a collection of suitable leaves press
them flat and trace them very carefully keeping the tracings together
in a book for reference accompanying this you should have in each case
a drawing of the leaf as it appears in its natural state always being
careful to do this from a point of view which will accommodate itself to
carving the leaf if you should have occasion to use it

carving on furniture
     furniture constructed with a view to carvingreciprocal aims of
     joiner and carversmoothness desirable where carving is
     handledthe introduction of animals or figures
illustration fig 53
you will find in the illustrations figs 53 to 62 certain suggestions
for various pieces of furniture they are given with the intention of
impressing upon you the fact that very little carving can be done at all
without some practical motive as a backbone to your fancies to be
always carving inapplicable panels is very dull work and only good for
a few preliminary exercises it is much better to consider the matter
well and resolve upon some opus which will spread your efforts over
a considerable period when you have decided upon the piece of furniture
which is most likely to be useful to you and which lies within your
powers of design and execution then make a drawing for it and have it
made by a joiner unless you can make it entirely yourself to be put
together in loose pieces for convenience of carving and glued up when
that is finished you should certainly design the piece yourself as you
should make all your own designs for the carving the two departments
must be carried on in the closest relation to each other while the work
is in progress otherwise their association will not be complete when it
is finished take for instance the head of the bed in the
illustration why should it stand up so high like the gable of a house
it is for no other reason than to give an opportunity for carving a
plain board of half the height would have been just as effective as a
protection to the sleeper useless as carving may be from this practical
point of view it must nevertheless be amenable to utilitarian laws it
must be smooth where it is likely to be handled as in the case of the
knobs on top of the posts and even where it is not likely to be
handled but may be merely touched occasionally it should still have an
inviting smoothness of surface as a matter of fact all carving on a
bed should be of this kind with no deep nooks or corners to hold dust
here then are a number of conditions which instead of being a
hindrance are really useful incentives to fresh invention just as the
construction of joiners work entails concessions on the part of the
carver so the carver may ask the joiner to go a little out of his way
in order to give opportunities for his carving a little knowledge of
this subject will make a reasonable compromise possible
you will find a further advantage in undertaking a fairly large piece of
work as it is almost certain to be in several parts each may thus
receive a different treatment by which means you not only obtain
contrast but get some idea of the extraordinary power with which one
piece of carving affects another when placed in juxtaposition whatever
designs you may decide upon should you undertake to carve the panels
for a bed let them be in decidedly low relief the surface must be
smoothly wrought doing away with as much of the tool marking as you
can but this smoothing to be done entirely with the tools not by any
means with glass paper great attention must be paid to the drawing of
the forms as it is by this that the impression of modeling and
projection will be expressed a very pleasant treatment of such low
relief when a smooth and even appearance is wanted is to carve the
ground to the full depth say 18 in only along the outlines of the
design and form the remainder into a kind of raised cushion almost
level in the middle with the original surface of the wood the whole
design need thus be little more than a kind of deepish engraving
depending for its effect upon broad lights defined by the engraved
shadows see fig 54 for an example of this treatment applied to
letters
illustration fig 54
now i expect you to make a fresh design the illustrations in all such
cases are purposely drawn in a somewhat indefinite way in order that
they may suggest without making it possible to copy
illustration fig 55
now we come to the mirror frame fig 55 i should suggest that this be
done in some lightcolored wood like peartree which has an agreeably
warm tone or if a hard piece of cedar can be found it would look well
but in no case should polish be added except that which comes from the
tool the construction need not be complicated take two 34in boards
glue them together to form the width shape out the frame in the rough
put behind this another frame of 34in thick stuff and make the
cornice out of wood about 112 in thick the parts to be kept separate
until the carving is finished and afterward glued or screwed together
the carving on the body of the frame that is in the gable above and
the front of bracket below should be in very low relief the lower
part being like the last a kind of engraving the fret above may be
sunk about 116 in and the ground slightly cushioned the carving on
sides and cornice is of a stronger character and may be cut as deeply
as the wood will allow while the cornice is actually pierced through in
places showing the flat board behind the design for this cornice
should have some repeating object such as the kind of pineapplelooking
thing in the illustration and its foliage should be formed with plenty
of wellrounded surfaces that may suggest some rather fat and juicy
plant
illustration fig 56
in fig 56 you have a suggestion for carving a bench or settle the
proportions of which have been taken from one found at a yorkshire
village inn the actual measurements are given in order that these
proportions may be followed it is a wellknown fact that chairs or
seats of any kind can not be successfully designed on paper with any
hope of meeting the essential requirements of comfort lightness and
stability making seats is a practical art and the development of the
design is a matter of many years of successive improvements a good
model should therefore be selected and copied with such slight
changes as are necessary where carving is to be introduced the main
lines should not be interfered with on any account nor should the
thickness of the wood be altered if possible the carving on this settle
is intended to be in separate panels about two inches apart these
panels will look all the better if no two are quite alike a good way to
give them more variety will be to make every alternate one of some kind
of open pattern like a fret these piercings need not extend all over
the design in the panel in every case some may have only a few shapely
holes mixed up with the lines others again may be formed into complete
frets with as much open as solid see fig 57
the carving should be shallow and not too fine in detail as it will
get a great deal of rubbing the material should be if possible oak
but beech may be used with very good effectin neither case should it
be stained or polished
illustration fig 57
fig 58 is a clock case something of this kind would make an excellent
opus such as i have alluded to and give plenty of scope for
invention as clocks of this kind are generally hung on a wall the
brackets from a practical point of view are of course unnecessary but
as it is important that they should look as if they were supported and
to satisfy the eye something in the way of a bracket or brackets is
generally added a bracket like the one in the illustration not being a
real support constructively speaking but only put there to give
assurance that such has not been overlooked or neglected becomes a kind
of toy and may be treated as such by adding some little fancy to make
it amusing and give an excuse for making a feature of it this will be
a good place to try your hand at some modest attempt at figure work in
designing your bracket should you wish to introduce a little figure of
man or beast i think you will find it more satisfactory if the figure
is separated from the structural part by a slight suggestion of solid
surroundings of its own thus the little roof over and the solid bit of
wood under the figure in the illustration serve this purpose lending
an appearance of steadiness which would be wanting in a bracket formed
of a detached figure at any rate never make your figures whether of
man or beast seem to carry the clock you may hunch them up into any
shape you like but no weight should be supposed to rest upon them
illustration fig 58
for sake of the carving oak will be the best wood to employ in making
this clock or one like it but italian walnut will do equally well the
size should be fairly large say about three feet over all in height
this will give a face of about ten inches in diameter which face will
look best if made of copper gilt and not much of it perhaps a mere
ring with the figures either raised or cut out leaving nothing but
themselves and two rings surrounding this should project from the wood
leaving a space of about one inch
illustration fig 59
if you are inclined to try a heavier piece of work the bench or
settleend in fig 59 may give you a suggestion in this there is a bird
introduced in the shape of a cock roosting on the branch of a tree it
would require to be done in a thick piece of wood say 3 ins thick and
would be best in english oak the idea will be to cut away the wood
from the outer lower portion leaving only about 114 or 112 in
thickness but at the top retaining the full thickness in which the
bird must be carved the outer edges being kept full thickness in order
to give the structural form and enclose the carving the inside of this
upper part toward the seat should also be carved but with a smooth
and shallow pattern of some kind as both may be seen together and in
contrast to each other
illustration fig 60
the introduction of figures leads me to a subject which it will be
better to discuss in the next chapter ie the question as to how far
it is possible or consistent with present conditions to attempt
anything that may bear the character of humor but in the meantime here
are three more subjects upon which fancy and ingenuity may be expended
with profit in fig 60 you have a heraldic subject in all such cases
the heraldry should be true and not of the bogus kind this shield
represents a real coat of arms and was done from a design by philip
webb being finally covered with gesso silvered and painted in
transparent colors
figs 61 and 62 are suggestions for wooden crosses oak being the best
material to use for such a purpose the carving should be so arranged as
to form some kind of pattern on the cross in fig 62 the black trefoils
are supposed to be cut right through the thin pieces of wood forming the
center portion and the carving on that part is very shallow

chapter xix
the grotesque in carving
     misproportion not essential to the expression of humorthe sham
     grotesque contemptiblea true sense of humor helpful to the
     carver
the dullness which comes of all work and no play may be said to affect
the carver at times he tires of carving leaves and ornaments what more
natural than to seek change and amusement in the invention of droll
figures of men or animals the enjoyment which we all feel in
contemplating the outcome of this spirit in ancient work leads us to
the imitation of both subject and manner hoping thereby that the same
results may be obtained but somehow the repetition is seldom attended
with much success while of original fancies of the same sort we are
obliged to confess ourselves almost destitute who can behold the
fantastic humors of gothic carvings without being both amused and
interested those grotesque heads with gaping mouths recall the stories
of childhood peopled with goblins and gnomes it is all so natural and
so much in keeping with the architecture which surrounds it the carving
is so rude and simple that it seems absurd when some authority on such
matters makes a statement to the effect that all such expression of
humor has become forever impossible to ourselves
this important part of the question must be left to your own meditation
to settle according to your lights experience will probably lead you
ultimately to the same opinion meantime the point i wish to impress
upon you is this that until you feel yourself secure and something of
a master of various branches of your craft you should not attempt any
subject which aims at being decidedly grotesque there are very good and
practical reasons for this one is that while you are studying your
art you must do nothing that may tend to obscure what faculties you
have for judging proportion now as all grotesque work is based more or
less on exaggeration it forms a very dangerous kind of exercise to the
beginner therefore i should never allow a pupil of mine to so much as
attempt it do not think that i wish to discourage every effort which
has not an ultraserious aim on the contrary i am but taking a rather
roundabout way to an admission that the humorous element has and must
have at all times a powerful attraction for the woodcarver and to the
statement of an opinion that it should not be allowed to take a
prominent place in the work of a student moreover that it is quite
possible to find in nature a varied and unfailing source of suggestion
in this respect more in fact than we are ever likely to account for
and which requires no artificial exaggeration to aid its expression
some tincture of the faculty is absolutely necessary to the carver who
takes his subjects from birds or beasts in order that he may perceive
and seize the salient lines and characteristic forms of which the
keynote is often to be found in a faint touch of humor and which like
the scent of a flower adds charm by appealing to another sense
the same argument applies to the treatment of the human figure let no
student and i may include also mastercarver think that a grotesque
treatment will raise the smile or excite the interest which is
anticipated the grotesque is a vehicle for grim and often terrible
ideas lightly veiled by a cloak of humorous exaggeration a sort of
viking horseplayit is in fact a language which expresses the mixed
feelings of sportive contempt and real fear in about equal proportions
when these feelings are not behind the expression it becomes a language
which is in itself only contemptible
illustration fig 63
if carried away by fancy you must find vent for its impulses and
carve images of unearthly beings at least make them cheerful looking
one can imagine such demons and goblins as being rather nice fellows
than otherwise a grim jest that fails is generally a foolish oneat
least its perpetrator neither deserves nor receives sympathy for his
discomfiture now i shall show you one or two examples which may make
this matter a little clearer to you if you are at all inclined to argue
the position i think at any rate they will prove that the expression
of humor does not always depend upon exaggeration and may exist in a
work which is one may say almost copied from nature fig 63 is an
example to this effect the little jester just emerging from a flower
one of the sidepieces to a miserere seat carving is undoubtedly a true
portrait carved without the slightest attempt at exaggeration the
quiet humor which it evinces required only sympathy to perceive and
skill to portray on the part of its carver he had nothing to invent in
the common acceptation of the word the carving of the mendicant which
comes on the other side is equally vivid in its truth to nature it is
so lifelike that we do not notice the humorous enjoyment of the artist
in depicting the whining lips and closed eyes of the professional
beggar observe the good manners of it allthe natural refinement of
the artist who leaves his characters to make all the fun without
intrusion from himself other than to give the aid of his skill in
representation now subjects of this class will in all probability
present themselves until the end of the world but artists like this
gothic one are not so likely to be common great technical skill a
large fund of vitality and many other controlling qualities are
necessary to the production of such an artist but he gives a clue to
the right action which we may with safety accept even if we can not
hope to equal his performance
illustration fig 64
illustration fig 65
the centerpiece fig 64 tells a little story of samson it is
noticeable in these medieval picture subjects how when a story has to
be told the details are treated in a broad and distinct fashion as if
the story could take care of itself and only required to be stated
clearly as to facts the detached ornamental parts on the contrary
receive a degree of careful attention not given to the picture
seemingly with the object of making their loneliness attractive
the broadhumor characteristic of the companion picture of medieval
life in the little domestic scene fig 65 is equally free from forced
exaggeration or intentional misproportion scale and anatomy to be
sure have had little consideration from the carver but we readily
forgive the inaccuracies in this respect on account of his quick wit in
devising means to an end
before we leave this subject look at plate ii in which you will see a
curious use of misproportionintentional too in this caseand used
for quite other than humorous purposes this is a little ornamental
figure from the tomb of henry iv in canterbury cathedral you will see
that the body is out of all proportion too small for the head which
surmounts it or too big for the feet upon which it stands now what
could have induced the carver to treat a dainty little lady thus it
certainly was not that he considered it an improvement upon nature nor
was it a joke on his part it could only be done for some practical
reason such as this that the little figure does part duty as a bracket
hence more appearance of solidity is required at the top and less at
the foot than true proportions would admit it is all done so
unostentatiously that one might look for hours at the figure without
noticing the license not that i should advise you to imitate this
naive way out of a difficulty the childlike simplicity of its treatment
succeeds where conscious effort would only end in affectation
illustration fig 66
illustration fig 67
in fig 66 you will see another little figure doing duty in connection
with a stall division in the lady chapel at winchester cathedral its
smooth roundness of form is very appropriate to the position it
occupies while its polished surface bears ample testimony that it has
given no offense to the touch of the many hands which have rested upon
it
fig 67 shows another example of the same sort but perched on a lower
part of the division this one is from the cathedral at berne each
division of the stalls having a different figure of which this is a
type

nothing enlivens or gives more variety of interest to woodcarving than
the introduction of animal forms they make agreeable haltingplaces on
which the eye may rest with pleasure they are in general both
beautiful in their shapes and associated with ideas which appeal
strongly to the imagination thus affording in masses of abstract
ornament the pleasantest kind of relief by adding to it points of
definite lineament and meaning
to carve animals as they ought to be carved one must have something
more than a passing interest in their forms there must be included also
an understanding of their natures and some acquaintance with their
habits a cattledrover is likely to know the salient points of a
bullock a horsebreeder all those connected with a horse and so on we
students however not having the advantage of such accurate and
personal knowledge must make shift in the best way we can to discover
and note the points so familiar to trained eyes to see animals in this
way and with knowledge of their forms and habits treat their
sculptured images according to the laws of our craft is no light task
if choice were to be made between a rude manner of carvingbut which
familiarity with the subject invested with lively recognition of
characterand a more cultured and elaborate but lifeless study in
natural history there should be no hesitation in making choice of the
former method because animal forms without some indication of
vitality are the dullest of all dull ornaments
it is quite impossible to describe in words the kind of action which
is most appropriate to sculpture it being much more a question of
treatment and the guiding spirit of the moment than a subject which
can be formulated as a broad and general principle which may be taken
for guidance you will always find yourself on surer ground in the
attempt to indicate the capacity for energy and the suggestion of
movement than you will if your aim is the extremity of action in any
direction you may with some justice point to the illustration given
in fig 65 and which appears to contradict this statement as being an
example in which violent action is the keynote you must notice
however that the two figures although struggling are for the moment
still or may be supposed so there is enough suggestion of this
pause to excuse the attitudes and save the composition from
restlessnesseven the raised hands may be supposed to remain in the
same position for a second or two this imaginary pause however
infinitesimal is essential to the dignity of the sculptors art as
nothing is more irritating to the mind than being forced to recognize
the contradiction between a motionless image and its suggestion of
restless action it is necessary to observe the same rule in the
expression of actual repose as some clue must be given some completed
action be suggested in order to distinguish dormant energy from
downright inertia i should like to impress upon you the importance of
making a special study of the characteristic movements of animals you
will in time become so far familiar with them that certain standards of
comparison and contrast will be established in your mind as aids to
memory thus you will be all the better able to carve with significance
the measured and stately action of a horse if you have in your minds
eye at the same time a picture of the more cumbrous and slower movements
of a cow and you will be helped in the same way when you are carving a
dog by remembering that the movements of a cat afford a striking
contrast in being stealthy where the other is nervous and quick
for the unfortunate townbred student or artist who has had few
opportunities to study birds and beasts familiar to the country
schoolboy there is no other way but to make the best of stuffed birds
photographs etc much may be done with these aids if a little personal
acquaintance with their habits and associations is added like salt to
keep the secondhand knowledge sweet and wholesome
in the absence of opportunity for study from the life no pictures of
animals can compare in their usefulness to the carver with those by
bewick they are so completely developed in essential details so full
of character and expressive of life that even when personal
acquaintance has been made with their various qualities a glance at one
of his engravings of birds or beasts conveys new meaning either of
gesture or attitude to what we have previously learned every student
who wishes to make a lively representation in carving of familiar beast
or bird should study bewicks engravings of quadrupeds and birds
drawings made for the purpose of study need not be elaborate indeed
such drawings are only embarrassing to work from the most practical
plan is to make a drawing in which the main masses are given correctly
and in about the same relative position that they will occupy in the
carving i give you in plate vii an example of this in a drawing made by
philip webb who by the study of a lifetime has amassed a valuable
store of knowledge concerning animals and acquired that extraordinary
skill in their delineation and the expression of character which is only
to be attained by close observation and great sympathy with the subject
the drawing in question was made for myself at the time i was carving a
lion for the cover of a book given in plate viii it was made in his
goodnatured way to help a lame dog over a stile as i had got into
difficulties with the form this drawing is all that a carvers first
diagram should be and gives what is always the first necessity in such
preliminary outlinesthat is the right relationship of the main
masses and the merest hint of what is to come in the way of detail all
of which must be studied separately but which would be entirely
useless if a wrong start had been made in fig 68 i give you tracings
from some notes i made myself while carving the sheep in plates v and
vi the object was to gain some definite knowledge of form by noting the
relation of planes sections of parts projections etc etc the
section lines and sidenotes are the most valuable part of the
memoranda in the same manner the illustration fig 69 shows diagrams
made from a heron giving section lines of beak etc
the sidenotes about the colors are valuable as although not
translatable into carving they do to some extent influence the manner
of interpreting forms
photographs must not be despised but they are only of use if read by
the light of previous knowledge for this reason you can not make too
many notes of sectional structure through heads necks and legs which
will help to explain the mystery common to all photographs
the bear shown in the frontispiece is traced from a photographic
illustration which appeared in the westminster budget some time ago by
the merest accident it is suggestive of a subject almost ready for the
carvers hand

until tourists began to explore the beauties of switzerland there were
no better carvers of animals than the serious but genial craftsmen of
that noble country more especially of such animals as were familiar to
their eyes this preeminence shows distinct signs of soon becoming a
thing of the past in the endeavors to meet the demands created by
thoughtless visitors still it is possible to obtain a little of the
traditional work uninfluenced by that fatal impetus originating in
modern commerce a piece of this kind is shown in fig 70 bought by a
friend only a year or two ago in the grindelwald and which although
forming part of the usual stock of such things made for tourist
consumption was picked out with judicious discrimination from a number
of stupid and trivial objects which displayed neither interest of design
nor other than mechanical skill of carving this little bear a few
inches in size is carved in a way which shows long experience of the
subject and great familiarity with the animals ways the tooling of
the hair is done with the most extraordinary skill and without the
waste of a single touch now a word or two more on studies from the
life before we leave this subject i have given you examples of
diagrams made for this purpose but much may be done without any
drawings further than a preliminary map of the general masses in the
case of such an animal as the horse which can be seen in every street
i have myself found it useful to follow them in my walks taking mental
note of such details as i happened to be engaged upon such as its legs
and joints its head or neck another day i would confine my attention
to eyes ears mane etc always with reference to the work
immediately in hand as that is the time to get the best results from
life study because the difficulties have presented themselves and one
knows exactly what to look for five minutes spent thus after the work
has been started provided the start has been right and involves no
mistake in the general masses is more valuable than hours of labor in
making preliminary drawings
illustration fig 70
the use of experimental models in clay or wax has of course its
advantages but it will be well to know just how far such an aid is
valuable and at what point its use becomes hurtful to ones work it is
a common practise in large carving shops for one man to design the
figure or animal subjects in clay while another carves them in stone or
wood now apart from the difference in material and the unnatural
division of labor which we have discussed before it is beyond
question that a model of this kind has even a more paralyzing effect on
the actual carver than a drawing would have of course the work is more
certain to reach a recognized standard and the risk of total failure is
reduced to a minimum but there is literally nothing left for the
carver to invent who if he is a man with a turn for that kind of
thing and of a nervous temperament must suffer untold irritation in
its execution the good and bad results of the use of a modeled pattern
attend in a modified degree even where both are done by the same hand
but for all that it is a useful and convenient way of making experiments
in doubtful passages of the work the how far a model is to be carried
must be regulated by the amount of confidence the carver has in his own
foresight but in any case it is always well to remember the difference
of treatment required in plaster clay and hard wood which lead to
such different results that often fresh difficulty arises in having to
translate the one manner into the other for the purpose of roughing out
the general scheme the clay if it must be resorted to should be used
in soft masses then a drawing in outline made from this but all
doubtful detailed work should be carved not modeled and for this
purpose the clay should be allowed to harden until it is nearly dry
the opinions of the wellknown woodcarver mr w aumonier on this
subject will be of value to you he says with regard to the best
method of going to work a fresh piece of woodcarving executed without
a model is distinctly a created work and that much good work may come
by chopping boldly at a block without any preconceived design but
designing as you go on but he thinks it is best to work from drawings
rough fullsize charcoal cartoons which give the effect wanted by
their light and shade he also says that he strongly protests against
the too frequent use of clay or plaster models because they are often
worse than useless and not infrequently absolutely immoral in their
tendency because they absorb time and money which ought more
legitimately to be spent on the carving itself
chapter xxi
foreshortening as applied to work in relief
     intelligible background outline better than confused
     foreshorteningsuperposition of masses
i have spoken of the necessity for careful balance between the outlines
of subject and background that both should be agreeable in shape this
becomes complicated and more difficult to arrange when we admit into our
design anything resembling what painters call foreshortening and the
awkwardness is felt even in the placing of such a small thing as an
appleleaf which may be treated in such a way that the intention of the
drawing is entirely lost in the confusion which arises between the
inferred and the actual projection
in designing such subjects it will be good to bear in mind as a guiding
principle that no matter what excuse there may be in the nature of the
inferred position of the leaf or limb the outline against the
background must be at once agreeable and explanatory
every kind of work in relief develops a species of compromise in the
expression of form lying somewhere between the representation of an
object on a perfectly flat ground as in a painting and the complete
realization of the same form copied from nature in some solid material
without any background whatever in proportion to the amount of actual
projection from the background of course the necessity diminishes for
that kind of foreshortening which is obtained by delineation it might
be inferred therefore that in very low reliefwhich is more nearly
akin to the nature of a picturemore liberty may be taken in this
direction it is not so however for where actual depth or projection
exists as in carving be it only so much as the depth of a line it
makes foreshortening wellnigh impossible except to a very limited
extent there must be of course some appearance of this quality so
a certain conventional standard has been set up beyond which one only
ventures at ones own risk thus care is taken that every object
composing the subject lies with its longest lines parallel to the
background in this way the least possible violence is done to the
imagination in completing the picture as an example no single leaf
should be represented in relief as turning or coming forward more than
it would do if plucked from the tree and laid loosely down upon a sheet
of paper a fig 71 is an outline of an appleleaf pressed out flat b
is an attempt to present it in violent foreshortening showing its back
to the spectator while its point is supposed to be buried in the
background c is the same leaf turned the other way and supposed to be
projecting forward both are exceedingly awkward and unintelligible as
mere outlines and if expressed in relief would not be any more
convincing as portraits of the thing intendedrather less so in fact
than the diagram which has no projection to interfere with the drawing
so we must turn our leaf until it presents its long side more or less to
the spectator as in d but even here part of the edge is so thin at a
that it will be better to turn it a little farther as in e showing
more of its surface as at b
illustration fig 71
again if we take as another example two apples one partly covering the
other as in a fig 72 where one apple is supposed to be behind the
other and so implies distance there is no means of expressing this
distance in carving lowering the surface of the hindmost apple would
merely throw out the balance of masses without giving a satisfactory
explanation of its position while to cut a deep groove between the two
would be an equally unsightly expedient the difficulty should whenever
it is possible be avoided by partially separating the two forms as in
b where the center of the hindmost apple clears the outline of the
other thus making it possible to get a division without awkwardness
illustration fig 72
illustration fig 73
a good expedient where leaf or scroll forms are to be carved and when
very truthful drawing is necessary to explain their convolutions is
that adopted by professor lethaby at the royal college of art it
consists in cutting the leaf out of a piece of stiffish paper and with
a knife or penhandle curling it into the required form the main lines
will thus be seen in true relation to one another and all the
distortion avoided which arises from disconnection of parts not only
that but it is a useful aid to the invention as much variety can be
hinted at by a skilful manipulation in curling its lobes fig 73 was
drawn from a paper model of this kind of course it is quite without
the necessary veins or minor articulations but is useful as a
suggestion of main lines with regard to subjects containing figures of
men or animals the same principle governs the placing of the whole body
in the first instance then of the different members so that heads
arms and legs take up a position as nearly as may be with a piece of
background all to themselves thus no two bodies should be
superimposed if it can be in any way avoided i am speaking now of
moderate and low relief although even in high relief the best masters
have always respected the principle the temptation to imitate effects
of foreshortening for its own sake is not without some excuse as it is
quite possible to make presentable pictures in this way a horse for
instance may be carved in low relief presenting either its head or
hindquarters to the spectator and yet not look absolutely absurd
again a front face may be carved in the same way notwithstanding the
difficulty presented by the projection of the nose neither of these
experiments can ever be said to prove entirely successful it is not so
much that they are either difficult or impossible as that a more
suitable method one more natural to the technique of the carver is
being neglected and its many good qualities sacrificed for sake of an
effect which can never be fully realized in sculpture to so dispose the
various masses great and small that they fall easily into groups each
having some relation to and share of the background is a true carvers
artifice a skilful use of this arrangement makes it quite unnecessary
to encroach upon the domain of another art in the imitation of an
effect which may be successfully rendered with the pencil but only so
to a very limited extent with the carving tools
you have all seen the actors when called before the curtain at the
close of the play how they pass before it one by one and perhaps
joining hands make their bows in line to all appearance on a very
narrow platform the curtain is your background while the footlights
may stand for the surface of your wood in illustration of this
principle let me call your attention to the arrangement of the animals
in plate vi where economy of space and a desire to display each detail
to advantage are the leading motives i give it as the readiest example
to hand and because it fairly illustrates the principle in question
you must excuse the apparent vanity in making choice of one of my own
works to exemplify a canon of art the sheep at the top is supposed to
be scampering over rocks the ram below may be any distance from the
sheep that you choose to imaginethe only indication of relative
position is separation by means of a ridge that may pass for a rock
the head of the ram is somewhat foreshortened but there was enough
thickness of wood contained in the big mass of the body to allow of
this being done in the smaller mass of the head without leaving too
much to be supposed the heads of the sheep in the fold have been as
closely packed as was consistent with showing as much of each as
possible as it was considered better to give the whole head and no body
than to show only a part of both most of the bodies therefore are
supposed to be hidden behind the wall only one showing in part
it is a general axiom of the craft that every mass be it body or leaf
must be made as complete in itself as the circumstances will allow but
if partly hidden the concealment should be wilful and without
ambiguity thus a dogs head may be rightly carved as being partly
hidden in a bucket but ought not to be covered by another head if it is
possible to avoid it
chapter xxii
undercutting and builtup work
     undercutting as a means and as an end its use and
     abusebuiltup workplanted workpierced work
by undercutting is meant the cutting away of the solid portions of
projections in such a manner as to make them invisible thus throwing
the carved surface work into more complete relief by detaching it from
the background this device has often been carried so far where the
projection was sufficient that entire groups of figures and foliage
have been practically detached from the background like pieces of
separate sculpture carved all round this desire for completeness of
relief was more or less a departure from the orthodox aims of the
carvers craft and led ultimately to what is known as builtup
workthat is to say work in which the projecting parts were composed
of many different pieces of wood each carved separately and afterward
glued or pinned together to form the composition many of the most
elaborate carvings by grinling gibbons are of this kind they have a
charm of their own but it is one of quite separate interest and
belongs to a category entirely removed from the art of carving objects
in a solid piece of wood apart from this distinction the difficulty of
the method requires the most accomplished mechanical skill and a highly
trained eye to either carve or compose such work in a way to command
respect i shall therefore dismiss this branch of the subject as being
outside of our present limits
undercutting on the other hand is an expedient distinctly
characteristic of solid woodcarving and some experiments ought to be
made by you in designing work in which it can be used it may be either
partial or completecomplete of course only up to a point that is to
say the connection with the background must in every case be not only
maintained but visibly demonstrated partial undercutting applies to
such portions as the sides of leaves the receding parts of heads
wings etc where the wood between the object and its background is cut
away on an inward bend either completing the projecting form as in
the case of a head or merely to hide the superfluous wood in the case
of a leaf all this presupposes a certain amount of elevation in the
relief indeed it is only in such cases that the process is necessary
or can be carried out the use of undercutting of this kind is like
every other technical process liable to abuse through too much being
made of its effects fortunately the time it consumes is a safeguard
against any tendency to run riot in this direction the point at which
it should in all cases stop and that relentlessly is where it begins
to cause a separation between any entire mass of ornament and its
background if portions are thus relieved almost to complete
detachment but visibly reconnect themselves in another place a certain
piquancy is gained which adds charm without destroying character a
curious use is made of undercutting in the bunch of leaves given in
plate xi from a miserere seat in winchester cathedral it may be said to
be completely undercut in so far that the whole bunch is hollowed out
under the surface leaving from 14 to 12 in thickness of wood in
which the leaves are carved so that you may put your finger in at one
hole and see it at the bottom of another the only end all this extra
labor seems to have attained is that of changefulness in the shadows of
the holes between the leaves in which one sees dark rims with light at
the bottom a condition which certainly adds a mysterious lightness to
the whole mass it is a very refined and appropriate use of
undercutting but would only be possible where time could be spent to
secure a variant of such epicurean delicacy as all the superfluous wood
must be taken out through the spaces between the leaves and in this
case they are not overlarge for that purpose
work which has its background entirely cut away and which is afterward
glued or planted on a fresh background to save labor can not be
called undercut this method has generally a cheap look as it is used
with the object of saving time and expense carving which is treated in
this way but instead of being planted close to the background is
fixed at a little distance from it as is the case with the lacelike
designs fitted into the hollow moldings of fifteenthcentury
choirscreens is of quite a different order although even in this
case it can not be strictly described as undercut it is more nearly
akin to pierced fretwork it has however all the general effect of
undercut work and is the only possible way of obtaining this effect in
wood where a large quantity of such ornament is required the face of
such carving is generally a little convex while the back is hollowed
out to give an equal thickness of section the ornaments in figs 75
76 and 77 are of this description and are calculated to give great
play of light and shade and be seen well at a considerable distance
undercutting in the strict and more laborious sense must be reserved for
occasions where the labor is repaid by the additional charm it must be
considered in the light of a tour de force which on account of its
cost in the matter of time should only be used under exceptional
circumstances care being taken to make it clear that it is an
exception to the general rule of solid carving on a solid background
chapter xxiii
picture subjects and perspective
     the limitations of an art not safely transgressedaerial
     perspective impossible in relieflinear perspective only possible
     in a limited way
those vague and shadowy boundaries which separate the domains of the
different arts are being perpetually called in question by what
landmarks such indefinite frontiers may be distinguished and how far
they may be extended or transgressed will always be a matter of
dispute excursions of conquest are continually being made and
conspicuous among these one which animates the hopes of many sculptors
and modelers its aim is the appropriation of those charms which are the
peculiar property of the graphic arts more especially their power of
expressing the effects of distance by means of linear and aerial
perspective
the background of a piece of carving is so obviously solid and
impenetrable that any attempt to imitate an appearance of distance is
sure to defeat its own ends the loss being greater than the gain if
there are limits to be observed in the foreshortening of a single leaf
how much more must they apply to the representation of whole landscapes
properly speaking there is no distance available in the carvers art
its whole interest lies near the surface and in the direct rays of the
light which illuminates it there is even a distinct pleasure to be
derived from the sense that it is all carved out of a block of such and
such thickness pointing to the reasonable conclusion that this
thickness should never be lost sight of the carving ever and anon
returning to the surface as a measure of music does to its keynote
this is exemplified in all the great works of antiquity among which the
parthenon frieze may be quoted as evidence on the other hand all
pictorial sculpture such as carved landscapes with figures diminishing
both in scale and projection necessarily fail to uphold this sense of
solidity as there must occur large spaces which are hollowed out far
below the surface to give another plane on which to carve the more
distant objects in low relief in the vain hope of making them appear to
recede work in which perspective of this kind is used must be viewed
as nearly as possible from the point of vision produced by its
vanishinglines this point is intelligible enough in the case of a
painting but when it comes to be carved into relief if it happens to
be seen from any other point of view it necessarily looks all wrong
because every part is thrown into false relationship
all this of course forms no argument against the use of explanatory
landscapes with trees buildings etc it only means that all such
features must be treated in a way entirely different to that adopted by
the painterthat is to say in detached groups each having some due
relation to the original surface of the wood and only very little to
their perspective positions in fig 74 are two diagrams of a landscape
composition the one is appropriate to a painted picture and the other
to carving both have pretty nearly the same number of features except
that in the carving there is no effect of distance attempted whereas
in the painting everything leads to this one particular distinction the
road goes into the picture the bridge is seen end on the house and
mill are diminished in size and the horizon is strongly enforced by a
shadow echoed in the sky the carving looks ridiculous beside the
painting but it is a severe test as it is not a subject which should
be carved at all in that condensed way

chapter xxiv
architectural carving
     the necessity for variety in studya carvers view of the study of
     architecture inseparable from a study of his own craftimportance
     of the carpenters stimulating influence upon the
     carvercarpenters imitation of stone construction carried too
     far
that the study of woodcarving should be confined to the narrow field of
its own performances would be the surest way to bring contempt upon an
art which already offers too many temptations for the easy embodiment of
puerile motives such a limited range would exclude all the stimulating
lessons to be derived from the many other kinds of carving and
sculpture forgetful that they are after all but different forms of
the same art differing only in technique and application it would take
no note of the stately sculptures of greecethe fountainhead of all
that is technically and artistically perfect in expression of formor
of the splendor of imagination displayed in the ivories of italy many
another source of inspiring impetus would be neglected including the
greatest of all the influence of architecture and through it the
dignified association or the carvers art with all that is noble in the
life of mankind
the dry and uninviting aspect which a serious study of architecture
presents to some minds is such that it is too often avoided as both
useless and wearisome much of this diffidence is due to a misconception
of the aims which should govern the student of decorative design in
making an acquaintance with its principles the study should not be
looked upon as pertaining exclusively to the functions of an architect
nor as having only an accidental connection with particular crafts it
must be remembered that in the old days mason and carpenter were both
craftsmen and architects and the sculptor and woodcarver had an equal
share in creating every feature which gives any distinction of style to
the buildings that were the outcome of their united efforts so
instead of looking upon the subject as only a study of dates for the
antiquary and rules of construction for the architect the carver
should take his own view and regard architecture for the time being as
what in some sense it really is a very large kind of carving which
includes and gives reason for his own particular branch the importance
of the subject is proved by the experience of centuries history showing
plainly how the two arts grew in strength and beauty only when closely
associated and shared each others fate in proportion to their
estrangement
in this place i can say but very little upon such a vast subject all i
can do is to call your attention to one or two examples of carved work
combined with structural carpentry in order that you may see for
yourselves what a power of effect lies in that union and how by
contrast it enhances the value and interest of both i do this in the
hope that it may possibly lead you to a more complete study of
architecture for which there is no lack of opportunity in books and
museums but more especially in what remains of the old buildings
themselves with which a familiar and personal acquaintance will be
much better than a theoretical or secondhand one
no carver with a healthy ambition can long continue to make designs and
produce them in wood without feeling intensely the want of some
architectural occasion for his efforts had he only a bargeboard to
carve or the canopy of a porch it would be such a relief to turn to
its large and general treatment after a course of the panels and
ornaments peculiar to domestic furniture look for instance at the
carved beams of the aisle roof in mildenhall church given in plate iii
and think what a fund of powerful suggestion lay in the bare timbers
before they were embellished by the carver with lion dragon and
knight even the carpenter became inspired with a desire to make
something ornamental of his own department and has shaped and carved
literally carved his timbers into graceful moldings then again in
the roof of sall church norfolk shown in plate iv you have a noble
piece of carpentry which is as much the work of an artist as the carved
figures and tracery which adorn itindeed it is all just as truly
carved work as those figures being chopped out of the solid oak with
larger tools ax and adze so that one knows not which to admire most
carved angels or carved carpentry
plates xi and xii are details of the carvings which fill the spandrels
of arch and gable in the choir stalls and screen at winchester
cathedral there are a great many of these panels similar in character
but differing in design some having figures birds or dragons worked
among the foliage they are comparatively shallow in relief and this
appears less than it really is owing to the fact that many parts of the
carving dip down almost to the background giving definite but not deep
shadows the main intention seems to have been to allow only enough
shadow to secure the pattern and then to emphasize this by means of a
multitude of little illuminated masses the leading lines run through
the pattern as continuously as possible but the surface of the leafage
is divided up into numbers of little hills and hollows the sides of
these prominences catch and reflect light more readily than they produce
shadow so that it is possible to trace the pattern at a considerable
distance by means of the lights alone unfortunately for all believers
in the historical evidence of ancient handicrafts this work was
overhauled some half century ago and in parts restored the old
work has been imitated in the new with surprising cleverness but for
that no one who has a clear sense of the true function of the carvers
art or of the historical value of its witness to past modes of life
will thank those who carried out the restoration so confusing is it
to be unable to distinguish at a glance the old from the new so
depressing to find such laborious efforts wasted in pleasing a childish
desire for uniformity of treatment when it could only be achieved at the
cost of deception and i may add so irritating to find oneself for a
moment deceived into accepting one of the restored parts as genuine
old work to add to the deception the whole of the old woodwork as
well as the new was smeared over with a black stain in order the better
to hide the difference of color in old and new wood thus forever
destroying its soft and natural color as well as the texture of its
surface so dear to the woodcarver
the fifteenth century in england was a period of great activity among
woodcarvers and many beautiful choirscreens were added about this
time to the existing churches all in the traditional gothic manner as
the renaissance influence was a full century at work in other countries
before its power began seriously to affect the national style the west
of england somerset and devon in particular is rich in the remains of
this late gothic carving some details of which are shown in the
accompanying illustrations figs 75 76 77
illustration fig 75
illustration fig 76
illustration fig 77
as a general rule the supporting carpentry of these screens bears a
strong resemblance to stonework so imitative is it in treatment that
it is only by the texture of the wood and its lightness of construction
that the distinction is made evident now a certain degree of modified
imitation where one craft models its forms of design upon those of
another using a different material as in the case of woodwork
imitations of arches tracery etc is not only legitimate but very
pleasing in its results to attain this end the carpenter need only be
true to his own idealsthere is no occasion to abandon the methods of
his own craft in order to copy the construction which is peculiar to
another the resources of carpentry offer an infinite field for the
invention of new and characteristic forms and these may be made all the
more attractive if they show to some extent the influence of an
associated craft but never fail to become wearisome if essential
character has been sacrificed for the sake of an ingenious imitation
the structural parts of some of these screens are composed of elaborate
imitations of stone vaulting and tracery so closely copied as to be
almost deceiving therefore they can not be taken as good examples of
suggestive opportunity for the woodcarver
the carved work on the other hand is marked by a strong craft
character essentially woody both in design and execution the
illustrations referred to are typical examples of this kind of work
and although the execution can not be indicated they at least give the
disposition of parts and some idea of the contrast obtained by the use
of alternate bands of ornament differing in scale or as in some cases
the agreeable monotony produced by a repetition of almost similar
designs varied slightly in execution
another prominent feature of church woodwork which developed about this
time into magnificent proportions was the font cover and canopy many
of these were however more like glorifications of the carpenters
genius for construction than examples of the carvers art as they were
composed of a multitude of tiny pinnacles and niches the carvers work
being confined to a repetition of endless crockets tracery and
separate figures or groups however in plate xiii an example is given
of what they could do when working together on a more equal footing
although much mutilated enough remains to show how the one craft gains
by being associated with the other in a wholesome spirit of rivalry
chapter xxv
surface finishtexture
     tool marks the importance of their directionthe woody texture
     dependent upon clearness of cutting and sympathetic handling
the term texture is sometimes applied to the quality of finish which
is characteristic of good carving it has a somewhat misleading sound
which seems to suggest that the final treatment of the surface is the
work of a separate operation however it is a right enough word as the
texture which woodcarvers aim at is that of the wood in which they are
carving one might naturally think that this texture must necessarily
appear when the work was finished but that is not the case as it is
only rescued by the most skilful use of the tools and easily disappears
under the mismanagement of clumsy or unsympathetic hands
texture in carving is in some respects on a parallel with tone in
paintingit depends upon a right relation of many qualities as in the
painting good tone is the outcome of the combined effects of truth in
color and a right balance of what are called the values together with
decision in the handling of the brush so in carving texture depends
upon first having a clear idea of what is being carved and making it
clear to others that if it be round hollow or flat it must be so
indeed that edges and sharpnesses be really where they were intended to
be and not lost in woolly confusion then again as with the painters
brush the tool must be moved by a hand which adapts itself to every
changing plane to all manner of curves and contours with touches
sometimes delicate and deliberate at others broad and sweeping or
even at times brought down with the weight and force of an axblow
a good quality of finish may exist in the most divergent kinds of work
each having its own characteristic texture thus a broad treatment on a
large scale will make much of the natural texture of the wood enforcing
it by crisp edges and subtle little ridges which catch the light and
recall the momentary passage of the sharp tool while elaborate work in
low relief may have a delicate texture which partly imitates that of the
details of its subject and partly displays the nature of the wood in
either case the texture must be consciously aimed at by the carver as
the last but by no means least quality which is to give vitality to the
work of his hands a sense of the capabilities of his wood in this
respect is one of the best aids to the carver as it reacts on his sense
of form and compels him to precision
manual dexterity alone may succeed in making its work clearly
intelligible but that is all and it generally leaves a surface in
which there is little indication of any feeling for the material in
which the work is carved nothing in fact that marks it specially as
carving in wood or distinguishes it from a casting in metal
the technical operation which is most immediately answerable for the
making or marring of texture is the disposition and nature of the final
tool marks these should be so managed that they help the eye to
understand the forms they should explain rather than confuse the
contours of the surface just as in a good chalk drawing the strokes and
crosshatchings are put in with method and if well done produce the
effect of something solid so in carving the tool marks should
emphasize the drawing without in any way calling attention to
themselves
it is quite impossible to explain in words that will not be open to
misconstruction the subtle commingling of qualities which make all the
difference between good and bad texture we may succeed better by
describing those conditions which are unfavorable to it thus work which
is very much cut up into minute detail and which lacks a proper
contrast of surface or for the same reason work which is too
generally bald and smooth rarely exhibit a good surface texture again
work which is overlabored or where delicate details have been attempted
on a coarsegrained wood or finally work which although done with
success in the matter of mechanical dexterity is deficient in feeling
for its woody possibilities are all likely to fail in the matter of
texture
punchmarked backgrounds have undoubtedly a legitimate place among the
expedients of the carver for obtaining contrast but on the whole as
such they are of a somewhat meretricious order and in almost every
case their use is fatal to the charm of fine texture as this always
depends on an appreciation of the homogeneous connection of carving and
background if they are used at all they should be made to form patterns
on the background and not put down promiscuously little gouge marks
are still better as they are not so mechanical
i shall conclude this part of my subject with a quotation from the words
of mr w aumonier in a lecture delivered at the royal institute of
british architects
all carving to be treated according to the position it is to occupy
not only the design but the actual carving itself should be considered
with a view to the position it is to take and the light it will receive
thus even if quite close to the eye where of course its position
warrants or demands a certain amount of finish it must be remembered
that real finish rather means perfection of form than smoothness of
surface so that even there it should still show its cuts and its tool
marks fearlessly and be deepened in parts to make it tell its proper
tale in the combined scheme of decoration while if it is going a great
height or distance from the eye it should be left as rough as ever you
can leave it the only points that have to be regarded are the outlines
varieties of planes and depths and if these be properly considered
everything else will take care of itself and then the whole work can
not be left too rough its very roughness and choppy cuts will give it a
softness and quality when in its place that no amount of smoothing or
high finish can possibly attain to
beware of putting a wrong interpretation upon the word roughrefer to
what he says of the points to be regarded ie the varieties of
planes and depths if they are right the roughness is not likely to
be of the offensive kind
nothing so effectually destroys the quality of texture as polish applied
to carving if furniture must be polished it should not be carved the
only polish that improves carving is that which comes of use on hard
woods such as oak or italian walnut the pressure of the tools leaves a
pleasant polish which is all that is necessary the most that should
be allowed may be given by a little burnishing with the handle of the
tool
chapter xxvi
craft schools past and present
     the country craftsman of old timesa colony of craftsmen in busy
     intercoursethe modern craftsmans difficulties embarrassing
     variety of choice
the present revival of interest in the arts especially with regard to
those of a decorative kind is based on the recently awakened esthetic
desires of a small section of the general public who owe their activity
in this direction to the influence of men like john ruskin and william
morris the first of these by his magic insight discerned the true
source of vitality which lay in the traditions of medieval workmanship
ie their intensely human character and origin his fiery words
compelled attention and awakened a new enthusiasm for all that betokens
the direct and inspiring influence of nature they raised the hope that
this passion might in some way provide a clue to the recovery of a
fitting form of expression
william morris with no less power as a craftsman was the first to
give practical embodiment to this newly awakened impulse by a modified
return to the older methods of production his rare knowledge of
medieval history and manly sympathy with all that is generous in modern
life made it impossible for him to become a superficial imitator his
work is an example of what may be achieved by a union of high artistic
instincts with a clear understanding of the conditions of modern life
cheering as is the present activity in its encouragement of endeavor
the difficulties of establishing anything like an efficient system of
education for the artist more especially the sculptor or carver
artist is only being gradually realized the difficulties are not so
much academic as practical it is less a question of where to study than
one of knowing what direction those studies should take before any
genuine development in the art can be looked for continuity of effort
must be established and that in a single direction undisturbed as it
is at present by differences of public taste
opportunities for study are now afforded to an extent never before
dreamed of in books and schools and in museums but division of
opinion mars the authority of the two first while the last is
confessedly but a kind of catalogue which may only be read with profit
by the light of considerable experience
a certain amount of success has undoubtedly attended the progress of the
new system but it must always be more or less at a disadvantage
firstly by reason of its divided aims secondly because the system is
more theoretic than practical and is often based on the false
assumption that design may be learned without attaining a mastery over
technique and vice versa
until students become disillusioned on this latter point and are at the
same time permitted to follow their natural bent with as little
interference as possible from the exigencies of public taste uniformity
of aim will be impossible and consequently the system must remain
artificial it can never under any circumstances entirely replace that
more natural one adopted by our ancestors how can its methods compare
for a moment with the spontaneous and hearty interest that guided the
tools of those more happily placed craftsmen whose subjects lay around
them of daily familiarity whose artistic language was ready to hand
and without confusion affording an endless variety of expression to
every new and individual fancy many of these craftsmen were owing to
their invigorating surroundings gifted with a high poetic feeling for
their arta quality which gives to their work a transcendent value that
no learning or manual cleverness could supply they acquired their
technical knowledge in genial connection with equally gifted members of
other crafts and in consequence expressed themselves with corresponding
and justly proportioned skill in execution
conditions that can not be altered must be endured while they last but
the first step toward their improvement must be made in gaining a
knowledge of the facts as they are this will be the surest foundation
upon which to build all individual effort in the future
who that has felt the embarrassing doubts and contradictory impulses
peculiar to modern study can have failed to look disconsolately away
from his own surroundings to those faroff times when craft knowledge
was acquired under circumstances calculated to awaken the brightest
instincts of the artist the imaginary picture calls up the ancient
carver at his bench cheerfully blocking out images of leaves and
animals in his busy workshop surrounded with the sights and sounds of
country life his open door frames a picture of the village street
alive with scenes of neighborly interest from the millwheel comes a
monotonous music making pleasant cadence to his own woody notes or the
blacksmiths hammer rings his cheery counterpart in their companionable
duet
short as is the distance between workshop and home it provides a world
of beauty and incident suggesting to his inventive mind the subjects
suitable for his work birds beasts and flowers are as familiar to him
as the tools with which he works or the scent and touch of the solid
oak he handles daily there among the aromatic chips he spends the
long working hours of a summer day varied by the occasional visits of a
rather exacting father from the neighboring monastery or perhaps some
idle and gossiping acquaintance who looks in to hold a long parley with
his hand upon the latch or it may be that the mind turns to another
carver at work in one of the many large colonies of craftsmen which
sprang up amid the forest of scaffolding surrounding the slow and
mysterious growth of some noble cathedral here all is organized
activitythe best men to be found in the country have been banded
together and commissioned to do their best for what seems in modern
eyes a ridiculously small rate of pay some are well known and
recommended others as traveling artists are seeking change of
experience and daily bread foreigners are here from france italy and
the east all have been placed under the direction of competent masters
of their craft men who have long since served their apprenticeship to
its mysteries and earned an honorable position in its gilds
here the carver works in an atmosphere of exhilarating emulation
stonecarver and woodcarver vie with each other in producing work that
will do credit to their respective brotherhoods painter and decorator
are busy giving to the work of their hands what must have appeared to
those concerned an aspect of heavenly beauty the most precious
materials not being considered too costly for use in its adornment
what an interchange of artistic experienceinterchange between those
of similar craft from different countries and the stimulating or
refining influence of one craft upon anothersculptors goldsmiths
woodcarvers and painters all uniting in a sympathetic agreement to do
their utmost for the high authorities who brought them together with a
common feeling of reverence alike for the religious traditions which
formed the motives of their work and the representatives of that
religion in the persons of their employers
what an endless variety of interruptions must have been common all of a
kind eminently calculated to stimulate the imagination municipal
functions religious festivals with their splendid gatherings and
processions the exciting events of political contest often carried to
the point of actual combat to say nothing of the frequent saints day
holidays enjoyed by the craftsman in jovial social intercourse all and
every scene clothed in an outward dress of beauty ranging from the
picturesque roughness of the village inn to the magnificent pageantry of
a noblemans display or the majestic surroundings of an archiepiscopal
reception
from dreams of the past with its manysided life and background of
serious beauty we turn with feelings almost bordering on despair to the
possibilities of the present not only has the modern craftsman to
master the technicalities of his business but he must become student as
well no universally accepted form of his art offers him a readymade
language he is left fatally free to choose style period or
nationality from examples of every conceivable kind of carving in
museums photographs and buildings as proud but distracted heir to
all he may cultivate any one of them from chinese to the latest style
of exhibition art for his studies he must travel half a dozen miles
before he can reach fields trees and animals in anything like
inspiring conditions he must find in books and photographs the
botanical lineaments of foliage and flowers of which he mainly seeks to
know the wild life and free growth with but one short life allowed him
in which to make his poor effort in a single direction he must yet
study the history of his craft compare styles and endeavor with all
the help he can get to shape some course for himself can he be assured
of selecting the right one or out of the multitude of counselors and
contradictory views is there not a danger of taking a false step no
wonder if in the cloudy obscurity of his doubts he sometimes feels a
tired desire to abandon the problem as too intricate to be resolved
chapter xxvii
on the importance of cooperation between builder and carver
     the infinite multiplicity of stylesthe gothic influence
     sculpture an integral element in its designsthe approach of the
     socalled renaissance perioddisturbed convictionsthe revival
     of the classical stylethe two styles in conflict for a time
     their respective characteristics reviewedcarvers become dependent
     upon architects and paintersthe revival separates designer
     and executant
the prevailing architectural fashion of a time or country known as its
style has generally been determined by the influence of more advanced
nations on those of a ruder constitution each modifying the imported
style to suit its own climatic and social conditions and imbuing it
with its own individual temperament the foreign idea was thus developed
into a distinct and national style which in its turn bore fruit and
was passed on as an initiative for other nations and new styles the
current of this influence generally speaking trended from east to west
as though following the course of the sun upon whose light it depended
for the illumination of its beauties
there are so many styles of architecture and consequently of carving
both in wood and other materials that a history of such a subject would
be a life study in itself and be quite barren of results except those
of a professional kind it would include the characteristics of carvings
from every country under the sun from the earliest times known
engravings on boars tusks found in prehistoric caves carvings on south
sea island canoe paddles peruvian monstrosities of terror the refined
barbarity of india and china the enduring and monumental efforts of
egyptian art and a hundred others down to times and countries more
within reach in fact it would only be another name for a history of
mankind from the beginning of the world
nothing could be better for the students purpose than to begin his
studies of history at that point where the first indication of the
gothic or medieval period of architecture makes its appearance for it
was from this great and revolutionary change in the manner of building
that all the subsequent variety of style in carving as well as building
in medieval europe took its origin the first rudiments of the great
school of art which has been broadly classified as having a gothic
origin began to make their appearance in byzantium some three or four
centuries after the birth of christ this city said to have been
founded by a colony of greek emigrants became the seat of roman
government in their eastern empire and is now known as constantinople
it contains a noted example of ancient art in the great church of st
sophia from the date of the building of this church in the sixth
century a d to the beginning of the fifteenth century in italy and
about a hundred years later more or less according to distance from
that center we have roughly the period during which the medieval
spirit ruled the arts of europe
the work of this long period is distinguished beyond all others by the
varied beauty and interest of its carvings a preeminence it owes in
part to the strong bias in this direction which was given by its early
founders but still more to the unbroken alliance maintained between
builders and carvers throughout the entire period an inherited talent
for sculpture handed down no doubt from their classical forefathers
distinctly marks the commencement of the era but from that time until
the appearance of the renaissance influence builder and carver are no
longer conceivable as being independent of each other sculpture of one
kind or another not only played an important part in the decoration of
its buildings but became a necessary and integral element in every
architectural conception be its importance little or great the masons
designed their structural features with a view to the embellishments to
follow from the hand of the carver they were in full sympathy with the
artistic intention of the decoration therefore their own ideas were in
complete conformity with those of the sculptor while even in some cases
they did this part of the work themselves the sculptors restrained by
the severe laws of structural design never transgressed the due limits
of their craft or became insistent upon the individuality of their own
work hence throughout all the successive changes of style brought
about by time and difference of country climate or material the art
of carving steadily progressed hand in hand with the art of building
the changes were so very gradual and grew so naturally from the
conditions and requirements of social life that ample time was allowed
for the education of public feeling which became in this way identified
with the inventive progress of the craftsmen as a happy result one aim
and desire governed alike builders carvers and people and one style
at a time enjoyed and understood by all was the wholesome regimen by
which the architectural appetite of the period was sustained cathedral
and cottage differed only in their relative grades of importance each
shared in due proportion the advantages of an architectural style common
to all forms of building and adaptable in the highest degree to every
varying purpose of design from the simplest piece of walling with the
barest indication of style to the most elaborate arrangement of masonry
and carving which could be devised to distinguish a stately and
important structure
time was however preparing a revolution which was destined to sweep
away many old beliefs and established institutions and with them those
familiar motives and habits of thought which had long formed the
bountiful source of medieval inspiration and invention the period
between the beginning of the fifteenth century and the reformation was
like a fiery furnace in which the materials for a new world were being
prepared it was no time for the leisurely enjoyment of the pleasures of
art which presupposes settled convictions and imperceptible
developments
about this time many new forms of intellectual activity began to engage
the minds of the more gifted speculative philosophy the opening fields
of science the imaginative literature of the ancients these were among
the subjects which while they enlarged the sphere of individual
thought destroyed that social ideal which had its roots in a common
belief and with it the secret source of all past development in
architecture with the deeplying causes and farreaching effects of the
unrest which disturbed this period we are not here concerned beyond
the point where it touches our interest in architecture and sculpture
that drastic changes were in progress affecting the popular regard for
these arts is undeniable educated and illiterate minds became alike
indifferent to the authority of established religioneither they
succumbed to the tyranny of its powerful but corrupt ministers or stood
out in open rebellion against its disputed dogmas in either case that
architecture which had formerly been regarded as the chief symbol of
united faith shared the neglect of one section or the abhorrence of the
other that strong sense of beauty once the common possession of
builders sculptors and people was now between the upper and nether
millstones of fate being ground into the fine dust which has served for
centuries as the principal ingredient in the manufacture of an endless
succession of moral puddings and pies known in modern times as art
criticism
to earnest minds in all classes at that time any enthusiasm for
architectural styles old or new must have appeared as futile as an
anxiety about appearances while ones house was burning
to the art of this period the title renaissance has been foolishly
applied when used in association with the arts of architecture and
sculpture it is essentially a misnomer for these arts it was merely a
time of revival not in any sense one of rebirth as the word implies
in no way can this period claim to have conferred vitality along with
the resuscitation of outward form the revival of a classical style in
architectural design which began in the early years of the fifteenth
century was the sequel to a similar revival in the study of greek and
roman literature then occupying the interests of cultivated scholars
it was but a step further to desire also the realization of those
architectural splendors which were associated with these studies such
dilettante dreams can not be supposed to have deeply interested the
general public with whose concerns they had but a remote connection so
under these circumstances probably the classical style was as suitable
as any other chosen on such narrow and exclusive grounds there was
even a certain fitness in it a capability of much expansion on
theatrical and grandiose lines its unbending demeanor toward craft
talent of the humbler kind at once flattered the vanity of the cultured
and cowed uneducated minds
the duomo at florence was finished early in that century and was one of
the first buildings in which the new style was adopted in this case it
was used mainly in the completion of a building already well advanced on
lines based upon the older traditions the character of its design
although not of a strictly imitative kind was distinctly based on a
classical ideal imitations followed mingling as in the case of the
duomo gothic and classic elements often with fine effect it is quite
possible to believe that had this intermarriage of the two schools
continued to bear fruit some vertebrate style might have resulted from
the union partaking of the nature of both parents but the hope was of
short duration its architects becoming enamored by the quality of
scientific precision which is the fundamental principle of classical
design soon abandoned all pretense of attempting to amalgamate the
native and imported styles they gave themselves up wholly to the
congenial task of elaborating a scholarly system of imitation so that
by the middle of the sixteenth century no trace whatever remained of
native feeling in the architecture of its important buildings
during the progress of this revolution in style the old medieval habits
of cooperation between master mason and sculptor were slowly being
exchanged for a complete dependence upon a special architect who was
not necessarily a craftsman himself but whose designs must be carried
out line for line with the most rigid adherence to measurements
for a moment in history the rival spirits of the two great schools of
architecture stand face to face like opposing ideals the classical one
recalled from the region of things past and forgotten again to play a
part on earth with at least the semblance of life the gothic spirit
under notice to quit and betake itself to that oblivion from which its
rival is reemerging
in the heyday of their power the first had shown a distinctly
autocratic bearing toward its workmen offering to its sculptors of
genius opportunities for the exercise of highly trained powers and to
the subordinate workmen only the more or less mechanical task of
repeating a limited number of prescribed forms the other a more genial
spirit had possessed the largest toleration for rude or untrained
workmanship provided that in its expression the carver had a meaning
which would be generally understood and appreciated if skill could be
commanded either of design or technique it was welcomed but it gave
no encouragement to work which was either so distinctive as to be
independent of its surroundings or of a kind which could have no other
than a mechanical interest in its execution the abrupt contrasts the
variety and mystery characteristic of gothic architecture had been a
direct and irresistible invitation to the carver and the freest
playground for his fancy the formality of the classical design on the
other hand necessarily confined such carving as it permitted to
particular lines and spaces following a recognized rule and except in
the case of basrelief figure subjects and detached statues demanded no
separate interest in the carvings themselves further than the esthetic
one of relieving such lines and spaces as were otherwise uncomfortably
bare
some modification of this extreme arrogance toward the decorative carver
was only to be expected in the revived style but the freedom allowed to
the individual carver turned out to be more apparent than real a new
race of carvers sprang up imbued with the principles of classical
design but being no longer in touch with natural and popular interests
nor stimulated by mutual cooperation with their brother craftsmen the
mason builders they adopted the fashionable mode of expression invented
by the new architects and the painters of the time elaborate
arabesque and other formal designs gave employment to the carvers in
making an infinite repetition of fiddles festoons and ribbons in the
execution of which they became so proficient that their work is more
often admired for its exquisite finish than for any intrinsic interest
in the subject or design
judged by its effects upon the art of carving without the aid of which
a national style of architecture is impossible the revival of classical
architecture never had a real and enduring life in it strictly
speaking no organic style ever grew out of its ambitious promises the
nearest approach to such a thing is to be found in those uncouth
minglings of gothic tradition with fragments of classical detail which
distinguish much of the domestic architecture during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries amusing in their quaint and often rich and
effective combinations humanly interesting in proportion to the
predominance of the gothic element association has grown up around
these homely records of a mixed influence until they have come to be
regarded with affection if not with the highest admiration
the revival brought nothing but harm to the carver himselfthat is
to the carver who found it impossible to reach the elevation of a
sculptor of genius he sacrificed his own small but precious talent as a
creator of pleasant images for the attainment of a finesse in the
execution of other peoples ideas to the renaissance must be
attributed that fatal separation of the craftsmans function into the
hands of designer and executant which has so completely paralyzed the
living spirit of individual invention it has taken close upon four
centuries to open the eyes of our craftsmen to this inconsistency and
revive the medieval truth that invention and execution are strictly
but one and the same thing let us hope that the present awakening to
the importance of this fact may yet lead to what will be truly worthy of
being called a renaissance not merely of outward forms but of that
creative energy which alone justifies the true meaning of the word

produced by the intersection of gouge cuts
