authors preface
this book is written for young students in high schools and normal
schools no knowledge can be of more use to a young person than a
knowledge of himself no study can be more valuable to him than a study
of himself a study of the laws of human behaviorthat is the purpose
of this book
what is human nature like why do we act as we do how can we make
ourselves different how can we make others different how can we make
ourselves more efficient how can we make our lives more worth while
this book is a manual intended to help young people to obtain such
knowledge of human nature as will enable them to answer these questions
i have not attempted to write a complete text on psychology there are
already many such books and good ones too i have selected for
treatment only such topics as young students can study with interest and
profit i have tried to keep in mind all the time the practical worth of
the matters discussed and the ability and experience of the intended
readers
to the teacher
this book can be only a guide to you you are to help your students
study human nature you must to some extent be a psychologist yourself
before you can teach psychology you must yourself be a close and
scientific student of human nature develop in the students the spirit
of inquiry and investigation teach them to look to their own minds and
their neighbors actions for verification of the statements of the text
let the students solve by observation and experiment the questions and
problems raised in the text and the exercises the exercises should
prove to be the most valuable part of the book the first two chapters
are the most difficult but ought to be read before the rest of the book
is studied if you think best merely read these two chapters with the
pupils and after the book is finished come back to them for careful
study
in the references i have given parallel readings for the most part to
titchener pillsbury and mnsterberg i have purposely limited the
references partly because a library will not be available to many who
may use the book and partly because the young student is likely to be
confused by much reading from different sources before he has worked out
some sort of system and a point of view of his own only the most
capable members of a high school class will be able to profit much from
the references given
to the student
you are beginning the study of human nature you can not study human
nature from a book you must study yourself and your neighbors this
book may help you to know what to look for and to understand what you
find but it can do little more than this it is true this text gives
you many facts learned by psychologists but you must verify the
statements or at least see their significance to you or they will
be of no worth to you however the facts considered here properly
understood and assimilated ought to prove of great value to you but
perhaps of greater value will be the psychological frame of mind or
attitude which you should acquire the psychological attitude is that of
seeking to find and understand the causes of human action and the
causes consequences and significance of the processes of the human
mind if your first course in psychology teaches you to look for these
things gives you some skill in finding them and in using the knowledge
after you have it your study should be quite worth while

editors preface
there are at least two possible approaches to the study of psychology by
teachertraining students in high schools and by beginning students in
normal schools
one of these is through methods of teaching and subject matter the
other aims to give the simple concrete facts of psychology as the
science of the mind the former presupposes a close relationship between
psychology and methods of teaching and assumes that psychology is
studied chiefly as an aid to teaching the latter is less complicated
the plan contemplates the teaching of the simple fundamentals at first
and applying them incidentally as the occasion demands this latter
point of view is in the main the point of view taken in the text
the author has taught the material of the text to high school students
to the end that he might present the fundamental facts of psychology in
simple form

the science of human nature
chapter i
introduction
science before attempting to define psychology it will be helpful to
make some inquiry into the nature of science in general science is
knowledge it is what we know but mere knowledge is not science for a
bit of knowledge to become a part of science its relation to other bits
of knowledge must be found in botany for example bits of knowledge
about plants do not make a science of botany to have a science of
botany we must not only know about leaves roots flowers seeds etc
but we must know the relations of these parts and of all the parts of a
plant to one another in other words in science we must not only
know we must not only have knowledge but we must know the
significance of the knowledge must know its meaning this is only
another way of saying that we must have knowledge and know its relation
to other knowledge
a scientist is one who has learned to organize his knowledge the main
difference between a scientist and one who is not a scientist is that
the scientist sees the significance of facts while the nonscientific
man sees facts as more or less unrelated things as one comes to hunt
for causes and inquire into the significance of things one becomes a
scientist a thing or an event always points beyond itself to something
else this something else is what goes before it or comes after itis
its cause or its effect this causal relationship that exists between
events enables a scientist to prophesy by carefully determining what
always precedes a certain event a certain type of happening a
scientist is able to predict the event all that is necessary to be able
to predict an event is to have a clear knowledge of its true causes
whenever beyond any doubt these causes are found to be present the
scientist knows the event will follow of course all that he really
knows is that such results have always followed similar causes in the
past but he has come to have faith in the uniformity and regularity of
nature the chemist does not find sulphur or oxygen or any other
element acting one way one day under a certain set of conditions and
acting another way the next day under exactly the same conditions nor
does the physicist find the laws of mechanics holding good one day and
not the next
the scientist therefore in his thinking brings order out of chaos in
the world if we do not know the causes and relations of things and
events the world seems a very mixedup chaotic place where anything
and everything is happening but as we come to know causes and
relations the world turns out to be a very orderly and systematic
place it is a lawful world it is not a world of chance everything is
related to everything else
now the nonscientific mind sees things as more or less unrelated the
farreaching causal relations are only imperfectly seen by it while
the scientific mind not only sees things but inquires into their causes
and effects or consequences the nonscientific man walking over the
top of a mountain and noticing a stone there is likely to see in it
only a stone and think nothing of how it came to be there but the
scientific man sees quite an interesting bit of history in the stone he
reads in the stone that millions of years ago the place where the rock
now lies was under the sea many marine animals left their remains in
the mud underneath the sea the mud was afterward converted into rock
later the shrinking and warping earthcrust lifted the rock far above
the level of the sea and it may now be found at the top of the
mountain the one bit of rock tells its story to one who inquires into
its causes the scientific man then sees more significance more
meaning in things and events than does the nonscientific man
each science has its own particular field zology undertakes to answer
every reasonable question about animals botany about plants physics
about motion and forces chemistry about the composition of matter
astronomy about the heavenly bodies etc the world has many aspects
each science undertakes to describe and explain some particular aspect
to understand all the aspects of the world we must study all the
sciences
a scientific law by law a scientist has reference to uniformities
which he notices in things and events he does not mean that necessities
are imposed upon things as civil law is imposed upon man he means only
that in certain welldefined situations certain events always take
place according to all previous observations the law of falling bodies
may be cited as an example by this law the physicist means that in
observing falling bodies in the past he has noticed that they fall
about sixteen feet in the first second and acquire in this time a
velocity of thirtytwo feet he has noted that taking into account the
specific gravity of the object and the resistance of the air this way
of falling holds true of all objects at about the level of the sea
the more we carefully study the events of the world the more strongly
we come to feel that definite causes under the same circumstances
always produce precisely the same result the scientist has faith that
events will continue to happen during all the future in the same order
of cause and effect in which they have been happening during all the
past
the astronomer knowing the relations of the members of the solar
systemthe sun and planetscan successfully predict the occurrence of
lunar and solar eclipses in other fields too the scientist can
predict with as much certainty as does the astronomer provided his
knowledge of the factors concerned is as complete as is the knowledge
which the astronomer has of the solar system even in the case of human
beings uncertain as their actions seem to be we can predict their
actions when our knowledge of the factors is sufficiently complete in a
great many instances we do make such predictions for example if we
call a person by name we expect him to turn or make some other
movement in response our usual inability to make such predictions in
the case of human beings is not because human beings are not subject to
the law of cause and effect it is not that their acts are due to
chance but that the factors involved are usually many and it is
difficult for us to find out all of them
the science of psychology now let us ask what is the science of
psychology what kind of problems does it try to solve what aspect of
the world has it taken for its field of investigation
we have said that each science undertakes to describe some particular
aspect of the world human psychology is the science of human nature
but human nature has many aspects to some extent our bodies are the
subject matter for physiology anatomy zology physics and chemistry
our bodies may be studied in the same way that a rock or a table might
be studied but a human being presents certain problems that a rock or
table does not present if we consider the differences between a human
being and a table we shall see at once the special field of psychology
if we stick a pin into a leg of the table we get no response if we
stick a pin into a leg of a man we get a characteristic response the
man moves he cries out this shows two very great differences between a
man and a table the man is sensitive and has the power of action the
power of moving himself the table is not sensitive nor can it move
itself if the pin is thrust into ones own leg one has pain human
beings then are sensitive conscious acting beings and the study of
sensitivity action and consciousness is the field of psychology these
three characteristics are not peculiar to man many perhaps all
animals possess them there is therefore an animal psychology as well
as human psychology
a study of the human body shows us that the bodysurface and many parts
within the body are filled with sensitive nerveends these sensitive
nerveends are the sense organs and on them the substances and forces
of the world are constantly acting in the sense organs the nerveends
are so modified or changed as to be affected by some particular kind of
force or substance vibrations of ether affect the eye vibrations of
air affect the ear liquids and solutions affect the sense of taste
certain substances affect the sense of smell certain organs in the skin
are affected by low temperatures others by high temperatures others
by mechanical pressure similarly each sense organ in the body is
affected by a definite kind of force or substance
this affecting of a sense organ is known technically as stimulation
and that which affects the organ is known as the stimulus
two important consequences ordinarily follow the stimulation of a sense
organ one of these is movement the purpose of stimulation is to bring
about movement to be alive is to respond to stimulation when one
ceases to respond to stimulation he is dead if we are to continue
alive we must constantly adjust ourselves to the forces of the world in
which we live generally speaking we may say that every nerve has one
end in a sense organ and the other in a muscle this arrangement of the
nerves and muscles shows that man is essentially a sensitiveaction
machine the problems connected with sensitivity and action and the
relation of each to the other constitute a large part of the field of
psychology
we said just now that a nerve begins in a sense organ and ends in a
muscle this statement represents the general scheme well enough but
leaves out an important detail the nerve does not extend directly to a
muscle but ordinarily goes by way of the brain the brain is merely a
great group of nerve cells and fibers which have developed as a central
organ where a stimulation may pass from almost any sense organ to
almost any muscle
but another importance attaches to the brain when a sense organ is
stimulated and this stimulation passes on to the brain and agitates a
cell or group of cells there we are conscious consciousness shifts
and changes with every shift and change of the stimulation
the brain has still another important characteristic after it has been
stimulated through sense organ and nerve a similar brain activity can
be revived later and this revival is the basis of memory when the
brain is agitated through the medium of a sense organ we have
sensation when this agitation is revived later we have a memory
idea a study of consciousness or mind the conditions under which it
arises and all the other problems involved give us the other part of
the field of psychology
we are not merely acting beings we are conscious acting beings
psychology must study human nature from both points of view we must
study man not only from the outside that is objectively in the same
way that we study a stone or a tree or a frog but we must study him
from the inside or subjectively it is of importance to know not only
how a man acts but also how he thinks and feels
it must be clear now that human action human behavior is the main
field of psychology for even though our main interests in people were
in their minds we could learn of the minds only through the actions
but our interests in other human beings are not in their minds but in
what they do it is true that our interest in ourselves is in our
minds and we can know these minds directly but we cannot know
directly the mind of another person we can only guess what it is from
the persons actions
the problems of psychology let us now see in some detail what the
various problems of psychology are if we are to understand human
nature we must know something of mans past we must therefore treat of
the origin and development of the human race the relation of one
generation to that preceding and to the one following makes necessary a
study of heredity we must find out how our thoughts feelings
sensations and ideas are dependent upon a physical body and its organs
a study of human actions shows that some actions are unlearned while
others are learned or acquired the unlearned acts are known as
instincts and the acquired acts are known as habits our psychology
must therefore treat of instincts and habits
how man gets experience and retains and organizes this experience must
be our problem in the chapters on sensations ideas memory and
thinking individual differences in human capacity make necessary a
treatment of the different types and grades of intelligence and the
compilation of tests for determining these differences we must also
treat of the application of psychology to those fields where a knowledge
of human nature is necessary
applied psychology at the beginning of a subject it is legitimate to
inquire concerning the possibility of applying the principles studied to
practical uses and it is very proper to make this inquiry concerning
psychology psychology being the science of human nature ought to be
of use in all fields where one needs to know the causes of human action
and psychology is applicable in these fields to the extent that the
psychologist is able to work out the laws and principles of human
action
in education for example we wish to influence children and we must go
to psychology to learn about the nature of children and to find out how
we can influence them psychology is therefore the basis of the science
of education
since different kinds of work demand in some cases different kinds of
ability the psychology of individual differences can be of service in
selecting people for special kinds of work that is to say we must have
sometime if we do not now a psychology of professions and vocations
psychological investigations of the reliability of human evidence make
the science of service in the court room the study of the laws of
attention and interest give us the psychology of advertising the study
of suggestion and abnormal states make psychology of use in medicine it
may be said therefore that psychology once abstract and unrelated to
any practical interests will become the most useful of all sciences as
it works out its problems and finds the laws of human behavior
at present the greatest service of psychology is to education so true
is this that a department has grown up called educational psychology
which constitutes at the present time the most important subdivision of
psychology while in this book we treat briefly of the various
applications of psychology we shall have in mind chiefly its
application to education
the science of education owing to the importance which psychology has
in the science of education it will be well for us to make some inquiry
into the nature of education if the growth development and learning
of children are all controlled and determined by definite causal
factors then a systematic statement of all these factors would
constitute the science of education in order to see clearly whether
there is such a science or whether there can be let us inquire more
definitely as to the kind of problems a science of education would be
expected to solve
there are four main questions which the science of education must solve
1 what is the aim of education 2 what is the nature of education
3 what is the nature of the child 4 what are the most economical
methods of changing the child from what it is into what it ought to be
the first question is a sociological question and it is not difficult
to find the answer we have but to inquire what the people wish their
children to become there is a pretty general agreement at least in the
same community that children should be trained in a way that will make
them socially efficient parents generally wish their children to become
honest truthful sympathetic and industrious it should be the aim of
education to accomplish this social ideal it should be the aim of the
home and the school to subject children to such influences as will
enable them to make a living when grown and to do their proper share of
work for the community and state working always for better things and
having a sympathetic attitude toward neighbors education should also do
what it can to make people able to enjoy the world and life to the
fullest and highest extent some such aim of education as this is held
by all our people
the second question is also answered psychological analysis reveals the
fact that education is a process of becoming adjusted to the world it
is the process of acquiring the habits knowledge and ideals suited to
the life we are to live the child in being educated learns what the
world is and how to act in ithow to act in all the various situations
of life
the third questionconcerning the nature of the childcannot be so
briefly answered in fact it cannot be fully answered at the present
time we must know what the childs original nature is this means that
we must know the instincts and all the other inherited capacities and
tendencies we must know the laws of building up habits and of acquiring
knowledge the laws of retention and the laws of attention these
problems constitute the subject matter of educational psychology and at
present can be only partially solved we have however a very
respectable body of knowledge in this field though it is by no means
complete
the answer to the fourth question is in part dependent upon the progress
in answering the third economical methods of training children must be
dependent upon the nature of children but in actual practice we are
trying to find out the best procedure of doing each single thing in
school work we are trying to find out by experimentation the proper
way to teach children to read to spell to write etc must be
determined in each case by independent investigation until our
knowledge of the child becomes sufficient for us to infer from general
laws of procedure what the procedure in a particular case should be we
venture to infer what ought to be done in some cases but generally we
feel insecure till we have proved our inference correct by trying out
different methods and measuring the results
education will not be fully scientific till we have definite knowledge
to guide us at every step what should we teach when should we teach
it how should we teach it how poorly we answer these questions at the
present time how inefficient and uneconomical our schools because we
cannot fully answer them but they are answerable we can answer them in
part now and we know how to find out the answer in full it is just a
matter of patient and extensive investigation we must say then that
we have only the beginnings of a science of education the problems
which a science of education must solve are almost wholly psychological
problems they could not be solved till we had a science of psychology
experimental psychology is but a halfcentury old educational
psychology less than a quartercentury old in the field of education
the science of psychology may expect to make its most important
practical contribution let us then consider very briefly the problems
of educational psychology
educational psychology educational psychology is that division of
psychology which undertakes to discover those aspects of human nature
most closely related to education these are 1 the original nature of
the childwhat it is and how it can be modified 2 the problem of
acquiring and organizing experiencehabitformation memory thinking
and the various factors related to these processes there are many
subordinate problems such as the problem of individual differences and
their bearing on the education of subnormal and supernormal children
educational psychology is not then merely the application of
psychology to education it is a distinct science in itself and its aim
is the solving of those educational problems which for their solution
depend upon a knowledge of the nature of the child
the method of psychology we have enumerated the various problems of
psychology now how are they solved the method of psychology is the
same as that of all other sciences namely the method of observation
and experiment we learn human nature by observing how human beings act
in all the various circumstances of life we learn about the human mind
by observing our own mind we learn that we see under certain
objective conditions hear under certain objective conditions
taste smell feel cold and warm under certain objective
conditions in the case of ourselves we can know both our actions and
our mind in the case of others we can know only their actions and
must infer their mental states from our own in similar circumstances
with certain restrictions and precautions this inference is legitimate
we said the method of psychology is that of observation and experiment
the experiment is observation still but observation subjected to exact
methodical procedure in a psychological experiment we set out to
provide the necessary conditions eliminating some and supplying others
according to our object the experiment has certain advantages it
enables us to isolate the phenomena to be studied it enables us to vary
the circumstances and conditions to suit our purposes it enables us to
repeat the observation as often as we like and it enables us to measure
exactly the factors of the phenomena studied
a psychological experiment let us illustrate psychological method by a
typical experiment suppose we wish to measure the individual
differences among the members of a class with respect to a certain
ability namely the muscular speed of the right hand psychological
laboratories have delicate apparatus for making such a study but let
us see how we can do it roughly at least without any apparatus let
each member of the class take a sheet of paper and a pencil and make as
many strokes as possible in a halfminute as shown in figure i the
instructor can keep the time with a stop watch or less accurately with
the second hand of an ordinary watch before beginning the experiment
the instructor should have each student taking the test try it for a
second or two this is to make sure that all understand what they are to
do when the instructor is sure that all understand he should have the
students hold their pencils in readiness above the paper and at the
signal begin all should start at the same time and make as many
marks as possible in the halfminute the strokes can then be counted
and the individual scores recorded the experiment should be repeated
several times say six or eight and the average score for each
individual recorded
illustration figure istrokes made in thirty seconds
a test of muscular speed
whether the result in such a performance as this varies from day to day
and is accidental or whether it is constant and fundamental can be
determined by repeating the experiment from day to day this repetition
will also show whether improvement comes from practice
if it is decided to repeat the experiment in order to study these
factors constancy and the effects of practice some method of studying
and interpreting the results must be found elaborate methods of doing
this are known to psychologists but the beginner must use a simpler
method when the experiment is performed for the first time the
students can be ranked with reference to their abilities the fastest
one being called first the second highest second and so on down
to the slowest performer then after the experiment has been performed
the second time the students can be again ranked
a rough comparison can then be made as follows determine how many who
were in the best half in the first experiment are among the best half in
the second experiment if most who were among the best half the first
time are among the best half in the second experiment constancy in this
performance is indicated or we might determine how many change their
ranks and how much they change suppose there are thirty in the class
and only four improve their ranks and these to the extent of only two
places each this would indicate a high degree of constancy two
different performances can be compared as above described the abilities
on successive days can be determined by taking the average rank of the
first day and comparing it with the average rank of the second day
if the effects of practice are to be studied the experiments must be
kept up for many days and each students work on the first day compared
with his work on succeeding days then a graph can be plotted to show
the improvement from day to day the average daily speed of the class
can be taken and a graph made to show the improvement of the class as a
whole this might be plotted in black ink then each individual student
could put on his improvement in red ink for comparison a group of
thirty may be considered as furnishing a fair average or norm in this
kind of performance
in connection with this simple performance making marks as fast as
possible it is evident that many problems arise it would take several
months to solve anything like all of them it might be interesting for
example to determine whether ones speed in writing is related to this
simple speed in marking each member of the class might submit a plan
for making such a study
the foregoing simple study illustrates the procedure of psychology in
all experimentation a psychological experiment is an attempt to find
out the truth in regard to some aspect of human nature in finding out
this truth we must throw about the experiment all possible safeguards
every source of error must be discovered and eliminated in the above
experiment for example the work must be done at the same time of day
or else we must prove that doing it at different times of day makes no
difference nothing must be taken for granted and nothing must be
assumed psychology then is like all the other sciences in that its
method of getting its facts is by observation and experiment
  summary science is systematic related knowledge each science has
  a particular field which it attempts to explore and describe the
  field of psychology is the study of sensitivity action and
  consciousness or briefly human behavior its main problems are
  development heredity instincts habits sensation memory
  thinking and individual differences its method is observation and
  experiment the same as in all other sciences

development of the race and of the individual
racial development the purpose of this chapter is to make some inquiry
concerning the origin of the race and of the individual in doing this
it is necessary for us first of all to fix in our minds the idea of
causality according to the view of all modern science everything has a
cause nothing is uncaused one event is the result of other previous
events and is in turn the cause of other events that follow yesterday
flowed into today and today flows into tomorrow the world as it
exists today is the result of the world as it existed yesterday this
is true not only of the inorganic worldthe world of physics and
chemistrybut it is true of living things as well the animals and
plants that exist today are the descendants of others that lived
before there is probably an unbroken line of descent from the first
life that existed on the earth to the living forms of today
not only does the law of causality hold true in the case of our bodies
but of our minds as well our minds have doubtless developed from
simpler minds just as our bodies have developed from simpler bodies
that different grades and types of minds are to be found among the
various classes of animals now upon the earth no one can doubt for the
different forms certainly show different degrees of mentality
according to the evidence of those scientists who have studied the
remains of animals found in the earths crust there is a gradual
development of animal forms shown in successive epochs in the very
oldest parts of the earths crust the remains of animal life found are
very simple in later formations the remains show an animal life more
complex the highest forms of animals the mammals are found only in
the more recent formations the remains of man are found only in the
latest formations
putting these two facts together1 that the higher types of mind are
found today only in the higher types of animals and 2 that a gradual
development of animal forms is shown by the remains in the earths
crustthe conclusion is forced upon us that mind has passed through
many stages of development from the appearance of life upon the earth to
the present time among the lower forms of animals today one sees
evidence of very simple minds in amoebas worms insects and fishes
mind is very simple in birds it is higher in mammals it is higher
still among the highest mammals below man we see manifestations of
mind somewhat like our own these grades of mentality shown in the
animals of today represent the steps in the development of mind in the
animals of the past
we cannot here go into the proof of the doctrine of development for
this proof the reader must be referred to zology one further point
however may be noted if it is difficult for the reader to conceive of
the development of mind on the earth similar to the development of
animals in the past let him think of the development of mind in the
individual there can certainly be no doubt of the development of mind
in an individual human being the infant when born shows little
manifestation of mentality but as its body grows its mind develops
becoming more and more complex as the individual grows to maturity
the world as dynamic the view of the world outlined above and held by
all scientific men of the present time may be termed the dynamic
view man formerly looked upon the world as static a world where
everything was fixed and final each thing existed in itself and for
itself and in large measure independent of all other things we now
look upon things and events as related and dependent each thing is
dependent upon others related to others
man not only lives in such a world but is part of such a world in
this world of constant and ceaseless change man is most sensitive and
responsive everything may affect him to all of the constant changes
about him he must adjust himself he has been produced by this world
and to live in it he must meet its every condition and change we must
then look upon human nature as something coming out of the past and as
being influenced every moment by the things and forces of the present
man is not an independent being unaffected by everything that happens
on the contrary he is affected by all influences that act upon him
among these influences may be mentioned weather climate food and
social forces
the condition of the various organs of a childs body determine to some
extent the effect which these various forces have upon it if a childs
eyes are in any way defective making vision poor this tremendously
influences his life not only is such a child unable to see the world as
it really is but the eyestrain resulting from poor vision has serious
effects on the child producing all sorts of disorders if a child
cannot hear well or is entirely deaf many serious consequences follow
in fact every condition or characteristic of a child that is in any way
abnormal may lead on to other conditions and characteristics often of a
serious nature the growth of adenoids for example may lead to a
serious impairment of the mind poor vision may affect the whole life
and character of the individual the influence of a parent teacher or
friend may determine the interest of a child and affect his whole life
the correct view of child life is that the child is affected in greater
or less degree by every influence which acts upon him
significance of development and causality what are the consequences of
the view just set forth what is the significance of the facts that have
been enumerated it is of great consequence to our thinking when we come
to recognize fully the idea of causality we then fully accept the fact
that mans body and mind are part of a causal and orderly world
let us consider for example the movement of a muscle every such
movement must be caused the physiologist has discovered what this cause
is ordinarily and normally a muscle contracts only when stimulated by
a nerve current tiny nerve fibrils penetrate every muscle ending in
the muscle fibers the nerveimpulse passing into the fibers of the
muscles causes them to contract the nerve stimulus itself has a cause
it ordinarily arises directly or indirectly from the stimulation of a
sense organ and the sense organs are stimulated by outside influences
as was explained previously
not only are our movements caused but our sensations our ideas and
our feelings follow upon or are dependent upon some definite bodily
state or condition the moment that we recognize this we see that our
sensations ideas and feelings are subject to control it is only
because our minds are in a world of causality and subject to its laws
that education is possible we can bring causes to bear upon a child and
change the child it is possible to build up ideas ideals and habits
and ideas ideals and habits constitute the man training is possible
only because a child is a being that can be influenced what any child
will be when grown depends upon what kind of child it was at the
beginning and upon the influences that affect it during its early life
while it is growing into maturity we need have no doubt about the
outcome of any particular child if we know with some degree of
completeness the two sets of factors that determine his lifehis
inheritance and the forces that affect this inheritance we can predict
the future of a child to the extent that we know and understand the
forces that will be effective in his life
the notion of causality puts new meaning into our view of the training
of a child the doctrine of development puts new meaning into our notion
of the nature of a child we can understand man only when we view him
genetically that is in the light of his origin we can understand a
child only in the light of what his ancestors have been
as these lines are being written the greatest the bloodiest war of
history is in progress men are killing men by thousands and hundreds of
thousands how can we explain such actions observation of children
shows that they are selfish envious and quarrelsome they will fight
and steal until they are taught not to do such things how can we
understand this there is no way of understanding such actions until we
come to see that the children and men of today are such as they are
because of their ancestors it has been only a few generations
relatively speaking since our ancestors were naked savages killing
their enemies and eating their enemies bodies the civilized life of
our ancestors covers a period of only a few hundred years the
precivilized life of our ancestors goes back probably thousands and
thousands of years in the relatively short period of civilization our
real original nature has been little changed perhaps none at all the
modern man is at heart the same old man of the woods
the improvements of civilization form what is called a social heritage
which must be impressed upon the original nature of each individual in
order to have any effect every child has to learn to speak to write
to dress to eat with knife and fork he must learn the various social
customs and to act morally as older people dictate the child is by
nature bad in the sense that the nature which he inherits from the past
fits him better for the original kind of life which man used to live
than it does for the kind of life which we are trying to live now this
view makes us see that training a child is in a very true sense
making him over again the child must be trained to subdue and control
his original impulses habits and ideals that will be suitable for life
in civilized society must be built up the doctrine of the bible in
regard to the original nature of man being sinful and the necessity of
regeneration is fundamentally correct but this regeneration is not so
much a sudden process as it is the result of long and patient
buildingup of habits and ideals
one should not despair of this view of childlife neither should one
use it as an excuse for being bad or for neglecting the training of
children on the contrary taking the genetic view of childhood should
give us certain advantages it makes us see more clearly the necessity
of training every child must be trained or he will remain very much a
savage in the absence of training all children are much alike and all
alike bad from our present point of view the chief differences in
children in politeness and manners generally in morals in industry
etc are due in the main to differences in training it is a great
help merely to know how difficult the task of training is and that
training there must be if we are to have a civilized child we must take
thought and plan for the education and training of our children the
task of education is in part one of changing human nature this is no
light task it is one that requires in the case of each child some
twenty years of hard patient persistent work
individual development heredity is a corollary of evolution individual
development is intimately related to racial development indeed racial
development would be impossible without heredity in the individual the
individual must carry on and transmit what the race hands down to him
this will be evident when we explain what heredity means
by heredity we mean the likeness between parent and offspring this
likeness is a matter of form and structure as well as likeness of action
or response animals and plants are like the parents in form and
structure and to a certain extent their responses are alike when the
individuals are placed in the same situation a robin is like the parent
robins in size shape and color it also hops like the parent birds
sings as they do feeds as they do builds a similar nest etc but the
likeness in action is dependent upon likeness in structure the young
robin acts as does the old robin because the nervous mechanism is the
same and therefore a similar stimulus brings about a similar response
most of the scientific work in heredity has been done in the study of
the transmission of physical characteristics the main facts of heredity
are evident to everybody but not many people realize how farreaching
is the principle of resemblance between parent and offspring from
horses we raise horses from cows we raise cows the children of human
beings are human not only is this true but the offspring of horses are
of the same stock as the parents not only are the colts of the same
stock as the parents but they resemble the parents in small details
this is also true of human beings we expect a child to be not only of
the same race as the parents but to have family resemblances to the
parentsthe same color of hair the same shape of head the same kind
of nose the same color of eyes and to have such resemblances as moles
in the same places on the skin etc a very little investigation reveals
likenesses between parent and offspring which we may not have expected
before
however if we start out to hunt for facts of heredity we shall perhaps
be as much impressed by differences between parent and child as we shall
by the resemblances in the first place every child has two parents
and it is often impossible to resemble both one cannot for example be
both short and tall one cannot be both fair and dark one cannot be
both slender and heavy one cannot have both brown eyes and blue in
some cases the child resembles one parent and not the other in other
cases the child looks somewhat like both parents but not exactly like
either if one parent is white and the other black the child is
neither as white as the one parent nor as black as the other
the parents of a child are themselves different but there are four
grandparents and each of them different from the others there are
eight great grandparents and all of them different if we go back only
seven generations covering a period of perhaps only a hundred and fifty
years we have one hundred and twentyeight ancestors if we go back ten
generations we have over a thousand ancestors in our line of descent
each of these people was in some measure different from the others
our inheritance comes from all of them and from each of them
how do all of these diverse characteristics work out in the child in
the first place it seems evident that we do not inherit our bodies as
wholes but in parts or units we may think of the human race as a whole
being made up of a great number of unit characters no one person
possesses all of them every person is lacking in some of them his
neighbor may be lacking in quite different ones now one parent
transmits to the child a certain combination of unit characters the
other parent a different combination these characteristics may not all
appear in the child but all are transmitted through it to the next
generation and they are transmitted purely by being transmitted
purely we mean that the characteristic does not seem to lose its
identity and disappear in fusions or mixtures the essential point in
this doctrine of heredity is known as mendelism it is the principle of
inheritance through the pure transmission of unit characters
an illustration will probably make the mendelian principle clear let us
select our illustration from the plant world it is found that if white
and yellow corn are crossed all the corn the first year resulting from
this crossing will be yellow now if this hybrid yellow corn is
planted the second year and freely crossfertilized it turns out that
one fourth of it will be white and three fourths yellow but this yellow
consists of three parts one part being pure yellow which will breed
true producing nothing but yellow the other two parts transmit white
and yellow in equal ratio that is to say these two parts are hybrids
the result of crossing white with yellow it is not meant that one can
actually distinguish these two kinds of yellow the pure yellow and the
hybrid yellow but the results from planting it show that one third of
the yellow is pure and that the other two thirds transmit white and
yellow in equal ratio
the main point to notice in all this is that when two individuals having
diverse characteristics are crossed the characteristics do not fuse and
disappear ultimately but that the two characteristics are transmitted
in equal ratio and each will appear in succeeding generations and will
appear pure just as if it had not been crossed with something
different the first offspring resulting from the crossknown as
hybridsmay show either one or the other of the diverse
characteristics or when such a thing is possible even a blending of
the two characteristics but whatever the actual appearance of the first
generation of offspring resulting from crossing parents having diverse
characteristics their germcells transmit the diverse characteristics
in equal proportion as explained above
when one of the diverse characteristics appears in the first generation
of offspring and the other does not appear or is not apparent the one
that appears is said to be dominant while the one not appearing is
said to be recessive in our example of the yellow and white corn
yellow is dominant and white recessive and it must be remembered that
the white corn that appears in the second generation will breed true
just as if it had never been crossed with the yellow corn one third of
the yellow of the second generation would also breed true if it could be
separated from the other two thirds
it is not here claimed that mendelism is a universal principle that all
characteristics are transmitted in this way however the results of the
numerous experiments in heredity lead one to expect this to be the case
most of the experiments have been with lower animals and with plants
but recent experiments and statistical studies show that mendelism is an
important factor in human heredity in such characteristics as color of
hair and eyes and skin partial color blindness defects of eye ear
and other important organs
the studies that have been made of human heredity have been for the
most part studies of the transmission of physical characteristics very
little has been done that bears directly upon the transmission of mental
characteristics but our knowledge of the dependence of mind upon body
should prepare us to infer mental heredity from physical heredity such
studies as throw light on the question bear us out in making such an
inference
the studies that have been more directly concerned with mental heredity
are those dealing with the resemblances of twins studies of heredity in
royalty studies of the inheritance of genius and studies of the
transmission of mental defects and defects of sense organs the results
of all these studies indicate the inheritance of mental characteristics
in the same way that physical characteristics are transmitted not only
are human mental characteristics transmitted from parent to offspring
but they seem to be transmitted in mendelian fashion
feeblemindedness for example seems to be a mendelian character and
recessive from the studies that have been made it seems that two
congenitally feebleminded parents will have only feebleminded
children feeblemindedness acts in heredity as does the white corn in
the example given above if one parent only is feebleminded the other
being normal all of the children will be normal just as all of the
corn in the first generation after the crossing was yellow but these
children whose parents are the one normal and the other feebleminded
while themselves normal transmit feeblemindedness in equal ratio with
normality it works out as follows if a feebleminded person marry a
person of sound mind and sound stock the children will all be of sound
normal mind if these children take as husbands and wives men and women
who had for parents one normal and one feebleminded person their
children will be one fourth feebleminded and three fourths of them
normal
to summarize the various conditions if a feebleminded person marry a
feebleminded person all the children will be feebleminded if a
feebleminded person marry a sound normal person pure stock all the
children will be normal if the children in the last case marry others
like themselves as to origin one fourth of their offspring will be
feebleminded if such hybrid children marry feebleminded persons one
half of the offspring will be feebleminded it is rash to prophesy but
future studies of heredity may show that mendelism or some
modification of the principle always holds true of mind as well as of
body
little can be said about the transmission of particular definite mental
traits such as the various aspects of memory association attention
temperament etc before we can speak with any certainty here we must
make very careful experimental studies of these mental traits in parents
and offspring no such work has been done all we have at the present
time is the result of general observation
improvement of the race eugenics is the science of improvement of the
human race by breeding while we can train children and thereby make
them much better than they would be without such training this training
does not improve the stock the improvement of the stock can be
accomplished only through breeding from the best and preventing the poor
stock from leaving offspring this is a wellknown principle in the
breeding of domestic animals
it is doubtless just as true in the case of human beings the hygienic
and scientific rearing of children is good for the children and makes
their lives better but probably does not affect their offspring we
should not forget that all the social and educational influences die
with the generation that receives them they must be impressed by
training on the next generation or that generation will receive no
influence from them the characters which we acquire in our lifetime
seem not to be transmitted to our children except through what is known
as social heredity which is merely the taking on of characteristics
through imitation our children must go through all the labor of
learning to read write spell add multiply subtract and divide
which we went through moral traits manners and customs and other
habits and ideals of social importance must be acquired by each
successive generation
heredity versus environment the question is often asked whether
heredity or the influence of environment has the most to do with the
final outcome of ones life it is a rather useless question to ask for
what a human being or anything else in the world does depends upon what
it is itself and what the things and forces are that act upon it
heredity sets a limitation for us fixes the possibilities the
circumstances of life determine what we will do with our inherited
abilities and characteristics hereditary influences incline us to be
tall or short fat or lean light or dark the characteristics of our
memory association imagination our learning capacity etc are
determined by heredity of course how far these various aspects develop
is to some extent dependent upon the favorable or unfavorable influences
of the environment what is possible for us to do is settled by
heredity what we may actually do what we may have the opportunity to
do is largely a matter of the circumstances of life
in certain parts of new england the number of men who become famous in
art science or literature is very great compared to the number in some
other parts of our country as far as we have any evidence the native
stocks are the same in the two cases but in new england the influences
turn men into the direction of science art and literature everything
there is favorable in other parts of the country the influences turn
men into other spheres of activity they become large landowners men of
business and affairs
the question may be asked whether genius makes its way to the front in
spite of unfavorable circumstances sometimes it doubtless does but
pugnacity and perseverance are not necessarily connected with
intellectual genius genius may be as likely to be timid as belligerent
therefore unfavorable circumstances may crush many a genius
the public schools ought to be on the watch for genius in any and all
kinds of work when a genius is found proper training ought to be
provided to develop this genius for the good of society as well as for
the good of the individual himself a few children show ability in
drawing and painting others in music others in mechanical invention
some in literary construction when it is found that this ability is
undoubtedly a native gift and not a passing whim special opportunity
should be provided for its development and training it will be better
for the general welfare as well as for individual happiness if each
does in life that for which he is by nature best fitted for most of us
however there is not much difference in our abilities we can do one
thing as well as we can many other things but in a few there are
undoubted special native gifts
  summary this is an orderly world in which everything has a cause
  all events are connected in a chain of causes and effects human
  beings live in this world of natural law and are subject to it
  human life is completely within this world of law and order and is a
  part of it education is possible only because we can change human
  beings by having influences act upon them
  individuals receive their original traits from their ancestors
  probably as parts or units mendelism is the doctrine of the pure
  transmission of unit characters eugenics is the science of
  improving the human race by selective breeding an individuals life
  is the result of the interaction of his hereditary characteristics
  and his environment

mind and body
gross dependence the relation of mind to body has always been an
interesting one to man this is partly because of the connection of the
question with that of life after death an old idea of this relation
almost universally held till recently was that the mind or spirit lived
in the body but was more or less independent of the body the body has
been looked upon as a hindrance to the mind or spirit science knows
nothing about the existence of spirits apart from bodies the belief
that after death the mind lives on is a matter of faith and not of
science whether one believes in an existence of the mind after death of
the body depends on ones religious faith there is no scientific
evidence one way or the other the only mind that science knows anything
about is bound up very closely with body this is not saying that there
is no existence of spirit apart from body but that at present such
existence is beyond the realm of science
the dependence of mind upon body in a general way is evident to every
one upon the most general observation and thought we know the effect
on the mind of disease of good health of hunger of fatigue of
overwork of severe bodily injury of blindness or deafness we have
perhaps seen some one struck upon the head by a club or run over by an
automobile and have noted the tremendous consequences to the persons
mind in such cases it sometimes happens that as far as we can see
there is no longer any mind in connection with that body the most
casual observation then shows that mind and body are in some way most
intimately related
finer dependence let us note this relation more in detail and in
particular see just which part of the body it is that is connected with
the mind first of all we note the dependence of mind upon sense
organs we see only with our eyes if we close the eyelids we cannot
see if we are born blind or if injury or disease destroys the retinas
of the eyes or makes the eyes opaque so that light cannot pass through
to the retinas then we cannot see
similarly we hear only by means of the ears if we are born deaf or if
injury destroys some important part of the hearing mechanism then we
cannot hear in like manner we taste only by means of the taste organs
in the mouth and smell only with the organs of smell in the nose in a
word our primary knowledge of the world comes only through the sense
organs we shall see presently just how this sensing or perceiving is
accomplished
dependence of mind on nerves and brain we have seen how in a general
way the mind is dependent on the body we have seen how in a more
intimate way it is dependent on the special sense organs but the part
of the body to which the mind is most directly and intimately related is
the nervous system the sense organs themselves are merely modifications
of the nerve ends together with certain mechanisms for enabling stimuli
to act on the nerve ends the eye is merely the optic nerve spread out
to form the retina and modified in certain ways to make it sensitive to
ether vibrations in addition to this there is of course the focusing
mechanism of the eye so for all the sense organs they are each of
them some sort of modification of nerveendings which makes them
sensitive to some particular force or substance
let us make the matter clear by an illustration suppose i see a picture
on the wall my eyes are directed toward the picture light from the
picture is refracted within the eyes forming an image on each retina
the retina is sensitive to the light the light produces chemical
changes on the retina these changes set up an excitation in the optic
nerves which is conducted to a certain place in the brain causing an
excitation in the brain now the important point is that when this
excitation is going on in the brain we are conscious we see the
picture
as far as science can determine we do not see nor hear nor taste nor
smell nor have any other sensation unless a sense organ is excited and
produces the excitation in the brain there can be no doubt about our
primary sensory experience by primary sensory experience is meant our
immediate direct knowledge of any aspect of the world in this field of
our conscious life we are entirely dependent upon sense organs and
nerves and brain injuries to the eyes destroying their power to perform
their ordinary work or injuries to the optic nerve or to the visual
center in the brain make it impossible for us to see
these facts are so selfevident that it seems useless to state them one
has but to hold his hands before his eyes to convince himself that the
mind sees by means of eyes which are physical sense organs one has but
to hold his hands tight over his ears to find out that he hears by
means of earsagain physical sense organs
but simple and selfevident as the facts are their acceptance must have
tremendous consequences to our thinking and to our view of human
nature if the mind is dependent in every feature on the body with its
sense organs this must give to this body and its sense organs an
importance in our thought and scheme of things that they did not have
before this close dependence of mind upon body must give to the body a
place in our scheme of education that it would not have under any other
view of the mind we wish to emphasize here that this statement of the
close relation of the mind and body is not a theory which one may accept
or not it is a simple statement of fact it is a presupposition of
psychology by presupposition is meant a fundamental principle which
the psychologist always has in mind it is axiomatic and has the same
place in psychology that axioms have in mathematics all explanations of
the working of the mind must be stated in terms of nerve and brain
action and stimulation of sense organs
since the sense organs are the primary and fundamental organs through
which we get experience and since the sensations are the elementary
experiences out of which all mental life is built it is necessary for
us to have a clear idea of the sense organs their structure and
functions and of the nature of sensations
vision the visual sense organs the details of the anatomy of the eye
can be looked up in a physiological textbook the essential principles
are very simple the eye is made on the principle of a photographers
camera the retina corresponds to the sensitive plate of the camera the
light coming from objects toward which the eyes are directed is focused
on the retina forming there an image of the object the light thus
focused on the retina sets up a chemical change in the delicate nerve
tissue this excitation is transmitted through the optic nerve to the
occipital back part of the brain and sets up brain action there then
we have visual sensation we see the object
the different colors that we see are dependent upon the vibration
frequency of the ether the higher frequencies give us the colors blue
and green and the lower frequencies give us the colors yellow and red
the intermediate frequencies give us the intermediate colors bluegreen
and orange by vibration frequencies is meant the rate at which the
ether vibrates the number of vibrations a second if the reader wishes
to know something about these frequencies such information can be found
in a textbook on physics
it will be found that the vibration rates of the ether are very great
it is only within a certain range of vibration frequency that sunlight
affects the retina slower rates of vibration than that producing red do
not affect the eye and faster than that producing violet do not affect
the eye the lightness and darkness of a color are dependent upon the
intensity of the vibration red for example is produced by a certain
vibration frequency the more intense the vibration the brighter the
red the less intense the darker the red
when all the vibration frequencies affect the eyes at the same time we
see no color at all but only brightness this is due to the fact that
certain vibration frequencies neutralize each other in their effect on
the retina so far as producing color is concerned red neutralizes
green blue neutralizes yellow violet neutralizes yellowish green
orange neutralizes bluish green
all variations in vision as far as color and brightness are concerned
are due to variations in the stimulus changes in vibration frequency
give the different colors changes in intensity give the different
brightnesses black gray and white all explanations of the many
interesting phenomena of vision are to be sought in the physiological
action of the eye
besides the facts of color and light and shade already mentioned some
further interesting visual phenomena may be mentioned here
visual contrast every color makes objects near it take on the
antagonistic or complementary color red makes objects near appear
green green makes them appear red blue makes near objects appear
yellow while yellow makes them appear blue orange induces greenish
blue and greenish blue induces orange violet induces yellowish green
and yellowish green induces violet these colorpairs are known as
antagonistic or complementary colors each one of a pair enhances the
effect of its complementary when the two colors are brought close
together in a similar way light and dark tints act as complementaries
light objects make dark objects near appear darker and dark objects
make light objects near seem lighter
these universal principles of contrast are of much practical
significance they must be taken account of in all arrangements of
colors and tints for example in dress in the arrangement of flowers
and shrubs in painting
colormixture if on a rotating motor disks of different colorssay
red and yelloware placed and rotated one sees on looking at them not
red or yellow but orange this phenomenon is known as colormixture
the result is due to the simultaneous stimulation of the retina by two
kinds of ether vibration if the colors used are a certain red and a
certain green they neutralize each other and produce only gray all the
pairs of complementary colors mentioned above act in the same way
producing if mixed in the right proportion no color but gray if
colored disks not complementary are mixed by rotation on a motor they
produce an intermediate color red and yellow give orange blue and
green give bluish green yellow and green give yellowish green red and
blue give violet or purple depending on the proportion mixing pigments
gives in general the same results as mixing by means of rotating the
disks the ordinary blue and yellow pigments give green when mixed
because each of the two pigments contains green the blue and yellow
neutralize each other leaving green
visual afterimages the stimulation of the retina has interesting
after effects we shall mention here only the one known as negative
afterimages if one will place on the table a sheet of white paper
and on this white paper lay a small piece of colored paper and if he
will then gaze steadily at the colored paper for a halfminute it will
be found that if the colored paper is removed one sees its complementary
color if the head is not moved this complementary color has the same
size and shape as the original colored piece of paper the negative
afterimage can be projected on a background at different distances its
size depending on the distance of the background the afterimage will
be found to mix with an objective color in accordance with the
principles of colormixture mentioned above
afterimage phenomena have some practical consequences if one has been
looking at a certain color for some time a halfminute or more then
looks at some other color the afterimage of the first color mixes with
the second color
adaptation the fact last mentioned leads us to the subject of
adaptation if the eyes are stimulated by the same kind of light for
some time the eyes become adapted to that light if the light is
yellow at first objects seem yellow but after a time they look as if
they were illuminated with white light losing the yellow aspect but if
one then goes out into white light everything looks bluish the
negative afterimage of the yellow being cast upon everything makes the
surroundings look blue for the afterimage of yellow is blue all the
other colors act in a similar way as do also black and white if one
has been for some time in a dark room and then goes out to a lighter
place it seems unusually light and if one goes from the light to a
dark room it seems unusually dark
hearing or audition just as the eye is an organ sensitive to certain
frequencies of ether vibration so the ear is an organ sensitive to
certain air vibrations the reader should familiarize himself with the
physiology of the ear by reference to physiologies the drumskin the
three little bones of the middle ear and the cochlea of the inner ear
are all merely mechanical means of making possible the stimulation of
the specialized endings of the auditory nerve by vibrations of air
as the different colors are due to different vibration frequencies of
the ether so different pitches of sound are due to differences in the
rates of the air vibrations the low bass notes are produced by the low
vibration frequencies the high notes are produced by the high
vibration frequencies the lowest notes that we can hear are produced by
about twenty vibrations a second and the highest by about forty
thousand vibrations a second
other sense organs we need not give a detailed statement of the facts
concerning the other senses in each case the sense organ is some
special adaptation of the nerveendings with appropriate apparatus in
connection to enable it to be affected by some special thing or force in
the environment
in the case of taste we find in the mouth chiefly on the back and
edges of the tongue organs sensitive to sweet sour salt and bitter
in the nose we have an organ that is sensitive to the tiny particles of
substances that float in the air which we breathe in through the nose
in the skin we find several kinds of sense organs that give us the
sensations of cold and warmth of pressure and pain these are all
special and definite sensations produced by different kinds of organs
the sense of warmth is produced by different organs from those which
produce the sense of cold these organs can be detected and localized on
the skin so also pain and touch or pressure have each its particular
organ
within the body itself we have sense organs also particularly in the
joints and tendons and in the muscles these give us the sensations
which are the basis of our perception of motion and of the position of
the body and its members in the semicircular canals of the inner ear
are organs that give us the sense of dizziness and enable us to
maintain our equilibrium and to know up from down
the general nature of the sense organs and of sensation should now be
apparent the nervous system reaches out its myriad fingers to every
portion of the surface of the body and within the body as well these
nerveendings are specially adapted to receive each its particular form
of stimulation this stimulation of our sense organs is the basis or
cause of our sensations and our sensations are the elementary stuff of
all our experience whatever thoughts we have whatever ideas or images
we have they come originally from our sensations they are built up out
of our sensations or from these sensations as they exist in memory
defects of sense organs the organs of sight and hearing are now by far
the most important of our sense organs they enable us to sense things
that are at a distance we shall therefore discuss defects of these two
organs only since sensations are the primary stuff out of which mind is
made and since sight and hearing are the most important sense organs
it is evident that our lives are very much dependent on these organs if
they cannot do their work well then we are handicapped and this is
often the case
the making of the human eye is one of the most remarkable achievements
of nature but the making of a perfect eye is too big a task for nature
she never makes a perfect eye there is always some defect large or
small to take plastic material and make lenses and shutters and
curtains is a great task the curvature of the front of the eye and of
the front and back of the crystalline lens is never quite perfect but
in the majority of cases it is nearly enough perfect to give us good
vision however in about one third of school children the defect is
great enough to need to be corrected by glasses
the principle of the correction of sight by means of glasses is merely
this1 when the focusing apparatus of the eye is not perfect it can
be made so by putting in front of the eye the proper kind of lens there
is nothing strange or mysterious about it in some cases the eye
focuses the light before it reaches the retina such cases are known as
nearsightedness and are corrected by having placed in front of the eyes
concave lenses of the proper strength these lenses diverge the rays and
make them focus on the retina in other cases the eye is not able to
focus the rays by the time they reach the retina in these cases the
eyes need the help of convex lenses of the proper strength to make the
focus fall exactly on the retina
1 the teacher should explain these principles and illustrate by
drawings consult a good text in physiology noyes university of
missouri extension bulletin on eye and ear defects will be found most
useful
another defect of the eye known as astigmatism is due to the fact that
the eye does not always have a perfectly spherical front cornea the
curvature in one direction is different from that in others for
example the vertical curvature may be more convex than the horizontal
such a condition produces a serious defect of vision it can be
corrected by means of cylindrical lenses of the proper strength so
placed before the eye as to correct the defect in curvature
still another defect of vision is known as presbyopia or farsightedness
due to old age it has the following explanation in early life when we
look at near objects the crystalline lens automatically becomes
thicker more convex this adjustment brings the rays to a focus on the
retina which is required for good vision as we get old the
crystalline lens loses its power to change its adjustment for near
objects although the eye may see at a distance as well as ever the
old person therefore must wear convex glasses when looking at near
objects as in reading and sewing
another visual defect of a different nature is known as partial color
blindness the defects described above are due to misshapen eyes
partial color blindness is due to a defect of the retina which makes it
unable to be affected by light waves producing red and green a person
with this defect confuses red and green while only a small percentage
of the population has this defect it is nevertheless very important
that those having it be detected people having the defect should not be
allowed to enter occupations in which the seeing of red and green is
important it was recently brought to the authors attention that a
partially colorblind man was selling stamps in a post office since two
denominations of stamps are distinguished by red and green colors this
man made frequent mistakes he was doing one of the things for which he
was specially unfitted it is easy to detect color blindness by simple
tests
so great is the importance of good vision in school work and the later
work of life that every teacher should know how to make simple tests to
determine visual defects children showing any symptoms of eyestrain
should be required to have their visual defects corrected by a competent
oculist and should be warned not to have the correction made by a
quack there is great popular ignorance and even prejudice concerning
visual defects and it is very important that teachers have a clear
understanding of the facts
defects of hearing hearing defects are only about half as frequent as
those of sight they are nearly all due to catarrhal infection of the
middle ear through the eustachian tube the careful and frequent
medical examination of school children cannot therefore be too
strongly emphasized the deafness or partial deafness that comes from
this catarrhal infection can seldom be cured it must be prevented by
the early treatment of the troubles which cause it
  summary the mind is closely related to the body especially is it
  dependent upon the brain nerves and sense organs the sense organs
  are special adaptations of the nerveends for receiving impressions
  each sense organ receives only its particular type of impression
  the main visual phenomena are those of colormixture afterimages
  adaptation and contrast since sensation is the basis of mental
  life defects of the sense organs are serious handicaps and should
  be corrected if possible visual defects are usually due to a
  misshapen eyeball and can be corrected by proper glasses which
  should be fitted by an oculist hearing defects usually arise from
  catarrhal trouble in the middle ear
class exercises
1 make a study of the relation of the mind to the body enumerate the
different lines of evidence which you may find indicating their close
relationship
2 can you find any evidence tending to show that the mind is
independent of the body
3 colormixture colored disks can be procured from c h stoelting
company chicago if a small motor is available the disks can be
rotated on the motor and the colors mixed mix pairs of complementary
colors also pairs of noncomplementary colors and note the result a
simple device can be made for mixing colors as follows on a board
stand a pane of glass on one side of the glass put a colored paper and
on the other side of the glass put a different color by looking through
the glass you can see one color through transmitted light and the other
color through reflected light by inclining the glass at different
angles you can get different proportions of the mixture now more of one
color now more of the other
4 negative afterimages cut out pieces of colored paper a half inch
square put one of these on a white background on the table with elbows
on the table hold the head in the hands and gaze at the colored paper
for about a halfminute then blow the paper away and continue to gaze
at the white background note the color that appears use different
colors and tabulate the results try projecting the afterimages at
different distances project the afterimages on different colored
papers do the afterimages mix with the colors of the papers
5 an interesting experiment with positive afterimages can be performed
as follows shut yourself in a dark closet for fifteen or twenty minutes
to remove all trace of stimulation of the retina with the eyes covered
with several folds of thick black cloth go to a window uncover the eyes
and take a momentary look at the landscape immediately covering the
eyes again the landscape will appear as a positive afterimage with
the positive colors and lights and shades the experiment is best
performed on a bright day
6 adaptation put on colored glasses or hold before the eyes a large
piece of colored glass note that at first everything takes on the color
of the glass what change comes over objects after the glasses have been
worn for fifteen or twenty minutes describe your experience after
removing the glasses plan and perform other experiments showing
adaptation for illustration go from a very bright room into a dark
room go from a very dark room to a light one describe your experience
7 contrast take a medium gray paper and lay it on white and various
shades of gray and black paper describe and explain what you find
8 color contrast darken a room by covering all the windows except
one window pane cover it with cardboard in the cardboard cut two
windows six inches long and one inch wide over one window put colored
glass or any other colored material through which some light will pass
by holding up a pencil you can cast two shadows on a piece of paper
what color are the shadows one is a contrast color induced by the
other which one explain the results
9 make a study of the way in which women dress what do you learn about
color effects
10 from the stoelting company you can obtain the holmgren worsteds for
studying color blindness
11 defective vision procure a snellens test chart and determine the
visual acuity of the members of the class seat the subject twenty feet
from the chart which should be placed in a good light while testing
one eye cover the other with a piece of cardboard above each row of
letters on the chart is a number which indicates the distance at which
it can be read by a normal eye if the subject can read only the
thirtyfoot line his vision is said to be 2030 if only the fortyfoot
line the vision is 2040 if the subject can read above the twentyfoot
line and complains of headache from reading farsightedness is
indicated if the subject cannot read up to the twentyfoot line
nearsightedness or astigmatism is indicated
12 hearing by consultation with the teacher of physics plan an
experiment to show that the pitch of tones depends on vibration
frequency such an experiment can be very simply performed by rotating a
wheel having spokes hold a light stick against the spokes so that it
strikes each spoke if the wheel is rotated so as to give twenty or
thirty strokes a second a very low tone will be heard by rotating the
wheel faster you get a higher tone other similar experiments can be
performed
13 acuity of hearing can be tested by finding the distance at which the
various members of the class can hear a watchtick the teacher can plan
an experiment using whispering instead of the watchtick see the
authors examination of school children
14 by using the point of a nail one can find the cold spots on the
skin warm the nail to about 40 degrees centigrade and you can find the
warm spots
15 by touching the hairs on the back of the hand you can stimulate the
pressure spots
16 by pricking the skin with the point of a needle you can stimulate
the pain spots
17 the sense of taste is sensitive only to solutions that are sweet
sour salt or bitter plan experiments to verify this point what we
call the taste of many things is due chiefly to odor therefore in
experiments with taste the nostrils should be stopped up with cotton
it will be found for example that quinine and coffee are
indistinguishable if their odors be eliminated by stopping the nose the
student should compare the taste of many substances put into the mouth
with the nostrils open with the taste of the same substances with the
nostrils closed

inherited tendencies
stimulus and response we have learned something about the sense organs
and their functions we have seen that it is through the sense organs
that the world affects us stimulates us and we have said that we are
stimulated in order that we may respond
we must now inquire into the nature of our responses we are moving
active beings but how do we move how do we act when stimulated why do
we do one thing rather than another why do we do one thing at one time
and a different thing at another time
before we answer these questions it will be necessary for us to get a
more definite and complete idea of the nature of stimulus and response
we have already used these terms but we must now give a more definite
account of them it was said in the preceding chapter that when a muscle
contracts it must first receive a nerveimpulse now anything which
starts this nerveimpulse is called the stimulus the muscular movement
which follows is of course the response the nervous system forms the
connection between the stimulus and response
the stimulus which brings about a response may be very simple or on
the other hand it may be very complex if one blows upon the eyelids of
a baby the lids automatically close the blowing is the stimulus and
the closing of the lids is the response both stimulus and response are
here very simple
but sometimes the stimulus is more complex not merely the simple
excitation of one sense organ but a complicated stimulation of an
organ or the simultaneous stimulation of several organs in playing
ball the stimulus for the batter is the oncoming ball the response is
the stroke this case is much more complex than the reflex closing of
the eyelids the ball may be pitched in many different ways and the
response changes with these variations
in piano playing the stimulus is the notes written in their particular
places on the staff not only must the position of the notes on the
staff be taken into account but also many other things such as sharps
and flats and various characters which give directions as to the manner
in which the music is to be played the striking of the notes in the
proper order in the proper time and with the proper force is the
response
in typewriting the stimulus is the copy or the idea of what is to be
written and the response is the striking of the keys in the proper
order speaking generally we may say that the stimulus is the force or
forces which excite the sense organs and thereby through the nervous
system bring about a muscular response
this is the ordinary type of action but we have already indicated a
different type in speaking of typewriting we said the stimulus might be
either the copy or ideas one can write from copy or dictation in which
the stimulus is the written or spoken word but one can also write as
one thinks of what one wishes to write the latter is known as
centrally initiated action that is to say the stimulus comes from
within in the brain rather than from without
let us explain this kind of stimulation a little further suppose i am
sitting in my chair reading i finish a chapter and look at my watch i
notice that it is three oclock and recall that i was to meet a friend
at that time the stimulus in this case is in the brain itself it is
the nervous activity which corresponds to the idea of meeting my friend
if we disregard the distinction between mind and body we may say that
the stimulus for a response may be an idea as well as a perception the
perception arising from the immediate stimulation of a sense organ and
the idea arising from an excitation of the brain not caused by an
immediate stimulation of a sense organ
instincts and habits in human action it is evident that there is always
a stimulus to start the nerveimpulse which causes the action if we
make inquiry concerning the connection between the stimulus and
response if we ask how it has come about that a particular stimulus
causes a particular response rather than some other possible response
we find two kinds of causes in one case the causal connection is
established through heredity in the other the causal connection is
established during a persons lifetime through training
a chicken for example hides under some cover the first time it hears
the cry of a hawk it scratches the first time its feet touch sand or
gravel it pecks the first time it sees an insect near by an infant
closes its eyes the first time it feels cold wind blow upon them it
cries the first time it feels pain it clasps its fingers together the
first time a touch is felt inside them the childs nervous system is so
organized that in each of the cases named the stimulus brings forth
the particular definite response these acts do not have to be
learned
but it is quite different in typewriting and piano playing one must
learn what keys on the piano to strike in response to the various
situations of the notes as written in the music one must also learn the
keys on the typewriter before he can operate a typewriter and in the
case of other habits we find for example that one does not respond by
saying 81 for 9 times 9 nor 13 for 6 plus 7 nor 8 for 15 minus
7 nor 8 for the square root of 64 nor 144 for the square of 12
etc until one has learned in each case
some connections between stimulus and response we have through
inheritance all others are built up and established in ones lifetime
particularly in the first thirty years of ones life
we have spoken of bonds between stimulus and response but have not
explained just what can be meant by a bond in what sense are stimulus
and response bound together a bond is a matter of greater permeability
of less resistance in one direction through the nervous system than in
other directions nerves are conductors for nervecurrents when a
nervecurrent is started in a sense organ it passes on through the path
of least resistance
now some nerves are so organized and connected through inheritance as
to offer small resistance this forms a readymade connection between
stimulus and response muscular responses that are connected with their
stimuli through inherited bonds by inherited nerve structure are
called instincts those that are connected by acquired bonds are called
habits sucking crying laughing are instinctive acts adding
typewriting piano playing are habits
the term instinct may be given to the act depending upon inherited
structure an inherited bond or it may be given to the inherited bond
itself similarly the term habit may be given to an act that we have
had to learn or to the bond which we ourselves establish between
response and stimulus in this book we shall usually mean by instinct an
action depending upon inherited structure and by habit an act depending
upon a bond established during lifetime a good part of our early lives
is spent in building up bonds between stimuli and responses this
establishing of bonds or connections is called learning
appearance of inherited tendencies not all of our inherited tendencies
are manifested immediately after birth nor indeed in the earliest years
of childhood but appear at different stages of the childs growth it
has already been said that a child soon after birth will close its
eyelids when they are blown upon the lids do not close at this time if
one strikes at them but they will do this later the proper working of
an instinct or an inherited tendency then depends upon the childs
having reached a certain state of development
the maturing of an instinct depends upon both age and use that is to
say upon the age of the animal and the amount of use or exercise that
the instinctive activity has had the most important factor however
seems to be age while our knowledge of the dependence of an instinct
upon the age of the animal is not quite so definite in the case of human
instincts the matter has been worked out in the case of chickens
the experiment was as follows chickens were taken at the time of
hatching and some allowed to peck from the first while others were
kept in a dark room and not allowed to peck when the chickens were
taken out of the dark room at the end of one two three and four days
it was found that in a few hours they were pecking as well as those
that had been pecking from birth it seems probable if we may judge
from our limited knowledge that in the human child activities are for
the most part dependent upon the age of the child and upon the state of
development of the nervous system and of the organs of the body
significance of inherited tendencies although human nature is very
complex although human action nearly always has some element of habit
in it nevertheless inborn tendencies are throughout life powerful
factors in determining action this will at once be apparent if we
consider how greatly we are influenced by anger jealousy love fear
and competition now we do not have to learn to be jealous to hate to
love to be envious to fight or to fear these are emotions common to
all members of the human race and their expression is an inborn
tendency throughout life no other influences are so powerful in
determining our action as are these so although most of our detailed
actions in life are habits which we learn or acquire the fundamental
influences which decide the course of our action are inherited
tendencies
classification of instincts for convenience in treatment the instincts
are grouped in classes those instincts most closely related to
individual survival are called individualistic instincts those more
closely related to the survival of the group are called socialistic
those individualistic tendencies growing out of periodic changes of the
environment may be called environmental instincts those closely
related to human infancy adapting and adjusting the child to the world
in which he lives may be called adaptive there is still another
group of inherited tendencies connected with sex and reproduction which
are not discussed in this book
we shall give a brief discussion of the instincts falling under these
various classes it must be remembered however that the psychology of
the instincts is indefinite and obscure it is difficult to bring the
instincts into the laboratory for accurate study for our knowledge of
the instincts we are dependent for the most part on general
observation we have had a few careful studies of the very earliest
years of childhood however although from the theoretical point of view
our knowledge of the instincts is incomplete it is sufficient to be of
considerable practical value
the individualistic instincts mans civilized life has covered but a
short period of time only a few hundred or a few thousand years his
precivilized life doubtless covered a period of millions of years the
inborn tendencies in us are such as were developed in the long period of
savage life during all of mans life in the time before civilization
he was always in danger he had many enemies and most of these enemies
had the advantage of him in strength and natural means of defense
unaided by weapons he could hardly hold his own against any of the
beasts of prey so there were developed in man by the process of natural
selection many inherited responses which we group under the head of
fear responses
just what the various situations are that bring forth these responses
has never been carefully worked out but any situation that suddenly
puts an individual in danger of losing his life brings about
characteristic reactions the most characteristic of the responses are
shown in connection with circulation and respiration both of these
processes are much interfered with sometimes the action is accelerated
at other times it is retarded and in some cases the respiratory and
circulatory organs are almost paralyzed also the small muscles of the
skin are made to contract producing the sensation of the hair standing
on end just what the original use of all these responses was it is
difficult now to work out but doubtless each served some useful
purpose
whether any particular situations now call forth inherited fear
responses in us is not definitely established but among lower animals
there are certain definite and particular situations which do call forth
fear responses on the whole the evidence rather favors the idea of
definite fear situations among children it seems that certain
situations do invariably arouse fear responses to be alone in the dark
to be in a strange place to hear loud and sudden noises to see large
strange animals coming in threatening manner seem universally to call
forth fear responses in children
however the whole situation must always be considered a situation in
which the father or mother is present is quite different from one in
which they are both absent but it is certain that these and other fears
are closely related to the age and development of the child in the
earlier years of infancy certain fears are not present that are present
later and it can be demonstrated that the fears that do arise as
infancy passes on are natural and inherited and not the result of
experience
few of the original causes of fear now exist the original danger was
from wild animals chiefly seldom are we now in such danger but of
course this has been the case for only a short time our bodies are the
same sort of bodies that our ancestors had therefore we are full of
needless fears during the early years of a childs life wise treatment
causes most of the fear tendencies to disappear because of disuse on
the other hand unwise treatment may accentuate and perpetuate them
causing much misery and unhappiness neither the home nor the school
should play upon these ancestral fears we should not try to get a child
to be good by frightening him nor should we often use fear of pain as
an incentive to get a child to do his work
man has always been afraid but he has also always been a fighter he
has always had to fight for his life against the lower animals and he
has also fought his fellow man the fighting response is connected with
the emotions of anger envy and jealousy a man is angered by anything
that interferes with his life with his purposes with whatever he calls
his own we become angry if some one strikes our bodies or attacks our
beliefs or the beliefs of our dear friends particularly of our
families the typical responses connected with anger are such as faster
heartbeat irregular breathing congestion of the blood in the face and
head tightening of the voluntary muscles particularly a setting of the
teeth and a clinching of the fists these responses are preparatory to
actual combat
anger envy and jealousy and the responses growing out of them have
always played a large part in the life of man a great part of history
is a record of the fights of nations tribes and individuals if the
records of wars and strifes and the acts growing out of envy and
jealousy and other similar emotions should be taken out of history
there would not be much left much of literature and art depict those
actions of man which grew out of these individualistic aspects of his
nature competition which is an aspect of fighting even to the present
day continues to be one of the main factors in business and in life
generally briefly fighting responses growing out of mans selfishness
are as old as man himself and the inherited tendencies connected with
them are among the strongest of our natures
in the training of children one of the most difficult tasks is to help
them to get control over the fighting instinct and other selfish
tendencies these tendencies are so deeply rooted in our natures that it
is hard to get control of them in fact the control which we do get
over them is always relative the best we can hope to do is to get
control over our fighting tendencies in ordinary circumstances
it is doubtful whether it would be good for us if the fighting spirit
should disappear from the race it puts vim and determination into the
life of man but our fighting should not be directed against our fellow
man the fighting spirit can be retained and directed against evil and
other obstacles we can learn to attack our tasks in a fighting spirit
but surely the time has come when we should cease fighting against our
neighbors
social tendencies over against our fighting tendencies we may set the
socialistic tendencies coperative and sympathetic actions grow out of
original nature just as truly as do the selfish acts but the
socialistic tendencies are not in general as strong as are the
individualistic ones what society needs is the strengthening of the
socialistic tendencies by use and a weakening of at least some of the
individualistic tendencies by control and disuse
socialistic tendencies show themselves in gangs and clubs formed by
children and adults it is therefore a common practice now to speak of
the gang instinct human beings are pleased and content when with
other human beings and not content not satisfied when alone of course
circumstances make a difference in the desires of men but the general
original tendency is as stated
the gang of the modern city has the following explanation boys like to
be with other boys moreover they like to be active they want to be
doing something the city does not provide proper means for the desired
activities such as hunting fishing tramping and boating it does not
provide experiences with animals such as boys have on the farm much of
the boys day is spent in school in a kind of work not at all like what
he would do by choice there is not much home life usually there is not
the proper parental control seldom do the parents interest themselves
in planning for the activities of their children the result is that the
boys come together on the streets and form a club or gang through this
organization the boys nature expresses itself without proper guidance
from older people this expression takes a direction not good for the
future character and usefulness of the boy
the social life of children should be provided for by the school in
coperation with the home the school or the schoolroom should
constitute a social unit the teacher with the parents should plan the
social life of the children the actual work of the school can be very
much socialized there can be much more coperation and much more group
work can be done in the school than is the case at present and many
other social activities can be organized in connection with the school
and its work excursions pageants shows picnics and all sorts of
activities should be undertaken
the schoolhouse should be used by the community as the place for many of
its social acts and performances almost every night and throughout the
summer as well as in the winter the people young and old should meet
at the school for some sort of social work or play the boy scouts
should be brought under the control of the school to help fulfill some
of its main purposes
environmental instincts in this class there are at least two tendencies
which seem to be part of the original nature of man namely the
wandering and the collecting tendencies
wandering the long life that our ancestors lived free and
unrestrained in the woods has left its effect within us one of the
greatest achievements of civilization has been to overcome the inherited
tendencies to roam and wander to the extent that for the most part we
live out our lives in one home in one family doing often but one kind
of work all our lives originally man had much more freedom to come and
go and do whatever he wished
truancies and runaways are the result of original tendencies and desires
expressing themselves in spite of training perhaps sometimes because of
the lack of training in childhood and youth these original tendencies
should to some extent be satisfied in legitimate ways excursions and
picnics can be planned both for work and for play if the childs
desires and needs can be satisfied in legitimate ways then he will not
have to satisfy them illegitimately the teaching itself can be done
better by following to some extent the lead of the childs nature
much early education consists in learning the world now most of the
world is out of doors and the child must go out to find it the teacher
should make use of the natural desires of the children to wander and
explore as a means of educating them the school work should be of such
a nature that much outdoor work will need to be done
collecting it is in the nature of children to seize and if possible
carry away whatever attracts attention this tendency is the basis of
what is called the collecting instinct if one will take a walk with a
child one can observe the operation of the collecting tendency
particularly if the walk is in the fields and woods the child will be
observed to take leaves flowers fruits seeds nuts pebbles and in
fact everything that is loose or can be gotten loose they are taken at
first aimlessly merely because they attract attention the original
natural response of the child toward that which attracts attention is
usually to get it get possession of it and take it along it is easy to
see why such tendencies were developed in man in his savage state it
was highly useful for him to do this he must always have been on the
lookout for things which could be used as food or as weapons he had to
do this to live but one need not take a child to the woods to observe
this tendency one can go to the stores till a child is trained not to
do it he seizes and takes whatever attracts attention
just as the wandering tendencies can be used for the benefit of the
child so can the collecting tendencies not only should the children
make expeditions to learn of the world but specimens should be
collected so that they can be used to form a museum at the school which
will represent the surrounding locality geological geographical
botanical and zological specimens should be collected the children
will learn much while making the collections and much from the
collections after they are made
education could profit greatly by making large demands upon the
collecting instinct it seems clear that in their childhood is the time
when children should be sent forth to the fields and woods to study
what they find there and to gather specimens the children can form
naturalists clubs for the purpose of studying the natural environment
such study should embrace rocks soils plants leaves flowers fruits
and specimens of the wood of the various trees birds and insects can be
studied and collected the work of such a club would have a twofold
value 1 the study and collecting acquaint the child with his natural
environment and in doing it afford a sphere for the activity of many
aspects of his nature they take him out of doors and give an
opportunity for exploring every nook and corner of the natural
environment the collecting can often be done in such a way as to appeal
to the group instincts for example the club could hold meetings for
exhibiting and studying the specimens and sometimes the actual
collecting could be done in groups 2 the specimens collected should
be put into the school museum and the aim of this museum should be to
represent completely the local environment the natural and physical
environment and also the industrial civil and social environment the
museum should be completely illustrative of the childs natural
physical and social surroundings the museum would therefore be
educative in its making and when it is made it would have immense
value to the community not only to the children but to all the people
in this museum of course should be found the minerals rocks soils
insectsparticularly those of economic importancebirds and also
specimens of the wild animals of the locality if proper appeal is made
to the natural desire of the children this instinct would soon be made
of service in producing a very valuable collection the school museum in
which these specimens are placed should also include other classes of
specimens there should be specimens showing industrial evolution the
stages of manufacture of raw material specimens of local historical
interest pictures documents books the museum should be made of such
a nature that parents would go there nearly as often as the children
the school should be for the instruction of all the people of the
community it should be the experiment station the library the
debating club the art gallery for the whole community2

imitation one of the fundamental original traits of human nature is the
tendency to imitate imitation is not instinctive in the strict meaning
of the word seeing a certain act performed does not apart from
training and experience serve as a stimulus to make a child perform a
similar act hearing a certain sound does not serve as a stimulus for
the production of the same sound nevertheless there is in the human
child a tendency or desire to do what it sees others doing
a few hours spent in observing children ought to convince any one of the
universality and of the strength of this tendency as our experience
becomes organized the idea of an act usually serves as the stimulus to
call it forth however this is not because the idea of an act of
necessity always produces the act it is merely a matter of the
stimulus and the response becoming connected in that way as the result
of experience our meaning is that an act can be touched off or prompted
by any stimulus our nervous organization makes this possible the
particular stimulus that calls forth a particular response depends upon
how we have been trained how we have learned in most cases our acts
are coupled up with the ideas of the acts we learn them that way
in early life particularly the connection between stimulus and response
is very close when a child gets the idea of an act he immediately
performs the act if he knows how now seeing another perform an act
brings the act clearly into the childs consciousness and he proceeds
to perform it but the act must be one which the child already knows how
to perform otherwise his performance of it will be faulty and
incomplete if he has never performed the particular act seeing another
perform the act sets him to trying to do it and he may soon learn it if
he successfully performs an act when he sees it done by another the act
must be one which he already knows how to perform and for whose
performance the idea has already served as a stimulus now if imitation
were instinctive in the strict sense one could perform the act for the
first time merely from seeing another do it without any previous
experience or learning it is doubtful whether there are any such
inherited connections it is however true that human beings are of
such a nature that particularly in early life they like to do and
want to do what they see others doing this is one of the most
important aspects of human nature as we shall see
function and importance of imitation in life natural selection has
developed few aspects of human nature so important for survival as the
tendency to imitate for this tendency quickly leads to a successful
adjustment of the child to the world in which he lives adult men and
women are successfully adjusted to their environment their adjustment
might be better but it is good enough to keep them alive for a time
now if children do as they see their parents doing they will reach a
satisfactory adjustment we may therefore say that the tendency to
imitate serves to adjust the child to his environment it is for this
reason that imitation has been called an adaptive instinct it would
perhaps be better to say merely that the tendency to imitate is part
of the original equipment of man
imitation is distinctively a human trait while it occurs in lower
animals it is probably not an important factor in adjusting them to
their environment but in the human race it is one of the chief factors
in adjustment to environment imitation is one of the main factors in
education usually the quickest way to teach a child to do a thing is to
show him how
through imitation we acquire our language manners and customs ideals
beliefs prejudices attitudes we take on through imitation the
tendency to imitate others coupled with the desire to be thought well of
by others is one of the most powerful factors in producing conformity
they are the whips which keep us within the bounds of custom and
conventionality the tendency to imitate is so strong that its results
are almost as certain as are those of inherited tendencies it is almost
as certain that a child will be like his parents in speech manners
customs superstitions etc as it is that he will be like them in form
of body he not only walks and talks and acts like his parents but he
thinks as they do we therefore have the term social heredity
meaning the taking on of all sorts of social habits and ideals through
imitation
the part that imitation plays in the education of a child may be learned
by going to a country home and noting how the boy learns to do all the
many things about the farm by imitating his father and how the girl
learns to do all the housework by imitating her mother imitation is the
basis of much of the play of children in that their play consists in
large part of doing what they see older people doing this imitative
play gives them skill and is a large factor in preparing for the work of
life
dramatization dramatization is an aspect of imitation and is a means
of making ideas more real than they would otherwise be there is nothing
that leads us so close to reality as action we never completely know an
act till we have done it dramatization is a matter of carrying an idea
out into action ideas give to action its greatest fullness of meaning
dramatic representation should therefore have a prominent place in the
schools particularly in the lower grades if the child is allowed to
mimic the characters in the reading lesson the meaning of the lesson
becomes fuller later on in the school course dramatic representation
of the characters in literature and history is a means of getting a
better conception of these characters in geography the study of the
manners and customs and occupations of foreign peoples can be much
facilitated through dramatic representation children naturally have the
dramatic tendency it is one aspect of the tendency to imitate we have
only to encourage it and make use of it throughout the school course
imitation in ideals imitation is of importance not only in acquiring
the actions of life but also in getting our ideals habits of thinking
are no less an aspect of our lives than are habits of acting our
attitudes our prejudices our beliefs our moral religious and
political ideals are in large measure copied from people about us the
family and social atmosphere in which one lives is a mold in which ones
mind is formed and shaped we cannot escape the influence of this
atmosphere if we would one takes on a belief that his father has one
clings to this belief and interprets the world in the light of it this
belief becomes a part of ones nature it is a mental habit a way of
looking at the world it is as much a part of one as red hair or big
feet or a crooked nose probably no other influence has so much to do
with making us what we are as social beings as the influence of
imitation
play play is usually considered to be a part of the original equipment
of man it is essentially an expression of the ripening instincts of
children and not a specific instinct itself it is rather a sort of
makebelieve activity of all the instincts kittens and dogs may be seen
in play to mimic fighting they bite and chew each other as in real
fighting but still they are not fighting
as the structures and organs of children mature they demand activity
this early activity is called play it has several characteristics the
main one is that it is pleasurable play activity is pleasurable in
itself we do not play that we may get something else which we like as
is the case with the activity which we call work play is an end in
itself it is not a means to get something else which is intrinsically
valuable
one of the chief values of play comes from its activity aspect we are
essentially motor beings we grow and develop only through exercise in
early life we do not have to exert ourselves to get a living play is
natures means of giving our organs the exercise which they must have to
bring them to maturity play is an expression of the universal tendency
to action in early life without play the child would not develop
would not become a normal human being
all day long the child is ceaselessly active the value of this activity
can hardly be overestimated it not only leads to healthy growth but is
a means through which the child learns himself and the world everything
that the child sees excites him to react to it or upon it he gets
possession of it he bites it he pounds it he throws it in this way
he learns the properties of things and the characteristics of forces
through play and imitation in a very few years the child comes to a
successful adjustment in his world
play and imitation are the great avenues of activity in early life even
in later life we seldom accomplish anything great or worth while until
the thing becomes play to us until we throw our whole being into it as
we do in play until it is an expression of ourselves as play is in our
childhood the proper use of play gives us the solution of many of the
problems of early education
play has two functions in the school 1 motor play is necessary to
growth development and health the constant activity of the child is
what brings about healthy growth
in the country it is not difficult for children to get plenty of the
proper kind of exercise but in the larger cities it is difficult
nevertheless opportunity for play should be provided for every child
no matter what the trouble or expense for without play children cannot
become normal human beings everywhere parents and teachers should plan
for the play life of the children
2 in the primary grades play can have a large place in the actual work
of the school the early work of education is to a large extent getting
the tools of knowledge and thought and workreading spelling
writing correct speech correct writing the elementary processes of
arithmetic etc in many ways play can be used in acquiring these tools
one aspect of play particularly should have a large place in education
namely the manipulative tendencies of children this is essentially
play children wish to handle and manipulate everything that attracts
their attention they wish to tear it to pieces and to put it together
this is natures way of teaching and by it children learn the
properties and structures of things they thereby learn what things do
and what can be done with them teachers and parents should foster these
manipulative tendencies and use them for the childs good these
tendencies are an aspect of curiosity we want to know we are unhappy
as long as a thing is before us which we do not understand which has
some mystery about it nature has developed these tendencies in us for
without a knowledge of our surroundings we could not live the child
therefore has in his nature the basis of his education we have but to
know this nature and wisely use and manipulate it to achieve the childs
education
  summary instincts are inherited tendencies to specific actions
  they fall under the heads individualistic socialistic
  environmental adaptive sexual or mating instincts these inherited
  tendencies are to a large extent the foundation on which we build
  education the educational problem is to control and guide them
  suppressing some fostering others in everything we undertake for a
  child we must take into account these instincts
class exercises
1 make a study of the instincts of several animals such as dogs cats
chickens make a list showing the stimuli and the inherited responses
2 make a study of the instincts of a baby see how many inherited
responses you can observe the simpler inherited responses are known as
reflexes the closing of the eyelids mentioned in the text is an
example how many such reflexes can you find in a child
3 make a special study of the fears of very young children how many
definite situations can you find which excite fear responses in all
children each member of the class can make a list of his own fears it
may then be seen whether any fears are common to all members of the
class and whether there are any sex differences
4 similarly make a study of anger and fighting what situations
invariably arouse the fighting response in what definite inherited
ways is anger shown do your studies and observations convince you that
the fighting instinct and other inherited responses concerned with
individual survival are among the strongest of inherited tendencies can
the fighting instinct be eliminated from the human race is it desirable
to eliminate it
5 make a study of childrens collections take one of the grades and
find what collections the children have made what different objects are
collected
6 outline a plan for using the collecting instinct in various school
studies
7 with the help of the principal of the school make a study of some
specific cases of truancy what does your finding show
8 make a study of play by watching children of various ages play make
a list of the games that are universal for infancy those for childhood
and those for youth consult johnsons plays and games
9 what are the two main functions of play in education why should we
play after we are mature
10 study imitation in very young children do this by watching the
spontaneous play of children under six what evidences of imitation do
you find
11 outline the things we learn by imitation what is your opinion of
the place which imitation has in our education
12 make a study of imitation as a factor in the lives of grown people
consider styles fashions manners customs beliefs prejudices
religious ideas etc
13 on the whole is imitation a good thing or a bad thing
14 make a plan of the various ways in which dramatization can be
profitably used in the schools
15 make a study of your own ideals what ideals do you have where did
you get them what ideals did you get from your parents what from
books what from teachers what from friends
16 show that throughout life inherited tendencies are the fundamental
bases from which our actions proceed on which our lives are erected

feeling and attention
the feelings related to the instincts on one side and to habits on the
other are the feelings in chapter iii we discussed sensation and in
the preceding chapter the instincts but when we have described an act
in terms of instinct and sensation we have not told all the facts
for example when a child sees a pretty red ball of yarn he reaches out
to get it then puts it into his mouth or unwinds it and plays with it
in various ways it is all a matter of sensation and instinctive
responses the perception of the ballseeing the ballbrings about the
instinctive reaching out grasping the ball and bringing it to the
mouth but to complete our account we must say that the child is
pleased we note a change in his facial expression his eyes gleam
with pleasure his face is all smiles showing pleasant contentment
therefore we must say that the child not only sees not only acts but
the seeing and acting are pleasant the child continues to look he
continues to act because the looking and acting bring joy
this is typical of situations that bring pleasure we want them
continued we act in a way to make them continue we go out after the
pleasuregiving thing
but let us consider a different kind of situation a child sees on the
hearth a glowing coal it instinctively reaches out and grasps it
starts to draw the coal toward it but instinctively drops it this is
not however the whole story instead of the situation being pleasant
it is decidedly unpleasant the child fairly howls with pain his face
instead of being wreathed in smiles is covered with tears he did not
hold on to the coal he did not try to continue the situation on the
contrary he dropped the coal and withdrew the hand the body
contracted and shrank away from the situation
these two cases illustrate the two simple feelings pleasantness and
unpleasantness most situations in life are either pleasant or
unpleasant situations may sometimes be neutral that is may arouse
neither the feeling of pleasantness or unpleasantness but usually a
conscious state is either pleasant or unpleasant a situation brings us
life joy happiness we want it continued and act in a way to bring
about its continuance or the situation tends to take away our life
brings pain sorrow grief and we want it discontinued and act in a
way to discontinue it
these two simple forms of feeling perhaps arose in the beginning in
connection with the act of taking food it is known that if a drop of
acid touches an amoeba the animal shrinks contracts and tries to
withdraw from the deathbringing acid on the other hand if a particle
of a substance that is suitable for food touches the animal it takes
the particle within itself the particle is lifegiving and brings
pleasure
the emotions pleasure and displeasure are the simple feelings most
situations in life bring about very complex feeling states known as
emotions the emotions are made up of pleasure or displeasure mixed
or compounded with the sensations from the bodily reactions
the circulatory system the respiratory system and nearly all the
involuntary organs of the body form a great sounding board which
instantly responds in various ways to the situations of life when the
youth sees the pretty maiden and when he touches her hand his heart
pumps away at a great rate his cheeks become flushed his breathing is
paralyzed his voice trembles he experiences the emotion of love the
state is complex indeed there is pleasantness of course but there is
in addition the feeling of all the bodily reactions
when the mother sees her dead child lying in its casket her head falls
over on her breast her eyes fill with tears her shoulders droop her
chest contracts she sobs her breathing is spasmodic nearly every
organ of the body is affected in one way or another the state is
unpleasant but there is also the feeling of the manifold bodily
reactions
so it is always the biologically important situations in life bring
about through hereditary connections in the nervous system certain
typical reactions these reactions are largely the same for the same
type of situation and they give the particular coloring to each
emotion it is evident that the emotions are closely related to the
instincts the reflexes that take place in emotions are of the same
nature as the instincts each instinctive act has its characteristic
emotion there are fear instincts and fear emotions fear is unpleasant
in addition to its unpleasantness there is a multitude of sensations
that come from the body the hair stands on end the heart throbs the
circulation is hastened breathing is interrupted the muscles are
tense this peculiar mass of sensations blended with the
unpleasantness gives the characteristic emotion of fear but we need
not go into an analysis of the various emotions of love hate envy
grief jealousy etc the reader can do this for himself3
3 see james psychology briefer course chapter xxiv
nearly every organ of the body plays its part in the emotions the
digestive organs the liver the kidneys the throat and mouth the
salivary glands the eyes and tear glands the skin muscles the facial
muscles etc and every emotion is made up of pleasantness or
unpleasantness and the sensations produced by some combination of bodily
reactions
it is well for us to remember the part that bodily conditions and states
play in the emotional life the emotional state of a man depends upon
whether he has had his dinner or is hungry whether the liver is working
normally and upon the condition of the various secreting and excreting
organs and glands in a word it is evident that our emotions fall
within a world of cause and effect our feeling states are caused
importance in life our feelings and emotions are the fountains from
which nearly all our volitional actions flow feeling is the
mainspring of life nearly everything we do is prompted by love or
hate or fear or jealousy or rivalry or anger or grief if the
feelings have such close relation to action then the schools must take
them into account for by education we seek to control action if the
feelings control action then we must try to control the feelings we
must get the child into a right state of mind toward the school toward
his teacher and toward his work the child must like the school like
the teacher and want to learn
moreover we must create the right state of mind in connection with
each study each task the child must come to feel the need and
importance of each individual task as well as of each subject the task
is then desirable it is to be sought for and worked at it is important
for life
this is merely enlisting the childs nature in the interest of his
education for motive we must always look to the childs nature the
two great forces which pull and drive are pleasure and pain nature
has no other methods formerly the school used pain as its motive almost
exclusively the child did his tasks to escape pain for motive we now
use more often the positive influences which give pleasure which pull
instead of drive what will one not do for the loved one what will
one not do to the hated one the child who does not love his teacher
gets little good from school while under that teacher moreover school
work is often a failure because it is so unreal has so little relation
to an actual world and seems foreign to any real needs of the child no
one is going to work very hard unless the work is prompted by desire
our desires come from our needs therefore if we are to enlist the
childs feelings in the service of his education we must make the
school work vital and relate it if possible to the actual needs of the
child
it must not be forgotten however that we must build up permanent
attitudes of respect for authority obedience and reverence for the
important things of life neither must it be forgotten that we can
create needs in the child if in the education of the child we follow
only such needs as he has we will make a fine savage of him but nothing
else it is the business of the school to create in the child the right
kind of needs as was pointed out in our study of the instincts we
must make the child over again into what he ought to be but this
cannot be a sudden process one cannot arouse enthusiasm in a
sixyearold child over the beauties of higher mathematics it takes ten
or fifteen years to do that and it must be done little by little
control of the emotions without training we remain at the mercy of our
baser emotions the child must be trained to control himself here is
where habit comes in to modify primitive action the child can be
trained to inhibit or prevent the reactions that arise in hatred envy
jealousy anger etc for a fuller discussion of this point we must wait
till we come to the discussion of habit and moral training
mood and temperament a mood is a somewhat extended emotional state
continuing for hours or days it is due to a continuance of the factors
which cause it the state of the liver and digestive organs may throw
one for days into a cross and ugly mood when the body becomes normal
the mood changes or disappears similarly one may for hours or days be
overjoyed or depressed or morose or melancholy parents and teachers
should look well to the matter of creating and establishing continuous
and permanent states of feeling that are favorable to work and
development
some people are permanently optimistic others pessimistic some are
always joyful others as constantly see only the dark side of life some
are always serious and solemn others always gay even giddy these
permanent emotional attitudes constitute temperament and are due to
fundamental differences within the body that are in some cases
hereditary crossness and moroseness for example may be due to a
dyspeptic condition and a chronically bad liver the happy dispositions
belong to bodies whose organs are functioning properly in which
assimilation is goodall the parts of the body doing their proper work
poor eyes which are under a constant strain through the reflex effects
upon various organs of the body are likely to develop a permanently
cross and irritable disposition through the close sympathetic relation
of the various organs anything affecting one organ and interfering with
its proper action is likely to affect many other organs and profoundly
influence the emotional states of the body in growing children
particularly there are many influences which affect their emotions
things of which we seldom think such as the condition of vision and
hearing the condition of the teeth nose and throat and the condition
of all the important vital organs of the body when a childs
disposition is not what we think it ought to be we should try to find
out the causes
training the emotions the emotions are subject to training the child
can be taught control moreover he can be taught to appreciate and
enjoy higher things than mere animal pleasure namely art literature
nature truth the child thereby becomes a spiritual being instead of a
mere pig the ideal of the school should be to develop men and women
whose baser passions are under control who are calm selfcontrolled
and selfdirected and who get their greatest pleasure from the finer
and higher things of life such as the various forms of music the songs
of birds the beauties and intricate workings of nature
this is a wonderful world and a wonderful life but the child may go
through the world without seeing it and live his life without knowing
what it is to live his eyes must be opened he must be trained to see
and to feel it is not the place here to tell how this is to be done
this is not a book on methods of teaching we can only indicate here
that the business of the school is not merely to teach people how to
make a living but to teach them how to enjoy the living there are many
avenues from which we get the higher forms of pleasure there are really
many different worlds which we may experience the world of animals the
world of plants the mechanical world the chemical world the world of
literature and of art the world of music it is the duty of the schools
to open up these worlds to the children and make them so many
possibilities of joy and happiness
the emotions and feelings then are not lawless and causeless but are
a part of a world of law and order they are themselves caused and
therefore subject to control and modification
attention attention too is related to inherited tendencies on the one
side and to habits on the other if one is walking in the woods and
catches a glimpse of something moving in the trees the eyes
instinctively turn so that the person can get a better view of the
object if one hears a sudden sound the head is instinctively turned so
that the person can hear better one stops the body is held still and
rigid breathing is slow and controlledall to favor better hearing
the various acts of attention are reflex and instinctive but what is
attention by attention we mean sensory clearness when we say we are
attentive to a thing or subject we mean that perceptions or ideas of
that thing or subject are clear as compared to other perceptions and
ideas that are in consciousness at the same time the contents of ones
consciousness the perceptions and ideas that constitute ones mind at
any one moment are always arranged in an attentive pattern some
being clear others unclear the pattern constantly changes and shifts
what is now clear and in the focus of consciousness presently is
unclear and may in a moment disappear from consciousness altogether
while other perceptions or ideas take its place
the first question that arises in connection with attention is what are
the causes of attention the first group of causes are hereditary and
instinctive the child attends to loud things bright things moving
things etc but as we grow older the basis of attention becomes more
and more habit an illustration will make this clear i once spent a
day at a great exposition with a machinist he was constantly attending
to things mechanical when i would not even see them he had spent many
years working with machinery and as a result things mechanical at once
attracted him similarly if a man and a woman walk along a street
together and look in at the shop windows the woman sees only hats
dresses ribbons and other finery while the man sees only cigars
pipes and automobile supplies every day we live we are building up
habits of attending to certain types of things what repeatedly comes
into our experience easily attracts our attention to the exclusion of
other things
the function of attention attention is the unifying aspect of
consciousness there are always many things in consciousness and we
cannot respond to all at once the part of consciousness that is clear
and focal brings about action the things to which we attend are the
things that count
in later chapters we shall learn that in habitformation attention is
an important factor we must attend to the acts we are trying to
make habitual in getting knowledge we must attend to what we are
trying to learn in committing to memory we must attend to the ideas
that we are trying to fix and make permanent in thinking and reasoning
those ideas become associated together that are together in attention
attention is therefore the controlling aspect of consciousness it is
the basis of what we call will the ideas that are clear and focal and
that persist in consciousness are the ideas that control our action
when one says he has made up his mind he has made a choice that merely
means that a certain group of ideas persist in consciousness to the
exclusion of others these are the ideas which ultimately produce
action and it is our past experience that determines what ideas will
become focal and persist
training the attention there are two aspects of the training of
attention 1 we can learn to hold ourselves to a task when we sit
down to a table to study there may be many things that tend to call us
away there lies a magazine which we might read there is a play at the
theater there are noises outside there is a friend calling across the
street but we must study we have set ourselves to a task and we must
hold fast to our purpose
the young child cannot do this he must be trained to do it the
instruments used to train him are pleasure and pain rewards and
punishments that come from parents gradually slowly the child gains
control over himself no one ever amounts to anything till he can hold
himself to a task to a fixed purpose one must learn to form plans
extending over weeks months and years and to hold unflinchingly to
them just as one must hold himself to his study table and allow nothing
to distract or to interfere no training a child can receive is more
important than this for it gives him control over his life it gives
him control over the ideas that are to become focal and determine
action it is for this reason that we call such training a training of
attention it might perhaps better be called a training of the will but
the will is only the attentive consciousness the idea that is clear
that holds its own in consciousness is the idea that produces action
when we say that we will to do a certain thing all we can mean is
that the idea of this act is clearest and holds its focal place in
consciousness to the exclusion of other ideas it therefore goes over
into action
2 the training just discussed may be called a general training of
attention giving us a general power and control over our lives but
there is another type of training which is specific as with the
machinist mentioned above so with all of us we attend to the type of
thing that we have formed a habit of attending to continued experience
in a certain field makes it more and more easy to attend to things in
that field one can take a certain subject and work at it day after day
year after year by and by the whole world takes on the aspect of this
chosen subject the entomologist sees bugs everywhere the botanist sees
only plants the mechanic sees only machines the preacher sees only the
moral and religious aspects of action the doctor sees only disease the
mathematician sees always the quantitative aspect of things ideas and
perceptions related to ones chosen work go at once and readily to the
focus of consciousness other things escape notice
it is for this reason that we become crankier every year that we live
we are attending to only one aspect of the world while this blinds us
to other aspects of the world it brings mastery in our individual
fields we can then by training and practice get a general control
over attention and by working in a certain field or kind of work we
make it easy to attend to things in that field or work this to an
extent gives us control of our lives of our destiny
interest the essential elements of interest are attention and feeling
when a person is very attentive to a subject and gets pleasure from
experience in that subject we commonly say that he is interested in
that subject
since the importance of attention and feeling in learning has already
been shown and will be further developed in the chapters which follow in
connection with the subjects of habit memory and thinking little more
need be said here
the key to all forms of learning is attention the key to attention is
feeling feeling depends upon the nature of the child inherited and
acquired in our search for the means of arousing interest we look
first to the original nature of the child to the instincts and the
emotions we look next to the acquired nature the habits the ideals
the various needs that have grown up in the individuals life
educational writers have overemphasized the original nature of the child
as a basis of interest and have not paid enough attention to acquired
nature we should not ask so much what a childs needs are but what
they ought to be needs can be created the childs nature to some
extent can be changed the problem of arousing interest is therefore one
of finding in the childs nature a basis for attention and pleasure if
the basis is not to be found there then it must be built up how this
can be done how human nature can be changed is to some extent the main
problem of psychology every chapter in this book it is hoped will be
found to throw some light on the problem
  summary the two elementary feeling states are pleasantness and
  unpleasantness the emotions are complex mental states composed of
  feeling and the sensations from bodily reactions to the situations
  feeling and emotion are the motive forces of life at the bottom of
  all important actions the bodily reactions of emotions are reflex
  and instinctive attention is a matter of the relative clearness of
  the contents of consciousness the function of attention is to unify
  thought and action it is the important factor in all learning and
  thinking for it is only the attentive part of consciousness that is
  effective
class exercises
1 make out a complete list of the more important emotions
2 indicate the characteristic expression of each emotion in your list
3 can you have an emotion without its characteristic expression if
for example when a situation arises which ordinarily arouses anger in
you you inhibit all the usual motor accompaniments of anger are you
really angry
4 are the expressions of the same emotion the same for all people
5 try to analyze some of your emotional states anger or fear or
grief can you detect the sensations that come from the bodily
reactions
6 try to induce an emotional state by producing its characteristic
reactions
7 try to change an emotional state to an opposite emotion for example
grief to joy
8 try to control and change emotional states in children
9 name some sensations that for you are always pleasant others that
are always unpleasantcolors sounds tastes odors temperatures
10 confirm by observation the statement of the text as to the
importance of emotions in all the important actions of life
11 to what extent do you have control of your emotional states what
have you observed about differences in expression of deep emotions by
different people in case of death in the family some people wail and
moan and express their grief in the most extreme manner while others do
not utter a sound and show great control why the difference
12 make an introspective study of your conscious states to note the
difference in clearness of the different processes that are going on in
consciousness do you find a constant shifting
13 perform experiments to show the effects of attention in forming
habits and acquiring knowledge
1 perform tests in learning using substitution tests as described in
chapter x use several different keys in some experiments have no
distractions in others have various distracting noises what
differences do you find in the results
2 try learning nonsense syllables some lists with distractions
others without distractions
3 try getting the ideas from stories read to you as in the logical
memory experiment described in chapter x some stories should be read
without distractions others with distractions
14 why are you unable to study well when under the influence of some
strong emotion
15 are you trained to the extent that you can concentrate on a task and
hold yourself to it for a long time
16 do you see that as far as will and attention and the emotions are
concerned your life and character are in large measure in your own
hands

habit
the nature of habit we now turn from mans inherited nature to his
acquired nature inherited tendencies to action we have called
instincts acquired tendencies to action we shall call habits we can
best form an idea of the nature of habit by considering some concrete
cases
let us take first the case of a man forming the habit of turning out the
basement light it usually happens that when a man has an electric light
in the basement of his house it is hard for him at first to think to
turn out the light at night when he retires and as a consequence the
light often burns all night this is expensive and unnecessary so there
is a strong incentive for the man to find a plan which will insure the
regular turningoff of the light at bedtime the plan usually hit upon
is the following the electric switch that controls the basement light
is beside the basement stairway the man learns to look at the switch as
he comes up the stairs after preparing the furnace fire for the night
and learns to take hold of the switch when he sees it and turn off the
light coming up the stairs means to look at the switch seeing the
switch means to turn it each step of the performance touches off the
next the man sees that in order to make sure that the light will always
be turned off the acts must all be made automatic and each step must
touch off the next in the series at first the man leaves the light
burning about as often as he turns it off after practicing for a time
on the scheme the different acts become so well connected that he
seldom leaves the light burning we say that he has formed the habit
of turning off the light
for a second illustration let us take the process of learning that nine
times nine equals eightyone at first one does not say or write
eightyone when one sees nine times nine but one can acquire the
habit of doing so it does not here concern us how the child learns what
the product of nine times nine is he may learn it by counting by being
told or by reading it in a book but however he first learns it he
fixes it and makes it automatic and habitual by continuing to say or
to write nine times nine equals eightyone the essential point is
that at first the child does not know what to say when he hears or sees
the expression nine times nine but after long practice he comes to
give automatically and promptly the correct answer for the definite
problem nine times nine there comes the definite response
eightyone
for a third illustration let us take the case of a man tipping his hat
when he meets a lady a young boy does not tip his hat when he meets a
lady until he has been taught to do so after he learns this act of
courtesy he does it quite automatically without thinking of it for the
definite situation meeting a lady of his acquaintance there comes to
be established the definite response tipping the hat a similar habit
is that of turning to the right when we meet a person for the definite
situation meeting a person on the road or street or sidewalk there is
established the definite response turning to the right the response
becomes automatic immediate certain
there is another type of habit that may properly be called an
intellectual habit such as voting a certain party ticket say the
democratic when one is a boy one hears his father speak favorably of
the democratic party his father says hurrah for bryan so he comes
to say hurrah for bryan his father says i am a democrat so he
says he is a democrat he takes the side that his father takes in a
similar way we take on the same religious notions that our parents have
it does not always happen this way but this is the rule but no matter
how we come to do it we do adopt the creed of some party or some
church we adopt a certain way of looking at public questions and a
certain way of looking at religious questions for certain rather
definite situations we come to take definite stands when we go to the
booth to vote we look at the top of the ballot to find the column
marked democratic and the definite response is to check the
democrat column of course some of us form a different habit and
check the republican column but the psychology of the act is the
same the point is that we form the democratic habit or we form the
republican habit and the longer we practice the habit the harder it is
to change it
in the presidential campaign of 1912 roosevelt bolted from the
republican party it was hard for the older republicans to follow him
while one occasionally found a follower of roosevelt who was gray one
usually found the old republicans standing by the old party the younger
ones joining the progressive party it is said that when darwin
published the origin of species very few old men accepted the
doctrine of evolution the adherents of the new doctrine were nearly
all young men so there is such a thing as an intellectual habit one
comes to take a definite stand when facing certain definite intellectual
situations
similar to the type of habits which we have called intellectual is
another type which may be called moral when we face the situation of
reporting an occurrence we can tell the truth or we can lie we can
build up the habit of meeting such situations by telling the truth on
all occasions we can learn to follow the maxim tell the truth at all
times at all hazards we can come to do this automatically certainly
and without thought of doing anything else
most moral situations are fairly definite and clearcut and for them we
can establish definite forms of response we can form the habit of
helping a person in distress of helping a sick neighbor of speaking
well of a neighbor we can form habits of industry habits of
perseverance these and other similar habits are the basis of morality
the various kinds of habits which we have enumerated are alike in
certain fundamental particulars in all of them there is a definite
situation followed by a definite response one sees the switch and turns
off the light he sees the expression nine times nine and says
eightyone he sees a lady he knows and tips his hat in meeting a
carriage on the road he turns to the right when he has to vote he
votes a certain ticket when he has to report an occurrence he tells it
as it happened there is in every case a definite situation followed
by a definite response
another characteristic is common to all the cases mentioned above
ie the response is acquired it does not come at first in every
instance we might have learned to act differently we could form the
habit of always leaving the light burning could just as easily say
nine times nine equals forty we could turn to the left we could vote
the republican ticket we can form bad moral habits as well as good
ones perhaps more easily the point is however that we acquire
definite ways of acting for the same situations and these definite ways
of acting are called habits
habit and nervepath it has already been stated that a habit is a
tendency toward a certain type of action in a certain situation the
basis of this tendency is in the nervous system in order to understand
it we must consider what the nervous system is like nerves terminate at
one end in a sense organ and at the other end ultimately in a muscle
in figure ii a is a sense organ b a nerve going from the sense organ
to the brain c d e f g and h are motor nerves going from the brain
to the muscles now let us show from the diagram what organization
means and what tendency means at first when the child sees the
expression nine times nine he does not say eightyone the stimulus
brings about no definite action it is as likely to go out through e or
f as through d but suppose we can get the child to say nine times nine
equals eightyone we can write the expression on the blackboard and
have the child look at it and say nine times nine equals eightyone
suppose the act of saying eightyone is brought about by the
nervecurrent going out through nervechain d by repetition we
establish a bond a stimulus of a particular kind comes through a goes
over b to c and out over d making muscles at m bring about a very
definite action in saying eightyone
illustration figure iithe organization of tendencies
from the point of view of physiology the process of habitformation
consists in securing a particular nerve coupling establishing a
particular nerve path so that a definite form of stimulation will bring
about a definite form of response a nerve tendency is simply the
likelihood that a stimulus will take a certain course rather than any
other this likelihood is brought about by getting the stimulus to take
the desired route through the nervous system to a group of muscles and
to continue following this route the more times it passes the same way
the greater is the probability that at any given time the stimulus will
take the accustomed route and bring about the usual response at first
any sort of action is possible a nerve stimulus can take any one of the
many routes to the different muscles by chance or by conscious
direction the stimulus takes a certain path and by repetition we fix
and make permanent this particular route this constitutes a nerve
tendency or habit
plasticity our discussion should have made it clear that habit is
acquired nature while instinct is inherited nature habit is acquired
tendency while instinct is inherited tendency the possibility of
acquiring habits is peculiarly a human characteristic while inanimate
things have a definite nature a definite way of reacting to forces
which act upon them they have little if any possibility of varying
their way of acting water might be said to have habits if one cools
water it turns to ice if we heat it it turns to steam but it
invariably does this we cannot teach it any different way of acting
under the same conditions it always does the same thing
plants are very much like inanimate things plants have definite ways of
acting a vine turns around a support a leaf turns its upper surface to
the light but one cannot teach plants different ways of acting the
lower forms of animals are somewhat like plants and inanimate objects
but to a very slight extent they are variable and can form habits among
the higher animals such as dogs and other domestic animals there is a
greater possibility of forming habits in man there are the greatest
possibilities of habitformation in man the learned acts or habits are
many as compared to the unlearned acts or instincts while among the
lower animals the opposite is the casetheir instincts are many as
compared to their habits
we may call this possibility of forming habits plasticity inanimate
objects such as iron rocks sulphur oxygen etc have no plasticity
plants have very little possibility of forming habits lower animals
have somewhat more and higher animals still more while man has the
greatest possibility of forming habits this great possibility of
forming habits is one of the main characteristics of man let us
illustrate the contrast between man and inanimate objects by an example
if sulphur is put into a test tube and heated it at first melts and
becomes quite thin like water if it is heated still more it becomes
thick and will not run out of the tube it also becomes dark sulphur
always does this when so treated it cannot be taught to act
differently now the action of sulphur when heated is like the action of
a man when he turns to the right upon meeting a person in the street
but the man has to acquire this habit while the sulphur does not have
to learn its way of acting sulphur always acted in this way while man
did not perform his act at first but had to learn it by slow
repetition
everything in the world has its own peculiar nature but man is unique
in that his nature can be very much changed to a large extent a man is
made his nature is acquired after we become men and women we have
hundreds and thousands of tendencies to action definite forms of
action that we did not have when young mans nature might be said to
consist in his tendencies to action some of these tendencies he
inherits these are his instincts some of these he acquires these are
his habits
what habits do for us we have found out what habits are like let us
now see what they do for us what good do they accomplish for us how
are we different after forming a habit from what we were before we can
best answer these questions by a consideration of concrete cases
typewriting will serve very well the purpose of illustration we shall
give the result of an actual experiment in which ten university students
took part during their first half hour of practice they wrote an
average of 120 words at the end of fortyfive hours of practice they
were writing an average of 680 words in a half hour this was an
increase of speed of 560 per cent an expert typist can write about
3000 words in a half hour such a speed requires much more than
fortyfive hours practice and is attained by the best operators only
illustration figure iiilearning curves
the upper graph shows the improvement in speed of a group of students
working two half hours a day the lower curve shows the improvement of a
group working ten halfhours a day
in the foregoing experiment the students improved in accuracy also at
the beginning of the work they made 115 errors in the half hour at the
end of the practice with much faster speed they were making only
327 errors in a half hour the actual number of errors had increased
280 per cent the increase in errors was therefore exactly half as much
as the increase in speed this of course was a considerable increase
in accuracy for while the speed had increased to 56 times what it had
been at the beginning the errors had increased only 28 times the
subjects in this experiment paid much more attention to speed than they
did to accuracy if they had emphasized accuracy they would have been
doing almost perfect work at the end of the practice and their speed
would have been somewhat less practice then not only develops speed
but also develops accuracy
there are also other results at the beginning of work with the
typewriter there is much waste of energy and much fatigue the waste of
energy comes from using unnecessary muscles and the fatigue is partly
due to this waste of energy but even apart from this waste of energy
an habituated act is performed with less fatigue the various muscles
concerned become better able to do their work as a result of
habituation there is then greater speed greater accuracy less waste
of energy and less fatigue
if we look not at the changes in our work but at the changes in
ourselves the changes in our minds due to the formation of habits we
find still other results at the beginning of practice with the
typewriter the learners whole attention is occupied with the work
when one is learning to do a new trick the attention cannot be divided
the whole mind must be devoted to the work but after one has practiced
for several weeks one can operate the typewriter while thinking about
something else we say that the habituated act sinks to a lower level of
consciousness meaning that as a habit becomes more and more fixed less
and less attention is devoted to the acts concerned
increased skill gives us pleasure and also gives us confidence in our
ability to do the thing corresponding to this inner confidence is outer
certainty there is greater objective certainty in our performance and a
corresponding inner confidence by objective certainty we mean that a
person watching our performance becomes more and more sure of our
ability to perform and we ourselves feel confidence in our power of
achievement
now that we have shown the results of habituation let us consider
additional illustrations in piano playing the stimuli are the notes as
written in the music we see the notes occupying certain places on the
scale of the music a note in a certain place means that we must strike
a certain key at first the response is slow we have to hunt out each
note on the keyboard moreover we make many mistakes we strike the
wrong keys just as we do in typewriting we are awkward making many
unnecessary movements and the work is tiresome and fatiguing after
long practice the speed with which we can manipulate the keys in
playing the piano is wonderful our playing becomes accurate perfect
we do it with ease with no unnecessary movements we can play the
piano after we become skilled without paying attention to the actual
movements of our hands we can play the piano while concentrating upon
the meaning of the music or while carrying on a conversation or while
thinking about something else as a rule pleasure and confidence come
with skill playing a difficult piece on the piano involves a skill
which is one of the most complicated that man achieves it is possible
only through habituation of the pianoplaying movements
nailing shingles on a roof illustrates well the various aspects of
habituation the expert carpenter not only nails on many more shingles
in a day than does the amateur but he does it better and with more
ease and with much less fatigue the carpenter knows exactly how much
he can do in a day and each particular movement is certain and sure
the carpenter has confidence in and usually prides himself on this
ability thus getting pleasure out of his work
the operations in arithmetic illustrate most of the results of
habituation practice in addition makes for speed and accuracy in a few
weeks time we can very much increase our speed and accuracy in adding
or in the other arithmetical operations
the foregoing examples are sufficient although they could be multiplied
indefinitely almost any habit one might name would show clearly most of
the results enumerated the most important aspects of habituation may be
summed up in the one word efficiency habituation gives us speed and
accuracy speed and accuracy mean skill skill means efficiency
how habits are formed it is clear from the foregoing discussion that
the essential thing in a habit is the definiteness of the connection
between the stimulus and the response between the situation and the
reaction to the situation our question now is how is this definiteness
of connection established the answer is through repetition let us
work the matter out from a concrete case such as learning to play the
piano in piano playing the stimulus comes from the music as printed on
the staff a note having a certain position on the staff indicates that
a certain key is to be struck we are told by our music teacher what
keys on the piano correspond to the various notes on the staff or we
may learn these facts from the instruction book it makes no difference
how we learn them but after we know these facts we must have practice
to give us skill the mere knowledge will not make us piano players in
order to be skillful we must have much practice not only in striking
the keys indicated by the various note positions but with the various
combinations of notes for example a note on the second space indicates
that the player must strike the key known as a but a may occur with
any of the other notes it may precede them or it may follow them we
must therefore have practice in striking a in all these situations to
have skill at the piano we must mechanize many performances we must be
able to read the notes with accuracy and ease we must practice so much
that the instant we see a certain combination of notes on the staff our
hands immediately execute the proper strokes not only must we learn
what keys on the piano correspond to the various notes of the music but
the notes have a temporal value which we must learn some are to be
sounded for a short time others for a longer time we have eighth
notes quarter notes half notes etc moreover the signature of the
music as indicated by the sharps or flats changes the whole situation
if the music is written in a sharp then when a is indicated on the
staff we must not strike the white key known as a but the black key
just above known as a sharp
briefly in piano playing the stimulus comes from the characters
printed on the staff the movements which these characters direct are
very complicated and require months and years of practice we must
emphasize the fact that practice alone gives facility years of
practice but after these years of practice one can play a piece of
music at sight that is the first stimulus sets off perfectly a very
complicated response this sort of performance is one of the highest
feats of skill that man accomplishes
to get skill then one must practice but mere repetition is not
sufficient for practice to be most effective one must put his whole
mind on what he is doing if he divides his attention between the acts
which he is practicing and something else the effect of the practice in
fixing and perfecting the habit is slight it seems that when we are
building up a new nervepath which is to be the basis of a new habit
the nervous energies should not be divided that the whole available
nervous energy should be devoted to the acts which we are repeating
this is only another way of saying that when we are practicing to
establish a habit we should attend to what we are doing and to nothing
else but after the habitconnection is once firmly established we can
attend to other things while performing the habitual act the habitual
action will go on of itself we may say then that in order to be able
to do a thing with little or no attention we must give much attention
to it at first
another important factor in habitformation is pleasure the act which
we are practicing must give us pleasure either while we are doing it or
as a result pleasurable results hasten habitformation when we
practice an act in which we have no interest we make slow progress or
none at all now the elements of interest are attention and pleasure if
we voluntarily attend to a thing and its performance gives us pleasure
or pleasure results from it we say we are interested in it the secret
of successful practice is interest repeatedly in laboratory experiments
it happens that a student loses interest in the performance and
subsequently makes little if any progress one of the biggest problems
connected with habitformation is that of maintaining interest
a factor which prevents the formation of habits is that of exceptions
if a stimulus instead of going over to the appropriate response
produces some other action there is an interference in the formation of
the desired habit the effect of an exception is greater than the mere
neglect of practice the exception opens up another path and tends to
make future action uncertain particularly is this true in the case of
moral habits forming moral habits is usually uphill work anyway in
that we have instincts to overcome allowing exceptions to enter in the
moral sphere usually means a slipping back into an old way of acting
thereby weakening much the newlymade connection
in any kind of practice when we become fatigued we make errors if we
continue to practice when fatigued we form connections which we do not
wish to make and which interfere with the desired habits
economy of practice the principles which we have enumerated and
illustrated are fairly general and of universal validity there are
certain other factors which we may discuss here under the head of
economical procedure to form a habit we must practice but how long
should we practice at one time this is an experimental problem and has
been definitely solved it has been proved by experiment that we can
practice profitably for as long a time as we can maintain a high degree
of attention which is usually till we become fatigued this time is not
the same for all people it varies with age and in the case of the same
person it varies at different times if ordinary college students work
at habitformation at the highest point of concentration they get the
best return for a period of about a half hour it depends somewhat on
the amount of concentration required for the work and the stage of
fixation of the habit ie whether one has just begun to form the
habit or whether it is pretty well fixed for children the period of
successful practice is usually much less than a half hourfive ten
fifteen twenty minutes depending upon the age of the child and the
kind of work
the best interval between periods of practice is the day twentyfour
hours if one practices in the morning for a half hour one can practice
again in the afternoon with nearly as much return as he would secure the
next day but not quite in general practice is better gives more
return if spread out to practice one day as long as one can work at a
high point of efficiency and then to postpone further practice till the
next day gives one the most return for the time put in but if one is
in a hurry to form a habit one can afford to practice more each day
even if the returns from the practice do diminish proportionately
this matter has been tried out on the typewriter if one practices for
ten half hours a day with halfhour rests between one does not get so
much return for his time as he would if he should spread it out at the
rate of one or two halfhour practices a day but by working ten half
hours a day one gets much more efficiency in the same number of days
than if he should practice only one or two half hours a day this point
must not be misunderstood we do not mean that one must not work at
anything longer than a half hour a day we mean that if one is forming a
habit his time counts for more in forming the habit if spread out at
the rate of a half hour or an hour a day than it does if put in at a
faster rate therefore if one is in no hurry and can afford to spread
out his time he gets the best return by so doing and the habit is more
firmly fixed than if formed hurriedly but if one is in a hurry and has
the time to devote to it he can afford to concentrate his practice up
to five hours or possibly more in a day provided that rest intervals
are interspersed between periods of practice
there is one time in habitformation when concentrated practice is most
efficient that is at the beginning in a process as complicated as
typewriting so little impression is made at the beginning by a short
period of practice that progress is but slight on the first day one
should practice about four or five times to secure the best returns a
half hour each time
what the teacher can do now let us see how the teacher can be of
assistance to the pupil in habitformation the teacher should have a
clear idea of the nature of the habit to be formed and should
demonstrate the habit to the pupil suppose the habit is so simple a
thing as long division the teacher should explain each step in the
process she should go to the blackboard and actually solve a number of
problems in long division so that the pupils can see just how to do it
after this the pupils should go to the board and solve a problem
themselves the reason for this procedure is that it is most economical
if the children are left to get the method of doing long division from a
book they will not be able to do it readily and will make mistakes a
teacher can explain a process better than it can be explained in a book
by giving a full explanation and demonstration and then by requiring the
children to work a few problems while she watches for mistakes
correcting them at once the teacher secures economy of effort and time
the first step is to demonstrate the habit to the pupils the second to
have them do the act whatever it is correcting their mistakes the
third to require the pupils to practice till they have acquired skill
the teacher must make provision for practice
what parents can do parents can be of very great assistance to children
who are forming habits
1 they can coperate with the school which is directing the child in
the systematic formation of a great system of habits the teacher should
explain these habits to the parents so that they may know what the
teacher is trying to do quite often the home and the school are working
at cross purposes the only way to prevent this is for them to work in
the closest coperation with the fullest understanding of what is being
undertaken for the child parents and teachers should often meet
together and talk over the work of training the children of the
community parents should have not merely a general understanding of the
work of the school but they should know the details undertaken the
school often assigns practice work to be done at home in reading
writing arithmetic parents should always know of these assignments and
should help the children get the necessary practice they can do this by
reminding the child of the work by preparing a suitable place where the
work may be done and by securing quiet for the practice children like
play and it is easy for them to forget their necessary work parents can
be of the greatest service to childhood and youth by holding the
children to their responsibilities and duties
few parents take any thought of whether their children are doing all
possible for their school progress few of those who do make definite
plans and arrangements for the children to accomplish the necessary
practice and study this is the parents duty and responsibility
moreover parents are likely to feel that children have no rights and
think nothing of calling on them in the midst of their work to do some
errand now children should work about the house and help their
parents but there should be a time for this and a separate time for
study and practice on school work
when a child sits down for serious practice on some work his time
should be sacred and inviolable instead of interfering with the child
the parents should do everything in their power to make this practice
possible and efficient in their relations with their children perhaps
parents sin more in the matter of neglecting to plan for them than in
any other way they plan for everything else but they let their
children grow up having taken no definite thought about helping them to
form their life habits and to establish these habits by practice when a
child comes home from school the mother should find out just what work
is to be done before the next day and should plan the childs play and
work in such a way as to include all necessary practice if all parents
would do this the value to the work of the school and to the life of
the child would be incalculable
2 just as one of the main purposes of the teacher is to help the child
gain initiative so it is one of the greatest of the parents duties
parents must help the children to keep their purposes before them
children forget even when they wish to remember often they do not
want to remember the parents duty is to get the child to want to
remember and to help him to remember whether he wants to or not one
of the main differences between childhood and maturity is that the child
lives in the present his purposes are all immediate ones habits always
look forward they are for future good and use mature people have
learned to look forward and to plan for the future they must
therefore perform this function for the children they must look
forward and see what the child should learn to do and then see that he
learns to do it
3 parents must help children to plan their lives in general and in
detail ie in the sense of determining the ideals and habits that
will be necessary for those lives the parents must do this with the
help of the child the child must not be a blind follower but as the
childs mind becomes mature enough the parent must explain the matter
of forming life habits and must show the child that life is a structure
that he himself is to build life will be what he makes it and the time
for forming character is during early years the parent must not only
tell the child this but must help him to realize the truth of it must
help him continually consistently
4 of course it is hardly necessary to say that the parent can help
much perhaps most by example the parent must not only tell the child
what to do but must show him how it should be done
5 parents can help in the ways mentioned above but they can also help
by coperating among themselves in planning for the training of the
children of the community one parent cannot train his children
independently of all the other people in the community there must be a
certain unity of ideals and aims therefore not only is there need for
coperation between parents and teachers but among parents themselves
although they coperate in everything else they seldom do in the
training of their children the people of a community should meet
together occasionally to plan for this common work
importance of habit in education and life a man is the sum of his
habits and ideals he has language habits he speaks german or french
or english he has writing habits spelling habits reading habits
arithmetic habits he has political habits religious habits he has
various social habits habitual attitudes which he takes toward his
fellows he has moral habitshe is honest and truthful or he is
dishonest and untruthful he always looks on the bright side or else on
the dark side of events all these habits and many more he has they
are structures which he has built ones life then is the sum of his
tendencies and these tendencies one establishes in early life
this view gives an importance to the work of the school which is derived
from no other view the school is not a place where we get this little
bit of information or the other it is the place where we are molded
formed and shaped into the beings we are to be the school has not
risen to see the real importance of its work its aims have been low and
its achievements much lower than its aims teachers should rise to the
importance of their calling their work is that of gods they are
creators they do not make the child they do not give it memory or
attention or imagination but they are creators of tendencies
prejudices religions politics and other habits unnumbered so that in
a very real sense the school with all the other educational
influences makes the man we do not give a child the capacity to learn
but we can determine what he shall learn we do not give him memory but
we can select what he shall remember we do not make the child as he is
at the beginning but we can in large measure determine the world of
influences which complete the task of making
in the early part of life every day and every hour of the day
establishes and strengthens tendencies every year these tendencies
become stronger every year after maturity we resist change by
twentyfive or thirty character has set like plaster the general
attitude and view of the world which we have at maturity we are to hold
throughout life very few men fundamentally change after this it takes
a tremendous influence and an unusual situation to break one up and make
him an essentially different man after maturity every year a crank
becomes crankier
it is well that this is so everything in the world costs its price
rigidity is the price we pay for efficiency in order to be efficient
we must make habitual the necessary movements after they are
habituated they resist change but habit makes for regularity and
order we could not live in society unless there were regularity
order fixity habit makes for conservatism but conservatism is
necessary for order in a sense habit works against progress but
permanent improvement without habit would be impossible for permanent
progress depends upon holding what we gain it is well for society that
we are conservative we could not live in the chaos that would exist
without habit public opinion resists change people refuse to accept a
view that is different from the one they have held we could get nowhere
if we continually changed and it is well for us that we continue to do
the old way to which we have become accustomed till a new and better
one is shown beyond doubt even then it is probably better for an old
person to continue to use the accustomed methods of a lifetime although
better methods are developed they will not be so good for the old
person as those modes of action that he is used to the possibility of
progress is through new methods which come in with each succeeding
generation
when we become old we are not willing to change but the more reasonable
of us are willing that our children should be taught a better way
sometimes of course we find people who say that what was good enough
for them is good enough for their children most of us think better and
wish to give our children a better bringing up than ours has been
these considerations make clear the importance of habit in life they
should also make clear a very important corollary if habits are
important in life then it is the duty of parents and teachers to make a
careful selection of the habits that are to be formed by the children
the habits that will be necessary for the child to form in order to meet
the various situations of his future life should be determined there
should be no vagueness about it definite habits social moral
religious intellectual professional etc will be necessary for
efficiency we should know what these various habits are and should
then set about the work of establishing them with system and
determination just as we would the building of a house much school
work and much home training is vague indefinite uncertain done
without a clear understanding of the needs or of the results we
therefore waste time years of the childs life and the results are
unsatisfactory
drill in school subjects in many school subjects the main object is to
acquire skill in certain processes as previously explained we can
become skillful in an act only by repetition of the act therefore in
those subjects in which the main object is the acquiring of skill there
must be much repetition this repetition is called drill the matter of
economical procedure in drill has already been considered but there are
certain problems connected with drill that must be further discussed
drill is usually the hardest part of school work it becomes monotonous
and tiresome moreover drill is always a means it is the means by
which we become efficient take writing for example it is not an end
in itself it is the means by which we convey thoughts reading is a
means by which we are able to get the thought of another in acquiring a
foreign language we have first to master the elementary tools that will
enable us to make the thought of the foreign language our own
it seems that the hardest part of education always comes first when we
are least able to do it it used to be that nearly all the work of the
school was drill there was little school work that was interesting in
itself in revolt against this kind of school many modern educators
have tried to plan a curriculum that would be interesting to the child
in schools that follow this idea there is little or no drill pure and
simple there is no work that is done for the sole purpose of acquiring
skill the work is so planned that in pursuing it the child will of
necessity have to perform the necessary acts and will thereby gain
efficiency in arithmetic there is no adding subtracting multiplying
or dividing only as such things must be done in the performance of
something else that is interesting in itself for example the child
plays store and must add up the sales the child plays bean bag and must
add up the score practice gained in this indirect way is known as
incidental drill direct drill consists in making a direct approach we
wish to be efficient at adding so we practice adding as such and not
merely as incidental to something else
this plan of incidental drill is in harmony with the principle of
interest previously explained there are several things however that
must be considered the proper procedure would seem to be to look
forward and find out in what directions the child will need to acquire
skill and then to help him acquire it in the most economical way and at
the proper time nature has so made us that we like to do a new trick
when we have taught a child how to add and subtract he likes to perform
these operations because the operations themselves give pleasure
therefore much repetition can be allowed and much skill acquired by a
direct approach to the practice when interest drags incidental drill
can be fallen back upon to help out the interest children should be
taught that certain things must be done certain skill must be acquired
they should accept some things on the authority of elders they should
be taught to apply themselves and to give their whole attention to a
thing that must be done a desire for efficiency can be developed in
them the spirit of competition can sometimes be effectively used to add
interest to drill of course interest and attention there must be and
if it cannot be secured in one way it must be in another
experiments have abundantly shown the value of formal drill that is to
say drill for drills sake if an arithmetic class is divided one half
being given a few minutes drill on the fundamental operations each day
but otherwise doing exactly the same work as the other half of the
class the half receiving the drill acquires much more skill in the
fundamental operations and besides is better at reasoning out problems
than the half that had no drill the explanation of the latter fact is
doubtless that the pupils receiving the drill acquire such efficiency in
the fundamental operations that these cause no trouble leaving all the
energies of the pupils for reasoning out the problems
it has been shown experimentally that a direct method of teaching
spelling is more efficient than an indirect method it is not to be
wondered at that such turns out to be the case for in a direct
approach the act that we are trying to habituate is brought more
directly before consciousness receiving that focal attention which is
necessary for the most efficient practice in habitformation if one
wishes to be a good ball pitcher one begins to pitch balls and
continues pitching balls day after day morning noon and night one
does not go about it indirectly if one wishes to be a good shot with a
rifle one gets a rifle and goes to shooting similarly if one wishes
to be a good adder the way to do is to begin adding not to begin doing
something else of course any method that will induce a child to realize
that he ought to acquire a certain habit is right and proper we must
do all we can to give a child a desire an interest in the thing that he
is trying to do but there is no reason why the thing should not be
faced directly
rules for habit formation in the light of the various principles which
we have discussed what rules can be given to one forming habits the
evident answer is to proceed in accordance with established principles
we may however bring the most important of these principles together
in the form of rules which can serve as a guide and help to one forming
habits
1 get initiative by this is meant that a person forming a habit
should have some sustaining reason for doing it some end that is being
sought this principle will be of very little use to young children
only to those old enough to appreciate reasons and ends in arithmetic
for example a child should be shown what can be accomplished if he
possesses certain skill in addition subtraction and multiplication it
is not always possible for a young person to see why a certain habit
should be formed for the youngest children the practice must be in the
form of play but when a child is old enough to think to have ideals
and purposes reasons and explanations should be worked out
2 get practice if you are to have skill you must practice
practice regularly practice hard while you are doing it throw your
whole life into it as if what you are doing is the most important
thing in the world practice under good conditions do not think that
just any kind of practice will do try to make conditions such that they
will enable you to do your best work such conditions will not happen by
chance you must make them happen you must make conditions favorable
you must seek opportunities to practice you must realize that your life
is in the making that you are making it that it is to a large extent
composed of habits these habits you are building they are built only
by practice get practice when practicing fulfill the psychological
conditions work under the most favorable circumstances as to length of
periods intervals etc
3 allow no exceptions you should fully realize the great influence
of exceptions when you start in to form a habit allow nothing to turn
you from your course whether the habit is some fundamental moral habit
or the multiplication table be consistent do not vacillate nothing is
so strong as consistent action nothing so weak as doubtful wavering
uncertain action have the persistence of a bull dog and the regularity
of planetary motion
transfer of training our problem now is to find out whether forming one
habit helps one to form another in some cases it does the results of a
recent experiment performed in the laboratory of educational psychology
in the university of missouri will show what is meant it was found
that if a person practiced distributing cards into pigeon holes till
great proficiency was attained and then the numbering of the boxes or
pigeon holes was changed the person could learn the new numbering and
gain proficiency in distributing the cards in the new way more quickly
than was the case at first similarly if one learns to run a
typewriter with a certain form of keyboard one can learn to operate a
different keyboard much more quickly than was the case in learning the
first keyboard
it is probable that the explanation of this apparent transfer is that
there are common elements in the two cases certain bonds established in
the first habit are available in the second in the case of distributing
the cards many such common elements can be made out one gains facility
in reading the numbering of the cards the actual movement of the hand
in getting to a particular box is the same whatever the number of the
box one acquires schemes of associating and locating the boxes schemes
that will work in both cases but suppose that one spends fifteen days
in distributing cards according to one scheme of numbering and then
changes the numbering and practices for fifteen days with the new
numbering at the end of the second fifteen days one has more skill than
at the close of the first fifteen days in fact in five days one has as
much skill in the new method as was acquired in fifteen days in the
first method however and this is an important point the speed in the
new way is not so great as the speed acquired in thirty days using one
method or one scheme all the time direct practice on the specific habit
involved is always most efficient
one should probably never learn one thing just because it will help
him in learning something else for that something else could be more
economically learned by direct practice learning one language probably
helps in learning another a year spent in learning german will probably
help in learning french but two years spent in learning french will
give more efficiency in french than will be acquired by spending one
year on german and then one year on french if the only reason for a
study is that it helps in learning something else then this study
should be left out of the curriculum if the only reason for studying
latin for example is that it helps in studying english or french or
helps in grammar or gives one a larger vocabulary in english on account
of a knowledge of the latin roots then the study of the language cannot
be justified for all of these results could be much more economically
and better attained by a direct approach of course if latin has a
justification in itself then these byproducts are not to be despised
the truth seems to be that habits are very specific things a definite
stimulus goes over to a definite response we must decide what habits we
need to have established and then by direct and economical practice
establish these habits it is true that in pursuing some studies we
acquire habits that are of much greater applicability in the affairs of
life than can be obtained from other studies when one has acquired the
various adding habits he has kinds of skill that will be of use in
almost everything that is undertaken later so also speaking habits
writing habits spelling habits moral habits etc are of universal
applicability whenever one undertakes to do a thing that involves some
habit already formed that thing is more easily done by virtue of that
habit one could not very well learn to multiply one number by another
such as 8675489 by 439857 without first learning to add
this seems to be all there is to the idea of the transfer of training
one gets an act or an idea or an attitude or a point of view that is
available in a new thing thereby making the new thing easier the
methods one would acquire in the study of zology would be many of
them directly applicable in the study of botany but just as truly
one can acquire habits in doing one thing that will be a direct
hindrance in learning another thing knocking a baseball unfits one for
knocking a tennis ball the study of literature and philosophy probably
unfits one for the study of an experimental science because the methods
are so dissimilar in some measure antagonistic
habit and moral training by moral training we mean that training which
prepares one to live among his fellows it is a training that prepares
us to act in our relations with our fellow men in such a way as to bring
happiness to our neighbors as well as to ourselves specifically it is
a training in honesty truthfulness sympathy and industry there are
other factors of morality but these are the most important it is
evident at once that moral training is the most important of all
training this is at any rate the view taken by society for if a man
falls short in his relations with his fellows he is punished if the
extent of his falling is very great his liberty is entirely taken away
from him in some cases he is put to death moral training in addition
to being the most important is also the most difficult what the public
schools can do in this field is quite limited the training which the
child gets on the streets and at home almost overshadows it
nature of moral training a good person is one who does the right social
thing at the right time the more completely and consistently one does
this the better one is what kind of training can one receive that will
give assurance of appropriate moral action two things can be done to
give a child this assurance the child can be led to form proper ideals
of action and proper habits of action by ideal of action we mean that
the child should know what the right action is and have a desire to do
it habits of action are acquired only through action as has been
pointed out in the preceding pages continued action of a definite kind
develops a tendency to this particular action ones character is the
sum of his tendencies to action these tendencies can be developed only
through practice through repetition moral training therefore has the
same basis as all other training that is in habits the same procedure
that we use in teaching the child the multiplication table is the one to
use in developing honesty in the case of the tables we have the child
say fiftysix for eight times seven we have him do this till he
does it instantly automatically honesty and truthfulness and the other
moral virtues can be fixed in the same way
home and moral training the home is the most important factor in moral
training this is largely because of the importance of early habits and
attitudes obedience to parents and respect for authority which in a
large measure underlie all other moral training must be secured and
developed in the early years of childhood the child does not start to
school till about six years old at this age much of the foundation of
morality is laid unless the child learns strict obedience in the first
two or three years of life it is doubtful whether he will ever learn it
aright without the habit of implicit obedience it is difficult to
establish any other good habit
parents should understand that training in morality consists in large
measure in building up habits and should go about it in a systematic
way as various situations arise in the early life of a child the
parents should obtain from him the appropriate responses when the
situations recur the right responses should be again secured parents
should continue to insist upon these responses till tendencies are
formed for the right response to follow when the situation arises after
continued repetition the response comes automatically the good man or
woman is the one who does the right thing as the situation presents
itself does it as a matter of course because it is his nature he does
not even think of doing the wrong thing
one of the main factors in child training is consistency the parent
must inflexibly require the right action in the appropriate situation
good habits will not be formed if parents insist on proper action one
day but on the next day allow the child to do differently
parents must plan the habits which they wish their children to form and
execute these plans systematically exercising constant care parents
and children as well would profit from reading the plan used by
franklin farseeing and clearheaded franklin saw that character is a
structure which one builds so he set about this building in a
systematic way for a certain length of time he practiced on one virtue
allowing no exceptions in this one virtue when this aspect of his
character had acquired strength he added another virtue and then tried
to keep perfect as to both4
4 see autobiography of benjamin franklin
the school and moral training in this as in all other forms of
training the school is supplementary to the home the teacher should
have well in mind the habits and ideals that the home has been trying to
develop and should assist in strengthening the bonds the school can do
much in developing habits of kindness and sympathy among the children
it can develop civic and social ideals and habits just how it can best
do this is a question should moral ideals be impressed systematically
and should habits be formed at the time these ideals are impressed or
should the different ideals be instilled and developed as occasion
demands this is an experimental problem and that method should be
followed which produces the best results it is possible that one
teacher may use one method best while a different teacher will have
better success with another method
more important than the question of a systematic or an incidental method
is the question of making the matter vital when it is taken up nothing
is more certain than that mere knowledge of right action will not insure
right action in a few hours one can teach a child as matters of mere
knowledge what he should do in all the important situations of life
but this will not insure that he will henceforth do the right things
there are only two ways by which we can obtain any assurance that right
action will come the first way is to secure right habits of response
we must build up tendencies to action tendencies depend upon previous
action the second way is to help the child to analyze moral situations
and see what results will follow upon the different kinds of action
there can be developed in a child a desire to do that which will bring
joy and happiness to others rather than pain and sorrow but this
analysis of moral situations is not enough to insure right moral action
there must be practice in doing the right thing the situation must go
over to the right response to insure its going there the next time the
first thing in moral training is to develop habits then as soon as
the child is old enough he can strengthen his habits by a careful
analysis of the problem why one should act one way rather than another
this adds motive and motive gives strength and assurance
  summary habits are acquired tendencies to specific actions in
  definite situations they are fixed through repetition they give us
  speed accuracy and certainty they save energy and prevent
  fatigue they are performed with less attention and become
  pleasurable the main purpose of education is to form the
  habitsmoral intellectual vocational culturalnecessary for
  life habits and ideals are the basis of our mature life and
  character moral training is essentially like other forms of
  training habit being the basis
class exercises
1 practice on the formation of some habit until considerable skill is
acquired draw a learning curve similar to the one on page 95 showing
the increase in skill a class experiment can be performed by the use of
a substitution test take letters to represent the nine digits then
transcribe numbers into the letters as described on page 192 keep a
record of successive fiveminute periods of practice till all have
practiced an hour this gives twelve practice periods for the
construction of a learning curve the individual experiments should be
more difficult and cover a longer period suitable experiments for
individual practice are learning to operate a typewriter pitching
marbles into a hole writing with the left hand and mirror writing the
latter is performed by standing a mirror vertically on the table
placing the paper in front and writing in such a way that the letters
have the proper form and appearance when seen in the mirror the subject
should not look at his hand but at its reflection in the mirror a piece
of cardboard can be supported just over the hand so that only the image
of the hand in the mirror can be seen
2 a study of the interference of habit can be made as follows take
eight small boxes and arrange them in a row number each box plainly do
not number them consecutively but as follows 5 7 1 8 2 3 6 4
make eighty cards ten of each number and number them plainly practice
distributing the cards into the boxes note the time required for each
distribution continue to distribute them till considerable skill is
acquired then rearrange the order of the boxes and repeat the
experiment what do the results show
3 does the above experiment show any transfer of training compare the
time for each distribution in the second part of the experiment ie
after the rearrangement of the boxes with the time for the
corresponding distribution in the first part of the experiment the
question to be answered is are the results of the second part of the
experiment better than they would have been if the first part had not
been performed state your results and conclusions and compare with the
statements in the text
4 a study of the effects of spreading out learning periods can be made
as follows divide the class into two equal divisions let one division
practice on a substitution experiment as explained in exercise 1 for
five tenminute periods of practice in immediate succession let the
other division practice for five days ten minutes a day what do the
results indicate the divisions should be of equal ability if the first
tenminute practice period shows the sections to be of unequal ability
this fact should be taken into account in making the comparisons test
sheets can be prepared by the teacher or they can be obtained from the
extension division of the university of missouri
5 an experiment similar to no 4 can be performed by practicing adding
or any other school exercise care must be taken to control the
experiment and to eliminate disturbing factors
6 try the carddistributing experiment with people of different ages
young children old people and various ages in between what do you
learn is it as easy for an old person to form a habit as it is for a
young person why
7 if an old person has no old habits to interfere can he form a new
habit as readily as can a young person
8 cite evidence from your own experience to prove that it is hard for
an old person to break up old habits and form new ones which interfere
with the old ones
9 do you find that you are becoming set in your ways
10 what do we mean by saying that we are plastic in early years
11 have you planned your life work are you establishing the habits
that will be necessary in it
12 is it an advantage or a disadvantage to choose ones profession or
occupation early
13 attention often interferes with the performance of a habitual act
why is this
14 if a man removes his vest in the daytime he is almost sure to wind
his watch on the other hand if he is up all night he lets his watch
run down why
15 do you know of people who have radically changed their views late in
life
16 try to teach a dog or a cat a trick what do you learn of importance
about habitformation
17 what branches taught in school involve the formation of habits that
are useful throughout life
18 make a list of the moral habits that should be formed in early
years
19 write an essay on habit and life

memory
perceptions and ideas in a previous chapter brief mention was made of
the difference between perceptions and ideas this distinction must now
be enlarged upon and made clearer perceptions arise out of our sensory
life we see things when these things are before our eyes we hear
things when these things produce air vibrations which affect our ears
we smell things when tiny particles from them come into contact with a
small patch of sensitive membrane in our noses we taste substances when
these substances are in our mouths now this seeing hearing smelling
tasting etc is perceiving we perceive a thing when the thing is
actually at the time affecting some one or more of our sense organs a
perception then results from the stimulation of a sense organ
perception is the process of perceiving sensing objects in the
external world
ideas are our seeming to see hear smell taste things when these
things are not present to the senses this morning i saw had a
perception of a robin tonight in my study i have an idea of a
robin this morning the robin was present light reflected from it
stimulated my eye tonight as i have an idea of the robin it is not
here i only seem to see it the scene which was mine this morning is
now revived reproduced we may say therefore that ideas are the
conscious representatives of objects which are not present to the
senses ideas are revived experiences
revived experience is memory since it is memory that enables us to live
our lives over again brings the past up to the present it is one of
the most wonderful aspects of our natures the importance of memory is
at once apparent if we try to imagine what life would be without it if
our life were only perceptual if it were only the sights and sounds and
smells and tastes of the passing moment it would have little meaning
it would be bare and empty but instead of our perceptions being our
whole life they are only the starting points of life perceptions serve
to arouse groups of memory images or ideas and the groups of ideas
enrich the passing moment and give meaning to the passing perceptions
which otherwise would have no meaning
suppose i am walking along the street and meet a friend i see him
speak to him and pass on but after i have passed on i have ideas i
think of seeing my friend the day before i think of what he said and of
what he was doing of what i said and of what i was doing perhaps for
many minutes there come ideas from my past experience these ideas were
aroused by the perception of my friend the perception was momentary
but it started a long train of memory ideas
i pass on down the street and go by a music store within the store a
victrola is playing jesus lover of my soul the song starts another
train of memory ideas i think of the past of my boyhood days and
sunday school my early home and many scenes of my childhood for
several minutes i am so engrossed with the memory images that i
scarcely notice anything along the street again the momentary
perception this time of sounds served to revive a great number of
ideas or memories of the past
these illustrations are typical of our life every moment we have
perceptions these perceptions arouse ideas of our past life and
experience one of these ideas evokes another and so an endless chain
of images passes along the older we become the richer is our
ideational life while we are children the perceptions constitute the
larger part of our mental life but as we become older larger and
larger becomes the part played by our memory images or ideas a child is
not content to sit down and reflect giving himself up to the flow of
ideas that come up from his past experience but a mature person can
spend hours in recalling past experience this means that the older we
grow the more we live in the past the less we are bound down by the
present and when we are old instead of perceptions being the main part
of mental life they but give the initial push to our thoughts which go
on in an endless chain as long as we live
the physiological basis of memory it will be remembered that the basis
of perception is the agitation of the brain caused by the stimulation of
a sense organ by an external thing or force if there is no stimulation
of a sense organ there is no sensation no perception now just as the
basis of sensation and perception is brain activity so it is also the
basis of ideas in sensation the brain activity is set up from without
in memory when we have ideas the brain activity is set up from within
and is a fainter revival of the activity originally caused by the
stimulation of the sense organ our ideas are just as truly conditioned
or caused by brain activity as are our sensations
memory presents many problems and psychologists have been trying for
many years to solve them we shall now see what they have discovered and
what is the practical significance of the facts
relation of memory to age and sex it is a common notion that memory is
best when we are young but such is not the case numerous experiments
have shown that all aspects of memory improve with age some aspects of
memory improve more than others and they improve at different times and
rates but all aspects do improve from the beginning of school age to
about fourteen years of age the improvement of most aspects of memory is
rapid
if we pronounce a number of digits to a child of six it can reproduce
but few of them a child of eight or ten can reproduce more a child of
twelve can reproduce still more and an adult still more if we read a
sentence to children of different ages we find that the older children
can reproduce a longer sentence if we read a short story to children of
different ages and then require them to reproduce the story in their
own words the older children reproduce more of the story than do the
young children5
5 see age and sex graphs pp 184 188 189
girls excel boys in practically all the aspects of memory
in rote memory that is memory for lists of unrelated words there is
not much difference but the girls are somewhat better however in the
ability to remember the ideas of a story girls excel boys at every age
this superiority of girls over boys is not merely a matter of memory a
girl is superior to a boy of the same age in nearly every way this is
merely a fact of development a girl develops faster than a boy she
reaches maturity more quickly in mind as well as in body although a
girl is lighter than a boy at birth on the average she gains in weight
faster and is heavier at twelve than a boy of the same age she also
gains faster in height and for a few years in early adolescence is
taller than a boy of the same age of course boys catch up and finally
become much taller and heavier than girls similarly a girls mind
develops faster than the mind of a boy as shown in memory and other
mental functions
the improvement of memory by practice all aspects of memory can be
improved by practice some aspects much other aspects little the
memory span for digits or letters or words or for objects cannot be
much improved but memory for ideas that are related as the ideas of a
story can be considerably improved in extensive experiments conducted
in the authors laboratory it was found that a person who at first
required an hour to memorize the ideas in a certain amount of material
could after a few months practice memorize the same amount in fifteen
minutes and in the latter case the ideas would be better remembered
than they were at the beginning of the experiment not only could a
given number of ideas be learned in less time but they would be better
retained when learned in the shorter time if a person comes to us for
advice as to how to improve his memory what should we tell him in
order to answer the question we must consider the factors of a good
memory
factors of a good memory 1 the first requirement is to get a good
impression in the beginning memory is revived experience the more
vivid and intense the first experience the more sure will be the later
recall so if we wish to remember an experience we must experience it
in the first place under the most favorable conditions the thing must
be seen clearly it must be understood it must be in the focus of
consciousness
the best teaching is that which leads the child to get the clearest
apprehension of what is taught if we are teaching about some concrete
thing a plant a machine we should be sure that the child sees the
essential points should be sure that the main principles enter his
consciousness we should find out by questioning whether he really does
clearly understand what we are trying to get him to understand often we
think a pupil or student has forgotten when the fact is that he never
really knew the thing which we wished to have him remember
the first requisite to memory then is to know in the first place if
we wish to remember knowledge the knowledge must be seen in the
clearest light really be knowledge at the outset few people ever
really learn how to learn they never see anything clearly they never
stick to a point till it is apprehended in all its relations and
bearings consequently they forget largely because they never really
knew in the fullest sense
most teaching is too abstract the teacher uses words that have no
meaning to the pupil too much teaching deals with things indirectly we
study about things instead of studying things in geography for
example we study about the earth getting our information from a book
we read about land formations river courses erosion etc when
instead we should study these objects and processes themselves the
first thing in memory then is clear apprehension clear understanding
vivid and intense impression
2 the second thing necessary to memory is to repeat the experience
first we must get a clear impression then we must repeat the experience
if we would retain it it is a mistake to believe that if we have once
understood a thing we will always thereafter remember it we must think
our experiences over again if we wish to fix them for permanent
retention
we must organize our experience to organize experience means to think
it over in its helpful relations in memory one idea arouses another
when we have one idea what other idea will this arouse it depends on
what connections this idea has had in our minds in the past it depends
on the associations that it has and associations depend on our thinking
the ideas over together
teachers and parents should help children to think over their
experiences in helpful practical relations then in the future when an
idea comes to mind it brings along with it other ideas that have these
helpful practical relations we must not then merely repeat our
experiences but must repeat them in helpful connections or
associations in organizing our experience we must systematize and
classify our knowledge
one of the chief differences in men is in the way they organize their
knowledge most of us have experiences abundant enough but we differ in
the way we work over and organize these experiences organization not
only enables us to remember our experience but brings our experience
back in the right connections
the advice that should be given to a student is the following make sure
that you understand if the matter is a lesson in a book go through it
trying to get the main facts then go through it again trying to see
the relation of all the facts then try to see the facts in relation to
your wider experience if it is a history lesson think of the facts of
the lesson in their relation to previous chapters think of the details
in their bearing on wider and larger movements
a teacher should always hold in mind the facts in regard to memory and
should make her teaching conform to them she should carefully plan the
presentation of a new topic so as to insure a clear initial impression
a new topic should be presented orally by the teacher with abundant
illustration and explanation it cannot be made too concrete it cannot
be made too plain and simple
then after the teacher has introduced and made plain the new topic the
pupil reads and studies further at the next recitation of the class
the first thing in order should be a discussion on the part of the
pupils this will help the pupils to get the facts cleared up and will
help the teacher to find out whether the pupils have the facts right
the first part of the recitation should also be a time for questions
everything should now be made clear if there are any errors or
misunderstandings on the pupils part of course any procedure in a
recitation should depend upon the nature of the material and to some
extent on the stage of advancement of the pupil but in general such a
procedure as that just outlined will be most satisfactory and
economical first clear initial presentation by the teacher then
reading and study on the part of the pupil and third discussions on
the following day
teachers should also endeavor to show students how to study to the best
advantage pupils do not know how to study they do not know what to
look for and do not know how to find it after they know what they are
looking for they should be shown of course some of them learn without
help how to study but some never learn and it would be a great saving
of time to help all of them master the arts of study and memorizing
a very important factor in connection with memory is the matter of
meaning if a person will try to memorize a list of nonsense words he
will find that it is much more difficult than to memorize words that
have meaning this is a significant fact it means that as material
approaches nonsense it is difficult to memorize therefore we should
always try to grasp the meaning of a thing its significance in
science let us always ask what is the meaning of this fact what
bearing does it have on other facts how does it affect the meaning of
other facts
kinds of memories we should not speak of memory as if it were some sort
of power like muscular strength we should always speak of memories
memories may be classified from several different points of view a
classification may be based on the kind of material as memory for
concrete things the actual objects of experience on the one hand and
memory for abstract material such as names of things their attributes
and relations on the other again we can base a classification on the
type of ideation to which the material appeals as auditory memory
visual memory motor memory we can also base a classification on the
principle of meaning this principle of classification would give us
at least three classes memory for ideas as expressed in sentences
logical memory memory for series of meaningful words not logically
related in sentences rote memory memory for series of meaningless
words a form of rote memory this classification is not meant to be
complete but only suggestive with every change in the kind of
material the method of presenting the material to the subject or the
manner in which the subject deals with the material there may be a
change in the effectiveness of memory
while these different kinds or aspects of memory may have some relation
to one another they are to some extent independent one may have a good
rote memory and a poor logical memory or a poor rote memory and a good
logical memory that is to say one may be very poor at remembering the
exact words of a book but be good at remembering the meaning the
ideas of the book one may be good at organizing meaningful material
but poor at remembering mere words on the other hand these conditions
may be reversed one may remember the words but never get the meaning
it is of course possible that much of this difference is due to habit
and experience but some of the difference is beyond doubt due to
original differences in the nervous system and brain these differences
should be determined in the case of all children it is quite a common
thing to find a feebleminded person with a good rote memory but such a
person never has a good logical memory one can have a good rote memory
without understanding one cannot have a good logical memory without
understanding
let us now ask the question why can one remember better words that are
connected by logical relations than words that have no such connection
if we read to a person a list of twenty nonsense words the person can
remember only two or three but if a list of twenty words connected in a
sentence were read to a person in most cases all of them would be
reproduced the reason is that the words in the latter case are not new
we already know the words they are already a part of our experience we
have had days perhaps years of experience with them all that is now
new about them is perhaps a slightly new relation
moreover the twenty words may contain but one or at most only a few
ideas and in this case it is the ideas that we remember the ideas hold
the words together if the twenty words contain a great number of ideas
then we cannot remember all of them from one reading if i say i have
a little boy who loves his father and mother very much and this boy
wishes to go to the river to catch some fish one can easily remember
all these words after one reading but if i say the stomach in all the
salmonid is syphonal and at the pylorus are fifteen to two hundred
comparatively large pyloric coeca although this sentence is shorter
one finds it more difficult to remember and the main reason is that the
words are not so familiar
memory and thinking what is the relation of memory to thinking and the
other mental functions one often hears a teacher say that she does not
wish her pupils to depend on memory but wishes them to reason things
out such a statement shows a misunderstanding of the facts for
reasoning itself is only the recall of ideas in accordance with the laws
of association without memory there would be no reasoning for the
very material of thought is found to be the revived experiences which we
call ideas memories
one of the first requisites of good thinking is a reliable memory one
must have facts to reason and these facts must come to one in memory to
be available for thought if one wishes to become a great thinker in a
certain field he must gain experience in that field and organize that
experience in such a way as to remember it and to recall it when it is
wanted
what one does deplore is memory for the mere words with no understanding
of the meaning in geometry for example a student sometimes commits to
memory the words of a demonstration with no understanding of the
meaning of course that is worse than useless one should remember the
meaning of the demonstration if one has memorized the words only he
cannot solve an original problem in geometry but if he has understood
the meaning of the demonstration then he recalls it and is enabled to
solve the problem if one does not remember the various facts about the
relationships in a triangle he cannot solve a problem of the triangle
until he has worked out and discovered the necessary facts then memory
would make them available for the solution of the problem
memory and school standing that memory plays a large part in our life
is evident and of course it is an important factor in all school
work it matters not what we learn if we do not remember it the author
has made extensive experiments to determine the relation that memory has
to a childs progress in school
the method used was to give logical memory tests to all the children in
a school and then rank the children in accordance with their abilities
to reproduce the story used in the test then they were ranked according
to their standing in their studies a very high correlation was found
on the whole the pupils standing highest in the memory tests were found
to stand highest in their studies it is true of course that they did
not stand highest merely because they had good memories but because
they were not only better in memory but were better in most other
respects too pupils that are good in logical memory are usually good in
other mental functions
a test of logical memory is one of the best to give us an idea of the
school standing of pupils not only is the retention of ideas of very
great importance itself but the acquiring of ideas and the organizing
of them in such a way as to remember them involves nearly all the mental
functions the one who remembers well ideas logically related is the
one who pays the closest attention the one who sees the significance
the one who organizes the one who repeats the one who turns things
over in his mind a logical memory test is therefore to some extent a
test of attention association power of organization as well as of
memory in a word it is a test of mental power
other things being equal a person whose power of retention is good has
a great advantage over his fellows who have poor ability to remember
suppose we consider the learning of language the pupil who can look up
the meaning of a word just once and remember it has an advantage over
the person who has to look up the meaning of the word several times
before it is retained so in any branch of study the person who can
acquire the facts in less time than another person has the extra time
for learning something else or for going over the same material and
organizing it better the scientist who remembers all the significant
facts that he reads and sees their bearing on his problems has a great
advantage over the person who does not remember so well
of course there are certain dangers in having a good memory just as
there is danger in being brilliant generally the quick learner is in
danger of forming slovenly habits a person who learns quickly is likely
to form the habit of waiting till the last minute to study his lesson
and then getting a superficial idea of it the slow learner must form
good habits of study to get on at all
teachers and parents should prevent the bright children from forming bad
habits of study the person who learns quickly and retains well should
be taught to be thorough and to use the advantage that comes from
repetition the quick learner should not be satisfied with one attack on
his lesson but should study the lesson more than once for even the
brilliant learner cannot afford to neglect the advantages that come from
repetition a person with poor memory and only mediocre ability
generally can make up very much by hard work and by work that takes
advantage of all the laws of economical learning but he can never
compete successfully with the person who works as hard as he does and
who has good powers of learning and retention
the author has found that in a large class of a hundred or more there
is usually a person who has good memory along with good mental ability
generally and is also a hard worker such a person always does the best
work in the class a person with poor memory and poor mental powers
generally cannot hope to compete with a person of good memory good
mental powers generally if that person is also a good worker
learning and remembering a popular fallacy is expressed in the saying
easy come easy go the person who is the best learner is also the
best in retaining what is learned provided all other conditions are the
same this matter was determined in the following way a logical memory
test was given to all the children in a city school system a story was
read to the pupils and then reproduced by them in writing the papers
were corrected and graded and nothing more was said about the test for
one month then at the same time in every room the teachers said you
remember the story i read to you some time ago and which i asked you to
reproduce well i wish to see how much of the story you still
remember the pupils were then required to write down all the story
that they could recall
it was found that in general the children who write the most when the
story is first read to them write the most after the lapse of a month
and the poorest ones at first are the poorest ones at the end of the
month of course the correspondence is not perfect but in some cases
in some grades it is almost so
the significance of this experiment is very great it means that the
pupil who gets the most facts from a lesson will have the most facts at
any later time this is true of course only if other things are equal
if one pupil studies about the matter more reflects upon it repeats it
in his mind of course this person will remember more other things
being equal but if neither reviews the matter or if both do it to an
equal extent then the one who learns the most in the first place
remembers the most at a later time
i have also tested the matter out in other ways i have experimented
with a group of men and women by reading a passage of about a page in
length repeating the reading till the subject could reproduce all the
facts it was found that the person who acquired all the facts from the
fewest readings remembered more of the facts later it must be said that
there is less difference between the subjects later than at first
in the laboratory of columbia university a similar experiment was
performed but in a somewhat different way students were required to
commit to memory german vocabularies and were later tested for their
retention of the words learned it was found that those who learned the
most words in a given time also retained the largest percentage of what
had been learned it should not be surprising that this is the case the
quick learner is the one who makes the best use of all the factors of
retention the factors mentioned in the preceding paragraphgood
attention association organization etc
another experiment performed in the authors laboratory bears out the
above conclusions a group of students were required to commit to memory
at one sitting a long list of nonsense syllables the number of
repetitions necessary to enable each student to reproduce them was
noted one day later the students attempted to reproduce the syllables
of course they could not and they were then required to say them over
again till they could just repeat them from memory the number of
repetitions was noted the number of repetitions was much less than on
the first day on the third day the process was repeated the number of
repetitions was fewer still this relearning was kept up each day till
each person could repeat the syllables from memory without any study
it was found that the person who learned the syllables in the fewest
repetitions the first time relearned them in the fewest repetitions on
succeeding days all the experiments bearing on the subject point to the
same conclusion namely that the quick learner if other things are
equal retains at least as well as the slow learner and usually retains
better
transfer of memory training we have said above that there are many
kinds or aspects of memory it has also been said that we can improve
memory by practice now the question arises if we improve one aspect
of memory does this improve all aspects this is an important question
moreover it is one to be settled by experiment and not by argument
the most extensive and thorough experiment was performed by an english
psychologist sleight the experiment was essentially as follows he
took a large number of pupils and tested the efficiency of the various
aspects of their memory he then took half of them and trained one
aspect of their memory until there was considerable improvement the
other section had no memory training meanwhile after the training both
groups again had all aspects of their memory tested both groups showed
improvement in all aspects because the first tests gave them some
practice but the group that had been receiving the training was no
better in those aspects not trained than was the group receiving no
training at all aspects of memory much like the one trained showed some
improvement but other aspects did not
the conclusion is that memory training is specific that it affects only
the kind of memory trained and related memories this is in harmony
with what we learned about habit when we receive training it affects
only the parts of us trained and other closely related parts
learning by wholes we do not often have to commit to memory verbatim
but when we do it is important that we should know the most economical
way experiments have clearly demonstrated that the most economical way
is to read the entire selection through from beginning to end and
continue to read it through in this way till the matter is learned by
heart
in long selections the saving by this method is considerable a pupil
is not likely to believe this because if he spends a few minutes
learning in this manner he finds that he cannot repeat a single line
while if he had concentrated on one line he could have repeated at
least that much this is true but although he cannot repeat a single
line by the whole procedure he has learned nevertheless it would be a
good thing to demonstrate this fact to a class then the pupils would be
satisfied to use the most economical procedure the plan holds good
whether the matter be prose or poetry
but experiments have been carried on only with verbatim learning the
best procedure for learning the facts so that one can give them in ones
own words has not yet been experimentally determined
cramming an important practical question is whether it pays to go over
a great amount of material in a very short time as students often do
before examinations from all that has been said above one could infer
the solution to this problem learning and memorizing are to some extent
a growth and consequently involve time
there is an important law of learning and memory known as josts law
which may be stated as follows if we repeat or renew associations the
repetitions have most value for the old associations therefore when we
learn we should learn and then later relearn this will make for
permanent retention of course if we wish to get together a great mass
of facts for a temporary purpose and do not care to retain them
permanently cramming is the proper method if we are required to pass
an examination in which a knowledge of many details is expected and
these details have no important permanent value cramming is justified
when a lawyer is preparing a case to present to a court the actual
detail evidence is of no permanent value and cramming is justified
but if we wish to acquire and organize facts for their permanent value
cramming is not the proper procedure the proper procedure is for a
student to go over his work faithfully as the term of school proceeds
then occasionally review at the end of the term a rapid review of the
whole terms work is valuable after one has studied over matter and
once carefully worked it out a quick view again of the whole subject is
most valuable and assists greatly in making the acquisition permanent
but if the matter has not been worked out before the hasty view of the
material of the course while it may enable one to pass the examination
has no permanent value
function of the teacher in memory work the function of a teacher is
plainly to get the pupils to learn in accordance with the laws of memory
above set forth but there are certain things that a teacher can do that
may not have become evident to the reader it has been learned in
experiments in logical memory that when a story is read to a subject and
the subject attempts to reproduce it certain mistakes are made when
the story is read again it is common for the same mistakes to be made
in the recall certain ideas were apprehended in a certain way and
when the piece is read again the subject pays no more attention to the
ideas already acquired and reported and they are therefore reported
wrongly as they were in the first place often the subject does not
notice the errors till his attention is called to them
this suggests an important function of the teacher in connection with
the memory work of the pupils this function is to correct mistakes in
the early stages of learning a teacher should always be on the watch to
find the errors of the pupils and to correct them before they are fixed
by repetition
a teacher should also consider it her duty to test the memory
capacities of the pupils and to give each the advice that the case
demands
some educational inferencesthere are certain consequences to
education that follow from the facts of memory above set forth that are
of considerable significance many things have been taught to children
on the assumption that they could learn them better in childhood than
later because it was thought that memory and the learning capacity were
better in childhood but both of these assumptions are false as
children grow older their learning capacity increases and their memories
become better
it has particularly been held that rote memory is better in childhood
and that therefore children should begin their foreign language study
early it is true that as far as speaking a foreign language is
concerned the earlier a child begins it the better but this is not
true of learning to read the language the sounds of the foreign
language that we have not learned in childhood in speaking the mother
tongue are usually difficult for us to make the organs of speech become
set in the way of their early exercise in reading the foreign language
correct pronunciation is not important we are concerned with getting
the thought and this is possible without pronouncing at all reference
to graphs on pages 190 and 191 will show that rote memory steadily
improves throughout childhood and youth the author has performed
numerous experiments to test this very point he has had adults work
side by side with children at building up new associations of the rote
memory type and found that always the adult could learn faster than the
child and retain better what was learned
the experience of language teachers in college and university does not
give much comfort to those who claim that language study should be begun
early these teachers claim that the students who have had previous
language study do no better than those who have had none it seems
however that there certainly ought to be some advantage in beginning
language study early and spreading the study out over the high school
period but what is gained does not offset the tremendous loss that
follows from requiring all high school students to study a foreign
language merely to give an opportunity for early study to those who are
to go on in the university with language courses a mature university
student that has a real interest in language and literature can begin
his language study in the university and make rapid progress some of
the best classical scholars whom the author knows began their language
study in the university while it would have been of some advantage to
them to have begun their language study earlier there are so few who
should go into this kind of work that society cannot afford to make
provision for their beginning the study in the high school
the selection and arrangement of the studies in the curriculum must be
based on other grounds than the laws of memory what children make most
progress in and need most to know are the concrete things of their
physical and social environment children must first learn the
worldthe woods and streams and birds and flowers and plants and
animals the earth its rocks and soils and the wonderful forces at work
in it they must learn manwhat he is and what he does and how he does
it how he lives and does his work and how he governs himself they
should also learn to read and to write their mother tongue and should
learn something of that great store of literature written in the mother
tongue
the few that are to be scholars in language and literature must wait
till beginning professional study before taking up their foreign
language just as a person who is to be a lawyer or physician must also
wait till time to enter a university before beginning special
professional preparation the childs memory for abstract conceptions is
particularly weak in early years hence studies should be so arranged as
to acquaint the child with the concrete aspects of the world first and
later to acquaint him with the abstract relations of things mathematics
should come late in the childs life for the same reason mathematics
deals with quantitative relations which the child can neither learn nor
remember profitably and economically till he is more mature the child
should first learn the world in its descriptive aspects
memory and habit the discussion up to this point should have made it
clear to the reader that memory is much the same thing as habit memory
considered as retention depends upon the permanence of the impression on
the brain but in its associative aspects depends on connections between
brain centers as is the case with habit the association of ideas
which is the basis of their recall is purely a matter of habit
formation
when i think of george washington i also think of the revolution of
the government of the presidency of john adams thomas jefferson
etc because of the connections which these ideas have had in my mind
many times before there is a basis in the brain structure for these
connections there is nothing in any idea that connects it with
another idea ideas become connected because of the way in which we
experience them and the reason one idea calls up another idea is
because the brain process that is the cause of one idea brings about
another brain process that is the cause of a second idea the whole
thing is merely a matter of the way the brain activities become
organized therefore the various laws of habitformation have
application to memory in so far as memory is a matter of the association
of ideas based on brain processes
one often has the experience of trying to recall a name or a fact and
finds that he cannot presently the name or fact may come or it may not
come till the next day or the next week what is the cause of this
peculiar phenomenon the explanation is to be found in the nervous
system when one tries to recall the name and it will not come to mind
there is some temporary block or hindrance in the nervepath that leads
from one center to the other and one cannot think of the name till the
obstruction is removed we go on thinking about other things and in the
meantime the activities going on in the brain remove the obstruction so
when the matter comes up again the nerve current shoots through and
behold the name comes to mind
illustration figure ivassociative connections
the diagram represents schematically the neural basis of the association
of ideas
now the only preventive of such an occurrence is to be found in the law
of habit for the block ordinarily occurs in case of paths or bonds not
well established we must think together the things we wish to have
associated repetition is the key to the situation repetition which is
the significant thing in habitformation repetition which is the only
way of coupling two things which we wish to have associated together
of course there is no absolute coupling of two ideas one sometimes
forgets his own name when we are tired or ill things which were the
most closely associated may not hang together but those ideas hold
together in the firmest way that have been experienced together most
often in a state of attention the diagram on page 147 illustrates
schematically the neural connections and crossconnections which are the
bases of the association of ideas the circles a b c d e
and f represent brain processes which give rise to ideas and the
lines represent connecting paths note that there are both direct and
indirect connections
  summary sensation and perception give us our first experience with
  things memory is revived experience it enables us to live our
  experience over again and is therefore one of the most important
  human traits the physiological basis of memory is in the brain and
  nervous system memory improves with practice and up to a certain
  point with the age of the person it is better in girls than in
  boys good memory depends on vivid experience in the first place and
  on organization and repetition afterward the person who learns
  quickly usually retains well also memory training is specific the
  extension of the learning process over a long time is favorable to
  memory memory ideas are the basis of thinking and reasoning
class exercises
1 the teacher can test the auditory memory of the members of the class
for rote material by using letters it is better to omit the vowels
using only the consonants prepare five groups of letters with eight
letters in a group read each group of letters to the class slowly and
distinctly after reading a group allow time for the students to write
down what they recall then read the next group and so proceed till the
five groups have been read grade the work by finding the number of
letters reproduced taking no account of the position of the letters
2 in a similar way test visual memory using different combinations of
letters write the letters plainly on five large squares of cardboard
hold each list before the class for as long a time as it took to read a
group in experiment no 1
3 test memory for words in a similar way use simple words of one
syllable making five lists with eight words in a list
4 test memory for objects by fastening common objects on a large
cardboard and holding the card before the class put eight objects on
each card and prepare five cards expose them for the same length of
time as in experiment no 2
5 test memory for names of objects by preparing five lists of names
eight names in a list and reading the names as in experiment no 1
6 you now have data for the following study find the average grade of
each student in the different experiments find the combined grade of
each student in all the above experiments do the members of the class
hold the same rank in all the tests how do the boys compare with the
girls how does memory for objects compare with memory for names of
objects how does auditory memory compare with visual what other points
do you learn from the experiments
7 the teacher can make a study of the logical memory of the members of
the class by using material as described on page 184 make five separate
tests using stories that are well within the comprehension of the class
and that will arouse their interest sufficient material will be found
in the authors examination of school children and whipples manual
however the teacher can prepare similar material
8 do the students maintain the same rank in the separate tests of
experiment no 7 rank all the students for their combined standing in
all the first five tests rank them for their combined standing in the
logical memory tests compare the two rankings what conclusions are
warranted
9 you have tested in experiment no 7 logical memory when the
material was read to the students it will now be interesting to compare
the results of no 7 with the results obtained by allowing the students
to read the material of the test for this purpose select portions from
the later chapters of this book allow just time enough for the
selection to be read once slowly by the students then have it
reproduced as in the other logical memory experiment give several
tests if there is sufficient time find the average grade of each
student and compare the results with those obtained in no 7 this will
enable you to compare the relative standing of the members of the
class but will not enable you to compare the two ways of acquiring
facts for this purpose the stories would have to be of equal
difficulty let the members of the class plan an experiment that would
be adequate for this purpose
10 a brief study of the improvement of memory can be made by practicing
a few minutes each day for a week or two as time permits using
material that can be easily prepared such as lists of common words let
the members of the class plan the experiment use the best plan
11 the class can make a study of the relation of memory to school
standing in one of the grades below the high school give at least two
tests for logical memory give also the rote memory tests described on
page 189 get the class standing of the pupils from the teacher make
the comparison as suggested in chapter i page 15 or the correlation
can be worked out accurately by following the directions given in the
examination of school children page 58 or in whipples manual
page 38
12 let the members of the class make a plan for the improvement of
their memory for the material studied in school plan devices for
learning the material better and for fixing it in memory at the end of
the course in psychology have an experience meeting and study the
results reported
13 prepare five lists of nonsense syllables with eight in a list give
them as in experiment no 3 and compare the results with those of that
experiment what do the results indicate as to the value to memory of
meaningful material what educational inferences can you make in
preparing the syllables put a vowel between two consonants and use no
syllable that is a real word
14 a study of the effects of distractions on learning and memory can be
made as follows let the teacher select two paragraphs in later chapters
of this book of equal length and difficulty let the students read one
under quiet conditions and the other while an electric bell is ringing
in the room compare the reproductions in the two cases
15 from the chapter and from the results of all the memory tests let
the students enumerate the facts that have educational significance
16 make a complete outline of the chapter

thinking
in chapter iii we learned about sensation we found that when a sense
organ is stimulated by its appropriate type of stimulus this
stimulation travels through the sensory nerves and sets up an excitation
in the brain this excitation in the brain gives us sensation we see if
the eye is stimulated we hear if the ear is stimulated etc in
chapter vii we learned that after the brain has had an excitation giving
rise to sensation it is capable of reviving this excitation later this
renewal or revival of a brain excitation gives us an experience
resembling the original sensation only usually fainter and less stable
this revived experience is called image or idea the general process
of retention and revival of experience is as we have seen known as
memory an idea then is a bit of revived experience a perception is a
bit of immediate or primary experience i am said to perceive a chair if
the chair is present before me if the light reflected from the chair is
actually exciting my retinas i have an idea of the chair when i
seem to see it when the chair is not before me or when my eyes are
shut these distinctions were pointed out in the preceding chapter let
us now proceed to carry our study of ideas further
association of ideas the subject of the association of ideas can best
be introduced by an experiment take a paper and pencil and think of
the word horse write this word down and then write down other words
that come to mind write them in the order in which they come to mind
do this for three or four minutes and try the experiment several times
beginning with a different word each time make a study of the lists of
words compare the different lists and the lists written by different
students
in the case of the writer the following words came to mind in the first
few seconds horse bridle saddle tail harness buggy whip man
sky stars sun ocean why did these words come and why did they come
in that order why did the idea horse suggest the idea bridle and
why did bridle suggest saddle is there something in the nature of
ideas that couples them with certain other ideas and makes them always
suggest the other ideas no there is not ideas become coupled together
in our experience and the coupling is in accordance with our
experience things that are together in our experience become coupled
together as ideas the idea horse may become coupled with any other
idea the general law of the association of ideas is this ideas are
joined together in memory or revived experience as they were joined in
the original or perceptive experience
but the matter is complicated by the fact that things are experienced in
different connections in perceptive experience i do not always
experience horse together with bridle i sometimes see horses in a
pasture eating clover so as far as this last experience is concerned
when i think horse i should also think clover i sometimes see a
horse running when a train whistles so whistle and horse should be
coupled in my mind a horse once kicked me on the shoulder so horse
and shoulder should be connected in my mind and so they are the very
fact that these various experiences come back to me proves that they are
connected in my mind in accordance with the original experiences the
revival of various horse experiences has come to me faster than i could
write them down and they are all bound together in my memory if i
should write them all out it would take many hours perhaps days
not only are these horse ideas bound together with one another but
they are bound more or less directly more or less closely to
everything else in my life i can therefore pass in thought from the
idea horse to any other idea directly or indirectly now in any
given case what idea will actually come first after i have the idea
horse this depends upon the tendencies established in the nervous
system the brain process underlying the idea horse has connections
with many other processes and tends to excite these processes the
factors that strengthen these tendencies or connections are the
frequency recency primacy and vividness of experience let us
consider in some detail each of these factors
primacy of experience a strong factor in determining association is the
first experience the first the original coupling of ideas tends to
persist the first connection is nearly always a strong one and is also
strengthened by frequent repetition in memory our first experience with
people and things persists with great strength across the years in
spite of other associations and connections established later just now
there comes to mind my first experience with a certain famous scientist
it was many years ago i was a student in an eastern university this
man gave a public lecture at the opening of the session i remember many
details of the occurrence with great vividness although i studied under
this man for three years no other experience with him is more prominent
than the first first experiences give rise to such strong connections
between ideas that these connections often persist and hold their own as
against other connections depending upon other factors
the practical consequences of this factor in teaching are of course
evident both teachers and parents should take great care in the matter
of the first experiences of children if the ideaconnections of first
experiences are likely to persist then these connections should be
desirable ones they should not be useless connections nor should they
ordinarily be connections that will have to be radically undone later
usually it is not economical to build up connections between ideas that
will not serve permanently except in cases in which the immaturity of
the mind makes such a procedure necessary
recency of experience the most recent connection of ideas is relatively
strong and is often the determining one but the most recent connection
must be very recent or it has no especial value if i have seen a
certain friend today and his name is brought to mind now todays
experience with him will likely be brought to mind first but if my
last seeing him was some days or months ago the ideaconnection of the
last meeting has no great value of course circumstances always alter
the matter perhaps we should say in the last instance that other
things being equal the last experience has no special value if the
last experience was an unusual one such as a death or a marriage then
it has a value due to its vividness and intensity and its emotional
aspects these factors not only add strength to the connections made at
the time but are the cause of frequent revivals of this last experience
in memory in the succeeding days all these factors taken together often
give a last experience great associative strength even though the last
experience is not recent
frequency of experience the most frequent connection of ideas is
probably the most important factor of all in determining future
associations the first connection is but one and the last connection
is but one while repeated connections may be many in number
connections which recur frequently usually overcome all other
connections hence frequency is the dominant factor in association most
of the strength of first connections is due to repetitions in memory
later the first experience passes through the mind again and again as
memory and thereby becomes strengthened the fact that repetition of
connections establishes these connections is of course the
justification of drill and review in school studies the practical needs
of life demand that certain ideas be associated so that one calls up the
other teachers and parents knowing these desirable connections
endeavor to fix them in the minds of children by repetition the
important facts of history literature civics and science we endeavor
by means of repetition to fasten in the childs mind
vividness and intensity of experience a vivid experience is one that
excites and arouses us strongly stimulating our feelings such
experiences establish strong bonds of connection when i think of a
railroad wreck i think of one in which i participated the experience
was vivid intense and aroused my emotions i hardly knew whether i was
dead or alive then secondly i usually think of a wreck which i
witnessed in childhood a train plunged through a bridge and eighteen
cars were piled up in the ravine the experience was vivid and produced
a deep and lasting impression on me
the practical significance of this factor is of course great when
ideas are presented to pupils these ideas should be made clear every
conceivable device should be used to clarify and explainconcrete
demonstration the use of objects and diagrams pictures and drawings
and abundant oral illustration we must be sure that the one taught
understands that the ideas become focal in consciousness and take hold
of the individual this is the main factor in what is known as
interest an interesting thing is one that takes hold of us and
possesses us so that we cannot get away from it such experiences are
vivid and have rich emotional connections or accompaniments ideas that
are experienced together at such times are strongly connected
mental set or attitude another influence always operative in
determining the association of ideas is mental set by mental set we
mean the mood or attitude one is inwhether one is sad or glad well
or ill fresh or fatigued etc what one has just been thinking about
what one has just been doing are always factors that determine the
direction of association one often notices the effects of mental set in
reading newspapers if ones mind has been deeply occupied with some
subject and one then starts to read a newspaper one may actually
miscall many of the words in the article he is reading the words are
made to fit in with what is in his mind for example if one is all
wrought up over a wedding many words beginning with w and having
about the same length as the word wedding will be read as wedding
mental set may be permanent or temporary by permanent we mean the
strong tendencies that are built up by continued thought in a certain
direction one becomes a methodist a democrat a conservative a
radical a pessimist an optimist etc by continuity of similar
experiences and similar reactions to these experiences germans french
irish italians chinese have characteristic sets or ways of reacting
to typical situations that may be called racial these prejudicial ways
of reacting may be called racial sets or attitudes religious
political and social prejudices may all be called sets or attitudes
temporary sets or attitudes are leanings and prejudices that are due to
temporary states of mind the fact that one has headache or
indigestion or is in a hurry or is angry or is hungry or is
emotionally excited over something will for the time be a factor in
determining the direction of association
one of the tasks of education is to build up sets or attitudes
permanent prejudices to be constant factors in guiding association and
consequently action we wish to build up permanent attitudes toward
truth honesty industry sympathy zeal persistence etc it is
evident that attitude is merely an aspect of habit it is an habitual
way of reacting to a definite and typical situation this habitual way
is strengthened by repetition so that set or attitude finally after
years of repetition becomes a part of our nature our prejudices become
as strong seemingly as our instinctive tendencies after a man has
thought in a particular groove for years it is about as sure that he
will come to certain definite conclusions on matters in the line of his
thought as that he would give typical instinctive or even reflex
reactions we know the direction association will take for a
presbyterian in religious matters for a democrat in political matters
with about as much certainty as we know what their actions will be in
situations that evoke instinctive reactions
thinking and reasoning thinking is the passing of ideas in the mind
this flow of ideas is in accordance with the laws of association above
discussed the order in which the ideas come is the order fixed by
experience the order as determined by the various factors above
enumerated
in early life ones mind is chiefly perceptual it is what we see and
hear and taste and smell as one grows older his mind grows more and
more ideational with increasing age a larger and larger percentage of
our mental life is made up of ideas of memories the child lives in the
present in a world of perceptions a man is not so much tied down to
the present he lives in memory and anticipation he thinks more than
does the child a man is content to sit down in his chair and think for
hours at a time a child is not this thinking is the passing of ideas
now one then another and another these ideas are the survivals or
revivals of our past experience the order of their coming depends on
our past experience
as i sit here and write there surge up out of my past ideas of creeks
and rivers and hills horses and cows and dogs boys and girls men and
women work and play school days friendsan endless chain of ideas
this flow of ideas is often started by a perception for
illustration i see a letter on the table a letter from my brother i
then have a visual image of my brother i think of him as i saw him
last i think of what he said i think of his children of his home of
his boyhood and our early life together then i think of our mother and
the old home and so on and on presently i glance at a history among my
books and immediately think of greece and athens and the acropolis
plato aristotle and socrates schoolmates and teachers and friends
connected in one way or another with my college study of greek
in this description of the process of thinking i have repeatedly used
the words think of i might have said instead there came to mind
ideas of athens ideas of friends etc thinking then is a general
term for our idealife
reasoning is a form of thinking reasoning too is a flow of ideas but
while reasoning is thinking it is a special form of thinking it is
thinking to a purpose in thinking as above described and illustrated
no immediate ends of the person are served while in reasoning some end
is always sought in reasoning the flow of ideas must reach some
particular idea that will serve the need of the moment the need of the
problem at hand reasoning then is controlled thinking thinking
centering about a problem about a situation that one must meet
the statement that reasoning is controlled thinking needs some
explanation for the reader at once is likely to want to know what does
the controlling there is not some special faculty or power that does
the controlling the control is exercised by the set into which one is
thrown by the situation which confronts one the set puts certain
nervetracts into readiness to conduct or in other words makes
certain groups of ideas come into mind and makes one satisfied only if
the right ideas come as long as ideas come that do not satisfy the
flow keeps on taking one direction and then another in accordance with
the way our ideas have become organized an idea finally comes that
satisfies we are then said to have reached a conclusion to have made
up our mind to have solved our problem
but the fact that we are satisfied is no sure sign that the problem is
correctly solved it means only that our past experiences available at
the time through association say that the conclusion is right or in
more scientific terms that the conclusion is in harmony with our past
experience as it has been organized and made available through
association there is not within us a little being a reasoner that
sits and watches ideas file by and passes judgment upon them the real
judge is our nervous system with its organized bonds or connections
an illustration may make the matter clearer a boy walking along in the
woods comes to a stream too wide for him to jump across he wishes to be
on the other side so here is a situation that must be met a problem
that must be solved a flow of ideas is started centering about the
problem the flow is entirely determined and directed by past experience
and the present situation the boy pauses looks about and sees on the
bank a pole and several large stones he has walked on poles and on
fences he therefore sees himself putting the pole across the stream and
walking on it this may be in actual visual imagery or it may be in
words he may merely say i will put the pole across and walk on it
but before having time to do it he may recall walking on poles that
turned he is not then satisfied with the pole idea the perception of
stones may next become clear in his mind and if no inhibiting or
hindering idea comes up the stone idea carries him into action he
piles the stones into the stream and walks across
as was mentioned above the flow of ideas may take different forms the
imagery may take any form but is usually visual auditory motor or
verbal
further discussion of the point that reasoning is determined by past
experience may be necessary suppose the teacher ask the class a number
of different questions moral religious political many different
answers to the questions will be received in some cases as many answers
to the questions as there are pupils ask whether it is ever right to
steal whether it is ever right to lie whether it is ever right to
fight whether it is ever right to disobey a parent or teacher whether
oak is stronger than maple whether iron expands more when heated than
does copper whether one should always feed beggars etc the answers
received in each case depend on the previous experience of the pupils
the more nearly alike the experiences of the pupils the more nearly
alike will be the answers the more divergent the experiences the more
different will be the answers
the basis of reasoning is ultimately the same sort of thing as the basis
of habit we have repeated experiences of the same kind the ideas of
these experiences become welded together in a definite way association
between certain groups of ideas becomes well fixed later situations
involving these groups of ideas set up definite trains of association
we come always to definite conclusions from the same situations
provided that we are in the same mental set and the factors involved are
the same
throughout early life we have definite moral and religious ideas
presented to us we come to think in definite ways about them or with
them it therefore comes about that every day we live we are
determining the way we shall in the future reason about things we are
each day getting the material for the solution of the problems that will
be presented to us by future situations and the reason that one of us
will solve those problems in a different way from another is because of
having somewhat different experiences and of organizing them in a
different way
meaning and the organization of ideas in the preceding paragraphs we
have several times spoken of the organization of ideas let us now see
just what is meant by this expression intimately connected with the
organization of ideas is meaning what is the meaning of an idea the
meaning of an idea is another idea or group of ideas that are very
closely associated with it when there comes to mind an idea that has
arisen out of repeated experience there come almost immediately with it
other ideas perhaps vivid images which have been connected with the
same experience suppose the idea is of a horse if one were asked
what is a horse ideas of a horse in familiar situations would present
themselves one may see in imagination a horse being driven ridden
etc and he would then answer why a horse is to ride or a horse
is to drive or a horse is a domestic animal etc
again what is a cloud what is the sun what is a river what is
justice what is love one says a cloud is that from which rain
falls or a cloud is partially condensed vapor the sun is a round
thing in the sky that shines by day a river is water flowing along in a
low place through the land justice is giving to people what they
deserve love is that feeling one has for a person which makes him be
kind to that person the answer that one gives depends on age and
experience
but it is evident that when a person is asked what a thing is or what is
the meaning of a thing he has at once ideas that have been most closely
associated with the idea in question now since the most important
aspect of a thing is what we can do with it what use it can be to us
usually meaning centers about use a chair is to sit in bread is to
eat water is to drink clothes are to wear a hat is a thing to be worn
on ones head a shovel is to dig with a car is to ride in etc
use is not quite so evident in such cases as the following who was
csar who was homer who is edison what was the inquisition what were
the crusades however one has in these cases very closely associated
ideas and these ideas do center about what we have done with these men
and events in our thinking csar was a warrior homer was a writer of
epics edison is an inventor etc these men and events have been
presented to us in various situations as standing for various things in
the history of the world and when we think of them we at once think of
what they did the place they fill in the world this constitutes their
meaning
it is evident that an idea may have many meanings and the meaning that
may come to us at any particular moment depends upon the situation a
chair for example in one situation may come to mind as a thing to sit
in in another situation as a thing to stand in the corner and look
pretty in another a thing to stand on so that one may reach the top
shelf in the pantry in another a thing to strike a burglar with in
another a thing to knock to pieces to be used to make a fire
the meaning of a thing comes from our experience with it and the thing
usually comes to have more and more meanings as our experience with it
increases when we meet something new it may have practically no
meaning suppose we find a new plant in the woods it has little
meaning we may be able to say only that it is a plant or it is a small
plant we touch it and it pricks us and it at once has more meaning it
is a plant that pricks we bite into it and find it bitter it is then a
plant that is bitter etc in such a way objects come to have meaning
they acquire meaning according to the connections in which we experience
them and they may take on different meanings for different persons
because of the different experiences of these persons the chief
interest we have in objects is in what use we can make of them how we
can make them serve our purposes how we can make them contribute to our
pleasure
the organization of experience is the connecting through the process of
association of the ideas that arise out of our experience our ideas
are organized not only in accordance with the way we experience them in
the first place but in accordance with the way we think them later in
memory of course ideas are recalled in accordance with the way we
experience them but since they are experienced in such a multitude of
connections they are recalled later in these various connections and it
is possible in recall to repeat one connection to the exclusion of
others
organization can therefore be a selective process although horse is
experienced in a great variety of situations or connections for our
purposes we can select some one or more of these connections and by
repetition in recalling it strengthen these connections to the
exclusion of others herein lies one of the greatest possibilities in
thinking and reasoning which enables us to an extent to be
independent of original experience we must have had experience of
course but the strength of bonds between ideas need not depend upon
original experience but rather upon the way in which these ideas are
recalled later and especially upon the number of times they are
recalled
it is in the matter of the organization of experience that teachers and
parents can be of great help to young people children do not know what
connections of ideas will be most useful in the future people who have
had more experience know better and can by direction and suggestion
lead the young to form and strengthen by repetition those connections
of ideas that will be most useful later
in the various school studies a mass of ideas is presented these
ideas isolated or with random connections will be of little service to
the pupils they must be organized with reference to future use this
organization must come about through thinking over these ideas in
helpful connections the teacher knows best what these helpful
connections are and must help the pupil to make them
suppose the topic studied in history is the battle of bunker hill the
teacher should assist the child to think the battle over in many
different connections there are various geographical historical and
literary aspects of the battle that are of importance these aspects
should be brought to mind and related by being thought of together
thinking things together binds them together as ideas and later when
one idea comes the others that have been joined with it in the past in
thought come also therefore in studying the battle of bunker hill
the pupil not only reads about it but gets a map and studies the
geography of it works out the causes that led up to the battle studies
the consequences that followed reads speeches and poems that have been
made and written since concerning the battle the monument etc
similarly all the topics studied in school should be thought over and
organized with reference to meaning and with reference to future use as
a result of such procedure all the topics become organized and
crystallized with all related ideas closely bound together in
association
one of the greatest differences in people is in the organization of
their ideas of course people differ in original experience but they
differ more in the way they organize this experience and prepare it for
future needs just as in habitformation we should by exercise and
practice acquire those kinds of skill that will serve us best in the
future so in getting knowledge we should by repetition strengthen the
connections between those ideas that we shall need to have connected in
the future all education looks forward and is preparatory as a result
of training in the organization of ideas a pupil can learn how to
organize his experience in a measure independent of the teacher he
learns to know himself what ideas are significant and what
connections of ideas will be most helpful such an outcome should be one
of the ends of school training
training in reasoning we have already mentioned ways in which a child
can be helped in gaining power and facility in reasoning in this
paragraph we shall discuss the matter more fully there are three
aspects of training in reasoning one with reference to original
experience one with reference to the organization of this experience as
just discussed and one with reference to certain habits of procedure in
the recall and use of experience
1 original experience before reasoning in any field one must have
experience in that field there is no substitute for experience after
having the experience it can be organized in various ways but
experience there must be experience may be primary with things
themselves or it may be secondary received second hand through books
or through spoken language we cannot think without ideas and ideas
come only through perceptions of one kind or another
originally all experience arises out of sensations language makes it
possible for us to profit through the perceptual experience of others
but even when we receive our experience second hand our own primary
experience must enable us to understand the meaning of what we read and
hear about else it is valueless to us therefore if we wish to be able
to reason in the field of physics of botany of chemistry of medicine
of law or of agriculture we must get experience in those fields the
raw material of thought comes only through experience in such a subject
as physical geography for example the words of the book have little
meaning unless the child has had original experience in the matter
discussed he must have seen hills and valleys and rivers and lakes and
rocks and weathering and all the various processes discussed in
physical geography otherwise the reading of the text is almost
valueless the same thing is true of all subjects to reason in any
subject we must have had original experience in it
2 the organization of experience after experience comes its
organization this point has already been fully explained it was
pointed out that organization consists in thinking our experience over
again in helpful relations here parents and teachers can be of very
great service to children
3 habits of thought there are certain habits of procedure in
reasoning apart from the association of the ideas one can form the
habit of putting certain questions to oneself when a problem is
presented so that certain types of relations are called up if one is a
scientist one looks for causes if one is a lawyer one looks up the
court decisions if one is a physician one looks for symptoms etc
one of the most important habits in connection with reasoning is the
habit of caution reasoning is waiting waiting for ideas to come that
will be adequate for the situation one must form the habit of waiting a
reasonable length of time for associations to run their course if one
act too soon before his organized experience has had time to pass in
review he may act improperly therefore one must be trained to a proper
degree of caution of course caution may be overdone one must act
sometime one cannot wait always
another habit is that of testing out a conclusion before it is finally
put into practice it is often possible to put a conclusion to some sort
of test before it is put to the real test just as one makes a model and
tries out an invention on a small scale one should not have full
confidence in a conclusion that is the result of reasoning till the
conclusion has been put to the final test of experiment of trial
this last statement leads us to the real function of reasoning reason
points the way to action in a new situation after the situation is
repeated for a sufficient number of times action passes into the realm
of habit
language and thinking the fact that man has spoken and written language
is of the greatest significance it has already been pointed out that
language is a means through which we can get experience secondhand this
proves to be a great advantage to man but language gives us still
another advantage without language thinking is limited to the passing
of sensory images that arise in accordance with the laws of association
but man can name things and the attributes of things and these names
become associated so that thinking comes to be in part at least a
matter of words thinking is talking to oneself one cannot talk without
language
the importance that attaches to language can hardly be overestimated
when the child acquires the use of language he has acquired the use of
a tool the importance of which to thinking is greater than that of any
other tool now one can think without language in the sense that
memory images come and gowe have defined thinking as the flow of
imagery the passing or succession of ideas but after we have named
things thinking particularly reasoning becomes largely verbal or as
we said above talking to oneself
not only do we give names to concrete things but we give names to
specific attributes and to relations as we organize and analyze our
experiences there appear uniformities principles laws to these we
give names such as white black red weight length thickness
justice truth sin crime heat cold mortal immortal evolution
disintegration love hate envy jealousy possible impossible
probable etc we spoke above of meanings to meanings we give names so
that a single word comes to stand for meanings broad and significant
the result of much experience such words as evolution and
gravitation single words though they are represent a wide range of
experiences and bring these experiences together and crystallize them
into a single expression which we use as a unit in our thought
language therefore makes thought easier and its accomplishment
greater after we have studied csar for some years the name comes to
represent the epitome the birdseye view of a great man a similar
thing is true of our study of other men and movements and things single
words come to represent a multitude of experiences then these words
become associated and organized in accordance with the principles of
association discussed above so that it comes about that the older we
are the more we come to think in words and the more these words
represent the older we are the more abstract our thinking becomes the
more do our words come to stand for meanings and attributes and laws
that have come out of the organization of our experience
it is evident that the accuracy of our thinking depends upon these words
standing for the truth depends upon whether we have organized our
experience in accordance with facts if our word csar does not stand
for the real csar then all our thinking in which csar enters will be
incorrect if our word justice does not stand for the real justice
then all our thinking in which justice enters will be incorrect
this discussion points to the tremendous importance of the organization
of experience truth is the agreement of our thought with the thing
with reality we must therefore help the young to see the world clearly
and to organize what they see in accordance with the facts and with a
view to future use then the units of this organized experience are to
be tagged labeled by means of words and these words or labels become
the vehicles of thought and the outcome of the thinking depends on the
validity of the organization of our experience
  summary thinking is the passing of ideas in the mind its basis is
  in the association of memory ideas the basis of association is in
  original experience ideas becoming bound together in memory as
  originally experienced the factors of association are primacy
  recency frequency intensity and mental set or attitude reasoning
  is thinking to a purpose we can be trained in reasoning by being
  taught to get vivid experience in the first place and in organizing
  this experience in helpful ways having in mind future use
class exercises
1 a series of experiments should be performed to make clear to the
students that the basis of the association of ideas is in experience
and not in the nature of the ideas themselves
a let the students starting with the same word write down all the
ideas that come to mind in one minute the teacher should give the
initial idea as sky hate music clock table or wind the first ten
ideas coming to each student might be written on the blackboard for
study and comparison are any series alike is the tenth idea in one
series the same as that in any other
b for a study of the various factors of association perform the
following experiment let the teacher prepare a list of fifty
wordsnouns and adjectives such as wood murder goodness bad death
water love angel read the words to the class and let each student
write down the first idea that comes to mind in each case after the
list is finished let each student try to find out what the determining
factor was in each case whether primacy frequency recency vividness
or mental set when the study is completed the students paper should
contain three columns the first column showing the stimulus words the
second showing the response words the third showing the determining
factors the first column should be dictated and copied after the
response words have been written
c study the data in a and b noting the variety of ideas
that come to different students for the same stimulus word it will be
seen that they come from a great variety of experiences and from all
parts of ones life from childhood to the present showing that all our
experiences are bound together and that we can go from one point to any
other directly or indirectly
2 perform an experiment to determine how each member of the class
thinks ie in what kind of imagery let each plan a picnic in
detail how do they do it do they see it or hear it or seem to act it
or does it happen in words merely
3 think of the events of yesterday how do they come to you do your
images seem to be visual auditory motor or verbal do you seem to
have all kinds of imagery is one kind predominant
4 test the class for speed of free association as described on
page 193 repeat the experiment at least five times and rank the members
of the class from the results
5 similarly test speed for controlled association as described on
page 195 and rank the members of the class
6 compare the rankings in nos 4 and 5
7 the teacher can extend the controlled association tests by preparing
lists that show different kinds of logical relations with one another
from genus to species from species to genus from verb to object from
subject to verb etc do the students maintain the same rank in the
various types of experiments do the ranks in these tests correspond to
the students ranks in thinking in the school subjects
8 at least two series of experiments in reasoning should be performed
one to show the nature of reasoning and the other to show the ability of
the members of the class
a put several problems to the class similar to the following what
happens to a wet board laid out in the sunshine explain suppose corn
is placed in three vessels 1 2 and 3 number 1 is sealed up air tight
and kept warm number 2 is kept open and warm number 3 is kept open and
warm and moist what happens in each case explain
condensed milk does not sour as long as the can remains unopened after
the can is opened the milk sours if allowed to become warm it does not
sour if kept frozen why two bars of metal are riveted together one
bar is lead the other iron what happens when the bars are heated to
150 c 500 c 1000 c 2000 c answer the following questions is it ever
right to steal to kill a person to lie which are unwise and mistaken
republicans or democrats
in the above do all come to the same conclusion why were any unable
to come to a conclusion at all on some questions why do the
experiments make it clear that reasoning is dependent upon experience
b let the teacher prepare five problems in reasoning well within the
experience of the class and find the speed and accuracy of the students
in solving them compare the results with those in the controlled
association tests test the class with various kinds of mechanical
puzzles
9 the students should study several people to ascertain how well those
people have their experience organized is their experience available
can they come to the point immediately or are they hazy uncertain
and impractical
10 it is claimed that we have two types of people theoretical and
practical this is to some extent true what is the explanation
11 from the point of view of no 10 compare teachers and engineers
12 if anything will work in theory will it work in practice
13 from what you have learned in the chapter and from the experiments
write a paper on training in reasoning
14 what are the main defects of the schools with reference to training
children to think
15 make a complete outline of the chapter

individual differences
physical differences one never sees two people whose bodies are exactly
alike they differ in height or weight or color of the skin they differ
in the color of the hair or eyes in the shape of the head or in such
details as size and shape of the ear size and shape of the nose chin
mouth teeth feet hands fingers toes nails etc the anatomist
tells us that we differ internally just as we do externally while the
internal structure of one person has the same general plan as that of
another there being the same number of bones muscles organs etc
there are always differences in detail we are built on the same plan
ie we are made after a common type we vary above and below this
type or central tendency
weight may be taken for illustration if we should weigh the first
thousand men we meet we should find light men heavy men and men of
medium weight there would be few light men few heavy men but many men
of medium weight this fact is well shown in diagram by what is known as
a curve of distribution or frequency surface which is constructed as
follows draw a base line a b and on this line mark off equal distances
to represent the various weights at the left end put the number
representing the lightest men and at the right the number representing
the heaviest men the other weights come in between in order then
select a scale we will say a millimeter in height above the base line
represents one person of the weight represented on the base and in
drawing the upper part of the figure a c b we have but to measure up
one millimeter for each person weighed of the weight indicated below on
the base
illustration figure vfrequency surfaceweight
the solid line represents men the broken line women
a study of this frequency surface shows a tendency for people to be
grouped about the central tendency or average there are many people of
average weight or nearly so but few people who deviate widely from the
average weight if we measure people with reference to any other
physical characteristic or any mental characteristic we get a similar
result we find them grouped about an average or central tendency
mental differences just as we differ physically so also we differ
mentally and in the various aspects of our behavior the accompanying
diagram free association shows the distribution of a large number of
men and women with respect to the speed of their flow of ideas when men
and women are measured with respect to any mental function a similar
distribution is found
illustration figure vifrequency surfacefree association
solid line men broken line women the numbers below the base
represent the number of words written in the free association test and
the numbers at the left represent the number of people making the
respective scores
an interesting question is whether our mental differences have any
relation or connection with one another if one mental characteristic is
of high order are all the others of high order also does a good memory
indicate a high order of attention of association of imagination of
learning capacity experiments show that mental characteristics have at
least some degree of independence but the rule is that they generally
go together a high order of ability in one mental function indicating a
high order of ability in at least some others and a low order of
ability in one function indicating a low order in other functions
however it seems that abilities that are very much specialized such as
musical ability artistic ability etc may exist in high order while
other mental functions may be only mediocre it is a common thing for a
musical person to be of rather poor ability otherwise to the extent
that special abilities require specialized differences in the structure
of brain nervous system or sense organ they can exist in some degree
of independence of other functions musical ability to some extent does
require some such differences and may therefore be found either with a
high or a low degree of ability in other characteristics
it is doubtless true that at maturity the unequal power of mental
functions in the same person may be partly due to the fact that one
function has been exercised and others neglected a person having very
strong musical tendencies is likely to have such a great interest in
music that he will think other activities are not worth while and will
consequently neglect these other activities it will therefore turn out
that at maturity the great differences in mental functions in such a
person are in part due to exercise of one function and neglect of
others but there can be no doubt that in many cases there are large
original inherited differences the individual being poor in one aspect
of mind and good in others feebleminded people are usually poor in all
important aspects of mind however one sometimes finds a feebleminded
person having musical or artistic ability and often such a person has a
good rote memory sometimes a good verbal memory however the socalled
higher mental functionslogical memory controlled association and
constructive imaginationare all poor in a feebleminded person
each mental function may be looked upon as in some measure independent
each is found existing in people in varying degrees from zero ability up
to what might be called genius ability the frequency curves in fig vi
show this take rote memory for example idiots are found with
practically zero ability in rote memory at the other extreme we find
mathematical prodigies who after watching a long freight train pass and
noting the numbers of the cars can repeat correctly the number of each
car rote memory abilities can be found representing every step between
these two extremes this principle of distribution holds true in the
case of all mental functions we find persons practically without them
and others possessing them in the highest order but most people are
grouped about the average ability
detecting mental differences it has already been said that mind has
many different aspects and that people differ with respect to these
aspects now let us ask how we can measure the degree of development of
these aspects or functions of mind we measure them just as we measured
muscular speed as described in the first chapter each mental function
means ability to do somethingto learn to remember to form images
to reason etc to measure these different capacities or functions we
have but to require that the person under consideration do something
as learn remember etc and measure how well and how fast he does it
just as we would measure how far he can jump how fast he can run etc
in such measurements the question of practice is always involved if we
measure running ability we find that some are in practice while others
are not those in practice can run at very nearly their ultimate
capacity those who are not in practice can be trained to run much
faster than they do to get a true measure of running capacity we
should practice the persons to be measured till each runs up to the
limit of his capacity and then measure each ones speed the same thing
is true to some extent when we come to measure mental functions
proper however the life that children live gives exercise to all
fundamental functions of the mind and unless some of the children
tested have had experience which would tend to develop some mental
functions in a special way tests of the various aspects of learning
capacity memory association imagination etc are a fairly good
measure of original inherited tendencies
of course it must be admitted that there are measurable differences in
the influence of environment on children and when these differences are
extreme no doubt the influence is shown in the development of the
childs mind a child reared in a home where all the influences favor
its mental development ought to show a measurable difference in such
development when compared with a child reared in a home where all the
influences are unfavorable it is difficult to know to what extent this
is true for the hereditary and environmental influences are usually in
harmony the child of good hereditary stock having good environmental
influences and vice versa when this is not the case ie when a
child of good stock is reared under poor environmental influences or
when a child of poor stock is reared under good influences the results
seem to show that the differences in environment have little effect on
mental development as far as the fundamental functions are concerned
except in the most extreme cases
each mental function is capable of some development it can be brought
up to the limit of its possibilities but recent experiments indicate
that such development is not very great in the case of the elementary
fundamental functions training however has a much greater effect on
complex mental activities that involve several functions rote memory is
rather simple it cannot be much affected by training the memory for
ideas is more complex it can be considerably affected by training the
original and fundamental functions of the mind depend upon the nature of
the nervous system which is bequeathed to us by heredity this cannot be
much changed however training has considerable effect on the
cordinations and combinations of mental functions therefore the more
complex the mental activities which we are testing the more likely they
are to have been affected by differences in experience and training
if we should designate the logical memory capacity of one person by 10
and that of another by 15 by practice we might bring the first up to 15
and the second to 22 but we could not equalize them we could never
make the memory of the one equal to that of the other in an extreme
case we might find one child whose experience had been such that his
logical memory was working up to the limit of its capacity while the
other had had little practice in logical memory and was therefore far
below his real capacity in such a case a test would not show the
native difference it would show only the present difference in
functioning capacity
fairly adequate tests for the most important mental functions have been
worked out a series of group tests with directions and norms follow
the members of the class can use these tests in studying the individual
differences in other people the teacher will find other tests in the
authors examination of school children and in whipples manual of
mental and physical tests
mental tests
general directions
the results of the mental tests in the school will be worse than useless
unless the tests are given with the greatest care and scientific
precision every test should be most carefully explained to the children
so that they will know exactly what they are to do the matter must be
so presented to them that they will put forth all possible effort
they must take the tests seriously great care must be taken to see that
there is no cheating the work of each child should be his own work in
those tests in which time is an important element the time must be
carefully kept with a stop watch if one is available the papers
should be distributed for the tests and turned face downward on the
pupils desk the pupil when all are ready to begin should take the
paper in his hand and at the signal begin turn it over and begin work
and when the signal stop is given should quit work instantly and turn
the paper over before the work begins the necessary information should
be placed on each paper this information should be the pupils name
age grade sex and school this should be on every paper when the
test is over the papers should be immediately collected
logical memory
object the purpose of this test is to determine the pupils facility in
remembering and reproducing ideas a pupils standing in the test may
serve as an indication of his ability to remember the subject matter of
the school studies
illustration figure viilogical memory willie jones
method the procedure in this test is for the teacher to read slowly and
distinctly the story to be reproduced immediately after the reading the
pupils are to write down all of the story that they can recall they
must not begin to write till after the reading ten minutes should be
allowed for the reproduction this is ample time and each pupil should
be told to use the whole time in working on his reproduction at the end
of ten minutes collect the papers care should be taken to see that
each pupil does his own work that there is no copying before reading
the story the teacher should give the following instructions
  i shall read to you a story entitled willie jones and his dog or
  a farmers son or a costly temper as the case may be after i
  have read the story you are to write down all you can remember of
  it you are not to use the exact words that i read unless you wish
  you are to use your own words try to recall as much as possible and
  write all you recall try to get all the details not merely the
  main facts
material for grades three four and five use willie jones and his
dog for grades six seven and eight use a farmers son for the
high school use a costly temper the norms for the latter are based
on eighth grade and high school pupils
                                   
willie jones and his dog
willie  jones  was a little  boy  only  five years old  he had a
dog  whose name was buster  buster was a large  dog  with long 
black  curly  hair  his fore  feet  and the tip  of his tail 
were white  one day  willies mother  sent him  to the store 
which was only  a short  distance away  buster went with him 
following behind  as buster was turning  at the corner  a car 
struck him  and broke  one  hind  leg  and hurt  one  eye 
willie was  very  sorry  and cried  a long  time  willies
father  came  and carried  the poor  dog  home  the broken leg 
got well  in five  weeks  but the eye  that was hurt  became blind
a farmers son
will  was a farmers  son  who attended school  in town  his
clothes  were poor and his boots  often smelled  of the farmyard 
although he took great  care of them  since will had not gone to
school  as much  as his classmates  he was often  at a
disadvantage  although his mind  was as good  as theirs in fact
he was brighter  than most  of them  james  the wit  of the
class  never lost an opportunity  to ridicule  wills mistakes 
his bright  red  hair  and his patched  clothes  will  took the
ridicule  in good part  and never  lost his temper  one saturday 
as will  was driving  his cows  to pasture  he met james  teasing
 a young  child  a cripple  wills  indignation  was aroused 
by the sight  he asked  the bully  to stop  but when he would not
 will pounced  upon him  and gave him  a good  beating  and he
would not  let james go  until he promised  not to tease  the
crippled  child  again 
a costly temper
a man  named john  murdock  had a servant  who worried him  much by
his stupidity  one day  when this servant was more  stupid  than
usual  the angry  master  of the house  threw a book  at his head
 the servant  ducked  and the book flew  out of the window 
now go  and pick that book up  ordered the master  the servant 
started  to obey  but a passerby  had saved him  the trouble  and
had walked off  with the book  the scientist  thereupon  began to
wonder  what book  he had thrown away  and to his horror 
discovered  that it was a quaint  and rare  little  volume  of
poems  which he had purchased  in london  for fifty  dollars 
but his troubles  were not over  the weeks went by  and the man had
almost  forgotten his loss  when strolling  into a secondhand 
bookshop  he saw  to his great delight  a copy of the book  he
had lost  he asked the price 
well  said the dealer  reflectively  i guess we can let you
have it  for forty  dollars  it is a very  rare book  and i am
sure  that i could get seventyfive  dollars for it  by holding on a
while 
the man of science  pulled out his purse  and produced the money 
delighted at the opportunity of replacing  his lost  treasure  when
he reached home  a card  dropped out  of the leaves  the card was
his own  and further  examination  showed that he had bought back 
his own property 
forty dollars  worth of temper  exclaimed the man  i think i
shall mend my ways  his disposition  afterward  became so  good 
that  the servant became worried  thinking the man  must be ill 
                                   
illustration figure viiilogical memorya farmers son
the results the material for the test is divided into units as
indicated by the vertical lines the pupils written reproduction should
be compared unit by unit with the story as printed and given one credit
for each unit adequately reproduced the norms for the three tests are
shown in the accompanying figures vii viii and ix in these and all
the graphs which follow the actual ages are shown in the first
horizontal column the norms for girls appear in the second horizontal
column the norms for boys in the column at the bottom by the norm
for an age is meant the average performance of all the pupils of that
age examined age ten applies to those pupils who have passed their
tenth birthday and have not reached their eleventh birthday and the
other ages are to be similarly interpreted the vertical lines in the
graphs indicate birthdays and the scores written on these lines indicate
ability at these exact ages the column marked ten for example
includes all the children that are over ten and not yet eleven the
graphs show the development from age to age in general it will be
noticed there is an improvement of memory with age but in the high
school in the costly temper test there is a decline this may not
indicate a real decline in ability to remember ideas but a change in
attitude the high school pupil probably acquires a habit of
remembering only significant facts his memory is selective while in
the earlier ages the memory may be more parrotlike one idea being
reproduced with about as much fidelity as another this statement is
made not as a fact but as a probable explanation
rote memory
illustration figure ixlogical memorya costly temper
object the object of the rote memory tests is to determine the pupils
memory span for unrelated impressionswords that have no logical
relations with one another much school work makes demands upon this
ability therefore the tests are of importance
method there are two lists of words concrete and abstract with
six groups in each list the list of concrete words should be given
first then the abstract the procedure is to pronounce the first group
cat tree coat and then pause for the pupils to write these
three words then pronounce the next group mule bird cart
glass and pause for the reproduction and so on through the list
illustration figure xconcrete rote memory
give the following instructions
  we wish to see how well you can remember words i shall pronounce
  first a group of three words after i have pronounced them you
  are to write them down i shall then pronounce a group of four
  words then one of five words and so continue with a longer group
  each time you must pay very close attention for i shall pronounce
  a group but once you are not required to write the words in their
  order but just as you recall them
material the words for the test are given in the following lists
  concrete                           abstract
  1 cat tree coat                   1 good black fast
  2 mule bird cart glass           2 clean tall round hot
  3 star horse dress fence man    3 long wet fierce white cold
  4 fish sun head door shoe      4 deep soft quick dark great
       block                                dead
  5 train mill box desk oil      5 sad strong hard bright
       pup bill                            fine glad plain
  6 floor car pipe bridge hand   6 sharp late sour wide rough
       dirt cow crank                     thick red tight
illustration figure xiabstract rote memory
results the papers are graded by determining the number of concrete
words and the number of abstract words that are reproduced no account
is taken of whether the words are in the right position or not a
perfect score in each test would therefore be thirtythree the norms
are shown in figures x and xi
the substitution test
object this test determines ones ability to build up new associations
it is a test of quickness of learning
method the substitution testsheets are distributed to the pupils and
turned face down on the desks the teacher gives the following
instructions
  we wish to see how fast you can learn at the top of the sheet which
  has been distributed to you there is a key in nine circles are
  written the nine digits and for each digit there is written a letter
  which is to be used instead of the digit below the key are two
  columns of numbers each number contains five digits in the five
  squares which follow the number you are to write the letters which
  correspond to the digits work as fast as you can and fill as many
  of the squares as you can without making mistakes when i say
  stop quit work instantly and turn the paper over
before beginning the test the teacher should explain on the blackboard
the exact nature of the test this can be done by using other letters
instead of those used in the key make sure that the pupils understand
what they are to do allow eight minutes in grades three four and
five and five minutes above the fifth grade
material for material use the substitution testsheets this and the
other test material can be obtained from the university of missouri
extension division
results in grading the work count each square correctly filled in as
one point and reduce the score to speed per minute by dividing by eight
in grades three four and five and by five in the grades above
the norms are shown in figure xii
illustration figure xiisubstitution test
free association
object this test determines the speed of the free flow of ideas the
result of the test is a criterion of the quickness of the flow of ideas
when no restriction or limitation is put on this flow
method the procedure in this test is to give the pupils a word and
tell them to write this word down and all the other words that come into
their minds make it clear to them that they are to write whatever word
comes to mind whether it has any relation to the word that is given
them or not start them with the word cloud give the following
instructions
  i wish to see how many words you can think of and write down in
  three minutes i shall name a word you may write it down and then
  all the other words that come into your minds do not write
  sentences merely the words that come into your minds work as fast
  as you can
illustration figure xiiifree association test
results score the work by counting the number of words that have been
written the norms are shown in figure xiii
opposites
object this is a test of controlled association it tests one aspect of
the association of ideas all thinking is a matter of association of
ideas reasoning is controlled association the test may therefore be
taken as a measure of speed in reasoning
illustration figure xivopposites testlists i and ii
method distribute the lists of opposites to the pupils and turn them
face down on the desks use list one in grades three four and five
and list two in grades above allow two minutes in grades three four
and five and one minute in grades above give the following
instructions
  on the sheets that have been distributed to you are fifty words
  after each word you are to write a word that has the opposite
  meaning for example if one word were far you could write
  near work as fast as you can and when i say stop quit work
  instantly and turn your paper over
results the score is the number of opposites correctly written the
norms are shown in figure xiv

the wordbuilding test
object this is a test of a certain type of inventiveness namely
linguistic invention specifically it tests the pupils ability to
construct words using certain prescribed letters
illustration figure xvwordbuilding test
method the pupils are given the letters a e o m n r
and told to make as many words as possible using only these letters
give the following instructions
  i wish to see how many words you can make in five minutes using
  only the letters which i give you the words must be real english
  words you must use only the letters which i give you and must not
  use the same letter more than once in the same word you do not of
  course have to use all the letters in the same word a word may
  contain one or more letters up to six
material the pupils need only sheets of blank paper
results the score is the number of words that do not violate the rules
of the test as given in the instructions the norms are shown in figure xv
the completion test
object this is to some extent a test of reasoning capacity of
course it is only one particular aspect of reasoning the pupil is
given a story that has certain words omitted he must read the story
see what it is trying to say and determine what words put into the
blanks will make the correct sense the meaning of the word written in
a particular blank must not only make the sentence read sensibly but
must fit into the story as a whole filling in the blanks in this way
demands considerable thought
method distribute the testsheets and turn them face down on the desks
allow ten minutes in all the tests give the following instructions
  on the sheets which have been distributed is printed a story which
  has certain words omitted you are to put in the blanks the words
  that are omitted the words which you write in must give the proper
  meaning so that the story reads correctly each word filled in must
  not only give the proper meaning to the sentence but to the story as
  a whole
material use the completion testsheets joe and the fourth of july
for grades three four and five the trout for grades six seven
and eight and dr goldsmiths medicine for the high school
results in scoring the papers allow one credit for each blank
correctly filled the norms are shown in figures xvi xvii and xviii
it will be noticed that the boys excel in the trout story this is
doubtless because the story is better suited to them on the ground of
their experience and interest

joe ran6 errands for his mother and took care of the baby
until by the fourth of july his penny grew to be a dime the day
before the fourth he went down town all by himself to get his fire
works there were so many kinds he hardly knew which to buy the
clerk knew that it takes a long time to decide for he had been a
boy himself not very long ago so he helped joe to select the very
best kinds when are you going to fire them off asked the clerk i
will fire them very early tomorrow said the boy so that night
joe set the alarm clock and the next morning got up early to fire
his firecrackers

the trout
the trout is a fine fish once a big trout lived in a pool close by
a spring he used to stay under the bank with only his head showing
his wideopen eyes shone like jewels i tried to catch him i would
creep up to the edge of the pool where i could see his bright
eyes looking up
i caught a grasshopper and threw it over to him then there was a
splash in the water and the grasshopper was gone i did this two
or three times each time i saw the rush and splash and saw the bait
had been taken
so i put the same bait on my hook and threw it over into the
water but all was silent the fish was an old one and had grown
very wise i did this day after day with the same luck the trout
knew there was a hook hidden in the bait

doctor goldsmiths medicine
this is a story of good medicine most medicine is bad to take
but this was so good that the sick man wished for more
one day a poor woman went to doctor goldsmith and asked him to
go to see her sick husband he is very sick she said and i
can not get him to eat anything
so doctor goldsmith went to see him the doctor saw at once that
the reason why the man could not eat was because he was so poor
that he had not been able to buy good food
then he said to the woman come to my house this evening and i will
give you some medicine for your husband
the woman went in the evening and the doctor gave her a small
paper box tied up tight it is very heavy she said may i
see what it looks like no said the doctor wait until you
get home when she got home and she and her husband opened the
box so that he could take the first dose of medicinewhat do you
think they saw the box was filled with silver money this was
the good doctors medicine
                                   
importance of mental differences 1 in school work one of the
important results that come from a knowledge of the mental differences
in children is that we are able to classify them better when a child
enters school he should be allowed to proceed through the course as fast
as his development warrants some children can do an eightyear course
in six years others require ten years still others can never do it
the great majority of course can do it in eight years

illustration figure xixfrequency surfacescomparing fourth grade
with high school
the numbers along the base represent mental age those at the left the
number of pupils of the respective ages
it may be thought that a childs success in school branches is a
sufficient measure of his ability and that no special mental
measurements are needed this is a mistake many factors contribute to
success in school work ability is only one of these factors and should
be specially and independently determined by suitable tests children
may fail in school branches because of being poorly started or started
at the wrong time because of poor teaching sickness moving from one
school to another etc on the other hand children of poor ability may
succeed at school because of much help at home therefore special mental
tests will help in determining to what extent original mental ability
is a factor in the success or failure of the different pupils
as far as possible the children of the same grade should have about the
same ability but such is seldom the case in a recent psychological
study of a school system the author found wide differences in ability
in the same grade the distribution of abilities found in the fourth
grade and in the high school are shown in figure xix it will be seen
that in the fourth grade pupils are found with ability equal to that of
some in the high school of course to some extent such a condition is
unavoidable for a pupil must establish certain habits and acquire
certain knowledge before passing from one grade to another however
much of the wide variation in ability now found in the same grade of a
school could be avoided if the teacher had accurate knowledge of the
pupils abilities when a teacher learns that a child who is doing
poorly in school really has ability she is often able to get from that
pupil the work of which he is capable it has been demonstrated by
experience that accurate measures of childrens abilities are a great
help in gradation and classification
a knowledge of mental differences is also an aid in the actual teaching
of the children the instance mentioned at the close of the last
paragraph is an example a knowledge of the differences among the mental
functions of the same pupil is especially helpful it has been pointed
out that the different mental functions in the same pupil are sometimes
unequally developed sometimes considerable differences exist in the
same pupil with respect to learning capacity the different aspects of
memory association imagination and attention when a teacher knows of
these differences she can better direct the work of the pupils
for example if a pupil have a very poor memory the teacher can help
him by aiding him to secure the advantage that comes from close and
concentrated attention frequent repetitions logical organization etc
on the other hand she can help the brilliant student by preventing him
from being satisfied with hastily secured superficial knowledge and by
encouraging him to make proper use of his unusual powers in going deeper
and more extensively into the school subjects than is possible for the
ordinary student in many ways a teacher can be helpful to her pupils if
she has an accurate knowledge of their mental abilities
2 in life occupations extreme variations in ability should
certainly be considered in choosing ones life work only persons of the
highest ability should go into science law medicine or teaching many
occupations demand special kinds of ability special types of reaction
of attention imagination etc for example the operation of a
telephone exchange demands a person of quick and steady reaction the
work of a motorman on a street car demands a person having the broad
type of attention the type of attention that enables one to keep in
mind many details at the same time scientific work demands the type of
concentrated attention as far as it is possible occupations demanding
special types of ability should be filled by people possessing these
abilities it is best for all concerned if each person is doing what he
can do best it is true that many occupations do not call for special
types of ability and therefore as far as ability is concerned a
person could do as well in one of these occupations as in another the
time will sometime come when we shall know the special abilities
demanded by the different occupations and professions and by suitable
tests shall be able to determine what people possess the required
qualifications
the schools should always be on the lookout for unusual ability
children that are far superior to others of the same age should be
allowed to advance as fast as their superior ability makes possible and
should be held up to a high order of work such superior people should
be as far as possible in the same classes so that they can the more
easily be given the kind and amount of work that they need the schools
should find the children of unusual special ability such as ability in
drawing painting singing playing musical instruments mechanical
invention etc some provision should be made for the proper development
and training of these unusual abilities society cannot afford to lose
any spark of genius wherever found moreover the individual will be
happier if developed and trained along the line of his special ability
subnormal children a small percentage of children are of such low
mentality that they cannot do the ordinary school work as soon as such
children can be picked out with certainty they should be taken out of
the regular classes and put into special classes it is a mistake to try
to get them to do the regular school work they cannot do it and they
only waste the teachers time and usually give her much trouble
besides they waste their own time for while they cannot do the
ordinary school work they can do other things perhaps work of a manual
nature the education of such people should therefore be in the
direction of simple manual occupations
for detecting such children in addition to the tests given above
elaborate tests for individual examination have been devised the most
widely used is a series known as the binetsimon tests a special group
of tests is provided for the children of each age if a child can pass
the tests for his age he is considered normal if he can pass only the
tests three years or more below his age he is usually considered
subnormal but a childs fate should not depend solely upon any number
or any kind of tests we should always give the child a trial and see
what he is able to achieve this trial should cover as many months or
years as are necessary to determine beyond doubt the childs mental
status
  summary just as we differ in the various aspects of body so also
  we differ in the various aspects of mind these differences can be
  measured by tests a knowledge of these differences should aid us in
  grading classifying and teaching children as well as in the
  selection of occupation and professions for them mental traits have
  some degree of independence as a result a high degree of one trait
  may be found with low degree of some others
class exercises
1 many of the tests and experiments already described should have shown
many of the individual differences of the members of the class the
teacher will find in the authors examination of school children a
series of group tests with norms which can be used for a further study
of individual differences
2 the tapping experiment described in the first chapter can now be
repeated and the results taken as a measure of reaction time
3 you should now have available the records of all the tests and
experiments so far given that show individual differences make out a
table showing the rank of each student in the various tests compute the
average rank of each student for all the tests this average rank may be
taken as a measure of the intelligence of the students as far as such
can be determined by the tests used correlate this ranking with
standing in the high school classes it will give a positive
correlation not perfect however why not if your measures of
intelligence were absolutely correct you still would not get a perfect
correlation with high school standing why not
4 if you had a correct measure of intelligence of 100 mature people in
your city selected at random would this measure give you an exact
measure of their success in life give the reason for your answer
5 of all the tests and experiments previously described in this book
which gives the best indication of success in high school
6 if the class in psychology is a large one a graph should be prepared
showing the distribution of abilities in the class for this purpose
you will have to use the absolute measures instead of ranks find the
average for each test used make these averages all the same by
multiplying the low ones and dividing the high ones then all the grades
of each student can be added this will give each test the same weight
in the average the use of a slide rule will make this transference to a
new average very easy a more accurate method for this computation is
described in the authors examination of school children p 65
the students should make a study of individual differences and the
distribution of ability in some grade below the high school the tests
described in this chapter can be used for that purpose
7 is it a good thing for high school students to find out how they
compare with others in their various mental functions if you have poor
ability is it a good thing for you to find it out if the teacher and
students think best the results of all the various tests need not be
made known except to the persons concerned the data can be used in the
various computations without the students knowing whose measures they
are
8 to what extent is ability a factor in life you find people of only
ordinary ability succeeding and brilliant people failing why is this
9 none of the tests so far used measures ideals or perseverance and
persistence these are important factors in life and there is no very
adequate measure for any of them the students might plan some
experiments to test physical and mental persistence and endurance the
tapping experiment for example might be continued for an hour and the
records kept for each minute then from these records a graph could be
plotted showing the course of efficiency for the hour mental adding or
multiplying might be kept up continuously for several hours and the
results studied as above
10 we have said that ideals and persistence are important factors in
life are they inherited or acquired
11 do you find it to be the rule or the exception for a person standing
high in one mental function to stand high in the others also

chapter x
applied psychology
the general field psychology has now reached that stage in its
development where it can be of use to humanity it can be of use in
those fields which demand a knowledge of human nature as indicated in
the first chapter these fields are education medicine law business
and industry we may add another which has been called culture we
cannot say that psychology is able yet to be of very great service
except to education law and medicine it has been of less service to
the field of business and industry but in the future its contribution
here will be as great as in the other fields while the service of
psychology in the various fields is not yet great what it will
eventually be able to do is very clear it is the purpose of this
chapter to indicate briefly the nature and possibilities of this
psychological service
education throughout the preceding chapters we have emphasized the
educational importance of the facts discussed there is little left to
say here except to summarize the main facts since education is a matter
of making a child over into what he ought to be the science of
education demands a knowledge of the original nature of children this
means that one must know the nature of instincts their relations to one
another their order of development and the possibilities of their
being changed modified developed suppressed it means that one must
know the nature of the childs mind in all its various functions the
development and significance of these functionsmemory association
imagination and attention the science especially demands that we
understand the principles of habitformation the laws of economical
learning and the laws of memory
this psychological knowledge must form the groundwork in the education
of teachers for their profession in addition to this general
preparation of the teacher psychology will render the schools a great
service through the psychoclinicist who will be a psychological expert
working under the superintendents of our school systems his duty will
be to supervise the work of mental testing the work of diagnosis for
feeblemindedness and selection of the subnormal children the teaching
of such children he will give advice in all cases which demand expert
psychological knowledge
medicine in the first place there is a department of medicine which
deals with nervous diseases such as insanity double personality
severe nervous shock hallucination etc this entire aspect of medicine
is wholly psychological but psychology can be of service to the general
practitioner both in the diagnosis and treatment of disease a thorough
psychological knowledge of human nature will assist a physician in
diagnosis often the best way to find out what ails a patients body is
through the patients mind and the doctor must know how to get the
truth from the patients mind even in those cases in which the patient
is actually trying to conceal the truth a profound practical knowledge
of human nature is necessarya knowledge which can be obtained only
by long and careful technical study as well as practice and experience
psychology can be of service in the treatment of disease the physician
must understand the peculiar mental characteristics of his patient in
order to know how to deal with him in some cases hypnotism is a
valuable aid in treatment and in many cases ordinary normal suggestion
can be of considerable service the state of mind of a sick person has
much to do with his recovery the physician must know this and must know
how to induce the desired state of mind indeed a patients trouble is
often imaginary exists in the mind only in such cases the treatment
should be wholly mental ie through suggestion of course the best
physicians know these facts and make use of them in their practice but
preparation for this aspect of their work should be a regular part of
their medical education they should not be left to learn these facts
from their practice as best they may any more than they should be
expected to learn their physiology and anatomy in this way
law the service of psychology to law can be very great but owing to
the necessary conservatism of the courts it will be a long time before
they will make much use of psychological knowledge perhaps the greatest
service will be in determining the credibility of evidence psychology
can now give the general principles in this matter witnesses go on the
stand and swear to all sorts of things as to what they heard and saw and
did often months and even years previously the expert clinical
psychologist can tell the court the probability of such evidence being
true experiments have shown that there is a large percentage of error
in such evidence the additional value that comes from the oath has been
measured the oath increases the liability of truth only a small
percentage
experiments have also shown that ones feeling of certainty is no
guarantee of truth sometimes the point we feel surest about is the one
farthest from the truth in fact feeling sure of a thing is no
guarantee of truth
in a particular case in court the psychologist can determine the
reliability of the evidence of a particular witness and enable the judge
and the jury to put the proper value on such witnesss testimony for
example a witness may swear to a certain point involving the estimation
of time and distance the psychologist can measure the witnesss
accuracy in such estimates often showing that what the witness claims
to be able to do is an impossibility a case may hinge on whether an
interval of time was ten minutes or twelve minutes or whether a
distance was three hundred or four hundred feet a witness may swear
positively to one or both of these points the psychologist can show the
court the limitations of the witness in making such estimates
psychology can be of service in the examination of the criminal himself
through association tests and in other ways the guilt or innocence of
the prisoner can often be determined and his intellectual status can
also be determined the prisoner may be insane or feebleminded or
have some other peculiar mental disorder such matters fall within the
realm of psychology after a prisoner has been found guilty the court
should have the advice of the clinical psychologist in deciding what
should be done with him
it should be added that the court and not the attorneys should make use
of the psychologist whenever a psychologist can be of service in a case
in court the judge should summon such assistance just as he should if
expert chemical physical physiological or anatomical knowledge should
be desired
a knowledge of human nature can be of much service to society in the
prevention of crime this will come about from a better knowledge of the
psychological principles of habitformation and moral training through
a better knowledge of how to control human nature a large percentage of
all crime perhaps as much as forty per cent is committed by
feebleminded people now if we can detect these people early and give
them the simple manual education which they are capable of receiving we
can keep them out of a life of crime
studies of criminals in reform schools show that the history of many
cases is as follows the person being of low mentality could not get
on well at school and therefore came to dislike school and consequently
became a truant truancy led to crime crime sent the person to the
court and the court sent the person to the state reformatory
the great duty of the state is the prevention of crime usually little
can be done in the way of saving a mature criminal we must save the
children before they become criminals save them by proper treatment
society owes it to every child to do the right thing for him the right
thing whether the child is an idiot or a genius merely from the
standpoint of economy it would be an immense saving to the state if it
would prevent crime by the proper treatment of every child
business the contribution of psychology in this field so far is in
the psychology of advertising and salesmanship both having to do
chiefly with the selling of goods students of the psychology of
advertising have by experiment determined many principles that govern
people when reading newspapers and magazines principles having to do
with size and kind of type arrangement and form the wording of an
advertisement etc the object of an advertisement is to get the reader
interested in the article advertised the first thing is to get him to
read the advertisement here various principles of attention are
involved the next thing is to have the matter of the advertisement of
such a nature that it creates interest and remains in memory so that
when the reader buys an article of that type he buys the particular kind
mentioned in the advertisement
in salesmanship many subtle psychological principles are involved the
problem of the salesman is to get the attention of the customer and
then to make him want to buy his goods to do this with the greatest
success demands a profound knowledge of human nature other things being
equal that man can most influence people who has the widest knowledge
of the nature of people and of the factors that affect this nature the
successful salesman must understand human feelings and emotions
especially sympathy also the laws of attention and memory and the
power of suggestion a mastery of the important principles requires
years of study and a successful application of them requires just as
many years of practice
the last paragraph leads us to a consideration of the general problem of
influencing men in all occupations and professions one needs to know
how to influence other men we have already discussed the matter of
influencing people to buy goods people who employ labor need to know
how to get laborers to do more and better work how to make them loyal
and happy the minister needs to know how to induce the members of his
congregation to do right the statesman needs to know how to win his
hearers and convince them of the justice and wisdom of his cause
whatever our calling there is scarcely a day when we could not do
better if we knew more fully how to influence people
industry the service of psychology here is fourfold 1 finding what
men are fitted for 2 finding what kinds of abilities are demanded by
the various trades and occupations 3 helping the worker to understand
the psychological aspects of his work 4 getting the best work out of
the laborer
finding what men are fitted for in the preceding chapter we
discussed the individual variations of men some people are better
fitted physically and mentally for certain types of work than they are
for other types of work the determination of what an individual is
fitted for and what he is not fitted for is the business of psychology
in some cases the verdict of psychology can be very specific in
others it can be only general much misery and unhappiness come to
people from trying to do what they are not fitted by nature to do there
are many professions and occupations which people should not enter
unless they possess high general ability now psychology is able to
measure general ability there are many other occupations and
professions which people should not enter unless they possess some
special ability music art and mechanics may be mentioned as examples
of occupations and professions demanding specific kinds of ability in
industrial work many aspects demand very special abilities as quick
reaction quick perception fine discrimination calmness and
selfcontrol ingenuity quick adaptation to new situations psychology
can aid in picking out the people who possess the required abilities
the different abilities demanded it is the business of psychology to
make a careful analysis of the specific abilities required in all the
various works of life there are hundreds of occupations and often much
differentiation of work within an occupation it is for the psychologist
of the future to make this analysis and to classify the occupations with
reference to the kinds of abilities demanded of course many of them
will be found to require the same kind of ability but just as surely
many will be found to require very special abilities it is a great
social waste to have people trying to fill such positions unless they
possess the specific abilities required
it should be the work of the high school and college to explain the
possibilities and the demands in the way of ability of the various
occupations of the locality by possibilities and demands are meant the
kinds of abilities required and the rewards that can be expected the
kind of life which the different fields offer it is the further duty of
the high school and college to find out as far as possible the
specific abilities of the students with this knowledge before them the
students should choose their careers and then make specific preparation
for them the schools ought to work in close coperation with the
industries the student working for a part of the day in school and a
part in the industries this would help much in leading the student to
understand the industries and in ascertaining his own abilities and
interests
the psychological aspects of ones work all occupations have a
psychological aspect they involve some trick of attention of
association of memory certain things must be looked for certain
habits must be formed certain movements must be automatized workmen
should be helped to master these psychological problems to find the
most convenient ways of doing their work workmen often do their work in
the most uneconomical ways having learned their methods through
imitation and never inquiring whether there is a more economical way
securing efficiency securing efficiency is a matter of influencing
men a matter which we have already discussed securing efficiency is
quite a different matter from that treated in the preceding paragraph a
workman may have a complete knowledge of his work and be skilled in its
performance and still be a poor workman because he does not have the
right attitude toward his employer or toward his work the employer must
therefore meet the problem of making his men like their work and be
loyal to their employer the laborer must be happy and contented if he
is to do good work moreover there is no use in working or in living
either if one cannot be happy and contented
we have briefly indicated the possibilities of psychology in the various
occupations and professions there is a further application that has no
reference to the practical needs of life but to enjoyment a
psychological knowledge of human nature adds a new interest to all our
social experience the ability to understand the actions and feelings
of men puts new meaning into the world the ability to understand
oneself to analyze ones actions motives feelings and thoughts
makes life more worth living a knowledge of the sensations and sense
organs adds much pleasure to life in addition to its having great
practical value briefly a psychological knowledge of human nature adds
much to the richness of life it gives one the analytical attitude
experiences that to others are wholes to the psychologist fall apart
into their elements such knowledge leads us to analyze and see clearly
what otherwise we do not understand and see only darkly or not at all
literature and art and all other creations and products of man take on
a wholly new interest to the psychologist
  summary psychology is of service to education in ascertaining the
  nature of the child and the laws of learning to law in determining
  the reliability of evidence and in the prevention of crime to
  medicine in the work of diagnosis and treatment to business in
  advertising and salesmanship to the industries in finding the man
  for the place and the place for the man to everybody in giving a
  keener insight into and understanding of human nature
class exercises
1 visit a court room when a trial is in progress note wherein
psychology could be of service to the jury to the judge and to the
attorneys
2 to test the reliability of evidence proceed as follows take a large
picture preferably one in color and having many details hold it before
the class in a good light where all can see it let them look at it for
ten or fifteen seconds the time depending on the complexity of the
picture the students should then write down what they saw in the
picture underscoring all the points to which they would be willing to
make oath then the students should answer a list of questions prepared
by the teacher on various points in the picture some of these
questions should be suggestive such as what color is the dog
supposing no dog to be in the picture the papers giving the first
written description should be graded on the number of items reported and
on their accuracy the answers to the questions should be graded on
their accuracy how do girls compare with boys in the various aspects of
the report what is the accuracy of the underlined points
3 let the teacher with the help of two or three students perform
before the class some act or series of acts with some conversation and
then have the students who have witnessed the performance write an
account of it as in no 2
4 divide the class into two groups select one person from each to look
at a picture as in no 1 these two people are then to write a complete
account of the picture this account is then read to another person in
the same group who then writes from memory his account and reads to
another this is to be continued till all have heard an account and
written their own you will then have two series of accounts of the same
picture proceeding from two sources it will be well for the two who
look at the picture to be of very different types let us say one
imaginative the other matteroffact
do all the papers of one series have some characteristics that enable
you to determine from which group they come what conclusions and
inferences do you draw from the experiment
5 does the feeling of certainty make a thing true see how many cases
you can find in a week of persons feeling sure a statement is true
when it is really false
6 in the following way try to find out something which a person is
trying to conceal prepare a list of words inserting now and then words
which have some reference to the vital point read the words one by one
to the person and have him speak the first word suggested by those read
note the time taken for the responses a longer reaction time usually
follows the incriminating words and the subject is thrown into a
visible confusion
7 talk to successful physicians and find out what use they make of
suggestion and other psychological principles
8 spend several hours visiting different grades below the high school
in how many ways could the teachers improve their work by following
psychological principles
9 could the qualities of a good teachernative and acquiredbe
measured by tests and experiments
10 visit factories where men do skillful work and try to learn by
observation what types of mind and body are required by the different
kinds of work
11 does the occupation which you have chosen for life demand any
specific abilities if so do you possess them in a high degree
12 could parents better train their children if they made use of
psychological principles
13 in how many ways will the facts learned in this course be of
economic use to you in your life in what ways will they make life more
pleasurable
